I live in a physical body like other men, on theborders of Tibet, and at times (from the exoteric standpoint) preside over alarge group of Tibetan lamas, when my other duties permit. It is this fact thathas caused it to be reported that I am an abbot of this particular lamasery.Those associated with me in the work of the Hierarchy (and all true disciplesare associated in this work) know me by still another name and office. A.A.B.knows who I am and recognises me by two of my names.I am a brother of yours, who has travelled a little longer upon the Path thanhas the average student, and has therefore incurred greater responsibilities. Iam one who has wrestled and fought his way into a greater measure of light thanhas the aspirant who will read this article, and I must therefore act as atransmitter of the light, no matter what the cost. I am not an old man, as agecounts among the teachers, yet I am not young or inexperienced. My work is toteach and spread the knowledge of the Ageless Wisdom wherever I can find aresponse, and I have been doing this for many years. I seek also to help theMaster M. and the Master K.H. whenever opportunity offers, for I have been longconnected with Them and with Their work. In all the above, I have told you much;yet at the same time I have told you nothing which would lead you to offer methat blind obedience and the foolish devotion which the emotional aspirantoffers to the Guru and Master Whom he is as yet unable to contact. Nor will hemake that desired contact until he has transmuted emotional devotion intounselfish service to humanity—not to the Master.The books that I have written are sent out with no claim for their acceptance.They may, or may not, be correct, true and useful. It is for you to ascertaintheir truth by right practice and by the exercise of the intuition. Neither Inor A.A.B. is the least interested in having them acclaimed as inspiredwritings, or in having anyone speak of them (with bated breath) as being thework of one of the Masters. If they present truth in such a way that it followssequentially upon that already offered in the world teachings, if theinformation given raises the aspiration and the will-to-serve from the plane ofthe emotions to that of the mind (the plane whereon the Masters can be found)then they will have served their purpose. If the teaching conveyed calls forth aresponse from the illumined mind of the worker in the world, and brings aflashing forth of his intuition, then let that teaching be accepted. But nototherwise. If the statements meet with eventual corroboration, or are deemedtrue under the test of the Law of Correspondences, then that is well and good.But should this not be so, let not the student accept what is said.August 1934"},{"pageContent":"THE GREAT INVOCATIONFrom the point of Light within the Mind of GodLet light stream forth into the minds of men.Let Light descend on Earth.From the point of Love within the Heart of GodLet love stream forth into the hearts of men.May Christ return to Earth.From the centre where the Will of God is knownLet purpose guide the little wills of men—The purpose which the Masters know and serve.From the centre which we call the race of menLet the Plan of Love and Light work out.And may it seal the door where evil dwells.Let Light and Love and Power restore the Plan on Earth.“The above Invocation or Prayer does not belong to any person or group but toall Humanity.

BAILEY"},{"pageContent":"PUBLISHER’S STATEMENT[x] In Discipleship in the New Age, Volumes I and II , certain personalinstructions given by the Tibetan to a group of disciples were made public.These instructions together with certain esoteric teaching were first publishedby Alice A. Bailey, with the consent of the disciples involved, in 1944.Unpublished manuscripts containing additional instructions and esotericteachings as completed by Mrs. Bailey are now available. This text was writtenfrom time to time over a period of nine years from 1935 to 1944.In various places in the text of Glamour: A World Problem references are made tothe same discipleship group.In the present volume certain forms of group work in meditation are includedbecause of their informative value and because they illustrate the practicalvalue of the teaching given. The reader, however, should recognise thatmeditations suitable for special group purposes are not in general as effectivewhen used as an individual exercise.The potency of an integrated group composed of disciples who have a commonvision and an established group purpose is very great, and can be a real serviceto mankind. The newer Aquarian techniques include such group endeavours. Thepublished writings by the Tibetan and Alice A. Bailey provide information forwise and useful experimentation in group work which is undertaken as a spiritualworld service and not as a means of spiritual unfoldment of the individualaspirant.Such group action, voluntarily entered into, when not dominated by autocraticleadership control, and if undertaken with due humility and caution, is greatlyto be desired at the present time. Such action should be recognized as beingpioneering experimental ventures.[xi] Groups of this sort have already appeared in various parts of the world andmay well contribute to the success of the work of the New Group of WorldServers. Information about this worldwide group of servers is given in ATreatise on White Magic and in A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol. II .FOSTER BAILEY, July 1950"},{"pageContent":"CERTAIN PRELIMINARY CLARIFICATIONS[1] All groups involved in esoteric work have their own dharma or duty and allhave their peculiar objective. In order that you may clearly vision what you, asaspirants to discipleship have to do, and so intelligently cooperate, I willconcisely state the purpose:Dharma means duty, or obligation, and it is your definite and specificobligation to develop the intuition. The means or methods whereby thisdevelopment is to be brought about, can be by the study of symbols.I would ask you to note that generalities concerning the intuition, and attemptsto define it are very common, but that a real appreciation of it is rare.We are told by physicians and scientists that thousands of cells in the humanbrain are still dormant and, consequently, that the average human being usesonly a small part of his equipment. The area of the brain which is found aroundthe pineal gland is that connected with the intuition, and it is these cellswhich must be roused into activity before there can be any real intuitiveperception which, when aroused, will manifest soul control, spiritualillumination, true psychological understanding of one’s fellowmen, and adevelopment of the true esoteric sense, which is the objective before you atthis time.I would like to divide what I have to say into three parts, and I plead for aclose study of my words:I. I seek to define for you the intuition.II. I shall deal with its mode of development through the study of symbology.[2]III. I shall close by giving some specific instructions as to a useful mode ofprocedure.Should you, therefore, find these articles hard to understand and your reactionslow, you must bear in mind that this indicates your need for this study andcorroborates what I am telling you. If you will seriously consider with me whatthe intuition is not , I think my words will find in you an inner response.I. DEFINITION OF THE INTUITIONThe intuition is not a welling forth of love to people and, therefore, anunderstanding of them. Much that is called the intuition is recognition ofsimilarities and the possession of a clear analytical mind. Intelligent peoplewho have lived in the world for some time and who have experienced much and whohave contacted many other people can usually sum up with facility the problemsand dispositions of others, provided they are interested. This they must not,however, confound with the intuition.The intuition has no relation to psychism, either higher or lower; the seeing ofa vision, the hearing of the Voice of the Silence, a pleased reaction toteaching of any kind does not infer the functioning of the intuition. It is notonly the seeing of symbols, for that is a special sort of perception and thecapacity to tune in on the Universal Mind upon that layer of Its activity whichproduces the pattern-forms on which all etheric bodies are based. It is notintelligent psychology, and a loving desire to help. That emanates from theinterplay of a personality, governed by a strong soul orientation, and thegroup-conscious soul.Intuition is the synthetic understanding which is the prerogative of the souland it only becomes possible when the soul, on its own level, is reaching in twodirections : towards [3] the Monad, and towards the integrated and, perhaps(even if only temporarily) coordinated and at-oned personality. It is the firstindication of a deeply subjective unification which will find its consummationat the third initiation.Intuition is a comprehensive grip of the principle of universality, and when itis functioning there is, momentarily at least, a complete loss of the sense ofseparateness. At its highest point, it is known as that Universal Love which hasno relation to sentiment or to the affectional reaction but is, predominantly,in the nature of an identification with all beings. Then is true compassionknown; then does criticism become impossible; then, only, is the divine germseen as latent in all forms.Intuition is light itself, and when it is functioning, the world is seen aslight and the light bodies of all forms become gradually apparent. This bringswith it the ability to contact the light centre in all forms, and thus again anessential relationship is established and the sense of superiority andseparateness recedes into the background.Intuition, therefore, brings with its appearance three qualities:Illumination . By illumination I do not mean the light in the head. That isincidental and phenomenal, and many truly intuitive people are entirely unawareof this light. The light to which I refer is that which irradiates the Way. Itis “the light of the intellect,” which really means that which illumines themind and which can reflect itself in that mental apparatus which is held “steadyin the light.” This is the “Light of the World,” a Reality which is eternallyexistent, but which can be discovered only when the individual interior light isrecognised as such. This is the “Light of the Ages,” which shineth ever moreuntil the Day be with us. The intuition is therefore the recognition in [4]oneself, not theoretically but as a fact in one’s experience, of one’s completeidentification with the Universal Mind, of one’s constituting a part of thegreat World Life, and of one’s participation in the eternal persistingExistence.Understanding. This must be appreciated in its literal sense as that which“stands under” the totality of forms. It connotes the power of recession or thecapacity to withdraw from one’s agelong identification with form life. I wouldlike to point out that this withdrawal is comparatively easy for those who havemuch of the first ray quality in them. The problem is to withdraw in theesoteric sense, but to avoid at the same time the sense of separateness, ofisolation and of superiority. It is easy for first ray people to resist thetendency to identify themselves with others. To have true understanding involvesan increased ability to love all beings and yet, at the same time, to preservepersonality detachment. This detachment can be so easily founded on an inabilityto love, in a selfish concern for one’s own comfort—physical, mental orspiritual, and above all, emotional. First ray people dread emotion and despiseit, but sometimes they have to swing into an emotional condition before they canuse emotional sensitivity in the right manner.Understanding involves contact with life as an integrated personality, plusegoic reaction to the group purposes and plans. It connotes personality-soulunification, wide experience, and a rapid activity of the indwelling Christprinciple. Intuitional understanding is always spontaneous. Where the reasoningto an understanding enters, it is not the activity of the intuition.Love. As earlier said, this is not affectionate sentiment, or the possession ofa loving disposition; these two later aspects are incidental and sequential.When the intuition is developed, both affection and the possession of a spirit[5] of loving outgo will, necessarily, in their pure form, be demonstrated, butthat which produces these is something much more deep and comprehensive. It isthat synthetic, inclusive grasp of the life and needs of all beings (I havechosen these two words with intent!) which it is the high prerogative of adivine Son of God to operate. It negates all that builds barriers, makescriticism, and produces separation. It sees no distinction, even when itappreciates need , and it produces in one who loves as a soul immediateidentification with that which is loved.These three words sum up the three qualities or aspects of the intuition and canbe covered by the word, universality, or the sense of universal Oneness.Is that not something which all aspirants aim to achieve? And is it notsomething that each of you, as individuals, needs in a peculiar sense? Where itis present, there is an immediate decentralisation of the dramatic “I,” of thatcapacity always to relate all happenings, all phenomena, all group work tooneself as the centre.I cannot enlarge further upon the subject of Intuition. It is too vast a matter,and too abstruse. All I can do is to put before you its three aspects and thento urge upon you the need to submit to that training and to apply to yourselvesthat discipline which will work out in your life as love, light andunderstanding. When the theory is grasped and the right adjustments are made andwhen the needed work is done, the personality then becomes magnetic, whilst thebrain cells around the pineal gland, which have hitherto been dormant, becomeawakened and vibrant. The nucleus of every cell in the body is a point of light,and when the light of the intuition is sensed, it is this cell-light which willimmediately respond. The continuance of the inflow of the light of the intuitionwill draw forth, [6] esoterically speaking, into the light of day every cellwhich is so constituted that it will respond.II. THE MODE OF AWAKENING THE INTUITIONThere are many ways in which the intuition can be drawn into activity, and oneof the most useful and potent is the study and interpretation of symbols.Symbols are the outer and visible forms of the inner spiritual realities, andwhen facility in discovering the reality behind any specific form has beengained, that very fact will indicate the awakening of the intuition.First ray people belong to what is called the “Destroyer Ray” and the power ofthe first aspect, which is the power to bring to an end, flows through them.They will have a tendency to destroy, as they build, through a wrong directionof energy, through over-emphasis of energy in some particular direction, orthrough misuse of energy in work with themselves or others. Many first raypeople have the tendency to pride themselves on this and hide behind a pleathat, being upon the first ray, a destructive tendency is unavoidable. Such isnot the case. Builders, such as second ray people always are, have to learn todestroy, when prompted by group love and acting under the Will or first rayaspect. Destroyers have to learn to build, acting ever under the impulse ofgroup love and utilising the power of attachment in a detached manner. Bothgroups, builders and destroyers, must ever work from the standpoint of reality,from the inner nucleus of truth and must “take their stand at the centre.”The study of symbols tends to bring this about and when carried out withfaithfulness and diligence, will produce three effects:1. It trains in the power to penetrate behind the form and to arrive at thesubjective reality. [7]2. It tends to bring about a close integration between soul-mind-brain, and whenthat is brought about, the inflow of the intuition and, consequently, ofillumination and truth becomes more rapidly possible.3. It will put a strain upon certain unawakened areas in the brain and arouseinto activity the brain cells there found, and this is the first stage in theexperience of the aspirant. With the majority of true aspirants, the centrebetween the eyebrows is awakened, whilst the centre at the top of the head isvibrating very gently, but is not in full functioning activity. This highercentre must be awakened more fully before aspirants can measure up to their fullopportunity.In the study of symbols, I would urge upon you the necessity always to putbefore yourselves the goal of arriving at the underlying concept of any symbolstudied. This concept will ever be synthetic. It will not be detailed and insections. You may have to arrive at this concept through a study of detail andthrough arriving at the significance of various sections or parts of the symbolunder consideration. When, however, your analysis is completed, you must notrest satisfied until you have summed up the meaning of the symbol in somesynthetic idea, concept, meaning or name.Symbols have to be studied in three ways:a. Exoterically. This involves study of its form as a whole, of its lines, andtherefore of its numerical significance, and also study of its sectionalforms—by which I mean its arrangements, for instance, of cubes, triangles and ofstars and their mutual inter-relation.b. Conceptually. This involves arriving at its underlying idea, which may beexpressed in its name; at its [8] meaning as that emerges in the consciousnessthrough meditation; and at its significance as a whole or in part. You should,when doing this, bear in mind that the idea connotes the higher or abstractintent; that the meaning is that intent expressed in terms of the concrete mind;and that its significance has in it more of an emotional quality and might beexpressed as the type of desire it arouses in you.c. Esoterically . This would cover the effect of the force or energy upon youand of the quality of the vibration it may arouse in you perhaps in some centre,perhaps in your astral body, or perhaps only in your mind.This study, rightly undertaken, would lead to the unfoldment of the intuition,with its consequent manifestation on the physical plane as illumination,understanding and love.In the first instance, the objective of the study of symbolism is to enable thestudent to sense its quality and to contact that vibrant something which liesbehind that aggregate of line, colour and form of which the symbol is composed.To some types of people this study is relatively easy; to the majority it is noteasy at all, thereby indicating a lack that must be supplied by the use of thosefaculties at the present dormant. It is always distasteful to arouse the latentfaculties and requires an effort and a determination not to be swayed bypersonality reactions. To many it is not easily apparent how the penetrationinto the meaning of a symbol can provide a means whereby the dormant buddhic orintuitional faculty can be brought into functioning activity. It is a delicateart, this art of symbol reading, of “spiritual reading,” as our ancient master,Patanjali, [9] calls it. This power to interpret symbols ever precedes truerevelation. The comprehension of a truth for which a line or a series of linescomposing a symbolic form may stand is not all that has to be done. A goodmemory may remind you that a series of lines forming a triangle or a series oftriangles signifies the Trinity, or any series of triplicates within themacrocosmic or microcosmic manifestation. But that activity and accuracy of thememory will do naught to awaken the dormant brain cells or call into play theintuition. It must be remembered (and here becomes evident the value of acertain amount of technical or academic occultism) that the plane whereon theintuition manifests and where the intuitional state of consciousness is activeis that of the buddhic or intuitional plane. This plane is the highercorrespondence of the astral or emotional plane, the plane of sensitiveawareness through a felt identification with the object of attention orattraction. It becomes evident therefore that if the intuitional faculty is tobe brought into activity through the study of symbols, the student must feelwith, or be in some way identified with, the qualitative nature of the symbol,with the nature of that reality which the symbolic form veils. It is this aspectof symbolic reading that you are asked to study.Students should ascertain, therefore, after due study of the form aspect, whatthe symbol is doing to them, what feeling it evokes, what aspirations itarouses, and what dreams, illusions, and reactions are consciously registered.This stage is an intermediate one between the exoteric reading of a symbol andthe conceptual understanding. There is later another intermediate stage betweenconceptual understanding and esoteric comprehension and application. This latterstage is called “synthetic recognition.” Having studied the form and becomeaware of its emotional significance, you pass to the stage of grasping the basicidea [10] of the symbol, and from thence to a synthetic comprehension of itspurpose. This leads to true esotericism which is the practical application ofits living synthetic power to the springs of individual life and action.I would ask you to render not only an intelligent interpretation of the symbol,but also a recognition of the more subtle reaction of your sensitive feelingnature to the symbol as a whole. Study a total of four symbols a year. First,approach the symbol from its form aspect and seek to familiarise yourself withits outer aspect, with the sum total of lines, triangles, squares, circles,crosses and other forms of which it is composed, and as you do this endeavour tocomprehend it from the standpoint of the intellect, using your memory and whatknowledge you have, to understand it exoterically.Then as soon as the symbol is truly familiar to you and can be recalled to mindwith little effort, endeavour to sense its quality, to contact its vibration andto note its emotional effect upon you. This may vary from day to day or it mayalways be the same. Be simply honest in your noting this astral reaction to thesymbol and see where such reactions lead you, remembering always that they arenot intuitional but are reactions to the feeling or astral body.Finally, take note of what you have found to be, for you, the basic quality ofthe symbol and then (as in meditation work) lift the whole subject into themental realm by bringing the focussed attentive mind to bear upon it. This willlead you into the realm of concepts.We have consequently the following stages in the analysis of a symbol:1. Its exoteric consideration: line, form and colour.2. A comprehension in the astral or emotional body of [11] its quality, thereaction of a sensitive response to the impact of its qualitative nature.3. A conceptual consideration of its underlying idea, of what it is intended toteach, of the intellectual meaning it is intended to convey.4. The stage of the synthetic grasp of the purpose of a symbol, of its place inan ordered manifesting plan, of its true unified intent.5. Identification with the quality and purpose of the symbol as it isilluminated by the mind “held steady in the light.” This final stage brings intoactivity the brain as well as the mind.The study of symbols viewed as a whole, involves three stages:First, the investigation of a symbol, and the consequent progress of the analystfrom one progressive stage of awareness to another, to a gradual inclusion ofthe entire field covered by the symbol.Secondly, an intuitive perception of the symbols to be seen everywhere in thedivine manifestation.Third, the use of symbols on the physical plane, and their right adaptation to aseen and recognised purpose, leading to the subsequent magnetisation of thesymbol with the needed quality through which the idea can make its presencefelt, in order that the intuited qualified idea may find proper form on thephysical plane.Deal, therefore, with the symbols in a wide generalisation, exoteric, conceptualand esoteric, but add to that an analysis of your sensitivity and response tothe quality of the symbol.Let me recapitulate for a moment. First of all it is valuable to remember thatthe study of the symbol exoterically [12] involves the use of the brain and thememory. You endeavour to study line and form, number and general externalaspects, knowing that each line has significance, all numbers have theirinterpretation and all forms are symbols of an inner quality and life.The study of symbols conceptually carries you inward from the brain to the mind,into the realm of ideas. It sweeps into focussed activity the mental apparatus.You then become aware of the concept or idea which the sign or symbol embodies.You comprehend its meaning and for what it stands. You grasp the purpose forwhich the form has been brought into manifestation. Your study of number and ofline has given you a rich background of knowledge upon the objective plane—arichness in this case dependent upon your own personal reading, mental equipmentand knowledge. Your capacity to read a “meaning” into a symbol will be dependentalso upon the richness of the meaning you ascribe to the events of your dailylife, and your ability to really meditate.I would like to make clear to you that there is no set interpretation of anysymbol, and that for each human being that symbol—whatever it may be—will conveyunique meaning. A lack of interest in symbols presupposes usually a lack ofinterest in the due interpretation of life forms and their meaning. Also, toomuch academic interest in symbols may presuppose a tortuous and intricate mindwhich loves design and line and form and numerical relationships, but whichmisses entirely the significance of meaning. The balancing in the mind of formand concept, of expression and quality, of sign and meaning is vital to thegrowth of the disciple and the aspirant.The great need for most students is to arrive at meaning and to work with ideasand concepts. This activity will necessitate the use of the mind to understand,to grasp [13] and to interpret. It requires the development of that mentalsensitivity which will enable its possessor to respond to the vibrations of whatwe call the Universal Mind, the Mind of God, the Instigator of the Plan. Itpresupposes a certain ability to interpret and the power to express the ideaunderlying the symbol so that others may share it with you. This thought ofservice and of growth in usefulness must be steadily borne in mind .Can you not see how this power to study, to interpret and to penetrate tomeaning will further your growth spiritually? Can you believe that through theuse of this method you may learn to work more intelligently with the Plan andbecome a better helper of your fellowman?What is there in this objective world that is not the inadequate symbol of adivine idea? What have we in our outer manifestation but the visible sign (atsome stage of the evolving purpose) of the plan of the creating Deity? What areyou yourself but the outer expression of a divine idea? We must learn to seesymbols all around us and then to penetrate behind the symbol to the idea whichit should express.There is however a technique of study which may be of service to you as youattempt to arrive at an idea and thus study conceptually the many symbols bywhich we are surrounded. It is largely the technique for which meditation shouldhave prepared you. The difference between this technique and meditation work ismainly one of polarisation and goal. In the study of symbols conceptually, theconsciousness is polarised in the mental body, and no attempt is definitely madeto contact or involve the soul or ego. Herein lies the distinction between thissecond stage of symbol interpretation and ordinary meditation. You haveexhausted the method of familiarising yourself with the form aspect of thesymbol, and you know well its outer [14] contour and externalisation. You knowtoo that a peculiar series of lines (such as, for instance, the three linesforming a triangle) represent such and such an idea or truth or teaching. Thisis recorded in your brain, drawing on the resources of your memory. Theregistering of old information and knowledge anent the figures in a symbolserves to pull your consciousness up on to the mental plane and to focus itthere in the world of ideas or of concepts. The concepts exist already upon theconcrete levels of the mental plane. They are your mental and racial heritageand are ancient mental forms which you can now employ in order to arrive atmeaning and significance.It is an ancient statement of fact, which Plutarch expresses for us in thefamiliar words, that “An idea is a Being incorporeal, which has no subsistenceof itself, but gives figure and form unto shapeless matter and becomes the causeof the manifestation.” The figure and form you have registered with your brainand memorised, and likewise its activity in time and space, along with itsinnate capacity to build the form and express through that form a concept oridea. As you work inwards, you are also becoming aware of the nature of themotivating idea through the study of its form and its demonstrated activity, andyou are discovering the field of ideas of analogous nature in which the ideaembodied in the symbol finds itself. This field of ideas, inter-related andmutually explanatory, is now open to you and you will increasingly find yourselfin a position to move in this world of concepts with freedom. To work and livein the world of ideas now becomes your objective and main effort. You trainyourself in the recognition of ideas and concepts as they lie behind every form;you begin to think clearly about them and to see the direction in which theylead you and where, within the Eternal Plan, they fit.[15] If aspirants will do three things:a. Develop the power to visualise,b. Train the mind to intuit reality,c. Rightly interpret that which is seen,they can provide a demonstrating laboratory for the trained Observers of theworld.One of the things which the developed intuition can do is to break the glamourand illusion which invade the life. One of the things that a group of aspirants,whose intuitional interplay is established, can accomplish, is to aid in thework of smashing world glamour. Such work can be done when you have awakened theintuition, and when your inter-related understanding is firm and true. TheHierarchy will be able to use the world aspirants as an instrument for thebreaking of group glamour wherever it may be found. I refer to this possibilityin order to incite you all to more rapid and steady growth and effort.You have been told that one of the needs lying before all aspirants is to arriveat that intuitional knowledge and that intelligent understanding of glamour,both individual and planetary, which will enable them most definitely to work atits dispelling. That understanding will necessarily be only relative, but in thecourse of the next few years, your knowledge of the subject and of the methodswhereby glamour can be dissipated can be materially increased. This must happenif you work at the problem consciously in your own lives, and attempt to graspthe underlying theory also.Very little has been written or taught hitherto anent the subject of glamour,and it may mean much of value if we undertake the consideration of this subject,of its causes, and its effects, and also deal with the technique whereby it [16]can be dissipated and dispelled. It is obvious that I cannot deal with thesubject adequately in one instruction, and we will take the next two or threeyears, therefore, to discuss and study this important matter growing out of theneed of the present time and the increased sensitivity of humanity to subtlerimpressions. It has not been possible for me to do this up till now, as thegroup was incomplete and the inner cohesion needed strengthening. Now I can doso, as the group members are functioning together with a much increased innerrelationship, and a “spirit of love” has been shed abroad among you through thegroup reaction to each other’s need in the recent period of glamour.It is my intention, therefore, to change your work somewhat, retaining thesymbolic phrases as an exercise for your intuitional insight, but dropping theconsideration of the more formal and visual symbols. You have not gained fromthese symbolic forms what has been hoped, for the concrete mind of the majorityof the group members simply increased the form aspect, and the remainder needednot this method of instruction and development. We shall change the focus ofattention to a deep study of glamour. Herein will lie your service, for as youthink truly and use your illumined intelligence (if you can achieve this, mybrothers) you can help in time to do two things:1. Clarify the group mind on this subject. I refer not here to your particulargroup, but to the world consciousness.2. Help shatter the great illusion which has held, and still holds, the sons ofmen in thrall.I ask, therefore, for your service along these lines, and I request also thatyou give increased attention at the time of your full moon contact with myself.This group should [17] have a special aptitude for work along the line ofdispelling glamour at the period of the full moon. Contact is made on thedifferent planes according to the focus of the subtle bodies of the personnel ofthe group, and this group makes its contact with me on the higher levels of theastral plane. Hence the clarity of their reactions and the wealth of theirdetailed records. Also, herein will lie eventually their service, for they canlater (but not for some long time yet) utilise the days of contact and the“moment of entrance” (as it is sometimes called) for definite work in dispellingsome of the world illusion. First must come, however, aptitude in dispelling itin the personal life of each one of you.Another group makes its contact with me on mental levels and therein will lietheir field of service. Still other groups are only as yet in an embryonicstage. Their personnel is incomplete and the group integration only in processof being set up.I will, therefore, ask you to intensify your effort each month at the full moonperiod, and seek to strengthen your tie with myself and with your fellow groupmembers. One word of warning only will I give. Success along this line willbring both its rewards and also its difficulties. You will have to watch withcare for the undue stimulation of your astral or emotional nature, withconsequent and subsequent glamour. You will have to exercise the deepestwatchfulness in the endeavour to work thus on the astral plane, holdingsimultaneously the attitude of the Observer on the high plane of the soul. Noconstructive work and no service of vital importance can be rendered in thisdifficult sphere of activity unless there is this detached and liberatedattitude. You are to work in one of the most difficult spheres ofactivity—perhaps the most difficult to which a disciple can be called—and hencethe advisability of working there [18] in group formation. I cannot emphasisetoo strongly that you are to work as a group and not as individuals.Three great events are immanent in the world consciousness today:1. The growth and understanding of telepathic work.2. A comprehension and scientific investigation of illusion and world glamour.3. An increase in the right methods of healing.If this is so, you can see how groups of disciples can constitute a contributionto the emerging revelation and how useful our consecrated service can be. I say“our” advisedly, brother of old, as I am working definitely towards these threeends as a part of my ordained (self-ordained) service. I ask for yourcooperation and assistance. The steady impact of right thought on the humanconsciousness by trained groups of thinkers is the method that can be mostsuccessfully applied at this time, and here these groups can help profoundly.One of the things which will emerge most definitely during the next three orfour decades is the work that groups can do on levels other than the physical.Group service and united effort towards group welfare has for two centuries beenseen on Earth in all fields of human endeavour—political, philanthropic andeducational. Group service on the astral plane has been started also since 1875,but united effort to dispel the world glamour is only now in process oforganising and this group can be a part of the corporate effort towards thisend, and swell the number of those so engaged. Train yourselves, therefore, andlearn how to work. Telepathic sensitivity is necessarily the objective of allgroups of disciples, but it is the main objective of that group which we mightcall the Telepathic Communicators; [19] here they can render potent service.Groups of sensitives of this order can constitute a working, mediating body, andtransmit the new knowledge and teaching for the race; they can mould publicopinion and change the current of men’s thoughts. All small groups of people,naturally and inevitably, arrive at a telepathic relation between themselves,and between the personnel of similar groups, and this is to be desired andfostered and should rightly and steadily increase. But, as your telepathicsensitivity is increased, see to it that you are not deflected from your maingroup objective, which is to study and understand the significance of glamourand the laws for its dissipation. Record and note all telepathic activity andphenomena and learn to work this way, but regard it as a secondary issue for youat this time.One of the outstanding characteristics of the work done at the time of the fullmoon will be the mass of phenomena noted. This is to be expected as this servicecalls you to work on the astral plane. But it will provide you with a field forthe wise use of the faculty of discrimination. It is too early as yet for you towork at the problem of separating the real from the unreal; your task at firstwill be recording . Keep detailed records. Preserve the scientific attitude ofdetachment and of recognition and write down all that is sensed, seen orcontacted. These records will serve as the basis of analysis if all goes well,and from that analysis we may gather much of value.What I have to say to you as regards the subject of Glamour falls into certainbroad generalisations such as:I. The Nature of Glamour.II. The Causes of Glamour.III. The Dissipation of Glamour.[20] As we proceed we shall divide our subject up into greater detail, but inthis instruction I only seek to get certain broad outlines into your minds sothat the theme may fall into right places in your thoughts.There are four phrases which have for long been bandied about among so-calledoccultists and esotericists. They are: glamour, illusion, maya and theexpression, the dweller on the threshold . They all stand for the same generalconcept or some differentiation of that concept. Speaking generally, theinterpretations have been as follows, and they are only partial interpretations,and are almost in the nature of distortions of the real truth, owing to thelimitations of the human consciousness.Glamour has oft been regarded as a curious attempt of what are called the “blackforces” to deceive and hoodwink well-meaning aspirants. Many fine people arealmost flattered when they are “up against” some aspect of glamour, feeling thattheir demonstration of discipline has been so good that the black forces areinterested sufficiently to attempt to hinder their fine work by submerging themin clouds of glamour. Nothing could be further from the truth. That idea isitself part of the glamour of the present time, and has its roots in human prideand satisfaction.Maya is oft regarded as being of the same nature as the concept promulgated bythe Christian Scientist that there is no such thing as matter. We are asked toregard the entire world phenomena as maya and to believe that its existence issimply an error of mortal mind, and a form of auto-suggestion or self-hypnotism.Through this induced belief we force ourselves into a state of mind whichrecognises that the tangible and the objective are only figments of man’simaginative mind. This, in its turn, is likewise a travesty of reality.[21] Illusion is regarded rather the same way, only (as we define it) we lay theemphasis upon the finiteness of man’s mind. The world of phenomena is notdenied, but we regard the mind as misinterpreting it and as refusing to see itas it is in reality. We consider this misinterpretation as constituting theGreat Illusion.The Dweller on the Threshold is usually regarded as presenting the final test ofman’s courage, and as being in the nature of a gigantic thoughtform or factorwhich has to be dissipated, prior to taking initiation. Just what thisthoughtform is, few people know, but their definition includes the idea of ahuge elemental form which bars the way to the sacred portal, or the idea of afabricated form, constructed sometimes by the disciple’s Master to test hissincerity. Some regard it as the sum total of a man’s faults, his evil nature,which hinders his being recognised as fit to tread the Path of Holiness. None ofthese definitions, however, give a true idea of the reality.I would point out here that (generally speaking) these four expressions are fouraspects of a universal condition that is the result of the activity—in time andspace—of the human mind. The activity of MINDS! Ponder on this phrase for itgives you a clue to the truth.The Problem of Illusion lies in the fact that it is a soul activity, and theresult of the mind aspect of all the souls in manifestation. It is the soulwhich is submerged in the illusion and the soul that fails to see with clarityuntil such time as it has learnt to pour the light of the soul through into themind and the brain.The Problem of Glamour is found when the mental illusion is intensified bydesire. What the Theosophist calls “kama-manas” produces glamour. It is illusionon the astral plane.[22] The Problem of Maya is really the same as the above, plus the intenseactivity produced when both glamour and illusion are realised on etheric levels.It is that vital unthinking emotional MESS (yes, brother of old, that is theword I seek to use) in which the majority of human beings seem always to live.The Dweller on the Threshold is illusion-glamour-maya, as realised by thephysical brain and recognised as that which must be overcome. It is thebewildering thoughtform with which the disciple is confronted, when he seeks topierce through the accumulated glamour of the ages and find his true home in theplace of light.The above are necessarily only generalisations, and the result also of theactivity of the analytical mind, but they serve to embody a part of the problemin words and to convey to your minds a definite thoughtform of what we shalllater discuss in detail.As to the causes of this world condition, what can I say, brother of mine, whichwill convey meaning to your minds? The cause lies far back in the consciousnessof the “imperfect Gods.” Does that sentence really mean aught to you? Butlittle, I fear. We must descend into the realm of greater practicality and onlydeal with the matter as far as it concerns humanity. Planetary illusion willlater be briefly dealt with, but the immediate problem before man and thesignificant contribution of the disciple is the dissipation of much of theglamour in which mankind is immersed and which, during the coming Aquarian Age,will largely disappear in connection with the astral life of the race. The pointI would here make is to call attention to the fact that it is in meditation andin the technique of mind control that the thinkers of the world will begin torid the world of illusion. Hence the increasing interest in meditation as theweight of the world glamour is increasingly [23] realised, and hence the vitalnecessity for right understanding of the way of mind control.Another point which should be noted is that in the crystallisation of thismaterial age comes the great opportunity to strike a deadly blow on theplanetary Dweller on the Threshold. The reaction at this time, through thestress of circumstances, is bringing about a more spiritual understanding and areorganisation of human values, and this is part of the process whereby a vitalpart of the world glamour may be dissipated—if only all men of goodwill withinthe world aura adhere to their appointed task.When the Buddha was on Earth and achieved illumination, He “let in” a flood oflight upon the world problem through His enunciation of the Four Noble Truths.His body of disciples and His nine hundred arhats formulated those four greattruths into a structure of dogma and doctrine that—by the power of collectivethought—has greatly helped in the attack upon the world illusion. Today theChrist is carrying forward the same great task and in the spiritual significanceof His imminent Coming (and in the language of symbolism) He and His ninethousand arhats will strike a second blow at the world glamour. It is for thisthat we prepare. Only the intuition can dispel illusion and hence the need oftraining intuitives. Hence the service you can render to this general cause byoffering yourselves for this training. If you can overcome glamour in your ownlives and if you can, therefore, comprehend the nature of illusion you will helpina. The destruction of the dweller on the threshold,b. The devitalising of the general maya,c. The dissipation of glamour,d. The dispelling of illusion.[24] This you have to do in your own lives and in the group relation. Then yourmore general contribution will help in the wider human issues. The acuteness ofthe intellect, and the illumination of the mind, plus love and intention willaccomplish much. To this service, I reiterate my call.During the next few months I would suggest that you do three things:1. Define in your own words and as the result of meditation, your understandingof the four expressions with which I have been dealing. I ask for a realanalysis and not just four sentences of definition. Before I enlarge upon thissubject I would like you to organise your minds on the matter, using definitionsas a guide to your thought, yet stating the problem as you see it, and seekingto see the differences existing between these four aspects of the world glamour.2. Say each day, with care and thought, a very familiar prayer, The Lord’sPrayer. It has many meanings and the trite and usual Christian significance isnot for you. Ponder on this most ancient formula of truth and interpret itentirely in terms of a formula for the dissipation of illusion. Write anexegesis on it from this angle, taking it phrase by phrase and regarding it asgiving us seven keys to the secret of the elimination of glamour. The formula(which is not essentially a prayer) can be divided as follows:a. Invocation to the solar Lord.b. Seven sentences, embodying seven keys for the dissipation of illusion.c. A final affirmation of divinity.Use your intuition and apply these all to the subject of glamour and see at whatknowledge you will arrive. [25] Then write it down in the form of aninterpretation or article and we may arrive at much value.3. Keep a copy of your full moon record and, at the close of six months, subjectit to a careful analysis and see what is the sum total of gain. Divide youranalysis into the following heads and express your understanding of thephenomena:a. As to any real contact.b. As to any colour contact or phenomena.c. As to any other phenomena sensed, or seen or heard.That we may all go forward into greater light and understanding, and that thelight may shine upon the vertical Way of the disciple is my prayer andaspiration for you."},{"pageContent":"SECTION ONE: THE NATURE OF GLAMOUR[26] In the preceding pages we dealt with certain definitions of the words(frequently used interchangeably) dealing with illusion and glamour. We foundthat:1. Illusion is primarily of a mental quality and was characteristic of theattitude of mind of those people who are more intellectual than emotional. Theyhave outgrown glamour as usually understood. It is the misunderstanding of ideasand thoughtforms of which they are guilty, and of misinterpretations.2. Glamour is astral in character, and is far more potent at this time thanillusion, owing to the enormous majority of people who function astrally always.3. Maya is vital in character and is a quality of force. It is essentially theenergy of the human being as it swings into activity through the subjectiveinfluence of the mental illusion or astral glamour or of both in combination.4. The Dweller on the Threshold , always present, swings however into activityonly on the Path of Discipleship, when the aspirant becomes occultly aware ofhimself, of the conditions induced within him as a result of his interiorillusion, his astral glamour and the maya surrounding his entire life. Being nowan integrated personality (and no one is a disciple, my brother, unless he ismental as well as emotional, which is a point the [27] devotee oft forgets)these three conditions (with the preponderance of the effect in one or other ofthe bodies) are seen as a whole, and to this whole the term the “Dweller on theThreshold” is applied. It is in reality a vitalised thoughtform—embodying mentalforce, astral force and vital energy.The problem, therefore, before all of you in this group is to learn first ofall:1. To distinguish between these three inner illusory aspects.2. To discover what conditions in the environment or in the individualconstitution induce these situations of difficulty.3. To find out what methods are effective in inducing a cessation of thebewildering deceiving conditions.It must be remembered also that these distorting conditions, found in all ofyou, are the medium whereby you are tuned in on the world glamour and illusion.The emphasis has been laid in esoteric teaching on the training and liberationof the individual aspirant. This is, of course, necessary, for the mass is madeup of the individuals, and in the steady release from the control of these innerdelusions will come the eventual clarification of humanity. Therefore each ofyou in this group must of necessity work separately and apart with himself, andlearn to induce those conditions of clarity and truth which will overcome theancient rhythms and deep-seated habits and thus steadily purify the aura. Butthis has now to be done as a group , and this group constitutes one of the firstof the exoteric groups with which it is intended to work in the new age. Throughthe activity of such groups, the world glamour will be dissipated, [28] butfirst of all the aspirant must learn to deal with individual and group glamour.It is necessary to remember the following three things. I am going to be briefand technical in teaching this group, for my time is short and you have anadequate technical knowledge with which to understand that whereof I speak.First, the united auras of the group members ever determine the group condition,the group activity, usefulness, problem and glamour. Hence emerges individualgroup responsibility and individual usefulness. Each of you either hinders oraids the group, according to his auric condition, which is either in a state ofglamour or illusion or is kept relatively free from these conditions.Second, that the first job that each of you has to do is to determine his ownpeculiar problem. In giving you your individual instructions, I will take upwith you in this instruction where the particular tendency in this direction ofeach of you lies, and whether it is glamour, illusion or maya to which youhabitually succumb. I will deal with directness, for I have tested yoursincerity and believe in your willingness to be told the truth. Once you haveeach determined the specific nature of your peculiar problem, you can then workwith deliberation towards its solution—with deliberation, brother of old, andwith no speed, but with due care and caution and with right understanding.Thirdly, you must remember that as I look at the individual in any of thesegroups, I can at the same time gauge the quality of the group itself as a whole.The amount of inner light that can shine through and make its presence felt inyour auras can be seen by me and indicate to me the strength and the efficiencyand also the potency of your individual group influence, for the positive aurassubordinate the negative auras. What is required is a combination of positiveauras, deliberately subordinated to group work. [29] As you deal with illusionand as you free your minds from its effects, and as you dissipate the astralglamour in which you are all more or less immersed, you will enter into agreater freedom of living and usefulness. As the maya of distorted energycurrents ceases to swing you into lines of undesirable activity, the light thatis in you will shine forth with greater clarity. Incidentally the Dweller on theThreshold will slowly and surely disintegrate and leave your way, to the door ofInitiation, free and unimpeded.Strongly mental types are subject to illusion. This illusion is in reality acondition wherein the aspirant is being definitely controlled by:1. A thoughtform of such potency that it does two things:a. Controls the life activity or output.b. Tunes the aspirant in on the mass thoughtforms, which are of a similarnature, and which are built by others under the dominance of a similar illusion.This, in its worst aspect, produces mental insanity or idée fixe, but in itsleast dangerous and normal result produces the fanatic. The fanatic isusually—even if he realises it not—a bewildered man, who has a potent idea ofsome kind or another, but who finds it quite impossible to integrate it into theworld picture; to make those needed, and often divinely directed, compromiseswhich profoundly help humanity; to find the time or place for the realitieswhich are within his natural grasp.2. When a man is highly developed, the mental illusion is built around adefinite intuition and this intuition is concretised by the mind until itsappearance is so real that the man believes he sees so clearly that which shouldbe done or given to the world that he spends his time endeavouring [30] in afanatical manner to make others see it too. Thus his life slips away on thewings of illusion and his incarnation is a relatively profitless one. In a fewrare cases, this combination of intuition and mental activity produces thegenius in some field or another; but then there is no illusion, but clearthinking, coupled with a trained equipment in that particular field orenterprise.3. The weaker and more average mental types of people succumb to the generalfield of illusion and of mass illusion. The mental plane manifests a differentsort of distortion to that of the astral plane or the etheric. The faculty ofdiscrimination which is being developed has produced sharper lines ofdemarcation, and instead of the dense fogs and mists of the astral plane or theswirling tides and currents of energy of the etheric plane, we have on themental plane masses of sharply indicated thoughtforms of a particular qualityand note and tone, around which are grouped lesser thoughtforms, created bythose who respond to these forms, and to their note, quality and tone.Similarities are then seen to exist which constitute channels or avenues for themagnetic drawing power of the more potent thoughtforms. Ancient theologies inmodern garb, fixed presentations of half truth, the wild thinking of variousworld groups, and many similar emanating sources have—down the ages—produced theworld of illusion and those mental states which have held humanity prisoner towrong concepts and thoughts. So many are these thought producing illusions thatthe effect in the world today has been to cause a general division of the humanrace into varying schools of thought (philosophy, science, religion, sociology,etc., etc.), into many parties and groups, all of them coloured by an analogousidea, into groups of idealists fighting each other on behalf of their petconcepts, and into tens [31] of thousands of participants in group mentalactivity. These are today producing the world literature, through which theworld platforms are coloured; by their means the world leaders are inspired; andthey are responsible at this time for the mass of experiments in the field ofgovernment, of education, and of religion which are producing so much of theworld unrest, and consequently so much of the world illusion.What is needed therefore at this time, are thinkers who are training themselvesin that mental attitude and one-pointedness which is divorced from the danger ofa negative receptivity and is responsive, at the same time, to the higherintuitional inspiration. It is mediating interpreters of ideas that are neededand not mediums.The emotional types respond with facility to world glamour and to their ownindividual inherited and self-induced glamour. The bulk of the people are purelyemotional with occasional flashes of real mental understanding—very occasional,my brother, and usually entirely absent. Glamour has been likened to a mist orfog in which the aspirant wanders and which distorts all that he sees andcontacts, preventing him from ever seeing life truly or clearly or theconditions surrounding him as they essentially are. When he is a somewhatadvanced aspirant, he is aware of the glamour and occasionally sees in a flashin what direction truth for him may lie. But then again the glamour settles downupon him and he is rendered powerless to release himself or to do anythingconstructive. His problem becomes further complicated by his consequent distressand his deep disgust with himself. He walks ever in a fog and sees naught as ittruly exists. He is deceived by the appearance and forgets that which theappearance veils. The emanatory astral reactions which each human [32] beinginitiates ever surround him and through this mist and fog he looks out upon adistorted world. These reactions and the surrounding aura which they constituteblend and merge with the world glamour and fog and form part of the miasmas andunhealthy emanations for which the masses of men, for millions of years, areresponsible.I would point out to you that, in Lemurian days, glamour and illusion wererelatively unknown from the human standpoint. There were no mental reactions andbut little emotional response to environment. Men were largely instinctualanimals. Glamour began to be found in Atlantean days, and since that time hassteadily precipitated, until today when the Hierarchy looks at humanity itappears to be walking in a deep and constantly changing density of currentswhich hide and distort, and which swirl around the sons of men and prevent theirseeing the LIGHT as it is. This is all the more obvious when it is rememberedthat the other kingdoms of nature are relatively free from glamour and illusion.In our race, the Aryan, the world illusion is gathering weight and slowlyemerging into recognition in the human consciousness and this is a real pointgained, for that which is recognised can then be intelligently handled, if thewill to do so exists. Today illusion is so potent, that few people whose mindsare in any way developed but are controlled by these vast illusory thoughtforms,which have their roots and draw their life from the lower personality life anddesire nature of the masses of men. It is interesting to remember also inconnection with our Aryan race that these thoughtforms draw their vitality alsofrom the realm of ideas, but of ideas wrongly intuited and grasped and forced toserve the selfish purposes of men. Their forms have been brought into activityby the steadily growing creative power of mankind, and have been subordinated tothe wishes of men, through the [33] use of language with its power to limit anddistort. The illusion is also precipitated more potently than would otherwise bethe case by the effort of many devoted idealistic men to impose these distortedthoughtforms upon the mental bodies of the masses. This constitutes one of themajor problems with which the Hierarchy today has to concern itself; it is alsoone of the first factors which a Master has to consider in connection with anyaspirant and disciple.Glamour, as we have seen, is of more ancient standing and of earlier emergencethan is illusion. It has little in it of the mental quality and is the majorfactor controlling the majority. The objective of all training given on the Pathof Discipleship and up to the third initiation is to induce that clear thinkingwhich will render the disciple free from illusion and give to him that emotionalstability and poise which gives no room for the entrance of any of the worldglamour. This freedom becomes possible when there is in the aspirant no personalglamour, and no deliberately self-induced response to the determining factorswhich have produced glamour down the ages. With these factors we will laterdeal.Maya is the result of both glamour and illusion. It connotes, when present, anintegrated personality and therefore the capacity to tune in on mental illusionand astral glamour. Where this condition is found, the problem of the discipleis one of the greatest in the world. What constitutes the prime difficulty ofany disciple is the fact that the battleground of his life involves every aspectof his nature. The whole man is involved. Technically, the word MAYA should onlybe used in two cases:1. In reference to the united glamour-illusion to which a man who is anintegrated personality responds. [34]2. In speaking of the limitations of the planetary Logos of our planet.In the above remarks I have given you much food for thought—not only as regardsyour own personal problems (for all of you are subject to these conditions), butI have also indicated to you what is the nature of glamour. The word is used inall esoteric books and teaching to cover the conditions which are differentiatedunder the words maya, illusion and glamour itself. Later I will give you someteaching upon the causes of glamour and the methods of its dissipation. But Ihave given you here enough for the present, for it is my desire that you ponderupon these ideas during the next few months and learn somewhat of thesignificance of these words which you so lightly use. Watch yourselves and yourdaily life with discrimination, so that you learn to distinguish betweenglamour, illusion and maya. See whether you can discover the form which yourindividual Dweller upon the Threshold is likely to assume as you come intoconflict with it; and if you do the same for your group brothers and theimmediate world need, you will lose no time in the work of your astralclarification and mental release.I would ask you to study these instructions with peculiar care, for I am takingthe time and trouble these busy days to meet your need and to bring as muchlight as I can, without infringing your free will, to meet your need and clearyour course to service.I would suggest also that you find out all that you can anent the muchmisunderstood subject of the aura : search out what is said in my books and inthe writings extant in any good occult library. I seek no copying out ofparagraphs but a formulation of your knowledge so that you [35] can answerclearly questions which might be asked. The following three questions are basic:1. What is the aura and how does it come into existence?2. How can the aura be made the medium of light, and the light which shouldshine through it be intensified?3. Have you noticed what is the effect which your own individual aura is makingupon your environment and how can you improve that effect?This will enable you to make practical application of that which I seek to teachyou. Forget not that as you look out upon the world and your immediateenvironment, that you look out through your aura and have, therefore, to dealwith glamour and illusion.There are three further questions which you might put to yourself, facing theissue in the light of your soul:1. Do I suffer primarily from glamour or from illusion?2. Do I know which quality or characteristic in my nature facilitates my tuningin on the world glamour or the world illusion?3. Have I reached the point where I can recognise my peculiar Dweller on theThreshold, and can I state what form it takes?That you may indeed as individuals and also as a group learn the meaning of trueself-knowledge and so learn to stand in spiritual being, increasingly free fromglamour and illusion, is the prayer of your friend and brother who has foughthis way through to a greater measure of light...[36] During the past six months, four members of this group of students havebeen fighting glamour in their own individual lives, and for the most partsuccessfully. I make reference to this because in an experimental group such asthis, it is well to anticipate such a situation; such wrestling will naturallyoccur, because only that which is experimentally known becomes a true content ofthe equipment of the disciple. Earlier I referred to the fact that part of theplan of the Hierarchy embraces the starting of small groups such as this onewhich would have the definite objective of providing the active means wherebythe world glamour—today so potent and deep—can be dissipated.The time has not yet come for dealing with the world illusion on a large scale,for the race is not adequately mental nor has the illusion (which is, as I havestated, pre-eminently the result of the misinterpretation of ideas) reached itsheight. But the hour has struck for the first steps to be taken in thedissipation of glamour, and the hold of glamour upon the race should beappreciably lessened in the future. Hence the practical training now being givenin this group in their own lives; hence also the intended teaching later to begiven to the group—if they measure up to the opportunity—which will enable themto aid in the concerted and planned attack upon the world glamour. Wrestletherefore with your personal problems along these lines, my brothers, for inthis way you will gain facility in discernment, in clear precise action, and instrengthened understanding.In the process of dissipating glamour, the way of the greatest potency is torealise the necessity to act purely as a channel for the energy of the soul. Ifthe disciple can make right alignment and consequent contact with his soul, theresults show as increased light . This light pours down and irradiates not onlythe mind, but the brain consciousness [37] as well. He sees the situation moreclearly: he realises the facts of the case as against his “vain imaginings”; andso the “light shines upon his way.” He is not yet able to see truly in thelarger sweeps of consciousness; the group glamour and, of course, the worldglamour remain to him as yet a binding and bewildering mystery, but his ownimmediate way begins to clear, and he stands relatively free from the fog of hisancient and distorting emotional miasmas. Alignment, contact with his soul, andthen steadfastness, are the keynotes to success.It will therefore be apparent to you that small groups such as this, ifestablished in different countries and cities and if successful in theirpersonal activities, could play a most useful part. Such groups would have twoaspects to their endeavour. They would have to wrestle with group glamour whichcreeps inevitably into group life through the instrumentality of the groupmembers. Their united personal glamours provide the open door through whichgroup glamour can enter. An instance of this can be seen in this group, whenglamour entered in through the medium of L.T.S-K., and swept I.B.S. into itsvortex of force. It was overcome, fortunately, leaving you all the richer andmore united on account of the strong stand in love taken by the other groupmembers. May I remind L.T.S-K. and I.B.S. of their deep indebtedness to the loveof their brothers. The group love protected them. I.B.S. has gone a long way infreeing herself from certain aspects of glamour. L.T.S-K. is also freer than hewas, but still has much to do. It is always difficult for the third ray personto cultivate the intuition. The apparently profound wisdom of the manipulativeand devious science of the intelligence inherent in matter prevents oft theentrance of the true wisdom of the illumined mind. Six months ago I felt that itwas probably impossible for L.T.S-K. to free himself [38] from the glamour inwhich he habitually walked. Today a little more light shines upon his way and hemay, if he frees himself still further from his self-generated thoughtforms,make the needed grade.When group glamour has been somewhat dissipated and the group can walk in the“lighted Way” with freedom, then will come the time when the group can betrained in group alignment, group contact and group steadfastness. It can thenbegin the definite and scientific task of attacking the world glamour. It is ofinterest in this particular group to be reminded that this is part of theactivity now being undertaken by certain people in the New Group of WorldServers. Through the emphasis in the world of certain basic ideas such asgoodwill and mutual inter-dependence, much is being done to dissipate theglamour in which the people of the world are walking. It is not the function ofevery server to form part of the massed attack upon the world glamour which isnow getting under way. Everyone has to deal with glamour in his own personallife, but functions and activities differ. Yours is the work of the trainedobservers, and that training takes much time. At present, many of you do notrecognise glamour when it meets you, and envelops you. It is only by its effectsthat you eventually know it for what it is. The time must come when yourprocesses of observation are so keen that you will recognise it in its truenature before it immerses and engulfs you and produces those conditions whichenable you to say later: “Why did I allow myself to be glamoured? Why was I sodeluded?”At this point I desire to do two things: I seek to outline a little morecarefully this discussion or short treatise on glamour, so that our ideas may beclearly formulated and you will have a textbook for future reference which [39]will serve to guide your group and analogous groups in the way of rightactivity. Secondly, I wish to recapitulate somewhat those things which I havealready stated so as to enrich your understanding of the various phases of theworld glamour. This world glamour, the analytical mind has to differentiate intodistinctive phases, calling them Illusion, Glamour, Maya and that syntheticthoughtform, found on the Path of Discipleship, which is called by some schoolsof esotericism the Dweller on the Threshold.As you will see from this, my brothers, we have set ourselves a large theme,which must be very carefully handled. My task is a difficult one, because Iwrite for those who are still held by the varying aspects of glamour, andusually by the secondary glamour and maya. Illusion does not yet fully play itspart and the Dweller is seldom adequately realised. I would here remind you of astupendous occult fact and will ask you to endeavour to understand that whereofI speak. The Dweller on the Threshold does not emerge out of the fog of illusionand of glamour until the disciple is nearing the Gates of Life. Only when he cancatch dim glimpses of the Portal of Initiation and an occasional flash of lightfrom the Angel of the Presence Who stands waiting beside that door, can he cometo grips with the principle of duality , which is embodied for him in theDweller and the Angel. Do you comprehend that whereof I speak? As yet, my wordsembody for you symbolically a future condition and event. The day will surelycome, however, when you will stand in full awareness between these symbols ofthe pairs of opposites, with the Angel on the right and the Dweller on the left.May strength then be given to you to drive straight forward between these twoopponents, who have for long ages waged warfare in the field of your life, andso may you [40] enter into that Presence where the two are seen as one, andnaught is known but life and deity.In summarising some of the information I have given to you concerning the fouraspects of glamour, I would offer the following tabulation for your carefulconsideration.Note:1. A dawning sense of maya arose in Lemurian days, but there was no real glamourand illusion.2. Glamour arose in early Atlantean times.3. Illusion arose among advanced human beings in later Atlantean days and willbe a controlling factor in our Aryan race.4. The Dweller on the Threshold arrives at full potency at the end of this race,the Aryan, and in the lives of all initiates prior to taking the thirdinitiation.5. The subhuman kingdoms in nature are free from glamour and illusion, but areimmersed in the world maya.6. The Buddha and His 900 arhats struck the first blow at the world glamour whenHe promulgated His Four Noble Truths. The Christ struck the second blow with Histeaching of the nature of individual responsibility and of brotherhood. The nextblow will be struck by the New Group of World Servers, acting under thedirection of Christ and His disciples, symbolically described as “Christ and His9000 initiates.”7. The Four Keynotes to the solution of the problem of glamour are:Intuition . . . Illumination . . . Inspiration . . . The Angel of the Presence.[41] THE ASPECTS OF GLAMOURName Plane Opposite Objective Battleground Technique Illusion Mental IntuitionSpritual Perception Dispelling Path of Initiation World of Ideas Contemplationby soul Glamour Astral Illumination Lucidity Vision Dissipation Path ofDiscipleship Meditation Holding mind steady in the light Maya EthericInspiration Devitalisation Path of Probation Purification Occultism. Forcemanipulation Dweller on the Threshold Physical Brain Consciousness Angel of thePresence Discrimination Integrated personality At-one-ment End of duality[42] I would call your attention to the fact that the whole problem concernsitself with the use or misuse of force or energy, and that much will clear up inyour minds if you will realise three things:1. That average man, in everyday life, and the aspirant upon the Path ofProbation or Purification, works with the forces of life on the three planes ofhuman endeavour, plus the principle of life itself.2. That the disciple begins to discriminate between the forces and energy. Uponthe Path of Discipleship he begins to work with soul-energy. This eventuallydominates the forces.3. That the initiate works, upon the Path of Initiation, with energy and learnsto distinguish between the energy of life, the energies of the soul, and theforces of the phenomenal world.Another point also should be emphasised here and that is that the nature ofthese forces and energies, and their use and control have always to be realisedand worked out in full consciousness upon the physical plane. Theory must becomefact, and the battles which take place on the subtler levels of the astral andmental planes must be realised in the brain consciousness. It is there that theapplication is made. As these realisations and inner activities become practicalparts of the disciple’s life and their consequences become clear to hisperception in waking consciousness, they form in time part of his qualityequipment . He is in reality integrating and synthesising experience in thethree worlds and becoming a Master through conscious mastering. He grasps thefact that all that appears and all that happens is due to the circulation andconstant mutation of force. He discovers then how these forces interplay in hisown experiences [43] and nature, and grasps then the fundamental fact that onlythose forces which he himself can use and master in his own life as anindividual can be employed by him in group activity and be used in thedispelling of the world glamour. It might be expressed in illustration thus:1. Through alignment and subsequent contact, the intuition is evoked, awakenedand used. This is the great dispelling agency, and pours down from the plane ofthe intuition (the plane of buddhi) through the soul and the brain to the heartof the disciple.2. Through alignment and subsequent contact, the energy of the soul is evoked,awakened and used. This is the great dissipating agency, and pours down fromsoul levels (the higher levels of the mental plane) through the mind to thebrain of the disciple carrying illumination to the astral plane.3. These two types of spiritual energy work differently upon the forces of thepersonality, and their purpose and activity have to be realised in the brainconsciousness of the disciple as he works upon the physical plane.4. Then and only then can the light of the intuition and the light of the soulreturn to the astral plane through the conscious effort and the dynamicintelligent will of the serving disciple.Ponder on these points for they outline your way and your service....I have organised somewhat our ideas and outlined the plan under which we wouldapproach this theme. I gave you certain basic concepts and a skeleton outline ofthe subject as a whole. (See the Table of Contents.) Today we will begin withour real discussion. As you know, it is not [44] my intention to write a longand ponderous thesis on this subject. The books which will be compiled from theinstructions offered to these groups of disciples, will not be heavy treatisesas are those on Cosmic Fire and White Magic . They will constitute a series ofrelatively short volumes, and must therefore be packed with information, and notdiscursive in style.Above everything else, my brothers, these instructions must be of a definitelypractical value and must leave the student with the realisation that heunderstands better the subtle world of thought currents and of forces in whichhe dwells; and that he knows better the means he must employ and the techniquehe must follow if he is to clear his path from darkness and confusion and followon to light and harmony. Our study must be comparative also, and the reader mustbear in mind that he will not be able to distinguish the truth or isolate thataspect of the teaching which is for him of paramount importance unless heapplies that which is helpful, and ascertains clearly whether he is the victimof illusion or of glamour. In the last analysis, he must know where he standsbefore he can take his next needed step forward. The disciple is the victim and,let us hope, the dissipator of both glamour and illusion, and hence thecomplexity of his problem and the subtlety of his difficulties. He must bear inmind also (for his strengthening and cheer) that every bit of glamour dissipatedand every illusion recognised and overcome “clears the way” for those who followafter, and makes easier the path of his fellow disciples. This is parexcellence, the Great Service, and it is to this aspect of it that I call yourattention. Hence my attempts in these instructions to clarify this issue.One of the problems which confronts the aspirant is the problem of dulyrecognising glamour when it arises, and of being aware of the glamours whichbeset his path and the [45] illusions which build a wall between him and thelight. It is much that you have recognised that glamour and illusion exist. Themajority of people are unaware of their presence. Many good people today seethis not; they deify their glamours and regard their illusions as their prizedand hard won possessions.The very recognition, in its turn however, carries with it its own problems, sounable is the average disciple to free himself from the glamour-making facultiesdeveloped in the past, and so hard does he find it to preserve a due proportionand a proper sense of values in regard to the truths of the mental plane. A hardwon truth and a principle of reality can be grasped, and then around it thedisciple can build the easily formed illusions of the mind which is justbeginning to find itself. The glamours of an emotional nature can emerge andgather about the ideal, for that is as yet unclarified and is prone to attractto itself that which—emotionally and sensitively—it believes itself to be andhave.Let us illustrate my point from two angles, both of which are entirely in therealm of discipleship, or encountered upon the Path of Probation. We will callthem the “illusion of power” and the “glamour of authority.” This form of wordswill show you that one is to be encountered upon the astral plane and the otherupon the mental.The Glamour of Authority is a mass glamour in most cases. It has its roots inmass psychology and is one of the indications that humanity is at the nurserystage as yet, wherein men are safeguarded from themselves by the imposition ofsome rule, some set of laws, some authoritative dictum, emanating from statecontrol, from the rule of an oligarchy, or from the dictatorship of someindividual. It reduces mankind, as far as one can judge, to set forms andstandardises men’s activities, regimenting their lives [46] and work. It isimposed and ordered through catering to the fear complex, rampant in humanity atthis time; and this fear is one of the most fruitful sources of glamour which wehave. We might perhaps and with reason regard it as the seed of all glamour uponour planet. Fear has been the incentive to those conditions which have broughtabout the glamour of the astral plane, though not the illusions of the mentallevels of consciousness.When the glamour of authority transfers itself into the spiritual consciousnessof man, we have such a state of affairs as the period of the Inquisition in itsworst forms, of Church authority, with the emphasis upon organisation,government and penalties, or the unquestioned rule of some teacher. In itshighest forms we have the recognition of the right of the solar Angel, of thesoul or ego, to rule. Between these two extremes, which express the infancy ofthe race and the freedom which comes when mankind achieves its majority and thefreedom of the soul, lie all the many types and kinds of intermediate reactions.In illustration of our point, and thus emphasising the glamour aspect as itaffects the disciple and the problem which he faces, what do we find? Thedisciple has freed himself somewhat from the imposed control of an orthodoxteaching and from the rule of a teacher. He stands (as far as he can tell) freefrom such control. Knowing however his essential weakness and the lure of thepersonality, he is on guard against himself, and against the ancient rules ofcontrol and learns steadily to stand on his own feet, to come to his owndecisions, to distinguish truth for himself. He learns to choose his way. But,like all persons who have not taken some of the higher initiations, he can (indue time) become enamoured of his freedom, and automatically then swing into theglamour of his ideal of freedom,—an ideal which he has created. He becomes theprisoner of freedom. He rejects all rule except [47] that which he calls the“rule of his own soul,” forgetting that his contact with his soul is stillintermittent. He demands the right to stand alone. He revels in his new foundfreedom. He forgets that, having given up the authority of a teaching and of ateacher, he has to learn to accept the authority of the soul and of the group ofsouls with which he is affiliated through his karma, his ray type, his choice,and the inevitability of the effects of the at-one-ment. Having relinquished theguidance of another person upon the Path, and having his eyes partially opened,he now seeks to tread that Path to the goal, forgetting however that he treadsthe Path in unison with others , and that there are certain “Rules of the Road”which he must master, and which he must master in unison with others. He hasexchanged the individual law for the group law, but does not yet know that grouplaw as it should be known. He marches on as best he can alone, glorying in thefreedom from authority which he has succeeded in achieving. He promises himselfthat he will brook no authority or guidance.Those of us who are considering him and looking on at him from the clearerheights of attainment see him gradually becoming obscured by wisps of fog and bya glamour which is gradually growing up around him as he becomes a “prisoner ofthe fog of freedom” and revels in what he deems the fact of his independence.When his sight has cleared, and when his mental aspect is more developed andunfolded, he will know that the Law of the Group must, and will, impose itselfupon him, and that the rule of the lower nature has only to be exchanged for therule of the soul. This is group rule and works under the law of the group. Hehas struggled out of the mass of seekers of the Road on to the Road itself. Heis, therefore, ahead of the masses but he is not alone, even if he thinks thathe is. He will discover many others who are travelling the same way with [48]him, and their numbers will steadily increase as he progresses. The rule ofinterplay, of travel, and of group recognition and work and service will imposethemselves upon him until he finds that he is a member of the New Group of WorldServers, working under the conditions which are the rules governing theiractivities. As he learns to travel with them upon the Road, their governingincentives and the techniques of their chosen service will penetrate hisconsciousness, and automatically and naturally he will begin to obey the higherrhythm and give his assent to the laws which control group life and groupconsciousness. Finally, he will find himself entering into the silent placeswhere the Masters of the Wisdom dwell, and will work in group rhythm with Them,obeying thus the laws of the spiritual realm, which are the subjective laws ofGod.Time and again, along the Road, he will revolt from control and will fall backinto the glamour of his supposed freedom. There is freedom from the control ofthe personality. There is freedom from the control of personalities. But thereis never any freedom from the Law of Service, and from the constant interplaybetween man and man, and soul and soul. To stand really free is to stand in theclear unimpeded light of the soul, which is basically and intrinsically groupconsciousness.Therefore, when one of you is beset by uncertainty and unrest, desiring anddemanding to walk free and that no authority be imposed upon you, see that youare not submitting to the glamour of a desire to be freed from your groupimpacts, and make sure that you are not seeking—as a sensitive soul—a way ofescape. I am using this phrase in the modern psychological sense. Be sure to askyourself the question: Is your comfort and your peace of mind of such definiteimportance to yourself and to others that it warrants your sacrificing the groupintegrity in order to have it? [49] Does your own interior satisfaction providean adequate excuse for delaying the planned group purpose? For delay it, itcertainly will. Whatever you decide will constitute, in its turn, anauthoritative decision with all the consequent reactions upon the group....What is this occult obedience, my brothers, about which we hear so much? Notwhat many occult groups make it out to be. It is not the control of an externalorganisation, dedicated to so-called occult work. It is not the imposedconditions of any teacher of any rank. It is not the exchange of the prison ofone set of ideas for those of another set with perhaps a larger range or import.A prison is a prison, whether it is a tiny cell or an isolated island of vastextent, from which escape is impossible.The authority to which we, the teachers on the inner side, respond is twofold innature, and to it you are just beginning (as units in a group) to respond. Towhat do you respond?1. To the slowly emerging realisation of the “light beyond,” using that phraseas a symbol. This light is different in its appeal to the individual. Yet it isONE LIGHT. But its recognition reveals new laws, new responsibilities, newduties and obligations, and new relations to others. These constitute anauthoritative control. None can escape this authority, but can disobey it intime and space and for a temporary period.2. To the authority of the Rules of the Road which are imposed upon one as onepasses from the Path of Probation on to the Path of Discipleship. Yet it is ONEROAD. Upon this “narrow, razor-edged path,” one learns to walk with disciplineand discretion and [50] with the desirelessness which one experiences in unisonwith one’s fellow disciples.What, briefly and succinctly, are these rules of the Road? Let me give you sixof the simplest rules, begging you to remember that they are not authoritativelyimposed by an arbitrary Board of Directors, such as a group teacher or teachers(of whom I might, of course, be one) but are the outcome of the conditions to befound upon the Path itself. They carry the warrant of a man’s own soul and arethe result of the experience of millions of travellers upon that Path.I will give you these six rules (even as I gave them to another aspirantDiscipleship in the New Age, Vol. I, pp. 583-584. ) in ancient and symbolicform, translating them as well as I can from the ancient records, stored in theHall of Wisdom, and available to all earnest disciples,—such as you.The Six Rules of the Path(Rules of the Road)I. The Road is trodden in the full light of day, thrown upon the Path by ThoseWho know and lead. Naught can then be hidden, and at each turn, a man must facehimself.II. Upon the Road the hidden stands revealed. Each sees and knows the villainyof each. (I can find no other word, my brother, to translate the ancient wordwhich designates the unrevealed stupidity, the vileness and crass ignorance, andthe self-interest which are distinguishing characteristics of the averageaspirant.) And yet there is, with that great revelation, no turning back, nospurning of [51] each other, and no shakiness upon the Road. The Road goesforward into day.III. Upon that Road one wanders not alone. There is no rush, no hurry. And yetthere is no time to lose. Each Pilgrim, knowing this, presses his footstepsforward, and finds himself surrounded by his fellowmen. Some move ahead; hefollows after. Some move behind; he sets the pace. He travels not alone.IV. Three things the Pilgrim must avoid. The wearing of a hood, the veil whichhides his face from others; the carrying of a water pot which only holds enoughfor his own wants; the shouldering of a staff without a crook to hold.V. Each Pilgrim on the Road must carry with him what he needs: a pot of fire, towarm his fellowmen; a lamp, to cast its rays upon his heart and show hisfellowmen the nature of his hidden life; a purse of gold, which he scatters notupon the Road but shares with others; a sealed vase, wherein he carries all hisaspiration to cast before the feet of Him Who waits to greet him at the gate—asealed vase.VI. The Pilgrim, as he walks upon the Road, must have the open ear, the givinghand, the silent tongue, the chastened heart, the golden voice, the rapid foot,and the open eye which sees the light. He knows he travels not alone.The Illusion of Power is perhaps one of the first and most serious tests whichcomes to an aspirant. It is also one of the best examples of this “greatmistake,” and I [52] therefore bring it to your attention as being one againstwhich I beg you most carefully to guard yourself. It is rare indeed for anydisciple to escape the effects of this error of illusion for it is, curiously,based upon right success and right motive. Hence the specious nature of theproblem. It might be expressed thus:An aspirant succeeds in contacting his soul or ego through right effort. Throughmeditation, good intention, and correct technique, plus the desire to serve andto love, he achieves alignment. He becomes then aware of the results of hissuccessful work. His mind is illumined. A sense of power flows through hisvehicles. He is, temporarily at least, made aware of the Plan. The need of theworld and the capacity of the soul to meet that need flood his consciousness.His dedication, consecration and right purpose enhance the directed inflow ofspiritual energy. He knows. He loves. He seeks to serve, and does all three moreor less successfully. The result of all this is that he becomes more engrossedwith the sense of power, and with the part he is to play in aiding humanity,than he is with the realisation of a due and proper sense of proportion and ofspiritual values. He over-estimates his experience and himself. Instead ofredoubling his efforts and thus establishing a closer contact with the kingdomof souls and loving all beings more deeply, he begins to call attention tohimself, to the mission he is to develop, and to the confidence that the Masterand even the planetary Logos apparently have in him. He talks about himself; hegestures and attracts notice, demanding recognition. As he does so, hisalignment is steadily impaired; his contact lessens and he joins the ranks ofthe many who have succumbed to the illusion of sensed power. This form ofillusion is becoming increasingly prevalent among disciples and those who havetaken the first two initiations. There are today many people in the world whohave taken the first [53] initiation in a previous life. At some period in thepresent life cycle, recurring and recapitulating as it does the events of anearlier development, they again reach a point in their realisation which theyearlier reached. The significance of their attainment pours in upon them, andthe sense of their responsibility and their knowledge. Again they over-estimatethemselves, regarding their missions and themselves as unique among the sons ofmen, and their esoteric and subjective demand for recognition enters in andspoils what might otherwise have been a fruitful service. Any emphasis upon thepersonality can distort most easily the pure light of the soul as it seeks topour through the lower self. Any effort to call attention to the mission or taskwhich the personality has undertaken detracts from that mission and handicapsthe man in his task; it leads to the deferring of its fulfilment until such timewhen the disciple can be naught but a channel through which love can pour, andlight can shine. This pouring through and shining forth has to be a spontaneoushappening, and contain no self-reference.These two illustrations of glamour and of illusion will show you not only thesubtlety of the problem, but also the urgent need for its recognition. There aretoday so many manifesting these two qualities of the lower nature.1. GLAMOUR ON THE MENTAL PLANE . . . ILLUSION.In this section of our discussion we shall give less time to the considerationof illusion than we shall to that of glamour, or of maya. Illusion is not metsquarely, faced and overcome until a man has:a. Shifted the focus of his consciousness on to the mental plane.b. Worked definitely at the task of intelligent service. [54]c. Made his soul alignment consciously and easily, and firmly established histechnique of contact.d. Taken the first initiation.The word illusion is frequently lightly used to signify lack of knowledge,unsettled opinions, glamour, misunderstandings, psychic bewilderment, thedominance of the lower psychic powers, and many other forms of the worldillusion. But the time has come when the word must be used with a developeddiscriminating sense, and when the disciple must know clearly and comprehend thenature of that phenomenal miasma in which humanity moves. For the purposes ofclarity and in order to distinguish more definitely and effectively between theforms of illusion in which the soul moves, and from which it must liberateitself, it will be necessary for us to separate the Great Illusion (in itsvarious aspects) into its component parts in time and space, and this Iattempted partially to do when I defined for you the words Maya, Glamour,Illusion, and the Dweller on the Threshold. I want you to keep very clearly inyour mind these distinctions, and to study with care the tabulation earliergiven you.Illusion, for our purposes, can be understood to signify the reaction of theundisciplined mind to the newly contacted world of ideas. This contact opens upfrom the moment a man has aligned himself and brought the lower nature intotouch with the higher. Ideas come to us from the plane of the intuition. Thesoul illumines the plane of the mind and the plane of the intuition so that theystand revealed to each other and their mutual relationship becomes thenapparent. The mind of the man (which is slowly becoming the centre of hisconsciousness and the major reality in his existence) becomes aware of this newand undiscovered world of ideas and he seizes upon some idea or group [55] ofideas and endeavours to make them his own. At first, with the majority of peopleand especially with the average mystical type, the appreciation of ideas isvague and nebulous, and frequently is arrived at from a second-hand angle. Theillumination, coming through the medium of the feebly established soul contact,seems to the unaccustomed neophyte to be of a supreme wonder and of vitalmoment. The ideas contacted appear to him of great marvel, and superbly unusual,and vitally needed by humanity.But the mind is still self-centred, the contact feeble and the alignmentuncertain. The ideas are therefore only dimly sensed. But the uniqueness of theexperience in the realised content of the mind of the disciple leads him deepinto the realm of illusion. The idea, or ideas, which he has contacted are, ifhe could realise, only a fragment of a far greater Whole. That which he bringsto their interpretation is inadequate. The idea which has emerged in hisconsciousness, through the partial awakening of his intuition, will be distortedin its descent to his brain consciousness in several ways. That which he bringsto the materialising of the idea and to its transformation into a practicalworking scheme is as yet wholly unsuitable. The equipment does not suffice foraccuracy. The ways in which this distortion and this stepping down of the ideatake place might be outlined for you as follows:—The passage of an idea from theplane of the intuition to the brain .I. The idea is seen by the mind, “held steady in the light of the soul.”II. It descends to the higher levels of the mental plane and there clothesitself with the substance of those levels. It remains still an abstraction, fromthe angle of the lower mind. This point should be carefully noted by thewould-be intuitive. [56]III. The soul throws its light upward and outward, and the idea, nebulous andfaint, emerges into the consciousness of the man. It stands revealed, much as anobject stands revealed when the bright beam of a powerful searchlight is thrownupon it. The mind, endeavouring to remain in constant steady conscious contactwith the soul, seeing into the higher world through the medium of the “soul’swide-opened eye,” registers the idea with increasing clarity.IV. The idea, revealed, becomes then an ideal to the attentive mind andeventually something to be desired and materialised. The thoughtform-makingfaculty of the mind then comes into play; the “mind-stuff” becomes actuated bythe energy of the idea, vitalised by the recognition of the soul, and the ideathen takes its first real step towards embodiment. An ideal is only an embodiedidea.These are the first steps towards materialisation. Embodiment becomes possible.Thus illusion is produced.V. Distortion now sets in. This is brought about by various causes. These mightbe enumerated as follows:1. The ray type of the ego colours the man’s interpretation of the idea. Itcolours the emerging thoughtform. Symbolically speaking, the pure light ischanged into coloured light. The idea is then “clothed with colour, and therebythe first veil descends.”2. The point in evolution which the man has reached has also its effect, plusthe quality of the [57] integration existing between the three aspects of thepersonality, and the alignment established between soul-mind-brain. This, beingnecessarily imperfect, produces indefiniteness of outline and consequently ofthe final form. Therefore we have:a. Imperfect integration of the personality.b. Indefiniteness of the proposed thoughtform.c. The wrong material consequently attracted for the building of thethoughtform.d. A shifting focus of attention, owing to the dimness of the seen ideal.e. The rapport of the mind, with the sensed idea, is not stable.3. The quality of the development of the mental body of the disciple producesthe next “veiling” of the idea, as it is called. The idea has become changedthrough the ray colouring of the soul, and now a still more distorting change isbrought about by the ray type of the mental body itself, which may be, andusually is, different to that of the soul ray.These are the second steps towards materialisation. The form of the embodimentis qualified. Thus illusion is produced.VI. This illusion demonstrates in seven ways usually:1. Through wrong perception of an idea . The disciple cannot distinguish betweenan idea and an ideal, between an idea and a thoughtform, or between an intuitiveand a mental concept. This is one of the ways of producing illusion found mostcommonly among aspirants. The mental atmosphere in which we all dwell is one ofillusion. It [58] is also an atmosphere or area of conscious contact whereinthoughtforms of all kinds are to be found. Some of them are placed there by theHierarchy for man’s finding; some of them are men’s thoughtforms, built aroundideas; some of them are very ancient ideals and have been discarded, but stillpersist as thoughtforms; some of them are entirely new, and therefore are notyet potent, but most attractive. All of them have been created by man at somestage or another of his individual and racial development. Many of them are theshells of long exploded concepts; still others are embryonic; some of them arestatic and stable; many are in process of descent from intuitional levels; a feware still illumined by the clear light of the soul and are ready for embodiment.A large number of other thoughtforms are in process of disintegration. Some ofthese forms or embodied ideas are of a destructive nature, owing to the type ofmatter of which they are formed. Others are constructive. All of them arecoloured by some ray energy. A large number of these forms are necessarily builtthrough the activity of the world of personality; others are in process ofconstruction through the agency of the soul, as well as through the jointactivity of both these manifestations. Right perception is therefore essentialfor each mind, functioning correctly. Aspirants must learn to distinguishbetween:a. An idea and an ideal.b. Between that which is embodied, that which is in process of being embodied,and that which is awaiting disintegration. [59]c. Between that which is constructive and that which is destructive.d. Between the old and the new forms and ideas.e. Between the ray ideas and forms as they colour the higher presentations.f. Between ideas and thoughtforms, and between those which are purposely createdby the Hierarchy and those which are created by humanity.g. Between racial thoughtforms and group ideas.I could list many more differentiations, but the above will suffice to show theneed for right perceptions, and to indicate the roots of the prevalence of theworld illusion, brought about by wrong perception.The cause is an untrained, unillumined mind.The cure is training in the technique of Raja Yoga.This results in the ability to hold the mind steady in the light, to perceivecorrectly, to achieve a right outlook, and to attain a right mental attitude. Itwas these right attitudes with which the Buddha was dealing when He outlined theNoble Eightfold Path. It involves the reaching of a right mental altitude. Yes,I said altitude, my brothers, and not attitude.2. Through wrong interpretation. The idea, a vital entity or a germ of livingpotency, is seen through the medium of a partial view, distorted through theinadequacy of the mental equipment, and frequently stepped down into futility.The [60] mechanism for right understanding is lacking, and though the man maybe giving his highest and his best, and though he may be able in some measure tohold his mind steady in the light, yet what he is offering to the idea is but apoor thing at the best. This leads to illusion through misinterpretation.The cause is an over-estimation of one’s mental powers. The sin, par excellence,of the mental type is pride, and that colours all activities in the earlystages.The cure is the development of a cautious spirit.3. Through wrong appropriation of ideas. Misappropriation of an idea is basedupon the drama-making faculty and tendency of the personality to theself-assertion of the little self. These lead a man to appropriate an idea ashis own, to credit himself with its formulation, and to give therefore undueimportance to it, because he regards it as his. He proceeds to build his lifearound his idea, and to make his aims and his objectives of major importance,expecting others to recognise his proprietorship of the idea. He forgets that noone idea belongs to anyone but, coming as ideas do, from the plane of theintuition, they are a universal gift and possession, and the property of no onemind. His life, as a personality also, becomes subordinated to his idea of anidea, and his ideal of an idea. The idea becomes the dramatic agent of hisself-imposed life purpose, driving him from one extreme to another. This leadsto illusion through misappropriation. [61]The cause is over-estimation of personality and undue impress of personalityreactions upon the sensed idea and upon all who attempt to contact the sameidea.The cure is a steady attempt to decentralise the life from the personality, andto centre it in the soul.One point I would like to make clear at this point. Ideas very seldom come intothe world consciousness and into the human mind direct from the intuitionallevels. The stage of human development today does not yet permit this. They cancome from the intuitional levels only when there is a very highly developed soulcontact, a potent mind control, a trained intelligence, a purified emotionalbody, and a good glandular equipment, as the result of the above requirements.Ponder upon this thought.Most ideas, when of a very high order, are stepped down into the consciousnessof a disciple by his Master and are imparted to him through mental telepathy,and as a result of his sensitivity to the “psychic gift waves,” as the Tibetanteaching calls them. Ideas are also sensed in the interplay between disciples.Frequently, when disciples meet together and thus stimulate each others’ mindsand centralise each others’ focussed attention, they can unitedly make a contactwith the world of ideas which would otherwise be impossible, and bring throughthe newer concepts into being. Again, certain great ideas are to be foundexisting as currents of energy upon the mental plane, and can there be contactedand forced into embodiment through the trained attention of disciples. Thesecurrents of mental energy, coloured by a basic idea, are placed there by theHierarchy. When thus contacted and discovered, the neophyte is apt to regard hisachievement in a personal way [62] and attribute the idea to his own wisdom andpower. You will note therefore the great need for right understanding of thatwhich is contacted as well as for right interpretation.4. Through wrong direction of ideas. This is due to the fact that, as yet, thedisciple does not see the picture as it is. His horizon is limited, his visionmyopic. A fraction or a fragment of some basic idea impinges upon hisconsciousness and he interprets it as belonging to a range of activities withwhich it may have absolutely no relation at all. He therefore starts to workwith the idea, distributing it in directions where it is entirely useless; hebegins to clothe it in form from an utterly wrong angle, embodying it in such away that its usefulness is negated. Thus, from the very first moment of contact,the disciple has been suffering from illusion and as long as this is persistedin, the general illusion is strengthened. This is one of the most ordinary formsof illusion, and is one of the first ways in which the mental pride of thedisciple can be broken. It is illusion through an initial misapplication,leading to a wrong use or wrong direction of the idea.Its cause is a small and non-inclusive mind.Its cure is the training of the mind to be inclusive, well-stocked and welldeveloped from the angle of modern intelligence.5. Through wrong integration of an idea. Every disciple has a life plan, andsome chosen field of service. If he has not such a field, he is not a disciple.It may be the home or the school or a [63] larger field, but it is a definiteplace wherein he expresses that which is in him. In his meditation life andthrough his contact with his fellow disciples, he touches some idea ofimportance, perhaps, to the world. Immediately he seizes upon it and seeks tointegrate it into his life purpose and life plan. It may have for him nodefinite use, and is not an idea with which he should be working. Theover-activity of his mind is probably responsible for his so seizing upon thisidea. All ideas sensed and contacted need not necessarily be ideas with whichevery disciple should work. This the disciple does not always realise. Hetherefore seizes upon the idea and attempts to integrate it into his plans, andtries to work with energies for which he is not temperamentally suited. Heimposes an energy current upon his mental body with which he cannot cope anddisaster follows. Many good disciples demonstrate this over-fertile, over-activemind, and arrive at no good constructive objectives, or life activity. Theyseize upon every idea that comes their way, and use no discrimination of anykind. This is illusion, through acquisitiveness.Its cause is selfish grasping for the little self, even if this is unrealisedand the disciple is glamoured by the idea of his own selfless interests.Its cure is a humble spirit.6. Through wrong embodiment of ideas . This refers primarily to the difficultiesencountered by those developed souls who do touch the world of the intuition,who do intuit the great spiritual ideas, [64] and whose responsibility it is toembody them in some form, automatically and spontaneously, through a trained andrhythmic activity of the soul and mind, working always in the closestcollaboration. The idea is contacted, but is wrongly clothed in mental matterand therefore wrongly started on its way to materialisation. It finds itself,for instance, integrated into a group thoughtform of a colouring, keynote andsubstance which is entirely unsuited to its right expression. This happens farmore often than you might think. It concerns the higher interpretations of theHindu aphorism: Better one’s own dharma than the dharma of another.This is illusion through wrong discrimination where substance is concerned.Its cause is lack of esoteric training in creative activity.Its cure is the application of fifth ray methods, which are the methods of themental plane.This form of error seldom applies to the average aspirant and concerns anillusion which is the testing applied to many initiates of fairly high degree.The ordinary disciple, such as you and others in this group, seldom touch a pureidea, and hence seldom need to embody it.7. Through wrong application of ideas. How often does this form of illusiondescend upon a disciple! He contacts an idea intuitively and also intelligently(note the distinction here expressed) and misapplies it. This is perhaps anaspect of the synthetic illusion or the illusion of the whole of [65] the mentalplane, as modern man contacts it. Illusion varies from age to age, according towhat the Hierarchy is attempting to do, or according to the general trend ofmen’s thoughts. The disciple can therefore be swept into a wrong activity and awrong application of ideas because the general illusion (growing out of the sixtypes of illusion to which I have referred above) is over-dominant in his mind.I could continue enlarging on the ways whereby illusion traps the unwarydisciple but this will suffice to awaken in you that constructive analysis whichleads from knowledge to wisdom. We have noted that the seven major ways ofillusion are as follows:1. The way of wrong perception.2. The way of wrong interpretation.3. The way of wrong appropriation.4. The way of wrong direction.5. The way of wrong integration.6. The way of wrong embodiment.7. The way of wrong application.These are the third steps towards expression. The form of the expression is alsoqualified. Thus the seven ways of illusion are produced.I have here outlined for you the causes and the various types of illusion towhich the disciple is prone. In its pure form, this illusion has to be met andsome day surmounted; it has to be isolated and dispelled by the initiate. It wasthe final successful effort to do this that led Jesus upon the Cross to cry outin words of apparent distress. He then finally dissipated the illusion of thepersonal, objective [66] Deity. At that moment, He entered fully into theconsciousness that He was Himself God, and naught else; that the theory of unityoutlined by Him in the Gospel of St. John, chapter XVII, was indeed and in trutha fact in His Own consciousness, established unalterably. Yet, nevertheless, inthis infinite and supreme realisation, there entered for a moment a sense ofloss and of negation, forcing from His dying Personality that tremendousutterance which has bewildered, and at the same time comforted, so many. Thissignified the surmounting of the final synthetic illusion. When that has beendispelled, illusion, as it can be understood in the human family, disappears.The man stands free. The illusion of the mental plane can no longer deceive him.His mind is a pure instrument for the reflection of light and of truth. Theglamours of the astral plane have no further hold over him, and the astral bodyitself fades out.You will remember that I hinted to you in A Treatise on White Magic that theastral body itself was an illusion. It is the definition of the illusory mindupon the mental plane of that which we call the sum total of the desires of theman in incarnation. When illusion and glamour have both been overcome, theastral body fades out in the human consciousness. There is no desire left forthe separated self. Kama-manas disappears, and man is then regarded asconsisting essentially of soul-mind-brain, within the body nature. This is agreat mystery, and its significance can only be understood when a man hascontrolled his personality and eliminated all aspects of glamour and ofillusion. This is accomplished by accomplishing. This mastery is achieved bymastering. This elimination of desire is brought about by conscious eliminating.Get therefore to work, my brothers, and clarification of the problem mustinevitably ensue.[67] That which is the opposite pole of illusion is, as you well know, theintuition. The intuition is that recognition of reality which becomes possibleas glamour and illusion disappear. An intuitive reaction to truth will takeplace when—along a particular line of approach to truth—the disciple hassucceeded in quieting the thoughtform-making propensities of the mind, so thatlight can flow directly, and without any deviation, from the higher spiritualworlds. The intuition can begin to make its presence felt when glamour no longergrips the lower man, and a man’s low or high desires, interpreted emotionally orself- centredly, can no longer come between his brain consciousness and thesoul. Fleeting moments of this high freedom come to all true aspirants at times,during their life struggle. They have then an intuitive flash of understanding.The outline of the future and the nature of truth sweeps momentarily throughtheir consciousness, and life is never again exactly the same thing. They havehad their guarantee that all struggle is warranted and will evoke its adequatereward.As pointed out in the tabulation (See page 41), that which dispels illusion andsubstitutes for it a true spiritual and infallible perception iscontemplation,—a contemplation necessarily carried on by the soul. Perhaps somegrasp of the sequence of development can be arrived at, if you realise that theentire meditation process (in its three major divisions) can be divided asfollows:1. The Aspirant Probationary Path Concentration Maya. 2. The Disciple Path ofDiscipleship Meditation Glamour. 3. The Initiate Path of InitiationContemplation Illusion.The above tabulation will suffice to show the connection between the meditationprocess as outlined and taught in the Arcane School, and the problem which allof you have to face.[68] The technique of the dispelling of illusion, as used by the initiate, isthat of contemplation. But of what use is it for me to discuss this with you, ifyou are not initiate? Would it profit you at all, or would it only satisfy yourcuriosity, if I outlined for you the peculiar processes, employed by a soul incontemplation for penetrating and (through an act of the trained will andthrough some first ray formulas) for dispelling it? Naught that I can imagine.I shall therefore conclude my remarks on this point concerning illusion from theangle of your evolutionary status. Glamour is your problem, as it is the problemof the world, at this time. Some of you, whose mental bodies are in process oforganising, may suffer somewhat from illusion, but your major problem—as a groupand as individuals—is one of glamour. Your field of living experience is on thehigher levels of the astral plane. Your task is to overcome glamour, each inyour individual lives, and, as a group, later to approach the arduous task ofaiding in the dispelling of the world glamour. This you may later be able to do,if you submit to training and, as individuals, understand and master yourpersonal glamours. Just as soon as you have begun to do this, I can begin to useyou, as a group . But before you can work as a group, and before you can assistin the dissipation of the world glamour, you have to understand better andmaster more definitely the glamours and illusions of your personality. The timehas now come for me to help you deal more drastically with this problem ofglamour, with the view to your destined group service and not with a view ofyour personal release....I ask you to set to work, therefore, with fresh courage and determination andwith fresh understanding, and to carry on for another year. Will you bend youreffort to the task? For task it is. [69]2. GLAMOUR ON THE ASTRAL PLANE . . . GLAMOURI have dealt with the problem of illusion or glamour on the mental plane. Idealt with it succinctly and briefly, pointing out that it is not primarily themajor problem of this group of aspirants but that they—along with the worldaspirant, humanity—are primarily occupied with glamour. Those aspirants whostand in the forefront of humanity and whose task it is to confront the worldglamour and forge a way through it, have the task of releasing soul energy andmind potency. Among these pioneering souls you should take your stand, realisingthe magnitude of the opportunity and the imminence of the hour of release.You stand on the verge of accepted discipleship. This means that you willshortly have to add to your battle with glamour that of the battle withillusion. Are you strong enough for this? Forget not, that a disciple who isdealing with the aspiration of his nature and who is also wrestling with theproblems that result from mental polarisation and awareness, and with theenergies which become active through soul contact, is rapidly becoming anintegrated personality. His task is not therefore easy and calls for thefocussed activity of his best self. By that phrase, I mean the soul and theaspirational personality.Already you are battling somewhat with the illusion of ideas with which I dealtin my last instruction. You are thus beginning to develop that discriminationwhich will lead to right choice of life themes. In this instruction I seek tocast some light upon the glamour which confronts the disciple as an individualand also consider the aspect of glamour with which he must deal as a worldserver in training.Speaking symbolically, I would say that the planetary astral body (viewing itfrom soul levels) is lost in the [70] depths of a surrounding fog. When at nightyou look out at some clear sky, you see the stars and suns and planets shiningwith a clear cold brilliancy and with a twinkling blazing light which penetratesfor many millions of miles (or light years as they are called) until the humaneye registers them and records the existence of these shining stars. Looking,however, at the astral body of the planet, could you but do so, you would see nosuch clear shining but simply a murky ball of seeming steam and mist and fog.This fog is of a density and thickness which would indicate not onlyimpenetrability but also those conditions which are unfavourable to life. Yet wepass and come and go, we the Teachers on the inner side; and in that fog—seeingall things misshapen and distorted—labour the sons of men. Some are sohabituated to the fog and the density that they remain oblivious of itsexistence, regarding it as right and good and the unchangeable place of theirdaily life. Others have caught faint glimpses of a clearer world wherein moreperfect forms and shapes can be seen and where the fog hides not a dimly sensedreality—though what that reality may be they know not. Still others, such asyourselves, see before you an open path leading to the clear light of day. Youknow not yet, however, that as you tread the path you must, on the Path itself,work actively and intelligently with the surrounding glamour, following a trailblazed by those who have liberated themselves from the environing mists andpassed on into a world of clear horizons. So much of the time spent by discipleson the Path is a process of almost cyclic immersion in glamour and fog,alternating with hours of clarity and vision.There are four things which you who seek to work with glamour need to grasp;four basic recognitions which, [71] when understood, will serve to clear andlighten, and therefore straighten your way:1. Each human being stands in an environing world of glamour which is the resultof:a. His own past, with its wrong thinking, selfish desires, and misinterpretationof the purposes of life. There is, or has been, no comprehension of the intendedlife purpose as visioned by the soul and there cannot be until there is somedefinite organisation of the mental body.b. His family “desire life,” both past and present. This becomes increasinglypotent as evolution proceeds and the desire life of the family unit becomescomes marked and emphasised, constituting then inherited and demonstratedpsychological tendencies and characteristics.c. National glamour, which is the sum total of the desire life, plus theillusions, of any nation. These we term national characteristics and they are sopersistent and marked that they are usually recognised as embodying nationalpsychological traits. These are, of course, based on ray tendencies, pasthistory, and world inter-relations but constitute in themselves a glamorouscondition out of which every nation must work as it marches on towards therealisation of (and identification with) reality.d. An extension of the above idea into what we call racial glamour, using theword race to mean the human race. This constitutes a very ancient glamour oralmost a series of glamours, of entrenched desires, potent aspirations of somekind and definitely human-made forms which—fluidic, enveloping and pulsatingwith dynamic life—seek to [72] hold the consciousness of humanity upon theastral plane. Such a glamorous concept is that of money and its materialisticvalue. This glamorous desire is like a dense widely distributed fog, cutting offthe vision of truth, and distorting a very large number of human values.2. This fog, this glamour which envelops humanity at this time must be realisedas a definite substantial thing, and must be dealt with as such. The disciple oraspirant who is seeking to dispel glamour, either in his own life or as aservice rendered to the world, must recognise that he is working with substance,with the breaking up of the forms which it has assumed, and with the dissipationof a material all-enveloping substance—material in the same sense asthoughtforms are substantial things but (and here is a point of importance) of aless substantial nature than the forms of glamour found upon the astral plane.We are quite willing to remember that “thoughts are things” and that they have aform life and a purpose of their own. But they have a more unique and separativeexistence, and more clearly defined and more definite outlines. The forms ofglamour on the astral plane are even more substantial but are less clearlydefined. Thoughtforms are dynamic, penetrating, clear cut and outlined. Glamoursare smothering, vague, and enveloping. In them, a person is immersed as in theocean or in a “sea of fog.” With thoughtforms, he is confronted or faced, butnot immersed. It might almost be said that the astral body of a person comesinto being as a part of the general world glamour; it is difficult for him todifferentiate between his own astral body and the glamours which affect and swayand submerge him. His problem upon the mental plane is more clearly defined,even if it is equally difficult. [73]3. Astral glamour is a form of energy and an energy of great potency, owing tothree factors:a. It is of such an ancient rhythm, being inherent in astral substance itself,that it is most difficult for a human being to become aware of it or tounderstand it; it is the result of the age-long activity of human desire.b. It is a corporate part of a man’s own energy nature, and thereforeconstitutes for him the line of least resistance; it is part of a great worldprocess and therefore a part of the individual life process also, and is, initself, not wrong but an aspect of reality. This realisation necessarilycomplicates man’s thought about it.c. It is likewise definitely Atlantean in nature, being brought to a very highpoint of development in that race. It can therefore only be finally dissipatedby the Aryan race using the right technique. The individual who is learning todissipate glamour has to do two things:1. Stand in spiritual being.2. Keep the mind steady in the light.From this it will be apparent that the energy of the astral plane as itexpresses itself in the sentient desire life of the race, produces the majorglamours of humanity, and can only be dissipated, dispersed and dispelled by thebringing in of the higher energy of the mind, motivated by the soul.4. The glamours which hold humanity in thrall are:a. The glamour of materiality.b. The glamour of sentiment.c. The glamour of devotion.d. The glamour of the pairs of opposites.e. The glamours of the Path.[74] Let me now elucidate these glamours for you a little more in detail.The glamour of materiality is the cause of all the present world distress, forwhat we call the economic problem is simply the result of this particularglamour. Down the ages, this glamour has held the race increasingly interested,until today the entire world has been swept into the rhythm of money interest. Arhythm emanating from soul levels has always existed, being established by ThoseWho have freed Themselves from the control of material requirements, from thethraldom of money and the love of possessions. Today that higher rhythm iscommensurate with the lower rhythmic glamour, and hence the whole world isthinking in terms of the way out from this present material impasse. Those soulswho stand in the light to be found upon the mountain top of liberation and thosewho are advancing upward out of the fogs of materiality are now sufficient innumbers to do some definite work in connection with the dissipation of thisglamour. The influence of their thoughts and words and lives can and will bringabout a readjustment of values, and a new standard of living for the race, basedupon clear vision, a correct sense of proportion and a realisation of the truenature of the relationship existing between soul and form, between spirit andmatter. That which will meet a need that is vital and real ever exists withinthe divine plan. That which is unnecessary to the right expression of divinityand to a full and rich life can be gained and can be possessed, but only throughthe loss of the more real and the negation of the essential.Students, however, need to remember that that which is necessary variesaccording to the stage of evolution which [75] has been reached by anindividual. For some people, for instance, the possession of that which ismaterial may be as great a spiritual experience and as potent a teacher in lifeexpression as the more elevated and less material requirements of the mystic orhermit. We are rated as regards action and point of view by our place upon theladder of evolution. We are rated really by our point of view and not by ourdemand upon life. The spiritually minded man and the man who has set his feetupon the Path of Probation and who fails to attempt the expression of that whichhe believes, will be judged as caustically and pay as high a price as does thepure materialist—the man whose desires centre around substantial effects. Bearthis in mind and sit not in the seat of the judge or the scornful.Today the glamour of materiality is lessening perceptibly. The peoples of theworld are entering the wilderness experience, and will find in the wildernesshow little is required for full living, true experience and real happiness. Thegluttonous desire for possessions is not regarded as so reputable a desire asformerly, and a desire for riches is not producing the clutching hands asearlier in racial history. Things and possessions are slipping out of the handswhich have hitherto tightly held them, and only when men stand with empty handsand a realised new standard of values do they again acquire the right to own andto possess. When desire is absent and the man seeks nothing for the separatedself, the responsibility of material wealth can again be handed back to man, buthis point of view will then be free from that particular glamour, and the fogsof astral desire will be lessened. Illusion in many forms may still hold swaybut the glamour of materiality will be gone. It is the first destined todisappear. Students would do well to remember that all forms of possessions andall material objects, whether it is money, or a house, a picture or anautomobile, [76] have an intrinsic life of their own, an emanation of their own,and an activity which is essentially that of their own inherent atomicstructures (for an atom is a unit of active energy). This produces counterpartsin the world of etheric and astral life, though not in the mental world. Thesesubtler forms and distinctive emanations swell the potency of the world desire;they contribute to the world glamour and form part of a great and powerfulmiasmic world, which is on the involutionary arc but in which humanity, upon theupward arc, is nevertheless immersed. Therefore the Guides of the Race have feltthe necessity of standing by whilst the forces set up by man himself proceed tostrip him and thus release him to walk in the wilderness. There, in what iscalled straightened circumstances, he can readjust his life and change his wayof living, thus discovering that freedom from material things carries with itits own beauty and reward, its own joy and glory. Thus he is liberated to livethe life of the mind.The glamour of sentiment holds the good people of the world in thrall, and in adense fog of emotional reactions. The race has reached a point wherein the menof good intention, of some real understanding and owning a measure of freedomfrom the love of gold (symbolic way of speaking of the glamour of materiality)are turning their desire to their duty, their responsibilities, their effectsupon others, and to their sentimental understanding of the nature of love. Love,for many people, for the majority indeed, is not really love but a mixture ofthe desire to love and the desire to be loved, plus a willingness to do anythingto show and evoke this sentiment, and consequently to be more comfortable inone’s own interior life. The selfishness of the people who are desirous of beingunselfish is great. So many contributing sentiments gather around the sentimentor desire to show those amiable and pleasant characteristics which will evoke acorresponding reciprocation towards the would-be lover [77] or server who isstill completely surrounded by the glamour of sentiment.It is this pseudo-love, based primarily on a theory of love and service, whichcharacterises so many human relationships such as those existing, for instance,between husband and wife, parents and their children. Glamoured by theirsentiment for them and knowing little of the love of the soul which is freeitself and leaves others free also, they wander in a dense fog, often draggingwith them the ones they desire to serve in order to draw forth a responsiveaffection. Study the word “affection,” my brother, and see its true meaning.Affection is not love. It is that desire which we express through an exertion ofthe astral body and this activity affects our contacts; it is not thespontaneous desirelessness of the soul which asks nothing for the separatedself. This glamour of sentiment imprisons and bewilders all the nice people inthe world, imposing upon them obligations which do not exist, and producing aglamour which must eventually be dissipated by the pouring in of true andselfless love.I am but touching with brevity upon these glamours for each of you can elaboratethem for yourselves, and in so doing will discover where you stand in the worldof fog and glamour. Thus, with knowledge, you can begin to free yourselves fromthe glamour of the world.The glamour of devotion causes many probationary disciples to wandercircuitously around in the world of desire. This is primarily a glamour whichaffects sixth ray persons and is particularly potent at this time owing to theage-long activity of the sixth Ray of Devotion during the rapidly passingPiscean Age. It is today one of the potent glamours of the really devotedaspirant. They are devoted to a cause, to a teacher, to a creed, to a person, toa duty, or to a responsibility. Ponder on this. This harmless desire along someline of idealism which confronts them becomes definitely [78] harmful both tothemselves and to others, because through this glamour of devotion they swinginto the rhythm of the world glamour which is essentially the fog of desire.Potent desire along any line, when it obliterates the wider vision and shuts aman within a tiny circle of his own desire to satisfy his sentiment of devotion,is just as hampering as any of the other glamours, and is even more dangerousbecause of the beautiful colouring which the resultant fog takes on. A man getslost in a rapturous mist of his own making, which emanates from his astral bodyand which is composed of the sentimentalising of his own nature about his owndesire and devotion to the object of his attracted attention.With all true aspirants, owing to the increased potency of their vibrations,this devotional sentiment can be particularly difficult and bring about alengthy imprisonment. One illustration of this is the sentiment of devotionpoured out in a glamorous ecstasy by probationary disciples upon the Masters ofthe Wisdom. Around the names of the Members of the Hierarchy and around Theirwork, and the work of the initiates and the disciplined disciples (mark thatphrase) a rich glamour is created which prevents Them ever reaching the discipleor his reaching Them. It is not possible to penetrate the dense glamour ofdevotion, vibrating with dynamic ecstatic life, which emanates from theconcentrated energy of the disciple, working still through the solar plexuscentre.For this glamour there are some age-old rules: Contact the greater Self throughthe medium of the higher Self and thus lose sight of the little self, itsreactions, its desires, and intentions. Or: The pure love of the soul which isnot personalised in any way and which seeks no recognition can then pour intothe world of glamour which surrounds the [79] devotee, and the mists of hisdevotion (upon which he prides himself) will melt away.Upon the Probationary Path there comes the swing, consciously registered,between the pairs of opposites until the middle way is sighted and emerges. Thisactivity produces the glamour of the pairs of opposites , which is of a denseand foggy nature, sometimes coloured with joy and bliss and sometimes colouredwith gloom and depression as the disciple swings back and forth between thedualities. This condition persists just as long as the emphasis is laid uponfeeling —which feeling will run the gamut between a potent joyfulness as the manseeks to identify himself with the object of his devotion or aspiration, orfails to do so and therefore succumbs to the blackest despair and sense offailure. All this is, however, astral in nature and sensuous in quality and isnot of the soul at all. Aspirants remain for many years and sometimes for manylives imprisoned by this glamour. Release from the world of feeling and thepolarising of the disciple in the world of the illumined mind will dissipatethis glamour which is part of the great heresy of separateness. The moment a mandifferentiates his life into triplicities (as he inevitably must as he dealswith the pairs of opposites and identifies himself with one of them) he succumbsto the glamour of separation. Perhaps this point of view may aid or perhaps itwill remain a mystery, for the secret of world glamour lies hid in the thoughtthat this triple differentiation veils the secret of creation. God Himselfproduced the pairs of opposites—spirit and matter—and also produced the middleway which is that of the consciousness aspect or the soul aspect. Ponder deeplyon this thought.The triplicity of the pairs of opposites and of the narrow way of balancebetween them, the noble middle path, is the reflection on the astral plane ofthe activity of spirit, soul [80] and body; of life, consciousness and form, thethree aspects of divinity—all of them equally divine.As the aspirant learns to free himself from the glamours upon which we havetouched, he discovers another world of fog and mist through which the Path seemsto run and through which he must penetrate and thus free himself from theglamours of the Path . What are these glamours, my brothers? Study the threetemptations of Jesus, if you would know clearly what they are. Study the effectthat the affirmation schools which emphasise divinity (materially employed) haveupon the thought of the world; study the failures of disciples through pride,the world saviour complex, the service complex, and all the various distortionsof reality which a man encounters upon the Path, which hinder his progress andwhich spoils the service to others which he should be rendering. Emphasise inyour own minds the spontaneity of the life of the soul and spoil it not with theglamour of high aspiration selfishly interpreted, self-centredness,self-immolation, self-aggressiveness, self-assertiveness in spiritual work—suchare some of the glamours of the Path.Next, we will consider glamour on the etheric plane and the theme of the Dwellerupon the Threshold, and thus complete the brief outline of our problem which thefirst part of this teaching was intended to convey.Before taking up this subject in some detail, I would like to add something toour previous consideration of the problem of glamour. In your last instruction,I elaborated somewhat upon the subject of the various types of glamour and leftwith you the concept of their great importance in your individual lives. Thebattlefield (for the man who is nearing accepted discipleship or who is upon thepath of discipleship, in the academic sense) is primarily that of [81] glamour.That is the major problem and its solution is imminent and urgent for alldisciples and senior aspirants. It will be apparent, therefore, to you why theemphasis has been put, during the Aryan age, upon the necessity for the study ofRaja Yoga, and the cultivation of submission to its discipline. Only throughRaja Yoga can a man stand steady in the light, and only through illumination andthe achievement of clear vision can the fogs and miasmas of glamour be finallydissipated. Only as the disciple learns to hold his mind “steady in the light,”and as the rays of pure light stream forth from the soul, can the glamour bediscovered, discerned, recognised for what it essentially is and thus be made todisappear, as the mists of earth dissolve in the rays of the rising sun.Therefore I would counsel you to pay more adequate attention to your meditation,cultivating ever the ability to reflect and to assume the attitude ofreflection—held steady throughout the day.You would find it of real value to ponder deeply upon the purposes for which theintuition must be cultivated and the illumined mind developed, asking yourselvesif those purposes are identical in objective and synchronous in time. You wouldthen discover that their objectives differ, and the effects of their pronouncedunfoldment upon the personality life are likewise different. Glamour is notdispelled through the means of the intuition nor is illusion overcome by the useof the illumined mind.The intuition is a higher power than is the mind, and is a faculty latent in theSpiritual Triad; it is the power of pure reason, an expression of the buddhicprinciple, and lies beyond the world of the ego and of form. Only when a man isan initiate can the exercise of the true intuition become normally possible. Bythat I mean that the intuition will then be as easily operative as is the mindprinciple in the case of an actively intelligent person. The intuition, however,will [82] make its presence felt much earlier in extremity or on urgent demand.It is illumination that the majority of aspirants, such as are found in thisgroup, must seek; and they must cultivate the power to use the mind as areflector of soul light, turning it upon the levels of glamour, and thereforedissipating it. The difficulty, my brothers, is to do so when in the midst ofthe agonies and deceptions of glamour. It requires a quiet withdrawing in mindand thought and desire from the world in which the personality habitually works,and the centering of the consciousness in the world of the soul, there silentlyand patiently to await developments, knowing that the light will shine forth,and illumination eventually take place.A deep distrust of one’s reactions to life and circumstance, when such reactionsawaken and call forth criticism, separativeness or pride, is of value. Thequalities enumerated above are definitely breeders of glamour. They are occultly“the glamorous characteristics.” Ponder on this. If a man can free himself fromthese three characteristics, he is well on the way to the relinquishing and thedissipation of all glamour. I am choosing my words with care in an effort toarrest your attention.Illusion is dispelled, rejected, and thrust away through the conscious use ofthe intuition. The initiate insulates himself from the world of illusion and ofillusory forms and from the attractive urges of a personality nature andthereby—through the medium of isolation—comes into touch with the reality in allforms, hidden hitherto by the veil of illusion. This is one of the paradoxes ofthe Path. Insulation and isolation of the right kind lead to the rightrelationships and the correct contacts with the real. They produce eventualidentification with reality, through insulation of oneself against the unreal.It is this idea which lies [83] behind the teaching given in the last book inthe Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. These have often been misinterpreted and theirmeaning twisted into a plea for the wrong kind of isolation by those withseparative tendencies and for selfish ends.It is the soul itself which dispels illusion, through the use of the faculty ofthe intuition. It is the illumined mind which dissipates glamour.I would like here to point out that many well-meaning aspirants fail at thispoint, due to two errors.1. They omit to discriminate between illusion and glamour.2. They endeavour to dispel glamour through what they believe to be rightmethod,—by calling in the soul, whereas they really need to use the mindcorrectly.When one is in the midst of fogs and glamours, however, it is much easier to sitdown and hypnotise oneself into the belief that one is “calling in the soul”than it is to subject one’s astral and emotional nature to the effect of hardstraight thinking, using the mind as the instrument whereby glamour can bedispelled. Strange as it may seem, the “calling in of the soul” to deal directlywith glamour may (and frequently does) lead to an intensification of thedifficulty. The mind is the means whereby light can be brought to bear on allconditions of glamour, and students would do well to bear this thoughtconstantly in their consciousness. The process is one of linking up the mindwith the soul and then focussing oneself consciously and with precision in themind nature or in the mental body, and not in the soul nature or the egoic form.Then, through analysis, discrimination and right thought one proceeds to dealwith the problem of glamour. The trouble is that disciples often do notrecognise [84] the condition as one of glamour and it is difficult to give aclear and infallible rule whereby that recognition can come. It might be stated,however, that glamour can always be found where there exists:1. Criticism, when careful analysis would show that no criticism is reallywarranted.2. Criticism, where there is no personal responsibility involved. By that Imean, where it is not the place or the duty of the man to criticise.3. Pride in achievement or satisfaction that one is a disciple.4. Any sense of superiority or separative tendency.Many other clues to a right recognition of glamour might be given, but if all ofyou would pay close attention to the above four suggestions, you would releaseyour lives most perceptibly from the influence of glamour and be of greaterservice consequently to your fellowmen. I have endeavoured to give you here somepractical assistance in this difficult battle between the pairs of opposites,which is the major cause of glamour.3. GLAMOUR UPON ETHERIC LEVELS . . . MAYAWe come now to a consideration of the ways and means whereby maya can be endedand the disciple stand free from the influence of physical plane force . In theabove statement the whole story of maya can be found. It might be added also(perhaps not wholly correctly but nevertheless with sufficient truth to warrantthe statement) that maya, as a recognised effect, is only experienced when oneis upon the Path, beginning with the Path of Probation or Purification. One isalways in the midst of forces. But maya (as a problem) [85] only becomes so whenrecognised, and this recognition is not possible in the early stages ofevolution. Upon the Path, one begins to watch for and to discover the effects offorce; one finds oneself consciously the victim of force currents; one is sweptinto activity of some kind by uncontrolled forces, and the world of forcebecomes a consciously sensed reality to the struggling aspirant. It is for thisreason that I have stated that maya is predominantly a difficulty of the ethericbody, for in relation to maya we are dealing with the forces pouring through theseven centres of the body (in all or in some), producing reactions and effectsthat are desirable or disastrous.It is naturally necessary to realise that all manifestation on all levels is anexpression of force, but the forces to which I refer here under the term mayaare those uncontrolled energies, those undirected impulses which emanate fromthe world of prana and from the latent force of matter itself. These sweep a maninto wrong activity and surround him with a whirlpool of effects and ofconditions in which he is entirely helpless. He is the victim of mass force,hidden in the animal nature or in the world and the environing circumstances inwhich he finds himself. When to the power of maya is added the condition ofglamour and also the illusions of the advanced disciple, it will be seen hownecessary it is that there should be quiet differentiation between the threetypes of deception. It should he remembered that when we use the term“deception,” we mean deception from the angle of the soul. The aspirant has tolearn to stand free from illusion, glamour, and maya, and to do this he mustunderstand the means to freedom which are: Intuition, Illumination andInspiration.The problem of maya is complicated by the fact that upon the physical plane (asupon the astral plane, though this is as yet little realised) you have thebattle of a pair of [86] opposites. These are of a different nature in somerespects to those found upon the astral plane. On the physical plane (and bythat I mean upon the etheric levels of the physical plane whereon the deceptivepower of maya is experienced) there is the meeting of the forces of thesubjective world of the personality and the ancient energies of matter itself,brought over as latent seeds from an earlier solar system.It might perhaps become clearer to your perception if I worded the truth aboutmaya as follows:The latent impulses of the personality life, when divorced from and not undersoul control, are blended with the pranic fluids within the periphery of thepersonality sphere of influence, and then become potent directed streams offorce, seeking emergence into physical manifestation through the medium of theseven centres in the physical body. These forces or impulses, plus the pranaavailable, constitute the etheric body of the undeveloped and frequently of theaverage man. It will be apparent, therefore, how much the undeveloped man is thevictim of mass energy of a low kind, for his etheric body is responsive to, anddraws its energy from a type of general environing prana, until such time asthere is a definite direction and a higher control—either through orientedaspiration and mental discipline, or later as the result of soul conditioning,to use the psychological phrase.This etheric energy, focussed in an individual etheric body, passes through twostages prior to the period of discipleship:1. The stage wherein it assimilates the second force to which I referred—theforce, latent in the dense physical form, the energy of the atomic substance,thus producing a definite fusing and blending. This causes the animal nature toconform entirely to the inner impulses, [87] emanating from the world of prana,where the entirely undeveloped man is concerned, or from the lower astral wherethe more developed or average man is concerned.2. The moment, however, that an inner orientation towards the world of highervalues takes place, then the etheric or vital force is brought into conflictwith the lowest aspect of man, the dense physical body, and the battle of thelower pairs of opposites takes place.It is interesting to note that it is during this stage that the emphasis is laidupon physical disciplines, upon such controlling factors as total abstinence,celibacy, and vegetarianism, and upon physical hygiene and physical exercises.Through these, the control of the life of matter, the lowest expression of thethird aspect of divinity can be offset, and the man set free for the true battleof the pairs of opposites. This second battle is the true kurukshetra and isfought out in the astral nature, between the pairs of opposites which aredistinctive of our solar system, just as the physical pairs of opposites aredistinctive of the past solar system. From one interesting angle the battle ofthe opposites upon the lower spiral, in which the physical body in its twoaspects is concerned, can be seen taking place in the animal kingdom. In thisprocess, human beings act as the agents of discipline, and the domesticatedanimals, which are forced to conform to human control, are wrestling (even ifunconsciously from our point of view) with the problem of this lower pair ofopposites. Their battle is fought out through the medium of the dense physicalbody and the etheric forces, and in this way a higher aspiration is brought intoexpression. This produces in them the experience which we call“individualisation,” wherein the seed of personality is sown. On the humanbattlefield, the kurukshetra, the higher aspect of the [88] soul begins todominate, producing the process of divine-human integration which we call“initiation.” Ponder upon this.When an aspirant reaches that point in his evolution wherein the control of thephysical nature is an urgent necessity, he recapitulates in his own life thisearlier battle with the lowest pairs of opposites, and begins then to disciplinehis dense physical nature.Making a broad and sweeping generalisation, it might be said that for the humanfamily en masse this dense physical-etheric conflict was fought out in the WorldWar, which was the imposition of a tremendous test and discipline. Remember thatour tests and disciplines are self-imposed and grow out of our limitations andour opportunities. The result of this test was the passing on to the Path ofProbation of a very large number of human beings, owing to the purging andpurification to which they had been subjected. This purificatory process in somemeasure prepared them for the prolonged conflict upon the astral plane whichlies ahead of all aspirants prior to achieving initiation. It is the “Arjunaexperience.” This is an interesting point upon which to ponder and explains muchof mystery and of difficulty in the sequence of human unfoldment. The individualaspirant is apt to think only in terms of himself and of his individual testsand trials. He must learn to think of the mass occurrences and their preparatoryeffect where humanity is concerned. The World War was a climaxing point in theprocess of “devitalising” the world maya. Much force was released and exhaustedand much energy expended. Much was consequently clarified.Many people are occupied today in their individual lives with exactly the sameprocess and conflict. On a tiny scale that which was worked out in the World Waris worked out in their lives. They are busy with the problem of maya [89] andhence today we find an increasing emphasis upon the physical cultures,disciplines, and physical training, such as is imposed in the world of sport, inathletic exercises and military training. In spite of all the wrong motives andthe terrible and evil effects (speaking again with a wide generalisation), thetraining of the body and the organised physical direction of the youth of theworld today in all countries, particularly the military countries in Europe, ispreparing the way for millions to pass upon the Path of Purification. Is this ahard truth, my brothers? Humanity is under right direction, e’en if (during abrief interlude) they misunderstand the process and apply wrong motives to rightactivities.All these points we shall later take up in greater detail when we come to ourthird section and begin to study the modes of ending glamour, illusion and maya.At present I am only occupied with giving you a general picture and a slightelaboration of the tabulation to be found on page 41. Study it with care andmemorise it if possible, for in its right understanding lies for you much ofreal usefulness.I would like to point out in connection with the problem of maya that one of thefirst steps to its right handling is physical coordination; hence the emphasislaid upon this today in the training of children; hence also our use of asimilar process under the term “alignment” when dealing with the work ofmeditation and the effort to induce increased soul control. Students would dowell to bear this in mind and to ponder upon the following phrases:1. Physical co-ordination.2. Astral orientation.3. Mental direction.4. Personality alignment.These are all attempts to express the process of “right activity [90] upon thePath of Return.” This return is the objective of the human family and theculminating goal of the four kingdoms in nature. We could enlarge the concept byexpressing the truth in the following manner:Process Correspondence Obstacle 1. Physical coordination Mineral kingdom Maya.2. Astral orientation Vegetable kingdom Glamour. 3. Mental direction Animalkingdom Illusion. 4. Personality alignment Human kingdom The Dweller on theThreshold.These processes have, therefore, their equivalents in all the kingdoms and leadup to:1. The unfoldment of the divine consciousness. This starts in the mineralkingdom.2. The expression of the soul. This is typified in the vegetable kingdom withits uses and beauty.3. The manifestation of the Christ. This is the recognised goal of the animalkingdom which works towards individualisation.4. The revelation of the glory of God. This is the objective before humanity.4. GLAMOUR UPON THE HIGHER MENTAL PLANES . . . THE DWELLER ON THE THRESHOLD.We will now touch very briefly upon the problem of the Dweller on the Threshold.This Dweller is oft regarded as a disaster, as a horror to be avoided, and as afinal and culminating evil. I would remind you nevertheless that the Dweller isthe “one who stands before the Gate of God,” who dwells in the shadow of theportal of initiation, and who faces the Angel of the Presence open-eyed, as theancient scripture calls it. The Dweller can be defined as the sum total of theforces of the lower nature as expressed in [91] the personality, prior toillumination, to inspiration and to initiation. The personality, at this stage,is exceedingly potent, and the Dweller embodies all the psychic and mentalforces which down the ages have been unfolded in a man and nurtured with care;it can be looked upon as the potency of the threefold material form, prior toits consecration and dedication to the life of the soul and to the service ofthe Hierarchy, of God and humanity.The Dweller on the Threshold is all that a man is, apart from the higherspiritual self; it is the third aspect of divinity as expressed in the humanmechanism, and this third aspect must eventually be subordinated to the secondaspect, the soul.The two great contrasting Forces, the ANGEL and the DWELLER, are broughttogether—face to face—and the final conflict takes place. Again you will notethat it is a meeting and a battle between another and higher pair of opposites.The aspirant has, therefore, three pairs of opposites with which to deal as heprogresses towards light and liberation.The Pairs of Opposites1. On the Physical Plane . . . The dense and the etheric. Fought out upon thePath of Purification.2. On the Astral Plane . . . The well-known dualities. Fought upon the Path ofDiscipleship.3. On the Mental Plane . . . The Angel and the Dweller. Fought upon the Path ofInitiation.I have, I should judge, given you enough to ponder upon; I would close it,however, by pointing out to you the very practical nature of that which I havecommunicated and would urge you to find out in your own practical experience[92] the nature of the battle you have each to fight. To aid you in this, I amgoing to help you in one very definite way.It will be of service to you if I indicate to you—each of you—the rays whichgovern your threefold personality. You will then be in a position to handleyourselves with greater wisdom, to trace more easily the causes of difficultyand to study more intelligently the effect you may have upon each other and uponthose you contact in daily life. I will elaborate in detail the training whichshould be given to each of the three bodies, taking one of the vehicles at atime and explaining the problem facing each of you in relation to thatparticular vehicle, and assigning a meditation which will enable you (withgreater facility) to handle the personality from that specific angle.You will note from the above that it is, therefore, my intention to give you amuch more careful and intensive training. Will you profit by it? In the interimand in order that you can apprehend the truth of what I shall later tell you,will you study yourselves with care during the next six months and see if what Ilater suggest is not true? Use the information given in A Treatise on the SevenRays as your guide in this self-analysis; I would remind you that the raysgovern the three bodies in the following order:1. Rays governing the mental body Rays 1.4.5. 2. Rays governing the astral bodyRays 2.6. 3. Rays governing the physical body Rays 3.7.Thus you will note that all the rays play their part in the mechanism of man,making all circumstances the vehicles of opportunity and all conditions themedium of development. This statement as to the governing rays is a statement ofan infallible rule, except in the case of accepted disciples.As you read and study, you would find it of value to reflect upon and then toanswer the following questions: [93]1. What is the relation of the intuition to the problem of illusion?2. In what manner can illumination dispel glamour, and how can it be broughtabout?3. Define maya and give your understanding of inspiration as a factor indispelling it.I have purposely not elucidated this technique as I sought to draw out your ownideas. I would urge you to follow the group meditation with care. It is of deepimportance to the group in the interest of integration and real spiritualcooperation. The Full Moon work will likewise increase in importance. Later willcome facility in recognising and recording the nature of the glamour to bedissipated and aptitude in seeing the process of light distribution."},{"pageContent":"SECTION TWO: THE CAUSES OF GLAMOUR1. THE RACIAL AND INDIVIDUAL GROWTH OF GLAMOUR.[94] We shall now employ the word “glamour” to cover all the aspects of thosedeceptions, illusions, misunderstandings and misinterpretations which confrontthe aspirant at every step of his way until he achieves unity. I would have younote that word “unity,” for it holds the secret of disillusionment, as thisprocess of release from glamour has been occultly called. It will be apparent toyou (if you have studied these instructions with care) that the cause of glamouris primarily based upon the sense of duality. If such a duality did not exist,there would be no glamour, and this perception of the dual nature of allmanifestation lies at the very root of the trouble or troubles with whichhumanity is—in time and space—faced. This perception passes through variousstages and constitutes the great problem of the conscious entity. This conditionis a difficulty in the realm of consciousness itself and is not really inherentin the substance or matter. The dweller in the body perceives wrongly: heinterprets incorrectly that which is perceived; he proceeds to identify himselfwith that which is not himself; he shifts his consciousness into a realm ofphenomena which engulfs him, deludes him and imprisons him until such time as hebecomes restless and unhappy under the sense that something is wrong. Then hecomes finally to the recognition that he is not what he seems to be and that thephenomenal world of appearances is not identical with reality [95] as he hadhitherto supposed it to be. From that moment on he comes to the sense ofduality, to the recognition of “otherness” and to the perception that his senseof dualism should be ended and that a process of unification and an attempt toachieve at-one-ment should be undertaken. From that moment, the troubles of theevolving man begin to be observed by him and consciously encountered, and hefaces a long period of “extrication from glamour and the entering into thatworld wherein only unity is known.” The stages from then on might be enumeratedas follows:First: The stage wherein the material world is recognised and valued.Temporarily it is made the goal of all activity and the man, refusing torecognise the difference existing between him and the material and naturalworld, seeks to identify himself with it and to find satisfaction in purelyphysical pleasures and pursuits. This stage divides itself into two parts:a. That wherein satisfaction is sought in the almost automatic response to thephysical instincts, to sex, food and warmth. These loom large in man’sconsciousness. The animal nature in man is made the centre of the attempt toproduce some sense of unity. Because the inner and subtle man is as yet “weak inimpact” (as it is esoterically called), a physical unification temporarily takesplace which serves to deepen the glamour and to delay progress into freedom.b. The stage wherein satisfaction and sense of oneness is sought in the realm ofmaterial possessions, and in the establishing of a centre of beauty and comfortin life on the physical plane. Therein the man can be at home and oblivious of agrowing sense of dualism which, day by day, gets steadily stronger. This stageonly takes place [96] ages later when the aspirant is about to re-orient himselfto truth and to take the first steps towards the Probationary Path. It is acorrespondence towards the end of the Path of Evolution to the stage abovementioned, but the man experiencing it is a very different person to the one whonow seeks synthesis in the materialisation of beauty upon the outer plane. Thesubtle man is now becoming dominant.Secondly: The stage wherein the man first of all becomes aware of the dualitywhich can be expressed by the words “the man and the forces.” He becomes aliveto the fact that he and all humanity are the victims of forces and energies overwhich they have no control and which drive men hither and thither. He becomesaware also of forces and energies within himself over which he likewise has nocontrol and which force him to act in various ways, making him frequently thevictim of his own revolts, his own acts and selfishly directed energies. Herethe man discovers (unconsciously at first and later consciously), the initialduality—the physical body and the vital or etheric body. One is the mechanism ofcontact upon the physical plane, the other is the mechanism of contact with theinner forces, energies and worlds of being. This vital body controls andgalvanises the physical body into an almost automatic activity. I referred tothis duality in an earlier instruction. This stage is one of great difficultyfor the man, as an individual, and for humanity as a whole. Men are still soignorant of the “reality which shines under the envelope which envelops it”—asthe Old Commentary calls it—that true perception is difficult and at firstwell-nigh impossible. Blindly and ignorantly men have to cope with this firstpair of opposites. It is this that we see happening in the world at this time.The masses are awakening to the realisation that they are the victims and [97]the exponents of forces over which they have no control and of which they haveno understanding. They would like to assume control over them and are determinedso to do whenever possible. This constitutes the major problem today in theeconomic field and in the field of daily living and of government.World tension today consists in the fact that physical force and etheric energyare at grips. Forget not what I earlier told you that etheric force is closelyrelated to the Monad or the highest spiritual aspect. It is life itself on theverge of externalisation. Hence the emphasis today upon the spirit of humanity,upon the spirit of a nation, and the spirit of a group. This is all the resultof the battle going on between this pair of opposites in the field of humanaffairs and in the field of individual average human living. It is, however,this conflict—fought out to the point of synthesis and of at-one-ment—whichproduces the re-orientation of the race and of the individual to the truervalues and to the world of reality. It is this conflict—successfully waged—whichlands the man, as an individual, and the mass, as a whole, upon the Path ofPurification. When there is unification of these energies upon the physicalplane, you then have one-pointed activity and a determination to travel in aspecific direction. There follows the resolution (note this word and its usage)of the duality into a unity.This resolution works out in the early stages (where the average type ofaspirant is concerned) into a temporary astral unity and then there emerges theone-pointed devotee. He is found in all fields—of religion, of science, ofpolitics or in any other department of life. His etheric unity, producingre-orientation—with its results of a clear vision, a grasp of truth, and apicture of the immediate way to go—serves temporarily to glamour the man with asense of achievement, of surety, of power and of destiny. He goes [98] aheadblindly, furiously and ruthlessly until suddenly he is brought sharply upagainst changing conditions and recognises another and far more difficultsituation. The pairs of opposites upon the astral plane confront him, and hebecomes Arjuna upon the field of battle. All his sense of at-one-ment, ofdirection, of sure and oft-times smug satisfaction disappears and he is lost inthe fogs and glamours of the astral plane. This is the plight of manywell-meaning disciples at this time and upon it I must for a moment dwellbecause this group, when it can work as a group, has for its intended task thedissolution of some of the world glamour. Some day (and let us hope that it willtake place before long) this group and other such groups should work, as a groupand under direction of their Master, in piercing the world glamour and lettingin some light and illumination so that men may walk from henceforth more trulyon the Way in safety.I have, therefore, chosen for participation in this work several aspirants whosetendency is to succumb to glamour, though two of them are less prone to it thanare the others. Their relative freedom from it was one of the reasons why Ichose them. These two are D.L.R. and D.P.R. Let these two keep their lives freefrom any tendency to glamour if they are rightly to serve their brothers asdesired by me. I will give indication of their tendency in that direction intheir personal instructions. The other group members are quickly prone toglamour, but this is a grief to them. It can, however, be as quickly turned intoan asset. How can the world glamour be dissipated except by those who recogniseit for what it is and who have wrestled with it in their daily lives? How canthere be success in removing world glamour through illumination, unless thisillumination is brought about by those who have learned to cast the searchlightof the soul into the dark places and the glamour which surrounds [99] them, asindividuals, and then see it disappear? Be not discouraged by this “glamorousweakness” but regard your effort to understand the problem and your ability toarrive at the solution in your own lives as part of the contribution which youcan make to this most stupendous of world problems. Solve your glamour bydwelling in the light and holding the mind steady in that light, and by learningto throw this light into the fogs of glamour on the astral plane. Do not attemptto solve it, as some aspirants so frequently do, by saying, “Now I understand,”whereas all that they do (and many of you do the same) is to react to aself-evident occult platitude.Third: This stage of glamour is oft called the Arjuna Experience. Today theworld Arjuna is facing the pairs of opposites, just as does the individualdisciple, ready—when these pairs have been resolved into a unity—to tread thePath of Discipleship.It might be pointed out that:1. The masses in all lands are wrestling with the first pair of opposites, thatupon the physical plane. When “resolution” has taken place, these masses willstep on to the Path of Purification. This is rapidly taking place. It might beadded that this is a long and slow process because the consciousness is—in thisstage—not the intelligent awareness of the thinking man but the blindconsciousness of the physical man, plus the forces of nature themselves.2. The average educated citizen in all lands is facing today the Arjunaexperience and the pairs of opposites upon the astral plane. Hence the intensefeeling abroad in the world; hence also the search for illumination, througheducation, through religion, and through the many agencies of mentalinstruction, with the consequent [100] growth of knowledge, wisdom and rightrelationships. These people fall normally into two classes:a. Those who are aware of the necessity for decision and discrimination inthinking and in choice, but who are not yet truly aware of the implications orof the indications. They are called the “bewilderment phase of Arjuna’s plight,”and to racial, national and individual glamour, they have added a spiritualglamour which intensifies the fog.b. Those who have emerged out of this condition and are becoming aware of theirproblem. They see the pairs of opposites and are entering upon the “recognitionstage of Arjuna’s release.” They see the Form of God and the indwelling Realitywithin that Form and are arriving at the decision to let the Warrior carry onthe fight. They will then (when right decision and choice have been made) “standup and fight,” and will find themselves no longer on the Path of Purificationbut upon the Path of Discipleship.With this stage you are all familiar, and aspirants such as are found in thisgroup of students need no instruction from me as to the treading of the path outof glamour into light. The rules are well known: the glamours to which you aresusceptible are equally familiar; the glamours to which humanity is prone arewell recognised by you. It remains but for you to follow the ancient way of RajaYoga and bring in the mind as a dispelling agency and thus learn to stand in the“light” between the pairs of opposites, and through that “light” achieve freedomby treading the noble middle way. Sometimes, my brothers, I feel that you knowso much theoretically but have worked out relatively [101] so little. I askmyself whether I do not shoulder an unreasonable responsibility by giving youany more instructions. But I remind myself that I write for others as well asfor you and that my time is short for this particular service.The resolution of these dualities takes place when the soul, the true spiritualman, no longer identifies itself with either of the opposites, but stands freeupon this middle way; the disciple then sees the “lighted Way ahead,” alongwhich he learns to go without being drawn into the glamorous worlds whichstretch on either hand. He travels straight towards his goal.3. The stage wherein the intelligent thinking man, whether disciple orwell-meaning aspirant, or an initiate of the first and second degrees, has tolearn to distinguish between the truth and the truths, between knowledge andwisdom, between reality and illusion. When this stage has been passed through itleads to the third initiation, wherein the personality (which is prone to maya,glamour and illusion) stands free. It again experiences a sense of at-one-ment.This is due to the development of the sense of the intuition which puts into thedisciple’s hand an infallible instrument whereby to discriminate and to discern.His perception is becoming accurate and he stands relatively free from deceptionand wrong identifications and interpretations.You will have noted how the career of the man has, therefore, proceeded from acrisis of duality to one of a relative unity, only to have that sense ofunification disturbed by a renewed recognition of a higher and deeper duality.This duality temporarily produces another cleavage in a man’s life, and thusre-initiates a torturing process of bridging or of “occultly healing” [102] thisbreak in the continuity of the spiritual consciousness. I would here remind youthat this sense of peace or perception of cleavage is in itself an illusion andof the nature of glamour, and is based upon the illusory sense of identificationwith that which is not the self, or soul. The entire problem can be solved ifthe shift of the consciousness is away from identification with the lower formsof experience into that of identification with the real and true man.4. Stage by stage, the man has progressed from one state of illusion or glamourto another, from one point of discriminative opportunity to another until he hasdeveloped in himself three major capacities:1. The capacity to handle force.2. The capacity to tread the middle way between the pairs of opposites.3. The capacity to use the intuition.These capacities he developed by resolving the pairs of opposites on thephysical, astral and lower mental planes. Now he faces his climaxing resolution,equipped with these powers. He becomes aware of those two great and apparentlyopposing entities (with both of whom he finds himself consciouslyidentified)—the Angel of the Presence and the Dweller on the Threshold. Behindthe Angel he dimly senses, not another duality, but a great Identity, a livingUnity, which—for lack of a better word—we call the PRESENCE.He then discovers that the way out in this case is not the method of handlingforce or of leaving behind both pairs of opposites, or of right recognitionthrough the intuition, but that this Dweller and this Angel must be broughttogether; the lower entity must be “blotted out” in the “light,” or “forced todisappear within the [103] radiance.” This is the task of the higher of the twoentities, with which the disciple or the initiate, consciously and deliberately,identifies himself. With this process we will later deal. This is the problemwhich faces the initiate before he takes the final three initiations.You must bear in mind that none of these three stages are, in reality, dividedoff from each other by clear lines of demarcation, nor do they follow each otherin a clear sequence. They proceed with much overlapping and often with a partialsimultaneity. It is only when the disciple faces certain initiations that heawakens to the fact of these distinctions. Therefore, it might be stated that:1. In the first initiation the disciple demonstrates that he has resolved thedualities of the physical plane and can rightly impose etheric energy (thehigher of the two) upon physical energy.2. In the second initiation, the initiate demonstrates that he can choosebetween the pairs of opposites and proceed with decision upon the “middle way.”3. In the third initiation, the initiate can employ the intuition for the rightperception of truth, and in that initiation he catches the first real glimpse ofthe Dweller on the Threshold and the Angel of the Presence.4. In the fourth initiation, the initiate demonstrates his ability to producecomplete at-one-ment between the higher and lower aspect of the soul inmanifestation and sees the Dweller on the Threshold merge into the Angel of thePresence.5. In the fifth initiation—and here words fail to express the truth—he sees theDweller on the Threshold, [104] the Angel, and the Presence merged into a divinesynthesis.The question arises as to what produces this glamour and illusion. The subjectis so vast (embracing as it does the whole field of planetary history) that Ican do little more than indicate some of the causes. Few of them have, as yet,been susceptible of correction except in the case of individuals. This meansthat when individuals reach the point in evolution where they can identifythemselves with their higher aspect, the soul, and can then bring in soul energyto offset, subdue and dominate the lower forces of the personality, thencorrection becomes possible and inevitably takes place. When, therefore, thetime comes when a very large number of persons become aware of the condition ofworld glamour (through discovering it and dealing with it in their own lives),then we shall have a group approach to the problem. Then we shall have adefinite attack upon the world glamour, and when this does take place—speakingesoterically—“an opening will be made which will admit the light of the solarorb. The fogs will slowly disappear, subdued by the solar radiance, and thepilgrims will then find the enlightened WAY which leads from the heart of thefog, straight to the door of light.”It is with the intention of discovering how far the aspirants and disciples ofthe world have gone in their understanding and in their handling of this problemthat such an experiment as that being carried on in these groups has beenundertaken and permitted.2. THE CAUSES PRODUCING WORLD GLAMOUR.The causes producing world glamour can be divided into three groups: [105]A. Planetary causes.B. Causes initiated by humanity itself.C. Causes induced by any individual person which are, nevertheless, founded andbased in the two above groups of conditioning factors.A. Planetary Causes. These causes are two in number and beyond your finitecomprehension. I only state them and ask you to accept them as reasonablespeculations and possibly accurate hypotheses:1. Causes inherent in substance itself. The atoms of which all forms are madehave been inherited from an earlier universe or solar system and are, therefore,tinged with or coloured by the results of that great creative manifestation. Theeffects produced in that expression of divine existence constitute predisposingfactors or initiating causes in this solar system and planetary life. Theseconditioning and inherited factors cannot be evaded. They determine the natureof the life urge, the trend of the evolutionary unfoldment, and the innatetendencies which all forms possess, such as the capacity to grow and to unfold,to orient the type and to express in time and space the archetype or pattern,and to outline and determine the structure of the kingdoms into which sciencedivides the natural world. These are but a few of the innate, inherentcharacteristics of substance itself, inherited and conditioning our presentmanifestation of divine life.2. The life or manifestation of the planetary Logos, the “One in Whom we liveand move and have our being,” is determined by His Own Nature. To us, that greatLife embodies perfection and the qualities which distinguish Him are those towhich we direct our highest [106] aspiration. But, from the angle of Those LivesWho are ahead of Him upon the cosmic path (I speak symbolically and in terms ofhuman experience) He is among the “imperfect Gods.” These imperfections,hindering unfoldment or the perfect expression of divine energy when broughtinto conjunction with the inherited qualities and biases of the substancesthrough which He must express His life, His purposes and intentions, produce the“seeds of death and of decay” which characterise our planetary evolution in allthe four kingdoms in nature. They create the obstacles, obstructions andhindrances against which the soul in all created forms must struggle, gainingstrength and understanding thereby and eventual liberation.These are the two major planetary causes. They cannot finally deter the soulfrom emancipation but they can and do hinder and delay. It is useless for men tospeculate upon these hypotheses with their present inadequate equipment and typeof brain. Nothing would be achieved and you would be none the wiser.B. Causes initiated by humanity itself. Slowly, step by step, humanity hascreated and intensified that glamorous condition of consciousness which we callthe astral plane. All glamour is produced by the bringing together of one ormore streams of energy which produce a temporary whirlpool of energies and, fromthe angle of man—the onlooker and participator—produce a condition of darkness,a state of bewilderment which makes clear choice and right discriminationdifficult and, in the early stages, impossible. It creates an aura which istoday of such a general nature and so all-enveloping that everybody is,figuratively speaking, immersed in it. This aura, in the infancy [107] of therace, only surrounded the more advanced people. To understand what I mean bythis statement, I would call your attention to the fact that very unintelligentpeople, those who are among the lowest human types, and those who are littlemore than active animals, governed primarily by the instincts, are apt to dealvery simply and with complete directness with the facts of existence with whichthey are faced and which to them are of paramount or sole importance—the factsof hunger, of birth and death, of self-protection and perpetuation. There islittle true glamour in their reaction to life and living, and their simplicity,like that of a child, saves and protects them from many of the subtler ills.Their emotions are not subtle, and their minds are unawakened. But, as humanityevolved and the higher levels of the racial consciousness became more subtle andthe mind factor slowly became more active, then glamour and illusion developedvery rapidly.The first indications of glamour arose when the disciples and the aspirants ofthe Lemurian world (whose problem was the right comprehension, correctfunctioning and control of the physical body) began to differentiate betweenthemselves, as self-conscious beings, and physical and vital forces. Thatimmediately set up a tremendous activity in the throat centre which is thehigher aspect of the sacral centre (the sex centre) and thus led to the initialglamour and to the first definite recognition and consideration of the seximpulse, of sex attraction, and—for the initiate of that period—of the necessarysex transmutation. This went hand in hand with the earliest Yoga, or the cult ofthe physical body with the objective of its control by the soul, and theconsequent merging of the conscious and the subconscious.Around the aspirants of that time could then be seen gathering the first cloudsand fogs of glamour, though illusion [108] was nowhere present. The firstrecognition of the plane of the emotions, of the astral plane, was evoked in theconsciousness of the groups under preparation for the first initiation which wasthe highest initiation possible at that time. The reason for this slowlyemerging astral consciousness in the physically polarised aspirant of that time,was due to the fact that one of the secrets of initiation consists in the rightunderstanding and use of the consciousness which is aware and capable offunctioning upon a plane higher than that on which humanity as a whole is, atany given time, living. Hence, in Lemurian times, the physically centred man whowas on the verge of admission to the Path was aware of:1. The physical duality wherein his consciousness was accustomed to functionnormally and of the conflict between the physical body per se and the vitaletheric body.2. A dimly sensed higher consciousness which was distinguished by quality andsentiency. This was all that he could at that time contact upon the mostfamiliar plane today, the astral plane.3. A growing sense of self-identity which was the awakening soul or self, theMaster who was to lead him out of the purely physical consciousness into thenext divine stage, the astral consciousness. Forget not, through familiarity andfatigue of conflict, the divinity of each developing step.Thus it will be apparent to you, if the above is a true statement of fact, thatglamour arose from the recognition of these factors in consciousness and was theresult of man’s reactions to the complexities of his own constitution and to theenergy of his own soul.[109] As time went on, the entire human family became aware of the new emergingdualism existing between the physical constitution and the astral plane, plusthe activity of the centre within himself, which at this stage made itsappearance as conscience and innate—and at that time unreasoning—realisation ofan urge to higher living or a tendency to lower activity. This nebulousconscience developed eventually into what we call the Voice of Conscience. Whenthat took place, the intricacy and the difficulty of life was greatly increasedand glamour was definitely established on Earth. It was that which enfolded andover-emphasised the lower at the expense of the higher, and served to distractthe attention of the aspirant away from reality. May I again re-emphasise that,at this early stage, glamour was only evoked by and recognised by the highlyevolved people of that period?Then the Lemurian race slowly passed away and the Atlantean race came intoexistence. During the millions of years this race flourished on Earth there werevast numbers of people with the Lemurian consciousness flourishing at the sametime, just as today in this modern Aryan race, there are many, many millions ofpeople who express the Atlantean consciousness and are polarised in their astralbodies, the victims of emotion and of consequent glamour.In the Atlantean race, the physical duality was then solved, and the physicalbody and the etheric body constituted a unity, and in the healthy person stilldo so. The sense of duality shifted then into a growing recognition of theconflict in the realm of quality and into the field of what we today call the“pairs of opposites”—good and evil, pain and pleasure, right and wrong, senseand nonsense, and the multiplicity of opposites by which the aspirant is todayfaced.[110] Each of these racial histories sees the establishing of a temporary senseof unity in the early stages, when the previous cleavage had been healed and theinitial duality had been resolved into a unity. Then there comes a growingrecognition of a fresh realm of choice, based upon the emergence of the highervalues, and finally a period of conflict in the consciousness of the individualand of humanity as a whole, as the attempt is made to resolve this higherduality with which the man or the race is confronted.This resolution is brought about when a higher aspect of the consciousness isdimly visioned and men become aware of themselves as mental beings. There isthen a growing demand for that mind nature to be developed and brought into playin the effort to solve the problem in this category of opposites upon the astralplane.At the same time the sense of self-identity or the consciousness that “I am,” issteadily growing, and the initiate of the day faces the effort to releasehimself from the thraldom of the senses upon the astral plane, from the denseglamour into which his sensory perception has thrown him, and to establish hisfreedom by a complete control of the astral body. This he eventually does bydeveloping the power to pass between the pairs of opposites, unaffected byeither, and thus leave them behind. He accomplishes this by using the mind as adistributor of the light which reveals the “middle way” and which dissipates theglamour with its brilliance and radiance.This glamour has steadily deepened and intensified as more and more people havesucceeded in resolving the initial physical cleavage and have become centred inthe astral consciousness. Today such is the magnitude of this glamour and suchthe success of the evolutionary process, that humanity, as a whole, is wanderingin the fogs and miasmas of the world of sentient consciousness. When I [111] usethe word “sentient” I do not refer to the sensory apparatus of the physicalnervous system, but to the sentient awareness of the Self which is today soimmersed in glamour that the mass of men are entirely identified with the worldof feeling, of quality, of sentient interplay, and of emotional reactions, withtheir likes and dislikes, and their dominant self-pity. Self-pity is one of themajor glamours of the advanced and sensitive man. It is the advanced people whocontribute the most to the world glamour. The major glamour is the reaction ofthe aspirant to the truth, to reality when he first becomes aware of that whichlies beyond the astral plane. He interprets all that he there senses and sees interms of glamour, of emotional understanding, of a sentient fanaticism. Heforgets that truth lies beyond the world of feeling altogether, unaffected byit, and can only be sensed in its purity when feeling is transcended andtransmuted. The second major glamour is self-pity.The world today is divided into three groups, all of whom are subject to certainphases of glamour:1. Those who are Atlantean in their consciousness and are, therefore, completelyglamoured by:a. That which is material and to be desired.b. That which they feel in all relationships.c. That which they believe to be ideal, to be true or just, based on theirreactions to the thinkers of the day, but which they themselves do not mentallyunderstand.d. That which they demand of beauty, and of emotional comfort.e. That which brings to them spiritual comfort in the realm of religion andreligious desire. Note the phrasing.[112]2. Those who are more definitely Aryan in their consciousness. This means thatthe mind factor is awakening and thus constituting a difficulty and that theillusions of the mental plane are now added to the glamours of the astral plane.These illusions are theoretical and intellectual in nature.3. A group of people who are emerging out of those subject to glamour andillusion, and who are alive to the Voice of the Silence and to the demands ofthe soul.The complexity of the modern psychological problem lies in the fact that ourrace and period sees the synthesis of all the glamours and the emergence of theillusions of the mental plane. Today we have aspirants at all stages ofunfoldment, and find the masses recapitulating the different steps upon theevolutionary way, with the lowest layer of the human race definitely Lemurian intheir consciousness, even though few in numbers relatively speaking.Illusion is rapidly growing as the mental power of the race develops, forillusion is the succumbing to the powerful thoughtforms which the thinkers ofthe time and of the immediately preceding age have formulated, and which at thetime of their creation constituted the hope of the race. They embodied then thenew and emerging ideas by means of which the race was intended to progress.These forms, when old and crystallised, become a menace and a hindrance to theexpanding life. The realisation of the problems of illusion lies centuries aheadwhen the race will have left glamour behind, when there will be few Atlanteanminded people on the planet, and when there will be no people at all with theLemurian consciousness. However, as evolution proceeds, things are greatlyspeeded up, and the time when humanity will be predominantly distinguished bythe Aryan consciousness, is not as far ahead as might be [113] generallysupposed.Race Duality Problem Method Goal Lemurian Physical Force versus Vital EnergyMaya Astral control Hatha Yoga: Aspirants Laya Yoga: Disciples 1st InitiationInspiration Atlantean The Pairs of Opposites Qualities Sentiency Glamour Mentalcontrol Bahkti Yoga: Aspirants Raja Yoga: Disciples 2nd Initiation IlluminationAryan Dweller on the Threshold Angel of the Presence Illusion Soul control RajaYoga: Aspirants Agni Yoga: Disciples 3rd Initiation IntuitionI speak not in terms of the Aryan race as it is generally understood today or inits Nordic implications.C. Causes initiated by the individual. If you have studied all the above withthe needed care, it will be apparent to you that the individual man enters uponincarnation already handicapped by existent glamour of a very ancient origin andutterly beyond his power to control at this stage. It is of great potency. I usethe word “handicapped” advisedly for lack of a better term. I would like,however, to point out that the true significance of the situation exists in thefact that these conditions offer the opportunity to the man of evoking theunderstanding and point of view of the soul, for they provide the means wherebyexperience is gained. This experience will lead eventually to the soul assumingcontrol of the mechanism, the personality, and thus giving to that soul adefinite field of service. The vehicles through which the soul is seekingexperience and expression are normally and naturally subject to world glamours,and to the glamours of humanity as well as illusion. When the soul, in the earlystages of experience, falls into the snare of maya, of glamour and eventually ofillusion, the reason is that the soul is identifying itself with those forms andtherefore with the surrounding glamour, and thus failing to achieveidentification with itself. As evolution proceeds, the nature of the problembecomes apparent to the soul in incarnation and a process is then institutedwhereby the soul frees itself from the results of wrong identification. Everysoul in incarnation which succeeds in releasing its consciousness from the worldof illusion and of glamour is definitely serving the race, and helping to freehumanity from this ancient and potent thraldom.[115] But it must be borne in mind that when a man is nearing the stage ofconsciousness when both the astral body and the mental body are active andfunctioning, he himself becomes a manufacturer of glamour. He struggles withforces within himself and within the world in which he lives, and the increasingpotency of the inflowing soul energy (which comes in conflict with personalityforces) gradually produces around him a field of glamour and an environment ofillusion that brings this third category of glamour into full play.These glamours are dependent upon the expression of the different forces whichconstitute a man’s lower nature, of which he is becoming increasingly aware, andwhich pass through the stages of emergence into recognition, potency inexpression, and violence in conflict until the struggling soul sits down—as didArjuna—in the midst between the two opposing forces (personality force and soulenergy) and asks himself:1. Which is right, this or that?2. How can I distinguish where my duty or my responsibility lies?3. How can I find my way out of this bewildering situation?4. How can I bring in the control of the Warrior so that the two groups offorces which I love may be resolved into a unity?5. How can I find my way out of this impasse?6. Why must I hurt that which I love and through which I have expressed myselffor ages?7. How can I become aware of that mental illumination which will reveal the“middle way” between the pairs of opposites?8. How can I see God? or else the Form of God?[116] Many such questions arise in the mind of the aspirant. They indicatedilemma, bewilderment, a realisation of surrounding glamour, a stage of illusionand a condition of impotency. Against the disciple are fighting all the forcesof his own nature, and also those of humanity as a whole and of the planetarystate. He feels helpless, inert, feeble and hopeless. He cannot even see the wayout. Only one clear fact remains and that is the fact of the Soul, of theimmortal Identity, the Warrior behind the scenes, the Charioteer, Krishna, theChrist within.The Bhagavad Gita can be read entirely from the standpoint of the disciple’scombat with glamour and students would be well-advised so to study it.The individual glamours of which the disciple becomes aware are consequently offive types of force. These, when brought into activity simultaneously, producethose glamours which are strictly initiated and produced by the man himself.They are:1. The forces of his dense physical nature and of the vital body which latter,functioning through the dense physical nature, produce a condition of maya or ofuncontrolled energy.2. The forces of the astral nature, based upon desire and upon sentiency. These,at this stage, fall into two groups which we call the pairs of opposites. Theirpotency is accentuating at this period of individual history, for the discipleis polarised in the majority of cases in his astral body and is, therefore,subject to the glamours produced by the interplay of the opposites, plus thecondition of maya, referred to above.3. The forces of the lower mental nature, of the chitta or mind-stuff of whichthe mental body is composed. This [117] is coloured by past activity, as is thesubstance composing all the vehicles. This adds to maya and glamour, the stateof illusion.4. The personality ray then emerges and intensifies all these three aspects offorce expression, producing eventually their synthetic work. Then we have theemerging of what has been called “the threefold glamorous condition,” into onemajor glamour.5. The soul ray or energy is all this time steadily increasing its rhythmicpotency, and seeking to impose its purpose and will upon the personality. It isthe united relation and the interplay between these two which—when a point ofbalance has been achieved—sweeps the man on to the Probationary Path, on to thePath of Discipleship, and right up to the gate of initiation. There, standingbefore the Gate, he recognises the final duality which awaits resolution. TheDweller on the Threshold and the Angel of the PRESENCE.The nature of these glamours differs with different people, for the ray qualitydetermines the type of glamour or illusion to which a man will easily succumb,and that kind of glamour which he will the most easily create. Disciples have tolearn to differentiate between:1. The glamours or glamour already existent in his environment, to which he willeasily be attracted, or which he will easily attract, for they constitute theline of least resistance.2. The glamour that he creates as he tackles life through the medium of aparticular equipment, which is coloured by the experiences of past incarnations,and by the ray quality under which he has come into being.[118] This subject is so intricate that it will serve no useful purpose for meto go into detailed particulars. I can indicate the major glamours (and underthis term I include the various maya and illusions) to which the ray typespredispose the man. If you then apply these to the three vehicles ofmanifestation as well as to the personality and the soul, you will note howcomplicated is the problem. Yet remember this, my brother:The issue is certain and determined for, in this solar system, the triumph ofthe soul and its final dominance and control is a foregone conclusion, no matterhow great the glamour or how fierce the strife. Thus, the ascertaining (by theaspirant) of his ray influence is one of the first steps towards understandingthe nature of his problem and the method of release. The psychology of thefuture will direct attention to the discovery of the two rays which govern thesoul and personality. Having done this through a study of the physical type,emotional reactions and mental tendencies, attention will then be directed tothe discovery of the rays governing the specialised vehicles. When these fiverays (egoic, personality, physical, astral and mental) have been approximatelyascertained, then the following factors will need consideration:1. The nature, quality and stability of the glandular system.2. The point attained in evolution. This will be done by a careful considerationof the centres and the glands and their relation to each other.3. The recognition of the points of cleavage or the splits in the personalitywhich exist. These can be:a. Between the etheric and the physical bodies, leading to a lack of vitality,physical weakness, obsession and many forms of difficulty. [119]b. In the sentient astral body, leading to a vast number of problems andpsychological difficulties based upon undue sensitivity, reaction to glamour inthe environment, innate tendencies to glamour in the equipment or resulting fromsensitivity to the glamours of other people.c. In the mental body, imposing mental illusions of many kinds, such as controlby self-created thoughtforms, sensitivity to existing world, national, orenvironing thoughtforms of any school of thought, idée fixe, the sense of thedramatic or of importance, or a fanatical adherence to groups of ideas,inherited from the past, or mental reactions of a purely personal nature.d. Between any of these groups of forces which we call bodies:Between the etheric and astral bodies.Between the astral and the mental bodies.There is, for instance, a definite correspondence between the condition ofnegativity to physical plane living which is the result of a lack of integrationbetween the physical and the etheric bodies, and that lack of interest and thatfailure to handle physical plane living which the thinker on abstract andscientific levels so frequently evidences. Both groups fail to make a definiteand decisive manifestation upon the physical plane, both groups fail to dealwith the problems of physical plane living in a clear and satisfactory manner,both are non-positive physically, but the causes producing these relativelysimilar conditions are totally different—though alike in their effects.4. The comprehension of the Path of Life for an individual, through a study ofhis astrological indications. It is necessary in this connection to regard thesun sign [120] into which a man is born, as indicative of his personalitytrends, and as embodying the characteristics which he has inherited from thepast, but to regard the rising sign as holding within it the indications of theway that a man’s soul would have him go.Many other factors will warrant careful attention. The problem of the individualis complicated by certain inherited tendencies of a family, national and racialnature. These powerfully affect the physical body in both its aspects, producingglamours of many kinds. It is also affected by certain inherited ideas which arethe embodied thoughtforms of family, national and racial approaches to truth.These produce powerful illusions to which the individual man easily succumbs.There are also the inflowing forces of the sign into which the sun may bepassing, such as the conditions found in the world today, due to the fact thatour sun is passing into a new sign of the zodiac. Therefore powerful and newenergies are playing upon humanity, producing effects in all the three bodies.They are evoking glamours in the emotional nature and illusions in the mentalnature. Those easily subject to glamour become at this time conscious of anemphasised duality. The subject, as you will therefore see, is vast, and thisscience of the psychological influences and the results of their impact upon thehuman mechanism is, as yet, in its infancy. I have, however, indicated enough toarouse interest and to start investigation in this new field of psychologicalactivity.To return to the consideration of the many glamours which are produced by andrelated to certain ray types:RAY I.The glamour of physical strength.The glamour of personal magnetism. [121]The glamour of self-centredness and personal potency.The glamour of “the one at the centre.”The glamour of selfish personal ambition.The glamour of rulership, of dictatorship and of wide control.The glamour of the Messiah complex in the field of politics.The glamour of selfish destiny, of the divine right of kings personally exacted.The glamour of destruction.The glamour of isolation, of aloneness, of aloofness.The glamour of the superimposed will—upon others and upon groups.RAY II.The glamour of the love of being loved.The glamour of popularity.The glamour of personal wisdom.The glamour of selfish responsibility.The glamour of too complete an understanding, which negates right action.The glamour of self-pity, a basic glamour of this ray.The glamour of the Messiah complex, in the world of religion and world need.The glamour of fear, based on undue sensitivity.The glamour of self-sacrifice.The glamour of selfish unselfishness.The glamour of self-satisfaction.The glamour of selfish service.RAY III.The glamour of being busy.The glamour of cooperation with the Plan in an individual [122] and not a groupway.The glamour of active scheming.The glamour of creative work—without true motive.The glamour of good intentions, which are basically selfish.The glamour of “the spider at the centre.”The glamour of “God in the machine.”The glamour of devious and continuous manipulation.The glamour of self-importance, from the standpoint of knowing, of efficiency.RAY IV.The glamour of harmony, aiming at personal comfort and satisfaction.The glamour of war.The glamour of conflict, with the objective of imposing righteousness and peace.The glamour of vague artistic perception.The glamour of psychic perception instead of intuition.The glamour of musical perception.The glamour of the pairs of opposites, in the higher sense.RAY V.The glamour of materiality, or over-emphasis of form.The glamour of the intellect.The glamour of knowledge and of definition.The glamour of assurance, based on a narrow point of view.The glamour of the form which hides reality.The glamour of organisation.The glamour of the outer, which hides the inner. [123]RAY VI.The glamour of devotion.The glamour of adherence to forms and persons.The glamour of idealism.The glamour of loyalties, of creeds.The glamour of emotional response.The glamour of sentimentality.The glamour of interference.The glamour of the lower pairs of opposites.The glamour of World Saviours and Teachers.The glamour of the narrow vision.The glamour of fanaticism.RAY VII.The glamour of magical work.The glamour of the relation of the opposites.The glamour of the subterranean powers.The glamour of that which brings together.The glamour of the physical body.The glamour of the mysterious and the secret.The glamour of sex magic.The glamour of the emerging manifested forces.I have here enumerated many glamours. But their names are legion, and I have byno means covered the possibilities or the field of glamour.One of the groups with which I have worked had certain characteristics anddifficulties, and it might be of value if I mentioned it here.This group had a curious history in relation to other groups, because itspersonnel changed several times. Each time, the person who left the group hadbeen in it from karmic right and old relation to myself or to the group members,[124] and had, therefore, earned the opportunity to participate in thisactivity. Each time they failed, and each time for personality reasons. Theylacked group realisation and were definitely occupied with themselves. Theylacked the new and wider vision. So they eliminated themselves from this initialnew age activity. I am explaining this, for it is valuable to disciples to graspthe fact that karmic relation cannot be ignored and that group opportunity mustbe offered, even though it delay functioning in group service.Several of the group members were still struggling with glamour and it needed alonger time for them to adjust themselves to recognition of it when encountered.The major task of this group was to dissipate some of the universal glamour by aunited indicated meditation. Certain of the group members also were facing orhad major adjustments in their lives, and it took a little time for the neededsubjective rhythm to become established. But they all worked with understanding,perseverance and enthusiasm, and it was not long before the group work wasstarted.You would find it of value to consider the following questions:1. What is the method whereby ideas are developed from the moment of impressingthe mind of some intuitive?Broadly speaking, they pass through the following stages, as you have oft beentold:a. The idea . . . based on intuitive perception.b. The ideal . . . based on mental formulation and distribution.c. The idol . . . based on the concretising tendency of physical manifestation.2. What glamours do you feel are particularly dominant in the world today, andwhy? [125]3. I have spoken often of the work which this group and certain other groups areintending to do in dissipating world glamour. Have you any ideas as to how thisshould be done, or what will be demanded of you?3. THE CONTRAST BETWEEN HIGHER AND LOWER GLAMOURSIn the preceding part of this section we considered (briefly and all toocursorily) some of the causes of the dense glamour which surrounds humanity.That this glamour is very ancient, powerfully organised, and is the dominantcharacteristic of the astral plane emerged clearly, as did the fact of the threemajor predisposing subsidiary causes:1. The glamours induced by the planetary life and inherent in substance itself.2. Those glamours which are initiated by humanity, as a whole, and intensifiedthroughout an aeonial past.3. Glamour engendered by the individual himself, either in the past, throughparticipation in world glamour, or started this life.To all of these, every human being is prone and for many lives proves himselfthe helpless victim of that which he later discovers to be erroneous, false anddeceiving. He learns then that he need not fall supinely under the domination ofthe past—astral, emotional and glamorous—but that he is adequately equipped tohandle it, did he but know it, and that there are methods and techniques wherebyhe can emerge the conqueror of illusion, the dissipator of glamour and themaster of maya. This is the initial revelation, and it is when he has realisedthe implication of this and has [126] set out to dominate the undesirablecondition that he arrives later at a recognition of an essential duality. Thisis, for the time being, in no case an illusion. He discovers the relationshipbetween himself as a personality, the true Dweller on the Threshold, and theAngel of the PRESENCE—guarding the door of initiation. This marks a criticalmoment in the life of the disciple for it indicates the moment wherein he canbegin to tread the Path of Initiation, if he so desires and possesses therequired fortitude.In the last analysis, the partial subjugation of glamour and escape from thecomplete thraldom of illusion are indications to the watching Hierarchy that aman is ready for the processes of initiation. Until he is no longer completelydeceived and until he is somewhat free mentally, it is not possible for him toface the waiting Angel and pass through the door. One thing I would here pointout to you: after passing through the door of initiation, the disciple returnseach time again to take up anew his tasks in the three worlds of activity; hethere re-enacts the former processes—briefly and with understanding—after whichhe proceeds to master the essentials of the next initiatory lesson. I am hereputting a great deal of information in a very condensed form, but that is allthat is possible at this time.For a long time, the sense of dualism pervades the disciple’s being and makeshis life appear to be a ceaseless conflict between the pairs of opposites. Thebattle of the contraries is taking place consciously in the disciple’s life. Healternates between the experiences of the past and a recollection of theexperience of initiation through which he has passed, with the emphasis, firstof all, in the earlier experiences; later, in the final great experience whichis so deeply colouring his inner life. He has prolonged moments wherein he isthe baffled disciple, struggling with glamour, and brief moments wherein he isthe triumphant initiate. He [127] discovers in himself the sources of glamourand illusion and the lure of maya until the moment arrives when again he standsbefore the portal and faces the major dualities in his own particular littlecosmos—the Dweller and the Angel. At first he fears the Angel and dreads thelight which streams from that Angel’s countenance, because it throws into vividreality the nature of the Dweller who is himself. He senses, as never before,the formidable task ahead of him and the true significance of the undertaking towhich he has pledged himself. Little by little, two things emerge with startlingclarity in his mind:1. The significance of his own nature, with its essential dualism.2. The recognition of the relationship between the pairs of opposites with whichhe, as a disciple, has to work.Once he grasps the relation of the lower major duality (that of the personalityand the soul) he is then prepared to pass on to the higher reality, that of theintegrated Self (personality and soul) and its relation to the PRESENCE. In thisstatement, you have expressed in a few concise words the result of the firstthree initiations and the two final. Ponder on this.It will be of real value, I believe, if I relate for your benefit the variouscontrasting characteristics of the intelligent man and the disciple, using theword “disciple” to cover all stages of development from that of accepteddisciple to that of the Master. There is naught but the Hierarchy, which is aterm denoting a steady progress from a lower state of being and of consciousnessto a higher. This is in every case the state of consciousness of some Being,limited and confined and controlled by substance. You will note that [128] I say“substance” and not “form” for it is in reality substance which controls spiritfor a long, a very long, cycle of expression; it is not matter that controls,for the reason that gross matter is always controlled by the forces which areesoterically regarded as etheric in nature and, therefore, as substance, notform. Remember this at all times for it holds the clue to the true understandingof the lower nature.We will study, therefore, the basic essential contrasts which the disciple mustintuitively grasp and with which he must familiarise himself. We will dividewhat we have to say into four parts, dealing briefly, but I trust helpfully,with each:a. The contrast between Illusion and its opposite Intuition. b. The contrastbetween Glamour and its opposite Illumination. c. The contrast between Maya andits opposite Inspiration. d. The contrast between the Dweller on the Thresholdand its opposite The Angel of the PRESENCE.This, you will realise, is a large subject and deals with the major problem ofthe disciple. I would refer you at this point to what I have already said anentthese four aspects of glamour, and would ask you to refer with care to thevarious charts and tabulations which have been given to you from time to time.a. The Contrast between Illusion and Intuition.I have chosen this as the first contrast with which to deal as it should (eventhough it probably may not) constitute the major glamour of the members of thisgroup. Unfortunately the emotional glamour dominates still and, for the majorityof you, the second contrast, that between glamour and illumination, may provethe most useful and the most constructive.Illusion is the power of some mental thoughtform, of some ideal, and someconcept—sensed, grasped and interpreted [129] in mental form—to dominate themental processes of the individual or of the race and consequently to producethe limitation of the individual or group expression. Such ideas and conceptscan be of three kinds, as I realise you should know:1. They can be inherited ideas, as in the case of those who find it so difficultto adjust themselves to the new vision of world life and of social order, asexpressed in the newer ideologies. They are powerfully conditioned by theircast, their tradition and their background.2. They can be the more modern ideas which are, in the last analysis, thereaction of modern thought to world conditions and situations, and to these manyother aspirants are very prone and most naturally so, especially if living inthe vortex of force which we call modern Europe. Such modern ideas are construedtoday into major currents and dominating ideologies, and to these everyintelligent person must inevitably react, though they forget that that reactionis based on tradition, or upon national or international predisposition.3. They can be the newer dimly sensed ideas which have in them the power tocondition the future and lead the modern generation out of darkness into light.None of you as yet really sense these new ideas, though in moments of highmeditation and spiritual achievement, you may vaguely and briefly react to them.That reaction may be real just in so far that it conditions, with definiteness,your service to your fellowmen. You can react correctly and can do soincreasingly if you preserve your soul’s integrity and are not overcome by thebattle and the fever of your surroundings within your chosen field of service.[130] A mental illusion might perhaps be described as an idea, embodied in anideal form, which permits no room or scope for any other form of ideal. Itprecludes an ability, therefore, to contact ideas. The man is tied to the worldof ideals and of idealism. He cannot move away from it. This mental illusionties and limits and imprisons the man. A good idea may consequently become anillusion with great facility and prove a disastrous conditioning factor in thelife of the man who registers it.You might well ask here if the Hierarchy itself is not conditioned by an ideaand, therefore, is itself a victim of general and widespread illusion. Apartfrom the fact that the Directors of the Hierarchy and the Custodians of the Planare never permitted to become such until they are free from the incentive ofillusion, I would remind you that all ideas stream into the planetaryconsciousness along the channel of the seven rays. Thus, the Hierarchy is wideopen, in any case, to the seven major groups of ideas which are the IDEA of Godfor any specific point in time, expressed in seven major ways—all of themequally right and serving the sevenfold need of humanity. Each of these sevenformulations of God’s Idea has its specific contribution to make; each of themis a true idea which has its part to play in human or planetary service; andeach of them is so interrelated with the other six expressions of the samedivine Idea, working out as ideals upon the mental plane, that there can be nonarrowing down to one idea with its ramifications as happens among men. Thereis, at least, sensitivity to seven groups of ideas and their resultant idealsand—if it were no more than that—the Hierarchy is so far fluid and pliable. Butit is far more than just this, for, to the members of the Hierarchy, the ideaand its effects are not only interpreted in terms of human thoughtforms andhuman idealism, but they are also to be contacted and studied in their relationto the [131] Mind of God Himself and to the planetary kingdoms. These ideas comefrom and they emanate from the buddhic plane, which is seldom open to theconsciousness of the average disciple and certainly is not open to the contactof the average idealist. I would here remind you that few idealists arepersonally in touch with the idea which has given birth to the idealism. Theyare only in touch with the human interpretation of the idea, as formulated bysome disciple or intuitive—a very different thing.An illusion can, therefore, be defined as the consequence of an idea (translatedinto ideal) being regarded as the entire presentation, as the complete story orsolution and as being separated from and visioned independently of all otherideas—both religious in nature or apparently completely unrelated to religion.In this statement lies the story of separation and of man’s inability to relatethe various implications of a divine idea with each other. When visioned andgrasped in a narrow and separative manner, there is necessarily a distortion ofthe truth, and the disciple or aspirant inevitably pledges himself to a partialaspect of reality or of the Plan and not to the truth as far as it can berevealed or to the Plan as the Members of the Hierarchy know it. This illusionevokes in the disciple or idealist an emotional reaction which immediately feedsdesire and consequently shifts off the mental plane on to the astral; a desireis thus evoked for a partial and inadequate ideal and thus the idea cannotarrive at full expression, because its exponent sees only this partial ideal asthe whole truth and cannot, therefore, grasp its social and planetary and itscosmic implications.Where there is a real grasp of the whole idea (a rare thing indeed) there can beno illusion. The idea is so much bigger than the idealist that humility saveshim from narrowness. Where there is illusion (which is usual and commonplace)[132] and a vague interpretive reaction to an idea, we find emerging fanatics,vague idealists, sadistic enforcers of the idea as grasped, one-pointed andnarrow men and women, seeking to express their interpretation of God’s idea, andlimited, cramped visionaries. Such illusionary picturing of reality and suchvisionary showing forth of the idea has been both the pride and the curse of theworld. It is one of the factors which has brought our modern world to its sorrypass, and it is from this misuse of the divine faculty of touching the idea andtransforming it into the ideal that the world is today suffering—probablyinevitably. The imposition of these humanly and mentally interpreted ideas inthe form of limited ideologies has had a sorry effect upon men. They need tolearn to penetrate to the true idea which lies behind their ideal and tointerpret it with accuracy in the light of their soul, besides employing thosemethods which have the warrant and the sanction of LOVE. It is, for instance, noillusion that the idea which finds expression in the statement that “all men areequal” is a fact which needs emphasis. This has been seized upon by thedemocratically inclined. It is indeed a statement of fact, but when no allowanceis made for the equally important ideas of evolution, of racial attributes, andof national and religious characteristics, then the basic idea receives onlylimited application. Hence the enforced ideological systems of our modern timesand of the present day, and the rapid growth of ideological illusions, which arenevertheless based on a true idea—each and all without any exception. It isagain no illusion that the development of the Christ consciousness is the goalof the human family, but when it is interpreted in terms of authoritativereligion and by those in whom the Christ consciousness is as yet undeveloped, itbecomes simply a nice concept and often a sadistic incentive and thus entersimmediately into the realm of illusion.[133] I cite these two illustrations, out of many possible ones, so that you mayrealise how illusions come, how they develop and how they must eventuallydisappear; thus you can achieve some standard of comparison whereby to grasp therelative value of the true and the false, of the immediately temporal and thebasic eternality of the real.It will, therefore, be apparent to you that the lower or concrete levels of themental plane will have acquired or accumulated—down the ages—a vast number ofideas, which have been formulated as ideals, clothed in mental matter, nourishedby the vitality of those who have recognised as much of the truth of the idea asthey are capable of expressing and who have given to these ideals the emphasisof their thoughtform-making faculty and their directed attention, whichnecessarily implies the energising of the limited formulated ideal because—asyou know—energy follows thought.These forms of thought become objectives towards which the subjective reality,man, reaches and with which he identifies himself for long periods of time; intothem, he projects himself, thus vitalising them and giving them life andpersistence. They become part of him; they condition his reactions andactivities; they feed his desire nature and consequently assume undueimportance, creating a barrier (of varying density, according to the extent ofthe identification) between the man in incarnation and the reality which is histrue Being.There is no need for me here to itemise any of these prevailing thoughtforms andaspects of intellectual and mental illusion. I would not have you think for amoment that the embodied idea, which we call an ideal, is in itself an illusion.It only becomes so when it is regarded as an end in itself instead of being whatit essentially is, a means to an end. An ideal, rightly grasped and used,provides a temporary [134] aid towards the attainment of immediate and imminentreality which it is the goal of the man or the race, at any particular time, toreach. The idea before the race today is the re-establishing (upon a higher turnof the spiral) of that spiritual relationship which characterised the race inits child state, in its primitive condition. Then, under the wise guidance andthe paternalistic attitude of the Hierarchy and the initiate-priests of thetime, men knew themselves to be one family—a family of brothers—and achievedthis through a feeling and a developed sensuous perception. Today, under thename of Brotherhood , the same idea is seeking mental form and the establishmentof a renewed spiritual relationship (the idea) through training in right humanrelations (the ideal). This is the immediate goal of humanity.This result will be inevitably brought about by means of the cycle of necessitythrough which we are now passing and the dimly sensed idea will—as a result ofdire necessity—impose its rhythm upon the race and thus force the realisation oftrue Being upon all men. If a close study is made of the basic foundation of allthe ideologies without excepting any, it will be discovered that this idea ofintegral relationships (often distorted in presentation and hidden through wrongmethods), of spiritual objectives and of definite positive brotherly activitylies behind every outer form. I have used the current situation as anillustration of the idea taking form as the ideal and, alas, brother of mine,oft becoming the idol and the fanatical misunderstood and over-emphasised goalof the masses, under the guidance of some pronounced idealist. An ideal is atemporary expression of a basic idea; it is not intended to be permanent butsimply to serve a need and to indicate a way out of the past into a moreadequate future. All the present ideals, expressing themselves through thecurrent ideologies, will serve their [135] purpose and eventually pass away, asall else has passed in the history of the race and will give place, eventually,to a recognised spiritual relationship, a subjective fellowship, as a definedand expressed brotherhood . These will produce, when sufficiently developed andunderstood, a form of control and guidance and a species of government which itis not possible for even advanced thinkers at this time to grasp.When ideals and mental concepts and formulated thoughtforms dominate the mind ofan individual, a race or humanity in general, to the exclusion of allperspective or vision and to the shutting out of the real, then they constitutean illusion for as long as they control the mind and method of life. Theyprevent the free play of the intuition, with its real power to reveal theimmediate future; they frequently exclude in their expression the basicprinciple of the solar system, Love, through the imposed control of somesecondary and temporary principle; they can thus constitute a “forbidding darkcloud of rain” which serves to hide from view the “raincloud of knowable things”(to which Patanjali refers in his final book)—that cloud of wisdom which hoversover the lower mental plane and which can be tapped and used by students andaspirants through the free play of the intuition.Let us now consider the intuition, which is the opposite of illusion,remembering that illusion imprisons a man upon the mental plane and surroundshim entirely with man-made thoughtforms, barring out escape into the higherrealms of awareness or into that loving service which must be given in the lowerworlds of conscious, manifested effort.The major point I would seek to make here is that the intuition is the source orthe bestower of revelation. Through the intuition, progressive understanding ofthe ways of God in the world and on behalf of humanity are [136] revealed;through the intuition, the transcendence and the immanence of God issequentially grasped and man can enter into that pure knowledge, that inspiredreason, which will enable him to comprehend not only the processes of nature inits fivefold divine expression but also the underlying causes of theseprocesses, proving them effects and not initiatory events; through the intuitionman arrives at the experience of the kingdom of God, and discovers the nature,the type of lives and of phenomena, and the characteristics of the Sons of Godas They come into manifestation. Through the intuition, some of the plans andpurposes working out through the manifested created worlds are brought to hisattention, and he is shown in what way he and the rest of humanity can cooperateand hasten the divine purpose; through the intuition, the laws of the spirituallife, which are the laws governing God Himself, conditioning Shamballa, andguiding the Hierarchy, are brought to his notice progressively and as he provescapable of appreciating them and working them.Four types of people are subject to revelation through the awakening of theintuition:1. Those on the line of the world saviours. These touch and sense the divineplan and are pledged to service, and to work for the salvation of humanity. Theyare found expressing different and varying degrees of realisation, stretchingall the way from the man who seeks to reveal divinity in his own life and to hisimmediate small circle (through the medium of the changes and effects wrought inhis personal life) to those great Intuitives and world Saviours, such as theChrist. The former is motivated in all probability by some one intuitive crisiswhich entirely remade him and gave him a new sense of values; the latter can, atwill, rise into the world of intuitive perception and [137] values and thereascertain the will of God and a wide vision of the Plan. Such greatRepresentatives of Deity have the freedom of the Holy City (Shamballa) and ofthe New Jerusalem (the Hierarchy). They are thus unique in their contacts andthere have been relatively few of Them as yet.2. Those who are on the line of the prophets. These touch the Plan at highintuitive moments and know what the immediate future holds. I do not refer hereto the Hebrew prophets, so familiar to the West, but to all who see clearly whatshould be done to lead humanity out of darkness into light, beginning with thesituation as it is and looking forward into a future of divine consummation.They have a clear picture in their minds of what is possible to accomplish, andthe power to point it out to the people of their time. They necessarily rangeall the way from those who have a relatively clear vision of the cosmic pictureand objectives to those who simply see the next step ahead for the race or thenation. Isaiah and Ezekiel are the only two of the Hebrew prophets who had trueprophetic and cosmic vision. The others were small, but intelligent men who,from analysis and deduction, assessed the immediate future and indicatedimmediate possibilities. They had no direct revealing intuition. In the NewTestamen t, John, the beloved disciple, was privileged to gain a cosmic pictureand a true prophetic vision which he embodied in the Apocalypse, but he is theonly one who so achieved and he achieved because he loved so deeply, so wiselyand so inclusively. His intuition was evoked through the depth and intensity ofhis love—as it was in his Master, the Christ.3. Those who are the true priests. They are priests by spiritual calling and notby choice. It is the misunderstanding of the province and duties of a priestwhich has led all the Churches (in the East and in the West) to their disastrous[138] authoritarian position. The love of God, and the true spiritual incentivewhich recognises God immanent in all nature and peculiarly expressing thatdivinity in man, is lacking in the bulk of the priesthood in all the worldreligions. Love is not the guide, the indicator and the interpreter. Hence thedogmatism of the theologian, his ridiculous and profound assurances of correctinterpretation, and his oft-times cruelty, cloaked by his claim of rightprinciples and good intentions. But the true priest exists and is found in allreligions. He is the friend and the brother of all and, because he loves deeply,wisdom is his and (if he is of a mental type and training) his intuition isawakened and revelation is his reward. Ponder on this. The true priest is rareand is not found only in the so-called “holy orders”.4. Those who are the practical mystics or occultists. These, by virtue of adisciplined life, an ardent aspiration, and a trained intellect, have succeededin evoking the intuition and are, therefore, personally in touch with the truesource of divine wisdom. This, it is their function to interpret and toformulate into temporary systems of knowledge. There are many such, workingpatiently today in the world, unrecognised and unsought by the unthinking. Theirneed today is to “assemble themselves” in this hour of the world need and so lettheir voice be clearly heard. These people are resolving the sense of dualityinto a known unity, and their preoccupation with reality and their deep love ofhumanity have released the intuition. When this release has taken place, nobarriers are felt and true knowledge as a result of revealed wisdom is the giftwhich such people have, to give to their race and time.These are the four groups who are exchanging illusion for the intuition. This isthe initial resolution of the pairs of opposites, for there is no suchresolution without the aid of the intellect, because the intellect—throughanalysis, discrimination [139] and right reasoning—indicates what should bedone.b. The Contrast between Glamour and Illumination .One of the aptest symbols by which one can gather some picture of the nature ofglamour is to picture the astral plane on three of its levels (the second, thirdand fourth, counting from the top downwards) as a land shrouded in a thick fogof varying densities. The ordinary light of the ordinary man, which is similarto the headlights of a car and their self-sufficient blaze, serves only tointensify the problem and fails to penetrate into the mists and the fog. Itsimply throws it into relief so that its density and its deterring effectsbecome the more apparent. The condition of fog is revealed—but that is all. Soit is on the astral plane in relation to glamour; the light which is in man,self-induced and self-generated, fails ever to penetrate into or to dissipatethe gloom and the foggy miasmic conditions. The only light which can dissipatethe fogs of glamour and rid the life of its ill effects is that of the soul,which—like a pure dispelling beam—possesses the curious and unique quality ofrevelation, of immediate dissipation, and of illumination. The revelationvouchsafed is different to that of the intuition for it is the revelation ofthat which the glamour veils and hides, which is a revelation unique to theastral plane and conditioned by its laws. This particular utilisation of soullight takes the form of a focussed concentration of the light (emanating fromthe soul, via the mind) upon the state of glamour—particular or specific, orgeneral and world-wide—so that the nature of the glamour is revealed, itsquality and basis is discovered, and its power is brought to an end by a steady,prolonged period of concentration which is given to the dispelling of thecondition.[140] In our next section we will deal in detail with the technique of thisscientific use of light and, therefore, I will not elaborate the theme at thispoint. I will only deal with that much of it as will enable you, as a group, tobegin your long awaited work upon the problem of dispelling the present worldglamour—at least in some of its aspects. I am not defining glamour in this placeor giving you instances of its activity as I did in the case of illusion and itscontrasting correspondence, the intuition, because I covered the ground verythoroughly in the section immediately preceding, and you have only to refer tothat section to read all that I am prepared to give you at this time.I will, however, briefly define illumination , asking you to bear in mind thatwe are not here dealing with the illumination which reveals Reality, or thenature of the soul or which makes clear to your vision the kingdom of the soul,but with that form of illumination which is thrown down by the soul into theworld of the astral plane. This involves the conscious use of light and itsemployment, first of all, as a searchlight, scanning the astral horizon andlocalising the glamour which is causing the trouble, and secondly, as a focusseddistribution of light, turned with intention upon that area of the astral planewherein it is proposed that some effort be made to dissipate the fog and mistwhich are there concentrated.Certain basic premises are, therefore, in order and these might be stated asfollows:1. The quality and the major characteristic of the soul is light. Therefore, ifthat light is to be used and that quality expressed by the disciple and theworker, he must first of all achieve a recognised contact with the soul throughmeditation.2. The quality of the astral plane—its major characteristic—[141] is glamour. Itis the field whereon the great battle of the pairs of opposites must be foughtas they are the expression of ancient desire, in the one case—glamorous,deceptive and false—and in the other, high spiritual longing for that which isreal and true. It should be here remembered that astral desire, wrong andselfish emotion and astral reactions to the facts of daily life, are not naturalto the soul and constitute eventually a condition which serves to veilsuccessfully the true nature of the spiritual man.3. A relation must then be established between the soul and the astral plane,via the astral body of the disciple. This astral body must be regarded by him ashis response apparatus to the world of sensation and as the only instrumentwhereby his soul can contact that level of expression—temporary and non-lastingas it may be. The disciple must, therefore, establish contact with the soul anddo this consciously and with the needed emphasis and so carry soul light to hisown astral body, learn to focus it there in the solar plexus centre, and fromthat point of achievement proceed to work upon the astral plane at the arduoustask of dispelling glamour.4. When this line of contact has been made and the soul, the astral body and theastral plane have thus been intimately related, the disciple must carry thefocussed light from the solar plexus (where it has been temporarily localised)to the heart centre. There he must steadily hold it and work consistently andperseveringly from that higher centre. I might here paraphrase an ancientinstruction for disciples, which can be found in the Archives of the Hierarchyand which refers to this particular process. I am giving you a brief andsomewhat inadequate paraphrase of this ancient symbolic wording: [142]“The disciple stands and, with his back to the glamorous fog, looks towards theEast from whence the light must stream. Within his heart he gathers all thelight available and from that point of power between the shoulder blades thelight streams forth.”5. The disciple must relinquish all sense of tension or of strain and must learnto work with pure faith and love. The less he feels and the less he ispreoccupied with his own feelings or sense of achievement or of non-achievement,the more probable it will be that the work will proceed with effectiveness andthe glamour be slowly dispelled. In this work there is no haste. That which isvery ancient cannot be immediately dispelled no matter how good the intention orhow accurate may be the grasp of the needed technique.It will be apparent to you that there are elements of danger in this work.Unless the members of the group are exceedingly watchful and unless theycultivate the habit of careful observation, they may suffer fromover-stimulation of the solar plexus until such time as they have mastered theprocess of rapidly transferring the light of the soul, focussed in the solarplexus, and the innate light of the astral body, also found localised in thatcentre, into the heart centre between the shoulder blades. I would, therefore,warn each and all of you to proceed with the utmost care and I would caution youthat if you suffer any solar plexus disturbance or encounter in yourselves anyincreased emotional instability, to be not unduly disturbed. I would ask you toregard the phenomenon of disturbance as simply a temporary difficulty, incidentupon the service which you are seeking to render. If you pay this intelligentattention to the matter and no more, refusing to be distressed or to bedisturbed, no bad results will be felt.[143] In connection with your anticipated group work along these lines, you willproceed with your group meditation as indicated elsewhere (Discipleship in theNew Age, Volume I , page 61), and then—when you have arrived at Stage III in thegroup meditation—you will work together as follows:1. Having linked up with all your group brothers, then consciously carry out thehints given symbolically in the ancient writing which I paraphrased for youabove.a. Link up consciously with your soul and realise this linking as a fact.b. Then carry the light of the soul, through the power of the creativeimagination, direct to your astral body and from thence to the solar plexuscentre—which is the line of least resistance.c. Then transfer the light of the soul and the innate light of the astral bodyfrom the solar plexus centre to the heart centre, by a definite act of the will.2. Then, imaginatively, stand with your back to the world of glamour and withthe eye of your mind focussed on the soul, whose nature is LOVE.3. Let a few minutes’ interlude then take place wherein you stabilise yourselffor the work, and definitely and consciously focus the light available, from allsources, within the heart centre. Imagine that centre between the shoulderblades as a radiant sun. I might here point out that this is, in the individual,the microcosmic correspondence to the “heart of the Sun” which is alwaysdirected by the “central spiritual Sun,” localised in the head. Get this pictureclearly into your consciousness, for it involves the dual, yet synthetic,activity of the head and the heart. [144]4. Then see a shaft of pure white light, broad and brilliant, pouring out of theheart centre between the shoulder blades, on to that localised glamour withwhich you, as a group, are dealing. What this localised area is, I willpresently disclose.5. When this is clearly defined in your mind and inspired by your desire andforce, and when you have the entire symbolic picture clearly visualised, thensee your particular shaft of light blended with the shafts of light which yourgroup brothers are projecting. Thus a great flood of directed light coming fromseveral trained aspirants (and are you trained, my brothers?) will pour on tothat area of glamour with which you are supposed to deal.6. Do this work for five carefully sustained minutes and then proceed asindicated in Stage IV of your meditation outline.In defining illumination as the antithesis of glamour it is obvious that myremarks must necessarily be limited to certain aspects of illumination and willonly concern those directed forms of work and those presentations of the problemwhich will concern the use of light upon the astral plane and particularly inconnection with the work that you have pledged yourselves to do. There are manyother definitions possible, for the light of the soul is like an immensesearchlight, the beams of which can be turned in many directions and focussed onmany levels. We are however only concerned here with its specialised use.Illumination and the light of knowledge can be regarded as synonymous terms andmany glamours can be dissipated and dispersed when subjected to the potency ofthe informative mind, for the mind is essentially the subduer of emotion throughthe presentation of fact. The problem is to [145] induce the individual or therace or nation which is acting under the influence of glamour to call in themental power of assessing the situation and subject it to a calm, cold scrutiny.Glamour and emotion play into each other’s hands and feeling runs so strongusually in relation to glamour that it is impossible to bring in the light ofknowledge with ease and effectiveness.Illumination and perception of truth are also synonymous terms, but it should beremembered that the truth in this case is not truth on the abstract planes butconcrete and knowable truth—truth which can be formulated and expressed inconcrete form and terms. Where the light of truth is called in, glamourautomatically disappears, even if only for a temporary period. But, again,difficulty arises because few people care to face the actual truth, for itinvolves eventually the abandonment of the beloved glamour and the ability torecognise error and to admit mistakes, and this the false pride of the mind willnot permit. Again, I would assure you that humility is one of the most potentfactors in releasing the illuminating power of the mind, as it reflects andtransmits the light of the soul. The determined facing of the factual life andthe stern recognition of truth—coldly, calmly and dispassionately—will greatlyfacilitate the calling in of the flood of illumination which will suffice todispel glamour.As we are dealing with the problem of glamour and illumination, it might be ofvalue here if I dealt with the particular glamour which I would ask your groupto aid in dispelling. I refer here to the glamour of separateness . Work alongthis line will have most practical and salutary implications, for none of you(as you will discover) will be able to work effectively on this matter if youfeel any sense of separativeness; this separative reaction may express itself ashatred, as an active dislike or as a voiced criticism—[146] perhaps, in somecases, all three. There are forces which you may personally regard asseparativeness or as the cause of separation. I would remind you that thefavourite views and cherished beliefs of those to whom you are mentally opposed(often under the guise of a strenuous adherence to what you regard as rightprinciples) are to those who hold them equally right; they feel that your viewsare erroneous and they regard them as separative in their effect and as thebasis of trouble. They are, in their place, as sincere as you are and as eagerfor the achievement of the right attitude as you feel yourself to be. This issomething often forgotten and I would remind you of it. I might also illustratethis point by pointing out to you that the hatred or the dislike (if hatred istoo strong a word) that any of you may feel for the activities of the GermanGovernment, and for the line that they have taken against the Jewish people,might be turned with almost equal justification against the Jews themselves. Thelatter have always been separative and have regarded themselves as “the chosenof the Lord” and have never proved assimilable in any nation. The same can besaid of the Germans, and from many they evoke the same reaction as they mete outto the Jew, though not the physical persecution. Neither attitude, as you wellknow, is justifiable from the angle of the soul; they are both equally wrong,and this is a point of view which the Jew and the anti-Jew must eventuallyunderstand and, through understanding, bring to an end.I mention this because I am going to ask you to deal with that ancient andworld-wide glamour—the glamour of the hatred of the Jew. In this group there arethose who are, in their thought at least, violently anti-German; there areothers who are definitely, though intelligently, anti-Jew. I would ask those inboth these groups to recognise the problem with which they are faced. It is aproblem which [147] is so very ancient and deeply rooted in the consciousness ofthe race that it is far bigger than the individual can possibly vision; theindividual point of view is consequently so limited that constructive usefulnessis noticeably impaired. After all, my brothers, the point of view of the “underdog” is not necessarily the only one or necessarily always the correct one. Boththe Germans and the Jews merit our impersonal love, particularly as they areboth guilty (if I may use such a term) of the same basic errors and faults. TheGerman is powerfully race conscious; so is the Jew. The German is separative inhis attitude to the world; so is the Jew. The German insists today on racialpurity, a thing upon which the Jew has insisted for centuries. A small group ofGermans are anti-Christian; so are an equally small number of Jews. I couldcontinue piling up these resemblances but the above will suffice. Therefore,your dislike of one group is not more warranted than your refusal to recogniseany justification for the activities and attitudes of the other. Like frequentlyrepudiates and swings away from like, and the Germans and the Jews are curiouslyalike. Just as many British people and the preponderance of the British race arereincarnated Romans, so many Germans are reincarnated Jews. Hence the similarityof their points of view. It is a family quarrel and there is nothing moreterrible than this.I am going to ask you to take the Germans and the Jews into your groupmeditation and pour out your group love upon both these divisions of yourbrothers in the human family. See to it that before you begin your meditationyou have freed yourselves—emotions and mind—from any latent antagonisms, fromany hatreds, from any preconceived ideas of right or wrong but that you simplyfall back upon the love of your souls, remembering that both [148] Jews andGermans are souls as you are and identical in their origin, their goal and theirlife experience with yours.As you pour out the stream of pure white light (as Stage III instructs you), seeto it that it pours through you with purity and clarity as one stream. Then seeit bisect into equal quantities or proportions—one stream of living light andlove going to the Jews and the other to the German peoples. The quality of yourlove will count and not so much the accuracy of your analysis or the perfectionof your technique.c. The Contrast between Maya and Inspiration.Here we come definitely into the realm of material substance. This isessentially and in a peculiar manner the realm of force. Maya is predominantly(for the individual) the aggregate of the forces which control his septenaryforce centres to the exclusion, I would emphasise, of the controlling energy ofthe soul. Therefore, you will see that the bulk of humanity, until a man standsupon the Probationary Path, are under the control of maya, for a man succumbs tomaya when he is controlled by any other force or forces than those energieswhich come direct from the soul, conditioning and controlling the lesser forcesof the personality as they eventually and inevitably must and will.When a man is under the control of physical, astral and mental forces, he isconvinced at the time that they are, for him, right forces. Herein lies theproblem of maya. Such forces, however, when they control a man, determine him ina separative attitude and produce an effect which feeds and stimulates thepersonality and does not bring in the energy of the soul, the trueIndividuality. This analysis should prove illuminating to you. If men and [149]women would bring their lives under a closer scrutiny by the true inner orspiritual man and could thus determine what combination of energies conditionstheir life activity, they would not continue to function—as they do now—soblindly, so inadequately and so ineffectually.It is for this reason that the study and understanding of motives is of suchvalue and importance, for such a study determines intellectually (if properlyinvestigated) what factor or factors inspires the daily life. This is astatement worth careful consideration. I would ask you: What is your majoractuating motive? For, whatever it may be, it conditions and determines yourpredominant life tendency.Many people, particularly the unintelligent masses, are solely inspired bydesire—material, physical and temporary. Animal desire for the satisfaction ofthe animal appetites, material desire for possession and for the luxuries ofexistence, the longing for “things,” for comforts and for security—economic,social and religious—control the majority. The man is under the influence of thedensest form of maya, and the forces of his nature are concentrated in thesacral centre. Others are motivated by some form of aspiration orambition—aspiration towards some material heaven (and most religions portrayheaven in this manner), ambitions for power, desire for the satisfaction of theemotional or aesthetic appetites and for the possession of the more subtlerealities, and the longing for emotional comfort, for mental stability andassurance that the higher desires will meet with gratification. All this is mayain its emotional form, and it is not the same thing as glamour. In the case ofglamour, the forces of a man’s nature are seated in the solar plexus. In thecase of maya, they are seated in the sacral centre. Glamour is subtle andemotional. Maya is tangible and etheric.[150] Such are the forces of maya which actuate, motivate and energise the lifeof the ordinary man. Under their influence he is helpless for they inspire allhis thinking, all his aspiration and his desire, and all his activity on thephysical plane. His problem is twofold:1. To bring all his centres under the inspiration of the soul.2. To transfer or transmute the forces of the lower centres, which control thepersonality, into the energies of the centres above the diaphragm, which respondautomatically to the inspiration of the soul.It is in this thought that the potency and the symbolic value of breathingexercises consists. The motive is soul control, and though the methods employedare (in many cases) definitely undesirable yet the developing tendency of thelife thought will prove inevitably determining and conditioning. The methodsused may not save the unprepared physical body from certain evil and disastrousresults yet, in the long run and in the last analysis, they may condition thefuture experience (probably in another life) in such a manner that the aspirantwill find himself more able to function as a soul than might otherwise have beenthe case.Before I close this particular instruction upon glamour, I would like to callthe attention of the group to the occult sentences which I gave to D.L.R. priorto his leaving the group. They have a definite relation to the group work and Iwould like you to give them careful consideration and study. The Old Commentary, in speaking of the work of those whose dharma it is to dissipate worldglamour, uses the following illuminating sentences:“They come and stand. Within the midst of whirling forms—some of beauty rare andsome of [151] horror and despair—they stand. They look not here or there but,with their faces turned towards the light, they stand. Thus through their mindsthe pure light streams to dissipate the fogs.“They come and rest. They cease their outer labours, pausing to do a differentwork. Within their hearts is rest. They run not here and there, but constitute apoint of peace and rest. That which upon the surface veils and hides the realbegins to disappear and from the heart at rest a beam of dissipating forceprojects, blends with the shining light and then the mists of man’s creationdisappear.“They come and they observe. They own the eye of vision; likewise they own theright direction of the needed force. They see the glamour of the world, andseeing, they note behind it all the true, the beautiful, the real. Thus throughthe eye of Buddhi comes the power to drive away the veiling, swirling glamoursof that glamorous world.“They stand, they rest, and they observe. Such are their lives and such theservice that they render to the souls of men.”I would commend these lines to your careful thought. They convey to you not onlythe field of your group service but also the desired attitude of the personallife of every member of the group.I would also like, at this point, to touch upon a factor of real importance inthis work and to repeat my earlier warning: Will you remember that the effort tofree yourselves from irritation or from what is called in Agni Yoga “imperil” (apeculiar yet satisfying word, my brothers) is particularly essential for thisgroup? Irritation is exceedingly prevalent these days of nervous tension and itmost [152] definitely imperils progress and retards the steps of the discipleupon the Way. It can produce dangerous group tension if present in any of you,and this induced group tension can interfere with the free play of the power andlight which you are supposed to use, even when the other group members remainunconscious of the emanating source. Irritation definitely generates a poisonwhich locates itself in the region of the stomach and of the solar plexus.Irritation is a disease, if I might use that word, of the solar plexus centreand it is definitely contagious to an almost alarming extent. So, my brothers,watch yourselves with care and remember that just in so far as you can live inthe head and in the heart, you will end the disease of imperil and aid in thetransference of the forces of the solar plexus into the heart centre.d. The Contrast between the Dweller and its opposite, the Angel of the Presence.The entire subject of the Dweller and its relation to the Angel (a symbolic wayof dealing with a great relationship and possibility, and a great fact inmanifestation) is only now possible of consideration. Only when man is anintegrated personality does the problem of the Dweller truly arise, and onlywhen the mind is alert and the intelligence organised (as is becoming the casetoday on a fairly large scale) is it possible for man to sense—intelligently andnot just mystically—the Angel and so intuit the PRESENCE. Only then does theentire question of hindrances which the Dweller embodies, and the limitationswhich it provides to spiritual contact and realisation assume potentproportions. Only then can they be usefully considered and steps taken to induceright action. Only when there is adequate fusion within humanity as a whole does[153] the great human Dweller on the Threshold appear as an integrated entity,or the Dweller in a national or racial sense makes its appearance, spreading andvitalising national, racial and planetary glamour, fostering and feedingindividual glamours and making the entire problem unmistakably apparent. Onlythen can the relation between the soul of humanity and the generated forces ofits ancient and potent personality assume proportions which call for drasticactivity and intelligent cooperation.Such a time has now come, and in the two books, Problems of Humanity and TheReappearance of the Christ , and also in the Wesak and June Full Moon messages,I have dealt with this most practical and urgent situation, which is in itselfthe guarantee of human progress toward its destined goal as well as theassertion of its major hindrances to spiritual realisation. The sections onwhich we shall now be engaged are of prime importance to all who are in trainingfor initiation. I said “in training,” my brothers; I did not say that you wouldtake initiation in this life. I know not myself whether you will or no; theissue lies in your hands and in your planned destiny—planned by your souls. Yourproblem is essentially that of learning to handle the Dweller on the Thresholdand of ascertaining the procedures and the processes whereby the momentousactivity of fusion can take place. Through the medium of this fusion the Dweller“disappears and is no more seen, though still he functions on the outer plane,the agent of the Angel; the light absorbs the Dweller, and intoobscuration—radiant yet magnetic—this ancient form of life dissolves thoughkeeping still its form; it rests and works but is not now itself.” Such are theparadoxical statements of the Old Commentary .I have earlier defined for you in as simple terms as possible the nature of theDweller. I would like, however, [154] to enlarge upon one or two points and giveone or two new suggestions which—for the sake of clarity and for your more rapidcomprehension—we will tabulate as follows:1. The Dweller on the Threshold is essentially the personality; it is anintegrated unity composed of physical forces, vital energy, astral forces andmental energies, constituting the sum total of the lower nature.2. The Dweller takes form when a re-orientation of man’s life has taken placeconsciously and under soul impression; the whole personality is thentheoretically directed towards liberation into service . The problem is to makethe theory and the aspiration facts in experience.3. For a great length of time the forces of the personality do not constitute aDweller. The man is not on the threshold of divinity; he is not consciouslyaware of the Angel. His forces are inchoate; he works unconsciously in hisenvironment, the victim of circumstance and of his own nature apparently andunder the lure and the urge of desire for physical plane activity and existence.When, however, the life of the man is ruled from the mental plane, plus desireor ambition, and he is controlled at least to some large extent by mentalinfluence, then the Dweller begins to take shape as a unified force.4. The stages wherein the Dweller on the Threshold is recognised, subjected to adiscriminating discipline and finally controlled and mastered, are mainly three:a. The stage wherein the personality dominates and rules the life and ambitionsand the goals of man’s life-endeavour. The Dweller then controls.b. The stage of a growing cleavage in the consciousness [155] of the disciple.The Dweller or the personality is then urged in two directions: one, towards thepursuit of personal ambitions and desires in the three worlds; the other, inwhich the effort is made by the Dweller (note this statement) to take a standupon the threshold of divinity and before the Portal of Initiation.c. The stage wherein the Dweller consciously seeks the cooperation of the souland, though still in itself essentially constituting a barrier to spiritualprogress, is more and more influenced by the soul than by its lower nature.5. When the final stage is reached (and many are now reaching it today) thedisciple strives with more or less success to steady the Dweller (by learning to“hold the mind steady in the light” and thus controlling the lower nature). Inthis way the constant fluid changefulness of the Dweller is gradually overcome;its orientation towards reality and away from the Great Illusion is madeeffective, and the Angel and the Dweller are slowly brought into a closerapport.6. In the earlier stages of effort and of attempted control, the Dweller ispositive and the Soul is negative in their effects in the three worlds of humanendeavour. Then there is a period of oscillation, leading to a life ofequilibrium wherein neither aspect appears to dominate; after that the balancechanges and the personality steadily becomes negative and the soul or psychebecomes dominant and positive.7. The astrological influences can potently affect these situations and—speakinggenerally and within certain esoteric limits—it might be noted that: [156]a. Leo controls the positive Dweller. b. Gemini controls the processes ofoscillation. c. Sagittarius controls the negative Dweller.It might be added that the three signs—Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn—leadfinally to the fusion of the Dweller and the Angel.8. The soul ray controls and conditions the activity of the Angel and its typeof influence upon the Dweller. It affects karma, times and seasons.9. The personality ray controls the Dweller in all the earlier states and up tothe time when the soul ray begins steadily to produce a growing effect. Thispersonality ray is, as you know, a combination of three energies which producethe fourth or personality ray, through the medium of their inter-relation over avast period of time.10. Therefore, the five types of energy which I indicated to you as ofimportance in your own lives when I gave you indications as to the nature ofyour five controlling rays, govern also the relation between the Dweller and theAngel, both in the individual and in humanity as a whole. These five are therays of the physical body, the astral ray, the mind ray, the personality ray andthe soul ray.11. The rays which govern humanity and which condition humanity and the presentworld problem are as follows:a. The Soul ray 2nd humanity must express love. b. The personality ray 3rddeveloping intelligence for transmutation into love-wisdom. c. Mind ray 5thscientific achievement. d. Astral ray 6th idealistic development. e. Physicalray 7th organisation. Business.[157] The soul ray controls for an entire life period. The personality raysgiven above are for the Piscean Age which is now beginning to pass out; butthese have definitely and irrevocably conditioned humanity.You will note also that the first Ray of Will or Power is missing as is thefourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict. This fourth ray is always active as itcontrols in a peculiar manner the fourth creative Hierarchy and might beregarded as forming the basic personality ray of the fourth creative Hierarchy.The one given above is a transient and fleeting personality ray of a minorincarnation.12. In the Aquarian Age which is rapidly coming, the Dweller will presentslightly different personality forces:a. Personality ray 5th basic and determining. b. Mind ray 4th the creativeeffect. c. Astral ray 6th conditioning incentives. d. Physical ray 7th incomingray.13. Each great cycle in the zodiac is in the nature of an incarnation of thehuman family, and each great race is a somewhat similar happening; the latteris, however, of more importance where the human understanding and consciousnessis concerned. The analogy is to the few important incarnations in the life ofthe soul in contra-distinction to the many unimportant and rapidly succeedingincarnations. Of the important incarnations there are three which are of majorimport: the Lemurian, the Atlantean, and the Aryan races.14. Each race produced its own type of Dweller on the Threshold who was faced atthe close of the spiritual cycle (not the physical which goes on tocrystallisation) [158] when maturity was achieved and a certain initiationbecame possible for its advanced humanity.15. When a racial incarnation and a zodiacal cycle synchronise (which is notalways the case) then there comes a significant and important focussing of theattention of the Dweller on the Angel and vice versa. This is taking place atthis time at the close of the Piscean era and when the Aryan race has reachedmaturity and a relatively high water mark of development. Discipleship issignificant of maturity, and it is with mature development that the Dweller ismet. The Aryan race is ready for discipleship.16. The development of sensitivity in the individual and in the race indicatesthe imminence of the recognition of the Angel from both angles of vision and theimmediacy of the opportunity. This opportunity for active fusion has never beenso true as now.17. The lines of demarcation as existing between the recognised areas ofinfluence between the Dweller and the Angel are clearer than ever before in thehistory of the race. Man knows the difference between right and wrong and mustnow choose the way that he shall go. In the Atlantean racial crisis (which wasalso a complete human crisis), the history of which is perpetuated for us in theBhagavad Gita, Arjuna—symbol of the then disciple and the world disciple—wasfrankly bewildered. This is not so true now. The disciples of the world and theworld disciple do see the issues today relatively quite clearly. Will expediencywin or will the Dweller be sacrificed with love and understanding to the Angel?This is the major problem.[159] I will ask you, my brother, to do two things: study the above ideas in thelight of the present world crisis, and in the light of your own soul-personalityproblem.Advanced humanity stands, as the Dweller, on the very threshold of divinity. TheAngel stands expectant—absorbed in the PRESENCE yet ready to absorb the Dweller.Humanity has advanced in consciousness to the very boundaries of the world ofspiritual values and the kingdom of Light and of God. The Angel has “come toEarth” in expectation of recognition—an event of which the advent of Christ twothousand years ago was the symbol and the precursor. This is the situation whereall advanced aspirants are concerned. It can be yours. It is the situation alsowhere humanity as a whole is concerned and the approaching Hierarchy. Theconsciousness of humanity from the higher and spiritual standpoint functionstoday through the steadily growing band of world servers, world aspirants andworld disciples, and their name is Legion.Humanity today is the Dweller whilst the Hierarchy of Souls is the Angel andbehind stands the PRESENCE of Divinity Itself, intuited by the Hierarchy anddimly sensed by humanity but providing in this manner that threefold synthesiswhich is divine manifestation in form.All these three have powerful emanations (though the emanation of the PRESENCEvia Shamballa has been wisely held in leash since the human race came intobeing). They all have auras, if you care so to call them, and in the threeworlds at present that of the Dweller is still the most powerful, just as in thelife of the aspirant, his personality is as yet the dominant predisposingfactor. It is this powerful human emanation which constitutes the major glamourin the life of humanity and of the individual disciple. It is a synthesis ofglamour, fused and blended by the personality ray but precipitated by the effectof the steadily influencing soul ray. It [160] is the shadow or distortion ofreality, now sensed for the first time on a large scale by the race of men andthrown into high relief by the light which shines from the Angel, thetransmitter of energy from the PRESENCE.And so they stand—Humanity and the Hierarchy. And so you stand, my brother,personality and soul, with freedom to go forward into the light if you sodetermine or to remain static and unprogressive, learning nothing and gettingnowhere; you are equally free to return to identification with the Dweller,negating thus the influence of the Angel, refusing imminent opportunity andpostponing—until a much later cycle—your determining choice. This is true of youand of Humanity as a whole. Will humanity’s third ray materialistic personalitydominate the present situation or will its soul of love prove the most powerfulfactor, taking hold of the personality and its little issues, leading it todiscriminate rightly and to recognise the true values and thus bring in the ageof soul or hierarchical control? Time alone will show.I will give you no more today. I am anxious for these few essential statementsto be mastered by all of you, prior to our taking up Section III. I am anxioustoo for the general group instructions, which you have lately received, to takemuch of your time, interest and attention. Inner group adjustments and morefirmly established group relations are urgently needed and upon these I ask youto work. I would remind you here also that—as in all else in manifestation—thereis a group personality and a group soul; you must learn clearly to distinguishbetween the two and to throw the entire weight of your influence, desire andpressure on the side of the Group Angel. In this way there might occur thatstupendous recognition for which all initiation prepares the applicant—therevelation of the PRESENCE."},{"pageContent":"SECTION THREE: THE ENDING OF GLAMOUR[161] We come now to the consideration of the third section relating to worldglamour. It is difficult to write clearly about this matter because we are inthe midst of its most concentrated expression—the worst the world has ever seenbecause glamour, incident to centuries of greed and selfishness, of aggressionand materialism, has been focussed in a triplicity of nations. It is, therefore,easily to be seen and most effective in manifestation. Three nations express thethree aspects of world glamour (illusion, glamour and maya) in an amazingmanner, and their powerful assault upon the consciousness of humanity isdependent not only upon the response of Germany, Japan and Italy to this ancientmiasma but also upon the fact that every nation—United Nations as well asTotalitarian Nations—are tainted with this universal condition. The freedom ofthe world is consequently largely dependent upon those people in every nationwho (within themselves) have moved forward out of one or other of these“glamorous illusions and mayavic impressions” of the human soul into a state ofawareness wherein they can see the conflict in its wider terms, i.e., as thatexisting for them between the Dweller on the Threshold and the Angel of thePRESENCE.These people are the aspirants, disciples and initiates of the world. They areaware of the dualism, the essential dualism, of the conflict and are not sopre-eminently conscious of the threefold nature and the differentiated conditionof the situation which underlies the realised dualism. [162] Their approach tothe problem is therefore simpler and, because of this, world direction lieslargely in their hands at this time.It is right here that religion has, as a whole, gone astray. I refer to orthodoxreligion. It has been preoccupied with the Dweller on the Threshold and the eyesof the theologian have been held upon the material, phenomenal aspect of lifethrough fear and its immediacy, and the fact of the Angel has been a theory anda point of wishful thinking. The balance is being adjusted by the humanitarianattitudes which are so largely coming into control, irrespective of anytheological trend. These attitudes take their stand upon the belief of theinnate rightness of the human spirit, in the divinity of man, and upon theindestructible nature of the soul of mankind. This inevitably brings in theconcept of the PRESENCE, or of God Immanent and is the result of the neededrevolt against the belief in God Transcendent. This spiritual revolution wasentirely a balancing process and need cause no basic concern, for GodTranscendent eternally exists but can only be seen and known and correctlyapproached by God Immanent—immanent in individual man, in groups and nations, inorganised forms and in religion, in humanity as a whole and in the planetaryLife Itself. Humanity is today (and has been for ages) battling illusion,glamour and maya. Advanced thinkers, those upon the Probationary Path, upon thePath of Discipleship, and the Path of Initiation have reached a point wherematerialism and spirituality, the Dweller on the Threshold and the Angel of thePRESENCE, and the basic dualism of manifestation can be seen clearly defined.Because of this clarity of demarcation, the issues underlying the present worldevents, the objectives of the present world-wide struggle, the modes and methodsof re-establishing the spiritual contact so prevalent in Atlantean [163] daysand so long lost, and the recognition of the techniques which can bring in thenew world era and its cultural order can be clearly noted and appraised.All generalisations admit of error. It might, however, be said that Germany hasfocussed in herself world glamour—the most potent and expressive of the threeaspects of glamour. Japan is manifesting the force of maya—the crudest form ofmaterial force. Italy, individualistic and mentally polarised, is the expressionof world illusion. The United Nations, with all their faults, limitations,weaknesses and nationalisms, are focussing the conflict between the Dweller andthe Angel, and thus the three forms of glamour and the final form of theconflict between the spiritual ideal and its material opponent are appearingsimultaneously. The United Nations are, however, gradually and most decisivelythrowing the weight of their effort and aspiration on to the side of the Angel,thus restoring the lost balance and slowly producing on a planetary scale thoseattributes and conditions which will eventually dispel illusion, dissipateglamour and devitalise the prevalent maya. This they are doing by the increasedclear thinking of the general public of all the nations, bound together toconquer the three Axis Powers, by their growing ability to conceive ideas interms of the whole, in terms of a desirable world order or federation, and theircapacity to discriminate between the Forces of Light and the potency of evil ormaterialism.The work being done by those who see the world stage as the arena for theconflict between the Dweller on the Threshold and the Angel of the PRESENCEmight be itemised as:1. The producing of those world conditions in which the Forces of Light canovercome the Forces of Evil. This they do by the weight of their armed forces,plus their clear insight. [164]2. The educating of humanity in the distinction between:a. Spirituality and materialism, pointing to the differing goals of thecombatant forces.b. Sharing and greed, outlining a future world wherein the Four Freedoms will bedominant and all will have that which is needed for right living-processes.c. Light and dark, demonstrating the difference between an illumined future ofliberty and opportunity, and the dark future of slavery.d. Fellowship and separation, indicating a world order where racial hatreds,caste distinctions and religious differences will form no barrier tointernational understanding, and the Axis order of master races, determinedreligious attitudes, and enslaved peoples.e. The whole and the part, pointing to the time which is approaching (under theevolutionary urge of spirit) wherein the part or the point of life assumes itsresponsibility for the whole, and the whole exists for the good of the part.The dark aspect has been brought about by ages of glamour. The light is beingemphasised and made clear by the world aspirants and disciples who by theirattitudes, their actions, their writings and their utterances are bringing thelight into dark places.3. Preparing the way for the three spiritual energies which will sweep humanityinto an era of comprehension, leading to a focussed mental clarification ofmen’s minds throughout the world. These three imminent energies are: [165]a. The energy of the intuition which will gradually dispel world illusion, andproduce automatically a great augmentation of the ranks of the initiates.b. The activity of light which will dissipate, by the energy of illumination ,the world glamour and bring many thousands on to the Path of Discipleship.c. The energy of inspiration which will bring about, through the medium of itssweeping potency, the devitalisation or the removal, as by a wind, of theattractive power of maya or substance. This will release untold thousands on tothe Path of Probation.4. Releasing new life into the planet through the medium of every possibleagency. The first step towards this release is the proving that the power ofmaterialism is broken by the complete defeat of the Axis Powers and, secondly,by the ability of the United Nations to demonstrate (when this has been done)the potency of the spiritual values by their constructive undertakings torestore world order and to lay those foundations which will guarantee a betterand more spiritual way of life. These constructive attitudes and undertakingsmust be assumed individually by every person, and by nations as collectivewholes. The first is being undertaken at this time. The second remains as yet tobe done.5. Bringing home to the nations of the world the truths taught by the Buddha,the Lord of Light, and the Christ, the Lord of Love. In this connection it mightbe pointed out that basically:a. The Axis nations need to grasp the teaching of the Buddha as He enunciated itin the Four Noble [166] Truths; they need to realise that the cause of allsorrow and woe is desire—desire for that which is material.b. The United Nations need to learn to apply the Law of Love as enunciated inthe life of Christ and to express the truth that “no man liveth unto himself”and no nation either, and that the goal of all human effort is lovingunderstanding , prompted by a programme of love for the whole.If the lives and teachings of these two great Avatars can be comprehended andwrought out anew in the lives of men today, in the world of human affairs, inthe realm of human thinking and in the arena of daily living, the present worldorder (which is today largely disorder) can be so modified and changed that anew world and a new race of men can gradually come into being. Renunciation andthe use of the sacrificial will should be the keynote for the interim periodafter the war, prior to the inauguration of the New Age.Students need to remember that all manifestations and every point of crisis aresymbolised by the ancient symbol of a point within the circle, the focus ofpower within a sphere of influence or aura. So it is today with the entireproblem of ending the world glamour and illusion which fundamentally lie behindthe present acute situation and world catastrophe. The possibility of such adispelling and dissipation is definitely centred in the two Avatars, the Buddhaand the Christ.Within the world of glamour—the world of the astral plane and of theemotions—appeared a point of light. The Lord of Light, the Buddha, undertook tofocus in Himself the illumination which would eventually make possible thedissipation of glamour. Within the world of illusion—the world of the mentalplane—appeared the Christ, the Lord [167] of Love Himself, Who embodied inHimself the power of the attractive will of God. He undertook to dispel illusionby drawing to Himself (by the potency of love) the hearts of all men, and statedthis determination in the words, “I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men untoMe.” (John 12:32) From the point they then will have reached, the world ofspiritual perception, of truth and of divine ideas will stand revealed. Theresult will be the disappearing of illusion.The combined work of these two great Sons of God, concentrated through the worlddisciples and through Their initiates must and will inevitably shatter illusionand dispel glamour—the one by the intuitive recognition of reality by mindsattuned to it, and the other by the pouring in of the light of reason. TheBuddha made the first planetary effort to dissipate world glamour; the Christmade the first planetary effort towards the dispelling of illusion. Their workmust now be intelligently carried forward by a humanity wise enough to recogniseits dharma. Men are being rapidly disillusioned and will consequently see moreclearly. The world glamour is being steadily removed from the ways of men. Thesetwo developments have been brought about by the incoming new ideas, focussedthrough the world intuitives and released to the general public by the worldthinkers. It has been also largely aided by the well-nigh unconscious, but nonethe less real, recognition of the true meaning of these Four Noble Truths by themasses. Disillusioned and de-glamoured (if I may use such a term), humanityawaits the coming revelation. This revelation will be brought about by thecombined efforts of the Buddha and the Christ. All that we can foresee orforetell anent that revelation is that some potent and far-reaching results willbe achieved by the merging of light and love, and by the reaction of “lightedsubstance to the attractive power of love.” In this sentence I have given thosewho can understand [168] a profound and useful hint as to the method and purposeof the undertaking which was staged for the June Full Moon, 1942. I have alsogiven a clue to the true understanding of the work of these Avatars—a thinghitherto quite unrealised. It might be added that when an appreciation of themeaning of the words “transfiguration of a human being” is gained, therealisation will come that when “the body is full of light” then “in that lightshall we see LIGHT.” This means that when the personality has reached a point ofpurification, of dedication and of illumination, then the attractive power ofthe soul (whose nature is love and understanding) can function, and fusion ofthese two will take place. This is what the Christ proved and demonstrated.When the work of the Buddha (or the embodied buddhic principle) is consummatedin the aspiring disciple and in his integrated personality, then the fullexpression of the work of the Christ (the embodied principle of love) can alsobe consummated and both these potencies—light and love—will find radiantexpression in the transfigured disciple. What is true, therefore, of theindividual is true also of humanity as a whole, and today humanity (havingreached maturity) can “enter into realisation” and consciously take part in thework of enlightenment and of spiritual, loving activity. The practical effectsof this process will be the dissipation of glamour and the release of the humanspirit from the thraldom of matter; it will produce, also, the dispelling ofillusion and the recognition of truth as it exists in the consciousness of thosewho are polarised in the “awareness of the Christ.”This is necessarily no rapid process but is an ordered and regulated procedure,sure in its eventual success but relatively slow also in its establishment andsequential process. This process was initiated upon the astral plane [169] bythe Buddha, and on the mental plane when Christ manifested on Earth. Itindicated the approaching maturity of humanity. The process has been slowlygathering momentum as these two great Beings have gathered around Them Theirdisciples and initiates during the past two thousand years. It has reached apoint of intensive usefulness as the channel of communication between Shamballaand the Hierarchy has been opened and enlarged, and as the contact between thesetwo great Centres and Humanity has been more firmly established.At the June Full Moon, 1942, the first test as to the directness of thecommunication between the Centre where the Will of God holds sway, the Centrewhere the Love of God rules, and the Centre where there is intelligentexpectancy was made. The medium of the test was the united effort of the Christ,of the Buddha, and of those who responded to Their blended influence. This testhad to be carried out in the midst of the terrific onslaught of the powers ofevil and was extended over the two weeks beginning on the day of the Full Moon(May 30th 1942) and ending on June 15th 1942. There was a great concentration ofthe Spiritual Forces at that time, and the use of a special Invocation (onewhich humanity itself may not use), but the success or failure of the test was,in the last analysis, determined by mankind itself.You may feel, though wrongly, that not enough people know about or understandthe nature of the opportunity or what is transpiring. But the success of such atest is not dependent upon the esoteric knowledge of the few, the relativelyfew, to whom the facts and the information have been partially imparted. It isdependent also upon the tendency of the many who unconsciously aspire towardsthe spiritual realities, who seek for a new and better way of life for all, whodesire the good of the whole and whose [170] longing and desire is for a trueexperience of goodness, of right human relations and of spiritual enterpriseamong men. Their name is Legion and they are to be found in every nation.When the Will of God, expressed in Shamballa and focussed in the Buddha, theLove of God, expressed in the Hierarchy and focussed through the Christ, and theintelligent desire of humanity, focussed through the world disciples, the worldaspirants and the men of goodwill are all brought into line—either consciouslyor unconsciously—then a great re-orientation can and will take place. This eventis something that can happen.The first result will be the illumination of the astral plane and the beginningof the process which will dissipate glamour; the second result will be theirradiation of the mental plane and the dispelling of all past illusions and thegradual revelation of the new truths of which all past ideals and so-calledformulations of truth have only been the signposts. Ponder on that statement.The signpost indicates the way to go; it does not reveal the goal. It isindicative but not conclusive. So with all truth up to the present time.The demand is, therefore, for knowers and for those whose minds and hearts areopen; who are free from preconceived ideas fanatically held, and from ancientidealisms which must be recognised as only partial indications of greatunrealised truths—truths which can be realised in great measure and for thefirst time IF the lessons of the present world situation and the catastrophe ofthe war are duly learned and the sacrificial will is called into play.I have made this practical application and the immediate illustration of theteaching anent glamour, illusion and maya because the whole world problem hasreached a crisis today and because its clarification will be the outstandingtheme [171] of all progress—educational, religious and economic—until 2025 A.D.In the section with which we are now concerned we shall consider the practicalways in which illusion, glamour and the power of maya can be brought to an endin the life of the individual, and eventually in the life of nations and finallyin the world. Always we must begin with the unity of life, the Microcosm; then,having grasped process and progress in connection with the individual, the ideacan then be extended to the group, the organisation, the nation, and to humanityas a whole. Thus gradually we shall approach the great Idea to which we give thename of God, the Macrocosm.We shall in this section deal with techniques, and these might be summarised asfollows:1. The Technique of the Presence. By means of this technique, the soul assumescontrol of the integrated personality and of its relations, horizontal andvertical. This technique involves the unfolding of the flower of the intuition,dispelling illusion, revealing the Angel, indicating the Presence, and openingup to the disciple the world of ideas and the door of the higher initiations.Through the disciple’s grasp and application of these divine ideas or seedthoughts, he becomes initiate and the third initiation becomes possible as animmediate goal. The intuition is the applied power of transfiguration . Thistechnique is related to the little known yoga called Agni Yoga or the yoga offire.2. The Technique of Light. By means of this technique, the illumined mindassumes control over the astral or emotional body and dissipates glamour. Whenlight pours in, glamour fades out. Illumination dominates and the vision [172]of reality can be seen. This technique is related to Raja Yoga and its goal isthe second initiation; it produces ability to tread the Path of Discipleship,and enables the man to “live a life, enlightened by divinity.” Illumination isthe applied power of transformation.3. The Technique of Indifference. By means of this technique, maya is ended; forthe control of the purified astral vehicle is consciously and technicallybrought into activity, producing the freeing of the energies of the etheric bodyfrom the control of matter or force-substance, and bringing men in large numberson to the Probationary Path. Where there is “divine indifference” to the call orpull of matter, then inspiration becomes possible. This technique is related toKarma Yoga in its most practical form and the use of matter with completeimpersonality. The goal of this technique is the first initiation, which enablesman to “live a life, inspired by God.” Inspiration is the applied power oftransmission .1. THE TECHNIQUE OF THE PRESENCE.As we enter upon our consideration of this subject, the student has three thingsto bear in mind: the existence of the Intuition, the fact of Illusion, and theovershadowing Presence. This Presence is revealed by the intuition through themedium of the Angel and, when revealed and recognised, brings illusion to anend.The story of illusion is one which must not be confounded with glamour; illusionis related to the whole process of revelation. Glamour can be and often isrelated to the distortion of that which has been revealed, but it must be bornein mind that illusion is primarily concerned with the reaction of the mind tothe unfolding revelation, [173] as the soul registers it and seeks to impress iton the highest aspect of the personal lower self. Illusion is, therefore, thefailure of the mind correctly to register, to interpret or translate that whichhas been transmitted and it is consequently a sin (if you care for that word) ofthe intelligent and highly developed people, of those who stand on the Path andwho are in process of becoming rightly oriented; it is also a sin of accepteddisciples as they seek to expand their consciousness in response to soulcontact. When they have “seen through illusion” (and I use this phrase in itsesoteric sense) then they are ready for the third initiation.Our theme is, therefore, the theme of revelation and I would like to make somegeneral remarks upon the subject, because thereby the problem of world illusioncan be clarified and incidentally individual illusion also.The unfoldment of human awareness has been progressive down the ages, and hasbeen dependent upon two major and related factors:1. The factor of the gradual development of the human mind through the processesof evolution itself. This might be regarded as the innate capacity of that whichwe call the mind, the chitta, or mind stuff, to become more and more sensitiveto the impact of the phenomenal world, and to the impression from the higherworlds of being. The mind is the instrument which registers the process of“becoming” but it is also—during the later stages of human unfoldment—capable ofregistering the nature or function of being . Becoming is revealed through themedium of the intellect; Being, through the medium of the intuition. In allstudy of illusion, the instrumental nature of the mind must be remembered andits power to register accurately, to interpret [174] and transmit knowledgecoming from the world of phenomena and wisdom from the realm of the soul.2. The factor of the method whereby humanity is made aware of that which is notimmediately apparent. This is the method or process of what has been called“imposed revelation” or the impression conveyed to minds capable of reception ofthose ideas, beings, plans and purposes which exist behind the scenes, so tospeak, and which are (in the last analysis) the factors which determine andcondition the world process. These revelations or subjective, vital impressionsare revealed by the intuition and have nothing to do with the knowledges,impressions and impacts which are related to the three worlds of humanevolution, except in so far that (when grasped and apprehended) they havesteadily transformed man’s way of living, revealed to him his goals, andindicated his true nature. The revelations given throughout the ages andimpressed on the minds of those trained to receive them deal with the greatuniversals, are concerned with the whole, and lead to a developed appreciationof the oneness of life and with hylozoistic expression.Two paralleling processes have produced humanity and its civilisation: One isthe evolutionary process itself whereby the mind of the individual has beengradually unfolded until it becomes the dominant aspect in the personality; andat the same time a graded, wisely imparted series of revelations which have ledhumanity as a whole nearer to the inevitable apprehension of being; they haveled him steadily away from identification with form and into those states ofconsciousness which are super-normal from the ordinary human angle but entirelynormal from the spiritual.[175] Putting this concept specifically into occult terminology: Individualityhas led to the steady perfecting of the mind with its perception, apprehension,analysis and interpretation whilst initiation , through the growth of theintuition, brings about (when the mental perfecting process has reached arelatively high degree of development) the apprehension of the world ofspiritual values, of unified being and of intuitive understanding. This involvesa consequent moving of the point of individual focus out of the world ofphenomena into the world of reality. The lower use of the mind and its processesof unfoldment have produced illusion whilst the unfoldment of the higher mindand, later, its use as the transmitter of the intuition and of the higherrevelation, will produce the transfiguration of the three worlds of phenomena interms of the world of being.Illusion is frequently misinterpreted and misapplied mental perception of truth.It has naught to do with the mental phase of glamour, though illusion can becarried down into the world of feeling and become glamour. When this happens,its potency is exceedingly great because a thoughtform has become an entity,with vital power, and the magnetic power of feeling is added to the cold form ofthought. Ponder on this. But at the stage with which we are now dealing, whichis that of pure illusion, a revelation has precipitated upon the mental planeand—owing to failure rightly to apprehend and interpret it or to apply itusefully—it has developed into an illusion and enters upon a career ofdeception, of crystallisation and of misinformation.The theme of this technique is, therefore, concerned primarily with:1. The process of revelation. This process has been and today is the maintestimony and guarantee of the existence, [176] behind the scenes of thephenomenal life, of a revealing Group or Agency whose task is of a triplenature:a. To gauge the unfoldment of the human consciousness and to meet its constantappeal and demand for further light and knowledge.b. To judge what is the next needed revelation and what form it should take,through what medium it should emerge, and where and when it should appear.c. To ascertain with what obstructions, hindrances, and preconceived ideas thenew incoming revelation will have to contend.2. The fact of the Presence. This Presence is the impelling force behind allrevelation and is in reality God Immanent, striving ever for recognition andItself impelled thereto by the fact of God Transcendent.3. The influence of the Ange l, who is the individualised seed of consciousnessthrough whom, after due growth and response of the personal lower self, willcome the revelation of the Presence. All true revelation is concerned with theunfolding glory of divinity in some field of expression, thereby testifying tothe latent hidden Presence.4. The reaction of the intuitives throughout the world to that revelation andthe form in which they present it to the world thinkers. These latter are everthe first to appreciate and appropriate the new truth. The intuitives presentthe next phase of truth in a relatively pure form even though at the time ofpresentation it may be symbolically veiled. [177]5. The response of the thinking world to the presented truth. It is at thispoint that illusion appears and misinterpretation and misrepresentation takeplace. These untrue interpretations of revealed truth, when they have lastedlong enough and have acquired momentum, add to the general illusion and becomepart of it and thus feed and are fed by the world illusion. This is the built-upillusory form of thought, developed down the ages, which controls so much of themass belief. When the revelation reaches this stage, the mass of men becomeinvolved; they recognise the illusion as the truth; they regard this illusion asreality; they fail to grasp the significance of the veiled, symbolicallypresented revelation but confuse it with the illusory presentation, and thus theintuitively perceived revelation becomes a distorted, twisted doctrine.Theological interpretations and dogmas fall into this category and there ensuesa re-enactment of the ancient drama of the blind leading the blind, to whichChrist referred as He faced the theologians of His time.The above statements are true of all revelation as it comes forth from theemanating centre of light, whether they concern so-called religious truth orscientific discoveries or the great standard of spiritual values wherebyadvanced humanity of both hemispheres seek to live and which, from time to time,move on a step in significance and in importance.a. Intuition dispels Individual IllusionToday we have reached a crisis in the field of human apprehension and can nowenter into a new era wherein illusion can be dispelled and thinkers can begin toregister accurately and without misapprehension that which the intuitives conveyto them. This statement does not as yet apply to the [178] general public. Itwill be a long time before they will respond without illusion, because illusionis based upon the thoughtform-building activity of the lower mind. The massesare just beginning to use that lower mind and illusion is, therefore, for them anecessary stage of testing and training and one through which they must pass orthey will lose much valuable experience, leaving undeveloped their powers ofdiscrimination. This is a point which all teachers of occultism should have inmind. It is essential consequently that the masses are taught the significanceof illusion and be trained to see and choose the kernel of pure truth in anypresentation of truth with which they may be confronted. It is essentiallikewise that the world intuitives learn to use and control and understand thefaculty of spiritual perception, of divine isolation and appropriate responsewhich characterises the intuition. This they can do through the practice of theTechnique of the Presence, but not as it is usually taught and presented.Perhaps I shall make my meaning clearer if I state that this technique fallsinto certain scientific lines or modes of work, for which much of the traininggiven in schools of true meditation and in the Raja Yoga systems have preparedthe aspirant. These stages begin where the usual formulas leave off, andpre-suppose facility in approach to the Angel or the soul, and an ability toraise the consciousness to a point of soul fusion. I will list the processes orstages as follows:1. The evocation of the stage of tension. This is basic and essential. It is atension brought about by complete control of the personal self so that it is“fitted for contact with the real.”2. The achieving of a state of fusion with the soul or with the Angel whichguards the approach to the Path of the Higher Evolution. [179]3. The holding of the mind steady in the light of the soul, which remains theattitude of the lower self for the entire remaining period of work, held at thepoint of tension by the soul and not by an effort of the personality. The soulundertakes this holding when the personal self has done its utmost to achievethe desired tension.These are the three preliminary steps for which the practice of alignment shouldhave prepared the student of the higher mysteries. These steps must precede alleffort to develop the intuition, and this may take several months (or evenyears) of careful preparation. Fire is the symbol of the mind and these are thefirst three stages of the Agni Yoga discipline or of the yoga of fire for whichRaja Yoga has prepared the student.Next come six more stages in the Technique, and these must be thoroughlyunderstood and form the basis of prolonged brooding and intelligent reflection,carried on whilst the daily avocations and duties are being performed and notcarried out at certain set times. The trained intuitive or disciple lives everthe dual life of mundane activity and of intense and simultaneous spiritualreflection. This will be the outstanding characteristic of the Western disciplein contradistinction to the Eastern disciple who escapes from life into thesilent places and away from the pressures of daily living and constant contactwith others. The task of the Western disciple is much harder, but that which hewill prove to himself and to the world as a whole will be still higher. This isto be expected if the evolutionary process means anything. The Western racesmust move forward into spiritual supremacy, without obliterating the Easterncontribution, and the functioning of the Law of Rebirth holds the clue to thisand demonstrates this necessity. The [180] tide of life moves from East to Westas moves the sun, and those who in past centuries struck the note of Easternmysticism must strike and are now striking the note of Western occultism.Therefore, the following stages must follow upon the three earlier. We willcontinue with the numbering as given, for what I here suggest is a formula for amore advanced meditation attitude. I said not form.4. Definite and sustained effort to sense the Presence throughout the Universein all forms and in all presentations of truth. This could be expressed in thewords: “the effort to isolate the germ or seed of divinity which has brought allforms into being.” I would point out that this is not the attainment of a lovingattitude and a sentimental approach to all people and circumstances. That is themystical way and though not intended to be negated in the disciple’s life, isnot used at this time in the process of effective approach. It is the effortprimarily to see in the light which the Angel radiates the point of light behindall phenomenal appearances. This is, therefore, the transference of the mysticalvision to the higher levels of awareness. It is not the vision of the soul butthe vision or the spiritual sensing of that which the light of the soul can aidin revealing. The flickering soul light in the personal self has enabled thedisciple to see the vision of the soul and in that light to reach union with thesoul, even if only temporarily. Now the greater light of the soul becomesfocussed like a radiant sun and it reveals in its turn a still more stupendousvision—that of the Presence, of which the Angel is the guarantee and promise. Asthe light of the Moon is the guarantee that the light of the Sun exists, so thelight of the Sun is the guarantee, did you but know it, of a still greaterlight. [181]5. Then, having sensed the Presence—not theoretically but in vibrating responseto its Existence—there next comes the stage of the ascertaining of the Purpose.Hope of identification with the purpose lies too far ahead even for the averageinitiate, under the status of Master. With that unattainable stage (for us) weare not concerned. But we are concerned with the effort to achieve anunderstanding of that which through the medium of form is seeking to embody thehigh purpose at any particular point in the evolutionary cycle. This is possibleand has been achieved down the ages by those who have rightly approached andduly reflected upon the Way of the Higher Evolution. This Way is revealed to thedisciple, e’en though it may not concern the intuitive message which he maybring back from his high adventure.6. He then carries some world problem, some design which his mind has evolved orhis heart desired for the helping of humanity into what is esoterically called“the triple light of the intuition.” This light is formed by the blending of thelight of the personal self, focussed in the mind, the light of the soul,focussed in the Angel, and the universal light which the Presence emits; this,when done with facility through concentration and long practice, will producetwo results:a. There will suddenly dawn upon the disciple’s waiting mind (which stillremains the agent of reception) the answer to his problem, the clue to what isneeded to bring relief to humanity, the information desired which, when applied,will unlock some door in the realm of science, psychology or religion. Thisdoor, when opened, will bring relief or release to many. As before I have toldyou, the intuition is never concerned [182] with individual problems orenquiries, as so many self-centred aspirants think. It is purely impersonal andonly applicable to humanity in a synthetic sense.b. The “intruding agent of light” (as the Old Commentary calls these adventuringintuitives) is recognised as one to whom can be entrusted some revelation, somenew impartation of truth, some significant expansion from a seed of truthalready given to the race. He then sees a vision, hears a voice, registers amessage, or—highest form of all—he becomes a channel of power and light to theworld, a conscious Embodiment of divinity, or a Custodian of a divine principle.These forms constitute true revelation, imparted or embodied; they are stillrare but will increasingly be developed in humanity.7. The next few stages are called, in preparation for the revelation:a. The relinquishing of the Higher Way.b. The return to the Angel, or a refocussing in the soul.c. A pause or interlude for constructive thinking, under the influence of theAngel.d. The turning of the mind to the formulation of those forms of thought whichmust embody the revelation.e. Then again a pause which is called “the pause preceding presentation.”8. The presentation of the revelation or of the imparted truth and itsprecipitation into the world of illusion comes next. In that world of illusion,it undergoes the “fiery ordeal” wherein “some of the fire within that which isrevealed wings its way back to the source from whence it came; some of it servesto destroy the revealer, [183] and some to burn those who recognise therevelation.” This is a phase of Agni Yoga which, as you can see, is only forthose who can penetrate beyond the Angel into the place “where fire dwelleth,”and where God, the Presence, functions as a consuming fire and waits for thehour of total revelation. This is a symbolic rendering of a great truth. In thecase of the individual initiate, the third initiation, the Transfiguration,marks the consummation of the process. Only glory then is seen: only the voiceof the Presence is heard and union with the past, the present and the future isreached.9. The succumbing of the revelation to the prevailing illusion, its descent intothe world of glamour, and its subsequent disappearance as a revelation and itsemergence as a doctrine. But, in the meantime, humanity has been helped and ledforward; the intuitives continue to work and the inflow of that which is to berevealed never ceases.This basic technique underlies both primary and secondary revelations. In thecase of the first, the time cycle is long; in the second, the time cycle isshort. A very good instance of this process is demonstrated by one of thesecondary points of revelation in connection with the teaching which emanatedfrom the Hierarchy (the Custodian of secondary revelations, as Shamballa is ofprimary) fifty years ago and which took the form of The Secret Doctrine . H.P.B.was the “penetrating, sensing, appropriating intuitive.” The revelation sheconveyed followed the accustomed routine of all secondary revelation from theSource to the outer plane. There the minds of men, veiled by illusion andclouded by glamour, formulated it into an inelastic doctrine, recognising nofurther revelation and holding steadily—many of the theosophical groups—that TheSecret Doctrine was a final [184] revelation and that naught must be recognisedbut that book and naught deemed correct but their interpretations of that book.If they are correct, then evolutionary revelation is ended and the plight ofhumanity is hard indeed.Even the neophyte upon the way of the intuition can begin to develop in himselfthe power to recognise that which the lower mind cannot give him. Some thoughtof revealing potency, to be used for the helping of the many, may drop into hismind; some new light upon an old, old truth may penetrate, releasing the truthfrom the trammels of orthodoxy, thus illumining his consciousness. This he mustuse for all and not for himself alone. Little by little, he learns the way intothe world of the intuition; day by day, and year by year, he becomes moresensitive to divine Ideas and more apt in appropriating them wisely for the useof his fellowmen.The hope of the world and the dispelling of illusion lies in the development ofintuitives and their conscious training. There are many natural intuitives whosework is a blend of the higher psychism with flashes of true intuition. Theremust be the training of the exact intuitive. Paralleling their intuitiveresponse and their effort to precipitate their intuition into the world of humanthought, there must also be the steady development of the human mind so that itcan grasp and apprehend what is projected, and in this too lies the hope of therace.b. Group Intuition dispels World IllusionToday the world is full of illusions, many of them veiled under the form ofidealisms; it is full of wishful thinking and planning, and even though much ofthis is rightly oriented and expresses the fixed determination of theintelligentsia to create better living conditions for the entire population[185] of the world, the question arises: Is there in the sum total of thiswishful thinking enough of the essential dynamic livingness which will carry itdown into physical demonstration and factual expression and thus truly meethuman need? I would point out that the two greatest revealing Agents Who haveever come to Earth within the range of modern history made the following simplerevelations to humanity:1. The cause of all human suffering is desire and personal selfishness. Give updesire and you will be free.2. There is a way of liberation and it leads to illumination.3. It profits a man nothing to gain the whole world and lose his soul.4. Every human being is a Son of God.5. There is a way of liberation and it is the way of love and sacrifice.The lives of these Revealers were symbolic representations of that which Theytaught, and the rest of Their teaching but an extension of Their central themes.Their contribution was an integral part of the general revelation of the ageswhich has led men from the primitive state of human existence to the complexstate of modern civilisation. This general revelation can be called theRevelation of the Path which leads out of form to the Centre of all life; thepurity of this revelation has been preserved down the ages by a small handful ofdisciples, initiates and true esotericists who have always been present upon theEarth—defending the simplicity of that teaching, seeking for those who couldrespond to and recognise the germ or seed of truth, and training men to takeTheir place and to tread the way of intuitive perception. One of the major tasksof the Hierarchy is to seek for and find those who are sensitive to revelation[186] and whose minds are trained so that they can formulate the emerging truthsin such a way that they reach the ears of the world thinkers, relativelyunchanged. All revelation, however, when put into words and word forms, losessomething of its divine clarity.Much of the revelation of the past has come along the lines of the religiousimpulse and, as the illusion has deepened and grown in time, the originalsimplicity (as it was conveyed by its Revealers) has been lost. All basicrevelations are presented in the simplest forms. Accretion after accretion creptin; the minds of men made the teaching complex through their mentaldissertations until the great theological systems were built up which we call,for instance, the Christian Church and the Buddhist system. Their Founders wouldhave much difficulty in recognising the two or three fundamental and divinefacts or truths which They sought to reveal and emphasise, so great is themantle of illusion which has been thrown over the simple pronouncements of theChrist and of the Buddha. The vast cathedrals and the pompous ceremonies of theorthodox are far removed from the humble way of the life of the Christ, theMaster of all the Masters and the Teacher alike of angels and of men, and fromthe simplicity of His present way of life as He watches and waits for the returnof His people to the simple way of spiritual realisation.So great has been the illusion that in the West today men talk of the “temporalpower of the Catholic Church”; the Protestant Churches are split up into warringfactions; the Christian Science Church is known for its ability to amass moneyand to teach its adherents to do so and to achieve temporary good health; theGreek Orthodox Church was corrupt throughout, and only the simple faith of theuncultured and the poor has preserved any semblance of the truth in its originalsimple form. They have no ability for [187] high sounding theologicaldiscussions, but they do believe that God is love—just simply that—that there isa way which leads to peace and light, and that if they deny their own materialdesires they are pleasing God. I am, I know, widely generalising, brother ofmine, for I do know also that there are wise and good Christians and churchmenwithin the theological systems; these, however, spend not their time intheological discussions but in loving their fellowmen, and this they do becausethey love Christ and all for which He stands. They are not interested inbuilding great churches of stone and marble and in gathering together the moneyneeded for their support; they are interested to gather out those who form thetrue Church upon the inner spiritual plane and in helping them to walk in thelight.The illusion of power, the illusion of superiority, taints them not. After theworld crisis is over, Churchmen everywhere will not rest until they can discoverhow to penetrate through the illusion of doctrine and dogma which engulfs them,and find their way back to Christ and His simple message which has in it thepower to save the world, if recognised and practised.Much of the true revelation since the time of Christ has come to the world alongthe line of science. The presentation, for instance, of material substance(scientifically proven) as essentially only a form of energy was as great arevelation as any given by the Christ or the Buddha. It completelyrevolutionised men’s thinking and was—little as you may think it—a major blowstruck at the Great Illusion. It related energy to force, form to life, and manto God and held the secret of transformation, transmutation and transfiguration.The revelations of science when basic and fundamental are as divine as those ofreligion, but both have been prostituted to meet human demand. The era is [188]close at hand when science will bend every effort to heal humanity’s sores andbuild a better and happier world.The revelations of science, though focussed often through one man or woman, aremore specifically the result of group endeavour and of trained group activitythan are the revelations of religion, so called. Revelation, therefore, comes intwo ways:1. Through the effort, aspiration and achievement of one man who is so close tothe Hierarchy and so imbued with conscious divinity that he can receive themessage direct from the central divine Source. He has joined the ranks of theGreat Intuitives and works freely in the world of divine Ideas. He knows Hismission clearly; He chooses His sphere of activity with deliberation andisolates the truth or truths which He deems appropriate to the need of the time.He comes forth as a Messenger of the Most High, leads a dramatic and arrestinglife of service and symbolises in His life-events certain basic truths whichhave already been revealed but which He pictorially re-enacts. He epitomises inHimself the revelations of the past, and to them adds His Own contribution ofthe new revelation which it is His specific function to present to the world.2. Through the effort of a group of seekers, such as the scientificinvestigators in every country, who together are searching for light on theproblems of manifestation or for some means to alleviate human suffering, arevelation comes. The effort of such a group often lifts upon the wings of itsunrealised aspiration some one man who can then penetrate into the world ofdivine Ideas and there find the longed for cure or key and thus he intuitivelydiscovers a long sought secret. The discovery, [189] when of the first rank, isas much a revelation as the truths presented by the World Teachers. Who shallsay that the statement that God is Love is of more value than the statement thatAll is Energy?The route which the revelation then follows is the same in both cases, andillusion overtakes both forms of revelation but—and here is a point upon which Iwould ask you to reflect—there is a little less illusion gathered around therevelations of science than has gathered around the revelations of what humanitycalls the more definitely spiritual truths. One reason lies in the fact that thelast great spiritual revelation, given by the Christ, was given two thousandyears ago, and the development of man’s mind and his responsiveness to truth hasgrown greatly since that time. Again, the revelations of science are largely theresult of group tension, eventually focussed in one intuitive recipient, and therevelation is thereby protected.Today, as humanity awaits the revelation which will embody the thoughts anddreams and constructive goal of the New Age, the demand comes for the first timefrom a large group of intuitively inclined people. I said not intuitives,brother of old. This group is now so large and its focus is now so real and itsdemand so loud that it is succeeding in focussing the massed intent of thepeople. Therefore, whatever revelation may emerge in the immediate future willbe better “protected by the spirit of understanding” than any previous one. Thisis the significance of the words of the New Testament , “every eye shall seeHim”; humanity as a whole will recognise the revealing One. In past ages theMessenger from on High was only recognised by and known to a mere handful ofmen, and it took decades and sometimes centuries for His message to penetrateinto the hearts of humanity.[190] The stress of the times also and the development of the sense ofproportion, plus an enforced return to simplicity of living and requirements maysave the coming revelation from too swift and quick submergence in the fire ofthe Great Illusion .It will be apparent to you from the above that the mode of handling worldaffairs, states of consciousness and conditions in the three worlds is one inwhich the disciple and initiate work from above downwards. The method is inreality a repetition of the involutionary arc in which—like the Creator, from avantage point of exterior direction—energy, force and forces are directed intothe world of phenomena and produce definite effects upon the substance of thethree planes. This is a point which should be most carefully remembered; and itis for this reason that the Technique of the Presence must always be employed,prior to all other techniques. It establishes contact with the directingspiritual Agent and enables the disciple to assume the attitude of the detachedObserver and an agent of the Plan. When this technique is correctly followed, itbrings the intuition into play and the world of meaning (lying behind the worldof phenomena) stands revealed, thereby dispelling illusion. Truth, as it is, isseen and known. Forms in the outer world of phenomena (outer from the angle ofthe soul and therefore encompassing the three worlds of our familiar dailyliving) are seen to be but symbols of an inward and spiritual Reality.2. THE TECHNIQUE OF LIGHTWe come now to the consideration of the next development and service to berendered through the medium of another technique.This theme is so vast and there is so much literature to be found in all theworld Scriptures, commentaries and theological [191] dissertations on thesubject of Light that the simple truth and a few basic principles are lost tosight in a welter of words.In my various books I have given much anent this subject and in the book, TheLight of the Soul, which I wrote in collaboration with A.A.B., an effort wasmade to indicate the nature of the light of the soul. The key to this techniqueis to be found in the words: In that Light shall we see LIGHT. A simpleparaphrase of these apparently abstract and symbolic words could be given asfollows: When the disciple has found that lighted centre within himself and canwalk in its radiating light, he is then in a position (or in a state ofconsciousness, if you prefer) wherein he becomes aware of the light within allforms and atoms. The inner world of reality stands visible to him aslight-substance (a different thing to the Reality, revealed by the intuition).He can then become an efficient cooperator with the Plan because the world ofpsychic meaning becomes real to him and he knows what should be done to dispelglamour. It might be stated that this process of bringing light into dark placesfalls naturally into three stages:1. The stage wherein the beginner and the aspirant endeavour to eradicateglamour out of their own life by the use of the light of the mind. The light ofknowledge is a major dispelling agent in the earlier phases of the task andeffectively eliminates the various glamours which veil the truth from theaspirant.2. The stage wherein the aspirant and disciple work with the light of the soul.This is the light of wisdom which is the interpreted result of long experience,and this streams forth, blending with the light of knowledge.3. The stage wherein the disciple and the initiate work with the light of theintuition . It is through the blended [192] medium of the light of knowledge(personality light) and the light of wisdom (soul light) that the Light is seen,known and appropriated. This light puts out the lesser lights through the pureradiance of its power.You have therefore the light of knowledge, the light of wisdom and the light ofthe intuition, and these are three definite stages or aspects of the One Light.They correspond to the physical Sun, the heart of the Sun, and the CentralSpiritual Sun. In this last sentence you have the clue and the key to therelation of man to the Logos.These stages and their corresponding techniques are apt to be misunderstood ifthe student fails to remember that between them lie no real lines of demarcationbut only a constant overlapping, a cyclic development and a process of fusionwhich is most confusing to beginners. Just as the result of innate reaction toenvironment produces the apparatus needed to contact that environment, so theunfoldment of the powers which these techniques serve produces modes of contactwith soul and spiritual environments. Each of these techniques is related to anew environment; each of them eventually develops power in the initiate ordisciple which can be used in the service of humanity and in higher spheres ofdivine activity; each is related to the other techniques, and each releases thedisciple into a conscious relationship with a new environment, new states ofawareness and new fields of service. For instance:1. The Technique of the Presence , when successfully followed, enables theintuition to flow in and to supersede the activity of the rationalising mind andto dispel illusion, substituting for that illusion divine ideas, formulated intoconcepts which we call ideals. The Masters, it should be remembered, only usethe mind for two activities: [193]a. To reach the minds of Their disciples and attract aspirants through themedium of an instrument similar to the disciple’s mind.b. To create thoughtforms on concrete levels which can embody these divineideas. The directing Agent, the Angel of the Presence, produces the power tocreate in this manner, and this we call the result of the intuition—idea ortruth, its perception and its reproduction.2. The Technique of Light is more closely related to the mind and signifies themethod whereby the illumination which flows from the soul (whose nature islight) can irradiate not only ideals but life, circumstances and events,revealing the cause and the meaning of the experience. When the power of thedisciple to illumine is grasped, he has taken the first step towards dispellingglamour; and just as the technique of the Presence becomes effective upon themental plane, so this technique produces powers which can become effective onthe astral plane and eventually bring about the dissipation and thedisappearance of that plane.3. The Technique of Indifference renders ineffective or neutralises the hold ofsubstance over the life or spirit, functioning in the three worlds, for soul isthe evidence of life.In connection, therefore, with this second technique, I would like to take somewords out of the Bible, substituting the word “light” for the word “faith.” Igive you this definition: Light is the substance of things hoped for, theevidence of things not seen. This is perhaps one of the most occult definitionsof the light of the world that has yet been given and its true meaning isintended to be revealed in the next two generations. The word “faith” is a good[194] instance of the method of rendering “blind” some of the ancient truths sothat their significance may not be prematurely revealed. Light and substance aresynonymous terms. Soul and light are equally so, and in this equality ofidea—light, substance, soul—you have the key to fusion and to the at-one-mentwhich Christ expressed so fully for us in His life on Earth.When, therefore, students and aspirants have made progress in soul contact, theyhave taken one of the first important steps towards the comprehension of lightand its uses. They must however be careful not to confuse the light which theycan bring to bear on life, circumstance, events, and on environment with theintuition. The light with which we are concerned expresses itself in the threeworlds and reveals form and forms, their reaction and effects, their glamour andattractive appeal, and their power to delude and imprison consciousness. Thelight concerned is soul light, illuminating the mind and bringing aboutrevelation of the world of forms in which that life is immersed.The intuition is concerned with nothing whatsoever in the three worlds of humanexperience but only with the perceptions of the Spiritual Triad and with theworld of ideas. The intuition is to the world of meaning what the mind is to thethree worlds of experience. It produces understanding just as the light of soulproduces knowledge, through the medium of that experience. Knowledge is not apurely mental reaction but is something which is found on all levels and isinstinctual in some form in all kingdoms. This is axiomatic. The five sensesbring physical plane knowledge; psychic sensitivity brings a knowledge of theastral plane; the mind brings intellectual perception, but all three are aspectsof the light of knowledge (coming from the soul) as it informs its vehicles ofexpression in the vast threefold [195] environment in which it chooses toimprison itself for purposes of development.On a higher turn of the spiral, the intuition is the expression of the threefoldSpiritual Triad, placing it in relation to the higher levels of divineexpression; it is a result of the life of the Monad—an energy which carriesrevelation of divine purpose. It is in the world of this divine revelation thatthe disciple learns eventually to work and in which the initiate consciouslyfunctions. Of this higher experience, the active life of the three worlds is adistorted expression but constitutes also the training ground in which capacityto live the initiate life of intuitional perception and to serve the Plan isslowly developed. These distinctions (in time and space, because alldistinctions are part of the great illusion, though necessary and inevitablewhen the mind controls) must be carefully considered. Disciples will reach apoint in their development where they will know whether they are reacting to thelight of the soul or to the intuitional perception of the Triad. They will thencome to the point where they will realise that intuitive perception—as they callit—is only the reaction of the illumined personality to the identificationtendency of the Triad. But these concepts are beyond the grasp of the averageman because fusion and identification are by no means the same.The rules for the Technique of Light have been adequately laid down in the RajaYoga system of Patanjali, of which the five stages of Concentration, Meditation,Contemplation, Illumination, and Inspiration are illustrative; these, in theirturn, must be parallelled by a following of the Five Rules and the FiveCommandments. I would ask you to study these. They, in their turn, produce themany results in psychic sensitivity, of which hierarchical contact,illumination, service and discipline are descriptive and, finally, the [196]stage of “isolated unity,” which is the paradoxical term used by Patanjali todescribe the inner life of the initiate.Most of what I have said above is well known to all aspirants whether they studythe Raja Yoga teaching of India or the life of practical mysticism as laid downby such mystics as Meister Eckhart and the more mentally polarised modernesotericist. These latter went beyond the mystical vision by arriving at fusion.I need not enlarge on this. It is the higher stage of at-one-ment to which alltrue mystics bear witness.What does concern us here is how this light is recognised, appropriated and usedin order to dispel glamour and render a deeply esoteric service to the world. Itmight be said that the inner light is like a searchlight, swinging out into theworld of glamour and of human struggle from what one Master has called “thepedestal of the soul and the spiritual tower or beacon.” These terms convey theidea of altitude and of distance which are so characteristic of the mysticalapproach. Power to use this light as a dissipating agent only comes when thesesymbols are dropped and the server begins to regard himself as the light and asthe irradiating centre. Herein lies the reason for some of the technicalities ofthe occult science. The esotericist knows that in every atom of his body is tobe found a point of light. He knows that the nature of the soul is light. Foraeons, he walks by means of the light engendered within his vehicles, by thelight within the atomic substance of his body and is, therefore, guided by thelight of matter. Later, he discovers the light of the soul. Later still, helearns to fuse and blend soul light and material light. Then he shines forth asa Light bearer, the purified light of matter and the light of the soul beingblended and focussed. The use of this focussed light as it dispels individualglamour teaches the disciples the early stages of the technique which willdispel [197] group glamour and eventually world glamour, and this is the nextpoint with which we will deal.The theme with which we are dealing—the light of the soul as it dissipatesglamour in the three worlds—is the most practical and useful and needed subjectfor study to be found today: it concerns the astral plane, and the service to berendered is vital and timely. The ridding of the world of the individual and theworld of humanity as a whole of the all-enveloping glamour which holds humanityin thrall is an essential requirement for the race. The new era which will openup before mankind at the close of the war will be distinguished by its mentalpolarisation and consequent freedom from glamour; then illusion will for a timecontrol until the intuition is more fully developed. This illusion will producevastly different results to those which follow when men live and work in themidst of glamour. The second characteristic of the new era will be thescientific approach to the entire problem of glamour which will then berecognised for what it is and will be scientifically dissipated by the use ofthe illumined minds of groups, working in unison for just that purpose.The proposition, therefore, which I am laying before you (who are the aspirantsand the disciples of the world) is the possibility of a definite world service.Groups will eventually be formed of those who are working at the dissipation ofglamour in their individual lives and who are doing so not so much in order toachieve their own liberation but with the special objective of ridding theastral plane of its significant glamours. They will work unitedly on some majorphase of world glamour by the power of their individual illumined minds;unitedly they will turn “the searchlight of the mind, reflecting the light ofthe sun but at the same time radiating its own inner light upon the mists andfogs of Earth, for in these mists and fogs all men stumble. [198] Within thelighted sphere of the focussed radiant light, reality will issue forthtriumphant.”It is interesting to note that the most ancient prayer in the world refers tothe three aspects of glamour, and it is for these that the three techniques mustbe used to make release and progress possible. As you know, this prayer runs asfollows (Brihadaranyaki Upanishad I, 3, 28):“Lead us, O Lord, from darkness to light; from the unreal to the real; fromdeath to immortality.”“Lead us from darkness to light” refers to the mind as it becomes eventuallyillumined by the light of the intuition; this illumination is brought about bythe means of the Technique of the Presence from Whom the light shines. This isthe mediating factor producing the Transfiguration of the personality, and acentre of radiant light upon the mental plane. This statement is true whetherone is speaking of an individual or of that focal point of light which is formedby the mental unity and the clear thinking of advanced humanity. These, throughthe power of their unified minds, will succeed in ridding the world of someaspects of the Great Illusion.“Lead us from the unreal to the Real” has specific relation to the astral planeand its all-encompassing glamours. These glamours embody the unreal and presentthem to the prisoners of the astral plane, leading them to mistake them for theReality. This imprisonment by glamour can be ended by the activity of theTechnique of Light, utilised by those who work—in group formation—for thedissipation of glamour and for the emergence in the consciousness of men of aclear conception and recognition of the nature of Reality.This particular work of dissipation is our immediate theme. It is of vitalimportance that those who recognise [199] the open door to the future throughwhich all men must pass should begin to carry forward this work. Only thus canhumanity be helped to leave behind the errors, the glamours and the failures ofthe past. It is this technique which brings freedom from glamour and which cantransform human living, and so bring in the new civilisation and culture. Thisdissipation can be carried forward by disciples in all parts of the planet,aided by the world aspirants; it will, however, be primarily the work of thosewhose ray focus makes astral living the line of least resistance and who havelearnt or are learning to dominate it by the power of thought and mental light.These are the sixth ray people in the first instance, aided by aspirants anddisciples upon the second and fourth rays.In time and space, this task will be first of all instituted and controlled ingroup formation only by aspirants whose soul or personality rays are the sixthor by those whose astral bodies are conditioned by the sixth ray. When they havegrasped the nature of the work to be done and “fanatically adopted the techniqueof light in the service of the race,” their work will be completed by second raydisciples, working from the Ashrams of those Masters Who take disciples. Thework done by these two groups will be finally revealed (and at a much laterdate) by those aspirants and disciples who will swing into astral activity whenthe fourth ray again begins to manifest. Therefore, the work of dissipatingglamour is carried forward by those who come out into manifestation along thelines of energy which embody the second, fourth and sixth rays. I emphasise thisas disciples frequently undertake tasks for which they are not particularlyfitted and whose rays do not aid them in accomplishment and sometimes preventthat accomplishment.[200] The whole subject is related to consciousness, to the second aspect, andconcerns the forms through which mankind becomes progressively aware. Glamour iscaused by the recognition of that which man has himself created and, as hasoccultly been said, “Man only becomes aware of reality when he has destroyedthat which he has himself created.” These forms fall into two major groups:1. Those forms which are of very ancient origin and which are the result ofhuman activity, human thinking and of human error. They embrace all the formswhich the desire nature of man has created down the ages and are the nebuloussubstance of glamour—nebulous from the physical angle but dense from the angleof the astral plane. They are that which provides the incentive behind allstriving and activity upon the outer plane as man attempts to satisfy desire.From these forms the individual aspirant has ever to rid himself, emerging afterso doing through that gate which we call the second initiation into a widerconsciousness.2. Those forms which are being constantly created and ceaselessly produced inresponse to the aspirational nature of humanity and which provide theenticements which lead the man along towards high personal achievement in thefirst instance and spiritual achievement later. They have in them theindications of the new and the possible. These likewise (strange as it may seem)constitute a glamour, for they are temporary and illusory and must not bepermitted to hide the Real. That Reality will precipitate itself at the rightmoment once the higher light pours in. They are indicative of the Real and areoften mistaken for the Real; they are in conflict with the old thoughts anddesires of the past and must eventually give place to the factual presence ofthe [201] Real. They provide (in times of crisis) the great testing for allaspirants and disciples, evoking the subtlest kind of discrimination; but oncethat testing has been triumphantly passed, then can the task of dissipating boththese types of glamour be given to the disciple and aspirant, with the emphasisupon the immediate need or any particular and current world glamour.It will be apparent to you, therefore, that groups working consciously at theservice of dissipating glamour will have the following characteristics:1. They will be composed of sixth ray aspirants and disciples, aided by secondray spiritual workers.2. They will be formed of those who:a. Are learning or have learnt to dissipate their own individual glamours andcan bring understanding to the task.b. Are focussed upon the mental plane and have, therefore, some measure ofmental illumination. They are mastering the Technique of Light.c. Are aware of the nature of the glamours which they are attempting todissipate and can use the illumined mind as a searchlight.3. They will count among their numbers those who (occultly speaking) have thefollowing powers in process of rapid development:a. The power not only to recognise glamour for what it is, but to discriminatebetween the various and many types of glamour.b. The power to appropriate the light, absorbing it into themselves and thenconsciously and scientifically project it into the world of glamour. The [202]Masters, the higher initiates and the world disciples do this alone, if need be,and require not the protection of the group or the aid of the light of the groupmembers.c. The power to use the light not only through absorption and projection butalso by a conscious use of the will, carrying energy upon the beam of projectedlight. To this they add a persistent and steady focus. This beam, thusprojected, has a twofold use: It works expulsively and dynamically, much as astrong wind blows away or dissipates a dense fog or as the rays of the sun dryup and absorb the mist. It acts also as a beam along which that which is new anda part of the divine intention can enter. The new ideas and the desired idealscan come in “on the beam,” just as the beam directs and brings in the airplanesto a desired landing place.a. The Dissipation of Individual GlamourLet us first of all consider the mode by which the individual aspirant cansucceed in dissipating the glamours which have for ages conditioned his life inthe three worlds. He has been dominated by desire for four-fifths of hisincarnated experience. He has begun to transmute his desire into aspiration andto seek—with all the devotion, emotion and longing of which he is capable—forrealisation. It is then that he becomes aware of the appalling nature of theglamours in which he automatically and normally walks. Glamour arose when manrecognised and registered desire as an incentive, thus demonstrating hishumanity and his distinction from the animal, because it is the mind whichreveals the existence of desire. The instinctual effort to satisfy desire—innateand inherent in the lower nature—gave [203] place to planned efforts to meetdesire, involving the directive use of the mind. Thus the line of demarcationbetween the animal and the human has become increasingly apparent and the firstand basic expression of pure selfishness appeared aeons ago. Later, as evolutionproceeded and desire shifted from one planned satisfaction to another, it beganto take on a less physical aspect and men sought pleasure in emotionalexperience and in its dramatisation: this led to the establishment of the dramaas its first artistic expression; by means of this, down the ages, man hassupplemented individual emotional and dramatic living with a vicarioussubmergence in it, thus exteriorising himself and supplementing his personaldramas, desires, and objectives with those which were developed by means of thecreative imagination, thus laying the foundation for the recognition—intelligentand real—of the part in relation to the whole. Thus from earliest Atlanteantimes the foundation was laid for the unfoldment of the sense of mysticalduality through the various stages of an anthropomorphic recognition of deity tothe recognition of the real in man himself, until finally we arrive at theproposition which faces the disciple. Then the Dweller on the Thresholdconfronts the Angel of the Presence and the last and major conflict is foughtout.This dualistic consciousness culminates at the time of the third initiation inthe final fight between the pairs of opposites and the triumphant victory of theAngel—the embodiment of the Forces of Good in the individual, in the group andin humanity. Then dualism and the desire for that which is material and notoneself (as identified with the Whole) dies out. Unity and the “life moreabundantly” is achieved.The process followed by the disciple who is consciously working at thedissipation of glamour in his life can be [204] divided into four stages towhich the following definitions can be given:1. The stage of recognition of the glamour or glamours which hide the Real.These glamours are dependent in any particular life crisis upon the ray of thepersonality.2. The stage of focussing the disciple’s consciousness upon the mental plane andthe gathering of the light to that point of focus so that the illumination isclear, the work to be done is plainly seen, and the searchlight of the mind isdirected upon the glamour which it is intended should be dissipated.3. The stage of direction. This involves the steady pouring of the light (underintelligent direction) into the dark places of the astral plane, rememberingthat the light will enable the disciple to do two things:a. Dissipate the glamour—a satisfying experience.b. See the Real—a terrifying experience, brother of mine.4. The stage of identification with the Real as it is contacted after thedissipation of the glamour. In the added light which is now available, therewill be a further recognition of still subtler glamours which in their turn mustbe dissipated.This process of recognition, focussing, dissipation and consequent revelationgoes on continually from the time a disciple treads the Path of AcceptedDiscipleship until the third initiation.The clue to all success in this process is, therefore, connected with meditationand the holding of the mind steady in the light. Only through steadiness can thebeam of light be formed, intensified, focussed and projected and then—[205] atthe right moment—withdrawn. I cannot here enter upon an elucidation of theprocess of meditation, based on the right understanding of the nature ofconcentration. I have written much upon the subject and the Raja Yoga disciplineis well known. Mental concentration and control is now the ordinary theme of allinstructions given by educators and enlightened parents. It is difficult for theaverage person today to realise that there was a time when such phrases as “Useyour mind” or “If you will only think” or “A little mental control on your partwould be useful” were totally unknown because the mind was so little developed.It was then only recognised as a functioning factor by those with initiateconsciousness. The Path of Evolution is in fact the path of recognitions,leading to revelation. The whole process of evolution is initiatory incharacter, leading from one expansion of consciousness to another until theworlds of the formless and of form stand revealed in the light which theinitiate generates and in which he walks. These lights are varied and variouslyrevealing; there is:1. The light of matter itself, found in every atom of substance.2. The light of the vital or etheric vehicle—a light which is the reflection ofthe One Light because it unifies the three types of light within the threeworlds.3. The light of the instinct.4. The light of the intellect or the light of knowledge.5. The light of the soul.6. The light of the intuition.From light to light we pass, from revelation to revelation until we pass out ofthe realm of light into the realm of life which is, as yet to us, pure darkness.It will be obvious to you that this increasing light brings with it a constantlydeveloping series of revelations which, [206] like all else in the world ofhuman experience, unfolds before the eyes first of all the world of forms, thenthe world of ideals, then the nature of the soul, of ideas and of divinity. I amchoosing but a few of the words which embody the revelation and are symbolic ofits character. But all these revelations constitute one great unified revelationwhich is slowly unfolding before the eyes of humanity. The light of the personallower self reveals to man the world of form, of matter, of instinct, of desireand of mind; the light of the soul reveals the nature of the relation of theseforms of life to the world of the formless and of the conflict between the realand the unreal. The light of the intuition unfolds before the vision of the soulwithin the personality , the nature of God and the unity of the Whole. Therestlessness of material desire, seeking its satisfaction in the three worlds,eventually gives place to aspiration towards soul contact and soul life. This inits turn is recognised as a step towards those great fundamental experiences towhich we give the names of the five major initiations. These reveal to man thehitherto unrealised fact of his non-separateness and of the relation of hisindividual will to the divine will.We are now going to study the mode whereby these phases of work upon the astralplane are carried forward: first, the individual learns to use the light of themind, generated by the soul as it becomes closely related to the personality andimpulsed by the intuition. By means of this light the disciple learns todissipate his personal and private glamours. I mention this because I would haveyou appreciate the extent of the task a man undertakes when he consciously setsabout ridding himself of glamour preparatory to extended service. He is inconflict then with the whole glamour of the entire plane and is apt to beoverwhelmed by a realisation of what he is facing. This is one of the [207]causes of the deep depression and those profound inferiority complexes whichrender some people completely futile or lead eventually to suicide. Their ownpersonal glamours tie them in to national or planetary glamour and thuscondition their life expression and their thinking. I would ask you to rememberthis as you deal with people and find them set in their ideas and unable to seethe truth as you see it. They are as they are because their individual glamouris fed by the greater glamours, and this is as yet too much for them.It is not my intention to deal specifically with particular glamours but to giveyou a formula which—with slight changes and additions—can serve the individualand the group in the task of eradicating glamour. I would begin by saying thatthe first need is for the man to realise that his reactions, ideas, desires andlife experience, as far as his emotional nature is concerned, are conditioned bysome one glamour or glamours, that he is the victim of several glamours,engendered over many lives, deeply rooted in his past history, and to which heinstinctually reacts. The time, however, comes when the probationary disciplebecomes aware of these instinctual glamours and recognises them on appearance,even when reacting to them; he seeks to free himself, working at firstspasmodically, trying to use the mind to rationalise himself out of them andalternating between temporary success, when he can with deliberation act as iffree from glamour, and long periods of defeat when he is overwhelmed, can see nolight anywhere and acts like a blind, bewildered person. This indicates that heis drawn as by a magnet (the force of accumulated ancient glamour with itskarmic effects) into the midst of the very glamour he would seek to avoid. Latercomes the stage (a result of this alternating process) when the pull of the soulbegins to offset the pull of these glamours: he [208] aspires to free expressionand to liberation from astral plane control. The balancing process then takesplace.It is during this stage that meditation is instituted so that the man becomesaware of soul light as it blends with the inherent light of the mental body, andthis blended light steadily intensifies as he persists in the meditation work. Apoint then comes where the aspirant discovers that this inner light can be used,and he begins tentatively and with uneven success to turn that light upon theproblems of his particular glamour. It is also at this point that we now carryforward the Technique of Light, employing it so that the vague unscientifictechnique of the past comes to an end. The indicated technique is of use only tothe man who knows something of the light of the mind, of the light in the head,and of the light of the soul. The light in the head is produced by thedefinitely planned bringing together of soul light and personality light,focussed in the mental body and producing an effect in the brain. This focussingprocess falls into three stages:1. The attempt to focus the light of the mind and of matter in the mentalvehicle.This signifies a bringing together of the light of matter and substance (densematerial and etheric light) and the light of the mind itself. There is nopeculiar or specific light in or of the astral body itself, for it is only anaggregate of forms, created by individual man, by nations and by races, andthese in their entirety constitute the astral plane and possess no inherentlight as do other forms. They are not created as a form of expression for somedynamic life by the planetary Logos, and this is the real meaning of what I haveearlier told you that the astral plane in reality does not exist. It is thephantasmoric creation of human desire down the [209] ages and its false lightis a reflection of either the light of matter or of the mind. This process offocussing is undertaken through alignment and by the effort to bring to a pointof illumination the positive light of the mind and the negative light of thebrain and is carried forward through mental control, developed in meditation.When these two opposite poles are in relation then (by an act of the personalitywill) these two aspects of the lesser light can form a pin point of light—like asmall torch light—revealing some phase of the glamour to which the aspirant mosteasily responds. This first focussed light is not of such a nature that it cando more than reveal. It has no dissipating power, nor can it render existingglamour ineffective. It can only make a man aware in his waking or brainconsciousness that glamour holds him. This is related to the stage ofconcentration in the meditation process.2. The second stage of the focussing process is produced through the effort tomeditate. In the previous stage, the blending of the two material lights wasentirely a form process and the aspirant is actuated entirely by his personalityforces and expediency. An illustration of this and of its effectiveness can beseen in the man who, from purely selfish motives and through an intenseconcentration, focusses his mind and brings about the gratification of hisdesires and the achievement of his goals. He kills out all emotional reactionsand goes a long way towards dissipating glamour. He develops the ability to drawon the light of matter itself (physical matter and mental substance) and thus hegenerates a false light from which soul light is rigorously excluded. It is thispower which eventually produces a black magician. He has developed the capacityto draw [210] upon the light energy of matter itself and to focus it sopowerfully and effectively that it becomes a great destructive force. It is thiswhich has given Hitler and the six evil men associated with him their power todestroy upon the material plane. But, in the case of the aspirant, the power tomeditate upon spiritual reality and to contact the soul offsets the dangersinherent in focussing on and using solely the light of matter; to the lesserlight of matter is added the light of the soul and then these two blendedlights, or aspects of the One Light, are focussed upon the mental plane throughthe power of the creative imagination. This enables man eventually to dissipateglamour and liberates him from the astral plane.3. The third stage is that in which the light of matter, the light of the mindand the light of the soul (as a channel for the intuition) are consciouslyblended, fused and focussed. The man then turns this blended light, under souldirection, upon the world of glamour and upon the particular glamour with whichhe is at any one time pre-occupied. The false light of the astral planedisappears in this triple blended light just like a fire can be nearly put outif subjected to the full rays of the sun; or a burning glass, focussing the raysof the sun, can start a destructive blaze. It is the use of a powerful lightwhich can obliterate a lesser light and dissipate a fog.All this has to be understandingly and consciously carried forward as apreliminary to the technique proper. His work will be experimental at first, andscientifically applied eventually. It will be based upon a recognition oftruth—a truth which is faced and accepted. This work is not a form ofrationalisation, though that precedes the definitely [211] scientific work I amoutlining; it is not the cultivation of fresh interests of a mental andspiritual kind which gradually supersede desire and drive out glamour. That isall preparatory in character and leads to an unfoldment which prepares theaspirant to work scientifically; it is not a process of “killing out desire” assome schools of thought teach, but is a process of gradually eradicating desireby stern discipline and hard trained work and this, incidentally, involves thedissipation of glamour. Such have been the slow techniques of the past. Todaythe process is to be changed because enough people are now the product ofunderstanding and can work wisely and also scientifically.The process I am developing for you is one of rapid and effective dissipationand is based upon the acceptance of the hypothesis of light, upon therecognition of the fact that the astral plane has no true existence, upon atrained use of the creative imagination and upon the unquestioning following ofinstructions, individually and as a group.It is my intention to give you two formulas—one for the use of the individualand the other which groups can use as they contribute their united effort to thedissipation of glamour, either of group glamour or in relation to some aspect ofthe prevalent world glamour. Two things will be apparent to you:First: that those participating in the eradication of glamour must be able todistinguish between glamour and the reality. These often closely resemble eachother on a superficial examination. They must be in a position to recognise thatan emotional or astral condition constitutes a veil over the truth and is adistortion of the presentation or the appearance of the individual’s or thegroup’s expression of divinity. They must, therefore, be capable of vision,clear thinking, and prompt recognition as to what is preventing [212] thematerialising of that vision and the accurate reception of the truth. They mustalso be able to distinguish between a major and a minor glamour. A minorglamour, a passing evanescent thoughtform of an easily recognisable nature doesnot warrant the use of either of the formulas. Such a minor glamour would be asense of self-pity in an individual or the glorification of some notableindividual by an individual, a group or a nation. Time and commonsense sufficeto take care of such a situation. A major glamour in the world (prior to thewar) was the emphasis put upon possessions and the belief that happiness wasdependent upon things and upon material good and comfort.Second: that the three stages of focussing, referred to above, constitute apreparatory process. These three stages must be somewhat developed beforeeffective use of the formulas can be possible, and those intending to work atthe task of ridding the world of glamour must subject themselves constantly tothese phases in the art of polarisation, if I might so call it. They must havean understanding of the apparatus of thought, of the creation of thoughtforms,and of the nature of the thinker. They must be emotionally polarised, yet, ingroup work relatively free from astral control. This astral liberation must to acertain extent control the choice of those who are to work at majordissipations. In the case of the individual who is seeking to break up glamourin his individual life, he should be mentally polarised by decision and efforteven if the emotional nature is for him in any one life the line of leastresistance. Those working in group formation will have achieved a measure ofmental focus but for the purposes of the work to be done they will focusthemselves consciously and deliberately upon the emotional plane through [213] their control of their natures. Workers must therefore have practisedmeditation, have reflected much upon the nature of thought and its uses, andmust be aware of the light within.When these three stages are established as related activities, habits andautomatic reactions, and when the intention is fixed and the ability to focushas become an almost instinctual reaction, then sound and effective work can bedone; to this work must be added persistence and patience. It is not necessary,I might add, to have achieved perfection in the process before starting thiswork and service. Disciples and aspirants must cultivate the consciousness ofcooperation and realisation that in service such as is proposed, they aredefinitely participating in a hierarchical activity and are, therefore, in aposition to render help even if they could not—alone and unaided—achieve thedesired results. They can hasten the process by their combined help. The powerof united effort upon the physical plane is being realised today on a largescale, and the war effort in all countries has greatly hastened thisrealisation. The power of unified emotion (often expressing itself in what iscalled mob psychology) is everywhere recognised and feared as well as exploited.The power of unified thought is little grasped as yet, and the power inherent inthe light of many minds, rendering them effective instruments in world affairs,penetrating and dissipating glamour and proving creative upon the physicalplane, will prove to be a part of the new modes of work which will be employedin the new age. For this, the Hierarchy has planned and worked and it is nowprepared to test the effectiveness of that work by organising a group or groupswhich will work upon the problem of glamour.You can see, consequently, that what I am outlining is relatively new. The faintimpression of the coming technique [214] as far as the individual is concernedhas been registered. Men and women everywhere are attempting to rid themselvesof glamour by the power of clear thinking, stern discipline and commonsense, andby a recording consciously of their relation to the whole—which prompts them toeliminate out of their lives all that could hinder others or increase worlddeception through glamour. To this will be added (perhaps as an aspect of thenew world religion now on its way towards externalising) the realisation thatgroups can successfully clear away the glamours which darken humanity’s way toits goal, through the power of combined and projected thought.In order to make the first step towards united group activity along this line ofservice, I present a formula or group ritual which—if employed by those whoselives are relatively free from glamour, who are realists and who are recognisedby the group as thus relatively free, and who are animated by good intent—willdo much to bring to an end certain aspects of the world glamour. Their effort,combined with that of similar groups, will so weaken the power of these ancientglamours that the “Day of Clarification” will eventually come.First, however, let me briefly offer for the use of the individual aspirant aformula whereby he may aid in freeing himself from his particular glamour orglamours. I will tabulate the process, and the aspirant would do well to followit as given, having in his mind no sense of time, and being willing to do thiswork regularly for months, and if necessary for years, until he has freedhimself and the light breaks in on the astral plane through the medium of hisastral body. I would suggest that no aspirant attempt to tackle the problem ofglamour as a whole or seek to dissipate all the glamours to which he issusceptible. He is dealing with very ancient evil and with firmly established[215] habits of glamour. They are closely connected with aspects of his dailyliving, with his sex life or with his ambitions, with his relations to otherpeople, with his pet ideals and ideas, his dreams and visions. He should choosethe glamour that is the most apparent and the most hindering at any given time(and there is always one) and for its dissipation he should workconscientiously, if he would lay the foundations for effective service in thedissipation of world glamour.FORMULA FOR THE DISSIPATION OF GLAMOUR(For the Individual)I. Preparatory Stages.1. Recognition of the glamour to be dissipated. This involves:a. A willingness to cooperate with the soul in physical, astral and mental waysin order to aid in the more technical work. Ponder on the implications in thissentence.b. A recognition of the ways in which this glamour affects the daily life andall relationships.2. The three stages of focussing outlined (pp. 208-210) must be undertaken.a. The stage of focussing the light of the mind and the light of matter in themental vehicle. This is done by a process of lifting up and of blending andfusion, and to do this the activity of the creative imagination is employed.b. The stage of meditation which in time brings about the fusion of the light ofmatter, the light of the mind and the light of the soul upon the mental plane.[216]c. The stage in which these three lights are realised to be one unified light —asearchlight, ready to be turned in the needed direction.3. The recognition of two aspects of preparedness:a. Alignment of the personality, so that the three aspects of the lower natureare seen as constituting one functioning personality.b. An act of integration in which the personality and the soul are seen also asa unit. This is done through the dedication of the personality to the soul andits acceptance by the soul.These two lines of thinking produce a field of magnetic thought and realisationin which all the work is done.4. A pause in which the whole man braces himself for the work to be done. From aprofound pre-occupation with the stage of soul contact and initial preparationhe now focusses his attentive mind upon the glamour to be eradicated. This doesnot involve a consciousness of the glamour and its why and wherefore. It means aturning of the attention of the integrated soul-personality to the astral planeand the particular glamour; the attention is not turned to the astral body ofthe aspirant, seeking to do the work. This is a statement of major importancebecause in destroying the peculiar type of glamour with which he is concerned,the aspirant or disciple begins to destroy his share in it—that in him whichgives him contact with the glamour—and at the same time he is preparing himselffor group service along the same line. This will not prove an easy task. [217]II. The Technique or Formula.5. By an act of the creative imagination the worker endeavours to see and hearthe soul—the source of light and power in the three worlds—breathing out the OMinto the mind of the attentive waiting personality. There the light and power ofthe soul is retained and held by the positive personality, for a negativeattitude is not desirable.6. The retained light and power, combined with the dual light of the personality(focussed as we know on the mental plane) is seen generating an intense lightwhich can be visualised as a searchlight of great brilliance and strength. Itmust be seen as a sphere of vivid brilliant light but not yet radiating out orprojecting outwards.7. When this act of visualisation is deemed to be satisfactorily accomplished, apause then ensues wherein the aspirant focusses all the will he has behind thelight thus created by the fusion of the three lights. This refers to the stagespoken of by Patanjali as that of the “mind held steady in the light.” This useof the will—soul-personality will—is dynamic but at this stage quiescent and notmagnetic or radiatory.8. Next follows a process wherein the glamour to be dissipated and thesearchlight of the mind are brought into relationship by the power of thought.The glamour and its quality and the searchlight and its power are recognised tobe as they are, and the effect or effects to be brought about by thatrelationship are carefully thought out. This must not be done in such a way thatthe mind process, light [218] and power will strengthen the already powerfulglamour. It must be done in such a way that at the close of the process theglamour will be appreciably weakened and eventually dissipated. This is animportant realisation.9. Having, as far as possible, achieved the needed concentration, realisationand relationship, the aspirant then (by an act of the will and of the creativeimagination) turns on the searchlight and sees a vivid beam of light streamforth and pierce the glamour. He must visualise a broad brilliant beam, pouringforth from the illumined mind on to the astral plane. He must believe that thisis so.10. Then comes an important and difficult phase of the work in which the workernames the glamour and sees it in process of dissipation. He aids the process bysaying with tension and inaudibly:The power of the light prevents the appearance of the glamour (Naming it).The power of the light negates the quality of the glamour from affecting me.The power of the light destroys the life behind the glamour.The saying of these three sentences constitutes an affirmation of power and ofpurpose and must be enunciated at a point of tension, with the mind held insteadiness and with a positive orientation.11. Again the Sacred Word is sounded with intent to produce what in occultparlance is called an “Act of Penetration”; the light is then seen accomplishingthree things: [219]a. Making a definite impact upon the glamour.b. Penetrating the glamour and being absorbed by it.c. Dissipating it slowly; as time elapses the glamour will never again be sopowerful and will eventually disappear altogether.12. This is followed by a process of withdrawing wherein the aspirantconsciously and deliberately withdraws the beam of light and re-orients himselfupon the mental plane.I would point out that glamour is never immediately dissipated. It is of tooancient an origin. But a persistent use of this formula will weaken the glamourand slowly and inevitably it will vanish and the man will walk free from thatparticular hindrance. This may seem like a very long formula but I havepurposely detailed it in as full a manner as possible so that the aspirant mayclearly apprehend what he is intended to do. After due practice and a faithfulfollowing of the required conditions, the aspirant will follow it well-nighautomatically and all that he will then need will be the formula reduced to thefollowing brief outline:Brief Outline of the Formula1. The four Preparatory Stages:a. Recognition of the glamour to be dissipated.b. The stage of focussing the light of the personality, a dual light.c. The stage of meditation and the recognition of the greater light.d. The unification of the dual light of matter and the light of the soul,creating thus the searchlight of the mind. [220]2. A process of alignment and of recognised integration.3. A deliberate turning of the searchlight of the mind to the astral plane.The Formula4. Soul activity and the retention of the light.5. The generating and visualising of the searchlight.6. The evocation of the will behind the searchlight of the mind.7. The generated unified light is turned upon the glamour by the power ofthought.8. The naming of the glamour and the triple affirmation.9. The Act of Penetration.10. The Process of Withdrawing.You will see, brother of mine, that what I am in fact doing is teaching thecoming generation how to destroy those forms of thought which hold the race inbondage and which in the case of glamour are the forms which desire, emotion,sensitivity to environment, developing aspiration and old ideals have taken andwhich prevent the light of the soul from illuminating the waking consciousness.The energies taking form upon the astral plane are not pure emotion and feeling,clothed in pure astral matter, for there is no such thing. They are theinstinctual desires, evoked by the evolving substance of the physical plane andthis, in its entirety and through the activity of the human family, is beingredeemed and drawn upwards until some day we shall see the transfiguration ofthat substance and the “Glorification of the Virgin Mary”—the Mother Aspect inrelation to divinity. They are also the descending thoughtforms which thedeveloping human being is always creating and [221] drawing downwards intomanifestation, clothing them with the substance of desire. When the descendingforms of thought (a reflection in the three worlds of that vast “cloud ofknowable things” in process of perception, as Patanjali calls it, and whichhovers upon the buddhic plane, awaiting precipitation) and the ascending mass ofinstinctual demands from the lower aspect of the human unit and from humanity asa whole, meet at a point of tension then you have the appearance of what isknown as the astral plane—a man-created sphere of activity. The subhumankingdoms of nature know no astral plane; the superhuman kingdoms have surmountedit and discovered the secret of its delusion and no longer recognise it exceptas a temporary field of experience wherein man lives. In that sphere he learnsthe fact that reality is “none of these but only the One and the Other inrelation with each other.” This is one of the occult phrases which the disciplehas to learn to understand and which is descriptive of manifestation.b. The Dissipation of Group Glamour and of World GlamourGroup work in dissipating world glamour must be handled (as will be obvious toyou) by those who are working at the dissipation of glamour in their own livesand have learnt to use the formula just given. The majority of those so workingare sixth ray aspirants—those who have sixth ray personalities or whose soul rayis the sixth, plus those on all rays who have powerful sixth ray astralvehicles. These make the most effective workers in the group but are subject toone major difficulty. In spite of aspiration and good intention, they are seldomaware of the glamours which control them. It is exceedingly hard to induce thesixth ray aspirant to admit that he is held [222] by a glamour, particularlywhen it is glamour of spiritual connotation and of a very high order. In theircase, the glamour is enhanced by the energy of devotion which stiffens it andbrings in a quality which makes it most difficult to penetrate. Their completeassurance proves a serious obstacle to clear-sighted work because that has allto go before the work of dissipation can be carried forward successfully. Firstray people can overcome glamour with relative ease once they become aware of itas a personality limitation. Third ray people are as susceptible to it as arethose of the sixth ray and their devious, twisting, planning minds and therapidity with which they can deceive themselves (and seek often to deceiveothers) greatly hinders their work of clearing away glamour. Their pronouncedtendency to be the victims of glamour is evidenced by the inability of the thirdray aspirant and disciple to convey his meaning clearly by speech. He hasguarded himself for many lives by devious formulations of thought and of ideasand can seldom convey his meaning clearly. This is why sixth ray people andthird ray people almost inevitably prove themselves unable to teach. Both thesegroups must, therefore, learn to use this formula and they would greatly hastenthe process of dissipation if they would force themselves to speak or writetheir thoughts clearly, if they would never be ambiguous or deal in halfthoughts, innuendo or suggestion. They should clearly enunciate the ideas withwhich they may be dealing.The seventh ray person is faced with the difficulty of being able to createexceedingly clear-cut thoughtforms and the glamours, therefore, which controlhim are precise and definite and, to him, all compelling. They rapidlycrystallise, however, and die their own death. Second ray aspirants are usuallyfully aware of any glamour which may be seeking to hold them because they havean innate faculty [223] of clear perception. Their problem is to kill out inthemselves their rapid response to the magnetic pull of the astral plane and itsmany and widespread glamours. They are not so frequently responsive to a glamouras to all glamours in a relatively temporary manner but one which isnevertheless exceedingly delaying to their progress. Because of theirclearsightedness, they add to this sensitivity to glamour an ability to sufferabout it and to register their responsiveness as a sin and failure and thusdelay their liberation from it by a negative attitude of inferiority anddistress. They will profit enormously from a constant use of the formula untilthe time comes when they are aware of the glamour or glamours but are nottouched by them. Fifth ray people suffer the least from glamour but areprimarily the victims of illusion, and for them the Technique of the Presence isall-important because it brings in a factor which the true fifth ray person isapt to negate and refuse to admit, the fact of the Higher Self. He feelsself-sufficient. They respond so easily and with such satisfaction to the powerof thought; pride in their mental competence is their besetting sin and theyare, therefore, set in their purposes and preoccupied with the world of theconcrete and the intellectual. The moment that the Angel of the Presence is areality to them, their response to illusion weakens and disappears. Their majorproblem is not so much the negation of the astral body, for they are apt todespise its hold, but they have a major difficulty in recognising that which themind is intended to reveal—the divine spiritual Self. Their lower concrete mindinterposes itself between them and the vision.Fourth ray people are peculiarly prone to fall into glamour and thus to producea condition which is one of extreme difficulty. I might define their problem bysaying that they tend to bring their illusions down to the astral plane andthere clothe them with glamour and have consequently [224] a double problem upontheir hands; they are faced with a unification of glamour and illusion. Theyare, however, the group of souls which will eventually reveal the true nature ofthe intuition and this will be the result of their illusory glamorous fight inthe world of appearances.We come now to the consideration of the formula to be used by those who seek toserve humanity by deliberately breaking up and dispersing the glamours whichhold the race in thrall and who know the need to do this in group formation.Certain individual characteristics are essential for the personnel of suchgroups. First of all there must be an ability to work “without attachment” toresults and to use the formula for a given length of time (for instance, once aweek for two years or more) without looking for results; they need to realisethat they can never know whether they are successful or not, because theglamours they are attempting to dissipate are so widespread and general thateffects cannot be grasped by their individual minds. They are too close to thepicture; their perspective has necessarily to be that of the immediateforeground. Secondly, they must have an intelligent appreciation of whatconstitutes a world glamour so that they can occultly “name it” and, by sodoing, contact it. They must, thirdly, be accustomed to the work of dispersingglamour in their own lives; the necessity to do this and their success in sodoing are factors which indicate their suitability for the task.They must, finally, love their fellowmen. This they must not do as the sixth rayperson loves them, with an isolating devotion, but as the second ray personloves—with an all round appreciation of humanity, an understanding heart, plus acritical mind, which loves steadily in spite of error seen, with a clear sightedperception of the assets and the debits of an individual or a race. The abilityto [225] do this is one of the factors which enables the sixth ray aspirant totransfer off the minor sixth ray and find his place upon the major second ray,as must all sixth and fourth ray initiates.One of the requirements in this group work is a most careful choice of those whoare to participate in the work. They must be chosen because they can worktogether. They must either know each other exceedingly well and be free frompersonality frictions or they must be relatively unknown to each other aspersonalities but are drawn to each other as soul-collaborators in thisparticular work. They must, as far as in them lies, endeavour to work withregularity so that a rhythm can be set up which will lead to a steady rhythmicimpact of the light upon the glamour. They must also adhere faithfully to theformula given. This is one of the initial formulas and is most powerful becauseit is one of the very first to be used in group dissipation of glamour. Thiswhole procedure is entirely new as far as man is concerned, and the work to bedone will necessarily prove hard as it involves an interesting situation. Thegroups who will do this work of piercing the glamours which dim the vision ofhumanity and of dissipating them will be the first non-initiate groups to workthis way upon the physical plane and to work consciously and with fixed intent.Hitherto the work has been carried forward by members of the Hierarchy, and thenonly with the idea of holding back the glamours until such time as humanity wasready to destroy that which it had created. Glamours have also been piercedbefore now by massed effort carried forward for a long time and usually withoutany very real conscious understanding. An illustration of this would be the workdone by the Church in a diffused and vague way in piercing the glamour ofmaterial desire and material good by substituting the idea of a heavenlysubstitute. The work that is [226] now planned is dynamic and clear cut,consciously carried forward and specific in its impact. It is a definite methodof handling and projecting the energy of light with the objective of destroyingthe impediments of an emotional-mental nature upon the Path of Return to God.It is desirable and aids an easier and more concentrated form of work if thegroup can meet together for the use of the formula. If, however, this proves notpossible, then the personnel of the group can arrange to work apart but with theidea of the work being group work firmly realised and with a steady recognitionof the members who form the group body. This is necessary both for the “poolingof the light” and also for protection from the glamour to be attacked. This“pooling of the light” is a major requirement and must ever be borne in mind.Whenever possible, the rule should be that the work is done at some definiteplanned group meeting, even if this entails quite drastic sacrifice on the partof some of the members.I advise that some glamour which all the group members recognise as a majorhindrance to the progress of humanity be one of the first handled by the group.I would also advise that in the early stages of their work, they deal with aglamour affecting aspirants and that they do not attempt to tackle the morewidely spread and deeply centred glamours of the race as a whole. Let themdevelop facility in handling some of the lesser and more easily visualisedglamours. Then as time goes on and facility in the work is gained, the group canpass to the more difficult tasks and handle the glamours further removed fromtheir own orbit of difficulties. It is surely needless for me to point out thatthe group members be but those who are endeavouring to keep their own lives freefrom glamour. I would also add that if a group member is in the thick of glamourhimself and is occupied with wrestling with it, he should abstain [227] from thegroup work until he has freed himself with the aid of the individual formula.Those who can face themselves with an open eye and who see the truth as it is,who can face the same facts in connection with humanity, and can stand sereneand unafraid in the face of the worst kind of discoveries about themselves andthe world of men, are those who will employ this technique with the mostsuccess. I would also remind you that the group will need to protect itself fromthe glamour or glamours which it is attempting to dissipate. Their individualtendency to glamour is the factor which gives them the right to serve in thisway but it also lays them open to danger, and for this a protective formula willbe necessary.The formula will, therefore, be divided into three parts:1. The Preparatory Stages.2. The Use of the Protective Formula.3. Group Formula for the Dissipation of Glamour.The work done by the individual in dealing with his personal problems of glamourwill greatly facilitate the preparatory work of the group.You will note that in outlining to you this work, I make no reference to thetype of room, to the position of the group members, to posture assumed, to theuse of incense, or to any of the paraphernalia which so many occult groups deemof importance. The set physical rituals are today (from the angle of theHierarchy) entirely obsolete and of no importance where disciples and advancedaspirants are concerned. They are of value to the little evolved in whom thesense of drama has to be developed and who need external aids, and they doprovide a setting which serves to help beginners to keep the theme of their workand their objective in view. The only ritual which is [228] still regarded as ofvalue to the human family as a whole—particularly to the advanced person—is theMasonic Ritual. The reason for this is that it is a pictorial representation ofthe process of Creation, of the relation between God and man, of the Path ofReturn and also of those great Initiations through the means of which theliberated initiate passes into the Council Chamber of the Most High. But withthe exception of this, the small petty rituals of position and of physicalrelations in respect to attitude and seating arrangements are regarded asunnecessary and as usurping frequently the attention which should be given tothe work in hand.Those using these formulas are presumed to have acquired some measure of innerpolarisation and to be able to withdraw themselves to their spiritual centre inany place and at any time. This is the centre of quiet thought from whence thework is carried on.All that is needed as a preface to this group work is ten minutes of completesilence in which the group members attempt to set up that magnetic field ofpositive receptive activity (note here the paradoxes of the occult sciences)which will make the rest of the work possible.The leader of the group (chosen in rotation so that all the members of the groupoccupy that position) starts the work by calling the names of the group membersand as each name is called, the other group members look directly into the eyesof the one named, who rises and for a minute faces them. Thus a rapport and arelationship is established because the directive magnetic force of each soul isalways reached from “eye to eye.” This is the occult significance of the words“Can you look me in the eye?” or “They eyed each other” and similar phrases.Then, having established this interlocking relationship, the group sits insilence for ten minutes. This is done in order to withdraw the consciousness[229] from all world and personal affairs and centre it upon the work to bedone. At the end of that time, the leader names the glamour with which the groupis to be occupied. There will be no dissension anent the glamour at the time ofthe group meeting because the group members—outside the meetings and for a monthprior to undertaking the task of dissipating the glamour will have made a studyof it, its implications, its historicity and effects—psychological, individual,group and national, and also its widespread influence over humanity as a whole.The experience of the group in this type of work will determine the nature ofthe glamour to be dealt with. As I earlier pointed out, the inexperienced groupof workers will begin by dealing with one of the glamours which hinder aspirantsand will pass on from these to handle the more powerful and more widelydispersed glamours which trouble humanity as a whole. This preface to the workis frequently called the Act of Naming , because both the group members and alsothe glamour are named.The next stage is similar to the preparatory stages in the formula for thedissipation of glamour for the individual. You have therefore the following:THE PREPARATORY STAGES1. The Act of Naming.2. The Protective Formula.The Protective Formula is very simple. The members of the group will say inunison:“As a soul I work in light and darkness cannot touch me.I take my stand within the light.I work and from that point I never move.”[230] As they say this, each person in the group makes the sign of the Cross bytouching the centre of the forehead, the centre of the chest, and each of thetwo eyes, thus forming the long limbed Cross of the Christ or of divinehumanity. The Cross is not, as you well know, simply a Christian symbol. It isthe great symbol of light and of consciousness and signifies the vertical lightand the horizontal light, the power of attraction and the power of radiation,soul life and service. The Cross as now made in the Catholic Churches, touchingthe forehead, the heart and the two shoulders is the sign of matter. Itsignifies in reality the third Aspect. The Cross which the group will make isthe Cross of Christ and of the Christ consciousness. Gradually the Cross ofChrist (the Cross of the Risen Christ) will supersede the Cross of matter and ofthe Mother aspect. Its likeness to the swastika is obvious and will be one ofthe reasons for its disappearance.3. The Preparatory Stages:a. Focussing the dual personality light of matter and of mind.b. Meditation on soul contact and the recognition of soul light.c. The blending and fusion of the two lesser lights and of soul light. This iscarried forward as a group, each member making his contribution and consciouslyattempting to visualise the process of blending the triple light which eachcontributes, into one sphere of light.4. Then the group says in unison, at a signal from the leader: [231]“The light is one and in that light shall we see light.This is the light that turns the darkness into day.”OM. OM. OM.The processes of individual and group alignment and integration can now beregarded as completed and when it is really correctly accomplished, each meetingthereafter should see a more rapid integration and fusion and a greaterbrilliance of the sphere of light thus created. The sounding of OM indicatesboth the fusion and the sphere of action because OM is first of all soundedforth by the group soul (the realised unity of the souls of all the groupmembers) and then as the soul upon the mental plane, and finally as the soulready to function as lightbearer and distributor of light upon the astral plane.These are all symbolic ways of registering the inner reality and are an attemptto externalise force, for that is what all symbols and symbolic ways of actingare capable of doing; they thus serve to keep the workers at a point of tension.This is an important recognition and should keep the workers from attributingundue power to the form aspect of the simple ritual and aid them in focussingtheir attention in the world of meaning and of subjective spiritual activity.These three stages are called:1. The Act of Naming.2. The Act of Protection.3. The Act of Focussing the Light.It will be apparent to you that much depends upon the ability of the groupmembers to visualise clearly as well as to think clearly. Practice naturallytends to perfect both processes. At the close of these three stages, the groupmembers are united as souls insulated against the attractive power of theglamour, and united as souls with mind and brain held steady and positive in thelight. Their blended [232] light is looked upon by them as a great searchlightwhose beams are to be directed through an act of the will downward from themental plane on to the glamour existing on the astral plane and which has beenbrought into relation with the group by the very act of naming it. I am goinginto detail on this matter because the work is a new venture and I am anxiousfor you to start it with a clear understanding as to how the task is to becarried out. At the close of this instruction you will find the two long and twoshort formulas so that they can be seen and grasped apart from their explanatorycontext. This initial work should take fifteen minutes at first and later notmore than five (excluding the ten minutes of silent preparation which precedesthe formal work) for the group members will get used to working together andwill eventually attain the objectives of the preparatory work with greatrapidity.THE TECHNIQUE OR FORMULA5. Then together and in vocal unison the group says:“Radiance we are and power. We stand forever with our hands stretched out,linking the heavens and the earth, the inner world of meaning and the subtleworld of glamour.“We reach into the Light and bring it down to meet the need. We reach into thesilent Place and bring from thence the gift of understanding. Thus with thelight we work and turn the darkness into day.”As they say this, the group visualises the turning of the great searchlightwhich they have jointly created by their unified light on to the glamour to bedissipated, holding the light steady [233] and realising mentally the work ofdissipation it is intended to do. This is called the Act of Direction.6. Then follows a pause for a few minutes in which the group attempts to throwbehind the searchlight their united directed and dynamic will or intent; thiscarries along the projected beam of light the destructive quality of thespiritual will—destructive to all that hinders the manifestation of divinity.This is done by attaining a united point of tension, and the dedication of theindividual and group will to the will of God. This is called the Act of Will andis carried on by each member of the group silently and with a deep realisationthat all are thus accepted and that it is the group will which is being silentlyfocussed. Then together they say:“With power upon its beam, the light is focussed on the goal.”7. Then comes the Act of Projection and the saying of the words of powerwhich—again naming the particular glamour which is the subject of attention andthus bringing it consciously into relation with the focussed light—begins thetask of dissipation.“The power of our united light prevents the appearance of the glamour of ...(naming it). The power of our united light negates the quality of the glamourfrom affecting men. The power of our united light destroys the life behind theglamour.”These words are very nearly the same as those in the individual formula and gainstrength from the experience of the aspirant and from his familiarity with theiruse. This constitutes an Act of Affirmation [234] which is the second part ofthe Act of Projection.8. Then comes an important aspect of the work in which the group membersvisualise the gradual dissipation and dispersal of the glamour by thepenetration of the light into its darkness. They endeavour to see itdisintegrating and the reality emerging, doing this by an effort of the creativeimagination. Each will do this in his own way and according to his understandingand capacity. This is the Act of Penetration.9. Now follows five minutes of silence and intensity of purpose while the groupwaits for the work instituted to go forward. Then follows the group withdrawalof its consciousness from the astral plane and the world of glamour. The groupmembers refocus their attention first of all on the mental plane and then on thesoul, relinquishing all thought of the glamour, knowing that the work has beensuccessfully carried forward. They re-organise themselves as a group in relationto the kingdom of souls and to each other. Occultly speaking, the “searchlightof the soul is shut off.” This is the Act of Withdrawal.10. The OM is then sounded in group formation; and then, in order to emphasisethat the group work is ended, each member of the group sounds the OM alone,saying:“So let it be, and help me in my own life to end all glamour and untruth.”It will take aspirants some time to gain facility in this work, but it is surelyobvious that in learning what is an [235] entirely new technique of service eachstep must be mastered and practised for quite a long time. Every new branch oflearning takes some time to become familiar and this one is no exception. Butthe effort is well worth while both from the individual angle and as an act ofservice to humanity.That all the groups may learn to function in the light and that glamour maydisappear from all your lives so that you may walk freely in that light and usethat light for others is the wish of my heart for you.FORMULA FOR THE DISSIPATION OF GLAMOUR(For the Individual)Preparatory Stages.1. Recognition of the glamour to be dissipated. This involves:a. A willingness to cooperate with the soul.b. Understanding the nature of the particular glamour.2. The three stages of focussing:a. Focussing the dual light of matter and mind in the mental body.b. Focussing, through meditation, this dual light and the light of the soul.c. Focussing these three lights and so creating the searchlight for thedissipation of glamour.3. Preparedness through alignment and integration. This is the production of afield of magnetic thought substance.4. The turning of the attention and of the searchlight of the mind on to theastral plane. [236]The Formula.5. The soul breathes out the OM into the waiting personality and the light andpower thus generated are retained for use.6. An intense light is slowly and consciously generated.7. The spiritual will is invoked whilst the mind is held steady in the light.8. The glamour to be dissipated and the searchlight of the mind are brought intorelationship.9. The searchlight is then turned on by an act of the will and a strong beam oflight is projected into the glamour.10. The glamour is named and the aspirant says with tension inaudibly:“The power of the light prevents the appearance of the glamour (naming it). Thepower of the light negates the quality of the glamour from affecting me. Thepower of the light destroys the life behind the glamour.”11. The OM is sounded by the aspirant, producing an Act of Penetration. Thisproduces impact, penetration and dissipation.12. The aspirant, having done his work, withdraws himself consciously on to themental plane and the beam of light fades out.Brief Form of the Individual Formula.1. The four preparatory stages:a.

On a signal from the leader, the group says together:“The light is one and in that light shall we see light. This is the light thatturns the darkness into day.”OM. OM. OM.The Formula.5. Then together the group says:“Radiance are we and power. We stand forever with our hands stretched out,linking the heavens and the earth, the inner world of meaning and the subtleworld of glamour.We reach into the light and bring it down to meet the need. We reach into thesilent Place and bring from thence the gift of understanding. Thus with thelight we work and turn the darkness into day.”[239] As these words are said, the group members visualise the great searchlightthey have created turning its light upon the astral plane.6. A pause follows and then comes the invocation of the spiritual will. Whenthis has been done the group says:“With power upon its beam, the light is focussed on the goal.”7. The glamour to be dissipated is named and the light is thrown upon it. TheWords of Power are uttered :“The power of our united light prevents the appearance of the glamour of...(naming it).The power of our united light negates the quality of the glamour from affectingman.The power of our united light destroys the life behind the glamour.”8. Visualisation of the light, penetrating into the glamour and producing itsweakening and dissipation.9. Five minutes of silence and intensity of purpose whilst the work is seenproceeding. Then the group members refocus themselves upon the mental plane,turning their attention away from the astral plane. The searchlight of the soulis shut off.10. The sounding of the OM individually and aloud by each member.Brief Form of the Group Formula.1. The Act of Naming.2. The Act of Protection.3. The Act of Focussing the Lights.4. The Act of Direction. [240]5. The Act of Invoking the Will.6. The Act of Projection and Affirmation.7. The Act of Penetration.8. The Act of Withdrawal.Our consideration of glamour is nearing its close. We have carried a consecutivetheme steadily and have traced the threefold aspect of the world illusion as itappears upon the mental plane, and there conditions the intelligentsia of theworld; as it appears upon the astral plane where it constitutes the glamour towhich the masses of men succumb; we shall now consider the world of maya inwhich we, physically, live and move and have our being.I wonder if those who read my words appreciate the importance of this entiresubject or if they are aware of the wide field of service which it opens up,making practical—as it does—all human living, and indicating likewise the stepswhereby Reality can be known and all veiling forms disappear. Behind these wordsof illusion, glamour and maya, lies TRUTH. This truth is the clear consciousnessof Being, of Existence and of essential, initial Reality. That is the reasonthat Christ stood mute before Pilate who symbolised the human intellect; He knewthat no reply could convey meaning to that veiled, inhibited mind.Illusion is the mode whereby limited understanding and material knowledgeinterpret truth, veiling and hiding it behind a cloud of thoughtforms. Thosethoughtforms become then more real than the truth they veil, and consequentlycontrol man’s approach to Reality. Through illusion, he becomes aware of theapparatus of thought, of its activity, expressed in thoughtform building, and ofthat which he succeeds in constructing and which he views as the creation of hisintellect. He has, however, created a barrier between himself and that which isand, until he has exhausted [241] the resources of his intellect or hasdeliberately refused to utilise it, his divine intuition cannot function. It isthe intuition which reveals true Being and which induces a state of spiritualperception. Then the technique of the PRESENCE becomes an established habit.Glamour, in its turn, veils and hides the truth behind the fogs and mists offeeling and emotional reaction; it is of unique and terrible potency, owing tothe strength of human nature to identify itself with the astral nature and tothe vital nature of conscious and sentient response itself. As you know and havebeen taught, glamour can only be dissipated by the inflow of clear, directedlight; this is true of the life of the individual or of humanity as a whole.Illumination reveals first of all the existence of glamour; it provides thedistressing contrasts with which all true aspirants wrestle and then graduallyit floods the life to such an extent that eventually glamour completelyvanishes. Men see things then as they are—a facade hiding the good, thebeautiful and true. The opposites are then resolved and consciousness issuperseded by a condition of realisation—a realisation of Being for which wehave no adequate term. The technique of LIGHT becomes a permanent condition.3. THE TECHNIQUE OF INDIFFERENCEWe come now to a brief study of the third aspect of illusion, to which we givethe name Maya , and to the technique which can overcome it. We will deal nextwith the Technique of Indifference which is concerned with the distribution ofsoul force upon the physical plane, via the etheric plane, leading toinspiration. This is related to the Science of the Breath.What then is maya? This, my brother, is not easy to define because it is relatedto the form-building activity of [242] the planetary Logos Himself. However, aconsideration of the analogy existing between the microcosm and the Macrocosmmay help somewhat. The soul creates a threefold expression in the three worldsof human living. This is an occult truism. The outer form, the dual physicalbody (dense and vital or etheric) is produced, created, motivated, energised andconditioned by certain energies and forces, emanating from those levels whereonthe soul has—rightly or wrongly—engineered a reaction of identification . Notethis phrase, my brother. These make the man what he is; they give him histemperament, profession and quality upon the physical plane; they make himnegative or positive to various types of impacting energy; they give him hischaracter and make him what he appears to be to others; they produce hiscolouring, his capacities and his personality. With all of these the average manidentifies himself; he believes himself to be the form, the medium through whichhe attempts to express his desires and his ideas. This complete identificationwith the transient creation and with the outer appearance is maya. It must beremembered that individual maya is a fractional part of the world of energiesand forces which constitute the life expression of the planetary Logos, whichcondition our outer planetary life, and make our planet what it appears to be tothe other planets.The difference between man, the microcosm, and the planetary Logos, the Lord ofthe World, the Macrocosm, lies in the fact that the Lord of the World is notidentified with the maya which He has created, and which has its purpose ineventually bringing about the release of the “prisoners of the planet.” To thatMaya, HE is supremely indifferent and it is this divine indifference which hasled to the great theological illusion of an anthropomorphic Deity and to thebelief (in the East) that our planet is but the background [243] or theplaything of the Gods. It is this cosmic indifference which has led to the humanglamour concerning the “inscrutable will of God” and to the affirmation that Godis far away and not immanent in every creature and in every atom of whichcreatures are made. These are some aspects of the glamours and illusions whichmust be dispelled and dissipated and, in the process, discovery will be madethat the form is only maya and can be disregarded, that forces can be organisedand directed by energy and that the world of thought, the field of sentientconsciousness and the playground of the energies are something apart from theThinker, from the One who feels and from the Actor and Player of the many partswhich the Soul undertakes to play.The disciple learns eventually to know himself to be, above everything else(whilst in incarnation), the director of forces: these he directs from thealtitude of the divine Observer and through the attainment of detachment. Theseare things which I have oft told you before. These truths are, for you, only theplatitudes of occultism and yet, if you could but grasp the full significance ofdetachment and stand serene as the observing Director, there would be no morewaste motion, no more mistaken moves and no more false interpretations, nowandering down the bypaths of daily living, no seeing others through distortedand prejudiced vision and—above all—no more misuse of force.Again and again, down the ages, the Masters have told Their disciples (as I havetold you) that the occultist works in the world of forces. All human beings liveand move and express themselves in and through that same world of ever-moving,ever-impacting, outgoing and incoming energies. The occultist, however, worksthere; he becomes a conscious directing agent; he creates upon the physicalplane that which he desires, and that which he desires is the pattern of [244]things and the design laid down upon the trestle board of the spiritualconsciousness by the great divine Architect. Yet he identifies himself not withthe pattern or with the forces which he employs. He moves in the world of maya,free from all illusion, unhindered by glamour and uncontrolled by the mayavicforces. He is rapidly arriving, as far as his own little world is concerned, atthe same “divine indifference” which characterises Sanat Kumara, the Lord of theWorld; therefore increasingly he becomes aware of the Plan as it exists in theUniversal Mind and the Purpose which motivates the Will of God.It is this divine indifference which is responsible for the fact that inattempting to describe “Pure Being” or God, and in the effort to arrive at someunderstanding of the nature of divinity, the formula of negation has beenevolved. God is not this; God is not that; God is no-thing; God is neither timenor space; God is not feeling or thought; God is not form or substance. Godsimply IS. God IS —apart from all expression and manifestation as theManipulator of energy, the Creator of the tangible and the intangible worlds,the Pervader of life, or the Indweller in all forms. God is the ONE WHO canwithdraw and, in withdrawing, dispel, dissipate and devitalise all that has beencreated—using those words in their fullest significance.It will be obvious to you, therefore, that in these three activities of thatReality which is not identified with appearance, the will of God, the Destroyeraspect of Deity, is beneficently present. The act of abstraction produces thedispelling of the illusory world of thought; the withdrawal of the divineattention dissipates the sentient universe and brings glamour to an end; thecessation of divine direction brings death to the physical world. All theseactivities are evidences of the will or of the first aspect—the will-to-goodwhich can and will function in perfection only when goodwill [245] is finallyand fully developed on Earth, through the agency of humanity.The will and the breath, my brother, are occultly synonymous terms . In thisstatement you have the clue to the ending of maya.The above remarks are preliminary to our study of the Technique of Indifference.It is necessary to point out analogies and to link together the various aspectsof related teaching if true perception is to be developed. Let us divide ourconsideration of this subject as follows:1. Activity upon the etheric plane, i.e., the world of forces.a. Their distribution.b. Their manipulation.2. The Science of the Breath.a. The relation of the will and the breath.b. Inspiration.3. The Technique of Indifference.a. Through concentration.b. Through detachment.We enter now the field of practical occultism. This is not the field ofaspiration or the sphere of a planned moving forward towards that which ishigher and desirable. It is, in some ways, a reverse activity. From the pointreached upon the ladder of evolution, the disciple “stands in spiritual Being”(as far as in him lies), and consciously, deliberately works with the energiesin the three worlds. He directs them into the etheric body from whatever levelhe chooses to work—mental, emotional, or from the vital plane itself. He doesthis in conformity with some visioned idea, some cherished ideal, some senseddivine pattern, some spiritual hope, some consecrated ambition or some dedicateddesire.[246] The etheric body of the individual is, as you know, a part of the ethericbody of humanity and this, in its turn, is an aspect of the etheric body of theplanet, which is likewise an intrinsic part of the etheric body of the solarsystem. Incidentally, in this far-reaching factual relationship, you have thebasis of all astrological influences. Man moves, therefore, in a whirlpool offorces of all types and qualities. He is composed of energies in every part ofhis manifested and unmanifested expression; he is, therefore, related to allother energies. His task is one of supreme difficulty and needs the great lengthof the evolutionary cycle. With the mass of world energies and systemic forceswe cannot here deal, but we will confine ourselves to the consideration of theindividual problem, advising the student to endeavour to extend hisunderstanding of the microcosmic situation to the macrocosmic.a. Force distribution and manipulation upon the etheric plane.We will now assume that the aspirant is aware of the need for him to establish anew and higher rhythm in his physical plane life, to organise his time inobedience to the injunction of his higher self, and to produce, consciously andscientifically, those effects which—in his highest moments—are presented to himas desirable. He has now a certain amount of knowledge as to the equipmentavailable for his task and has mastered some facts anent the etheric vehicle.The pairs of opposites are clearly seen by him, even if he is as yet influencedby one or other of them; he is aware of a basic disagreement between his visionof goodness and his expression of that goodness. He has learnt that he is atriple reflection of a higher Trinity and that this Trinity is—for him—theReality. He understands that [247] mind, emotions and physical being areintended eventually to manifest that Reality. In the last analysis, he knowsthat if that intermediate aspect of himself, the etheric body, can be controlledand rightly directed, then vision and expression will and must finally coincide.He is also aware that the dense physical body (the outer tangible appearance) isonly an automaton, obedient to whatever forces and energies are the controllingfactors in the subjective, conditioning the man. Is that physical body to becontrolled by emotional force, pouring through the sacral centre and producingdesire for the satisfaction of the physical appetites, or through the solarplexus leading to emotional satisfaction of some kind? Is it to be responsive tothe mind and work largely under the impulse of projected thought? Is it perhapsto be directed by an energy greater than any of these but hitherto apparentlyimpotent, the energy of the soul as an expression of pure Being? Is it to beswept into action under the impulse of sentient reactions, ideas and thoughts,emanating from other human beings or is it to be motivated and spurred intoactivity under the direction of the spiritual Hierarchy? Such are some of thequestions to which answers must be found. The stage of aspiring, dreaming and ofwishful thinking must now be superseded by direct action and by the carefullyplanned use of the available forces, swept into activity by the breath, underthe direction of the inner eye and controlled by the spiritual man. Whichenergies can and must be thus used? What forces must be brought under direction?In what manner can they be controlled? Should they be ignored and so renderedfutile by that ignoring, or are they forces which are needed in the greatcreative work?It will be apparent to you that the first step the spiritual investigator has totake is to ascertain—truly and in the light of his soul—where exactly is hisfocus of identification. [248] By that I mean: Is his major use of energy to befound upon the mental plane? Is he predominantly emotional and utilising forcefrom the astral plane the greater part of the time? Can he contact the soul andbring in soul energy in such a manner that it negates or offsets his personalityforce? Can he thus live like a soul upon the physical plane, via the ethericbody? If he earnestly studies this problem, he will in time discover whichforces are dominant in the etheric body and will become aware consciously of thetimes and experience which call for the expenditure of soul energy. This, mybrother, will take time and will be the result of prolonged observation and aclose analysis of acts and sentient reactions, of words and thoughts. We arehere concerned, as you can see, with an intensely practical problem which is atthe same time an intrinsic part of our study and which will be evocative ofbasic changes in the life of the disciple.He will add to this observation and analysis of the strength of the force or theforces engaged, the conditions which will swing them into action, the frequencyof their appearance, indicating to him novelty or habit, and likewise the natureof their expression. In this way, he will arrive at a new understanding of theconditioning factors which work through his vital body and make him—upon thephysical plane—what he essentially is. This will prove to him of deep spiritualand significant help.This period of observation is, however, confined to mental and intelligentobservation. It forms the background of the work to be done, giving assuranceand knowledge but leaving the situation as it was. His next step is to becomeaware of the quality of the forces applied; in ascertaining this, he will findit necessary to discover not only his soul ray and his personality ray but toknow also the rays of his mental apparatus, and his emotional nature. This willlead [249] necessarily to another period of investigation and carefulobservation, if he is not already aware of them. When I tell you that to thisinformation he must add a close consideration of the potencies of the forces andenergies reaching him astrologically, you will see what a stern task he has sethimself. Not only has he to isolate his five ray energies, but he has to allowfor the energy of his sun sign as it conditions his personality, and of hisrising sign as it seeks to stimulate that personality into soul responsiveness,thus working out soul purpose through personality cooperation.There are, therefore, seven factors which condition the quality of the forceswhich seek expression through the etheric body:1. The ray of the soul.2. The ray of the personality.3. The ray of the mind.4. The ray of the emotional nature.5. The ray of the physical vehicle.6. The energy of the sun sign.7. The influence of the rising sign.Once, however, these are ascertained and there is some assurance as to theirfactual truth, the entire problem begins to clarify and the disciple can workwith knowledge and understanding. He becomes a scientific worker in the field ofhidden forces. He knows then what he is doing, with what energies he must work,and he begins to feel these energies as they find their way into the ethericvehicle.Now comes the stage wherein he is in a position to find out the reality and thework of the seven centres which provide inlet and outlet for the moving forcesand energies with which he is immediately concerned in this particularincarnation. He enters upon a prolonged period of observation, of experiment andexperience and institutes a trial and error, [250] a success and failure,campaign which will call for all the strength, courage and endurance of which heis capable.Broadly speaking, the energy of the soul works through the highest head centreand is brought into activity through meditation and applied aptitude in contact.The energy of the integrated personality is focussed through the ajna centre,between the eyes; and when the disciple can identify himself with that, and isalso aware of the nature and the vibration of his soul energy, then he can beginto work with the power of direction, using the eyes as directing agencies. Thereare, as you have gathered in your studies, three eyes of vision and direction atthe disposal of the disciple.1. The inner eye , the single eye of the spiritual man. This is the true eye ofvision and involves the idea of duality (of the see-er and that which is seen).It is the divine eye. It is that through which the soul looks forth into theworld of men and through which direction of the personality takes place.2. The right eye , the eye of buddhi, the eye which is in direct responsiverelation to the inner eye. Through this eye the highest activity of thepersonality can be directed upon the physical plane . You have therefore in thisconnection a triangle of spiritual forces which can be swept into uniqueactivity by the advanced disciple and initiate.[Image00003.jpg][251] It is through this triplicity, for instance, that the trained initiateworks when dealing with a group of people or with an individual.3. The left eye , the eye of manas, the distributor of mental energy undercorrect control—correct as far as personality purposes are concerned. This eyeis also a part of a triangle of forces, available for the use of the aspirantand the probationary disciple.[Image00003.jpg]The inner or divine eye is quiescent and relatively inactive, being only theorgan of observation where the soul is concerned and it is not yet—in themajority of cases—a distributor of directing soul energy. The disciplinedreoriented aspirant, however, integrated and focussed in his purifiedpersonality, is using both buddhic and manasic force; he is beginning to beintuitional and predominantly mental. It is when these two triangles are undercontrol and are beginning to function properly that the seven centres in theetheric body are brought under clear direction, become the recipients of theestablished rhythm of the developed human being, and present consequently aninstrument to the soul through which appropriate energies can flow and the fullorganisation and purpose of a functioning son of God can be manifested on Earth.Next comes what we have called the stage of direction. The soul or theintegrated personality is in command or—on a higher turn of the spiral—the Monadis in command [252] and the personality is simply then the agent of spirit.Through the two triangles or through both of them working synchronously, thecentres up the spine (five in all) are brought under rhythmic control. Energy isdirected into them or through them; they are steadily brought into a beauty oforganisation which has been described as a “life aflame with God”; it is a lifeof spiritual application and service wherein the higher triangle is the mostpotent.The following three statements sum up the story of the eventual release of thedisciple from the Great Illusion:First: As the soul, working through the higher triangle, becomes the directingagent, illusion is dispelled. The mind becomes illumined.Second: As the personality (under the growing influence of the soul) worksthrough the second triangle, glamour is dissipated. The control of the astralnature is broken.Third: As the disciple, working as the soul and as an integrated personality,assumes direction of his life expression, maya or the world of etheric energiesbecomes devitalised, and only those forces and energies are employed which servethe need of the disciple or the initiate as he fulfils divine intent.You will note that this is all embodied and brought about in the sevenfold workdescribed above. This can be summarised as follows:1. The disciple discovers the focus of his identification.2. He ascertains the nature of the forces he is in the habit of using and whichperpetually seem to swing him into action. [253]3. He becomes aware of the strength and frequency of this force expression.All this is carried forward as the mental observer.4. He becomes conscious of the quality of the forces employed, their rayrelation or their astrological significance.This is a sentient, feeling activity and is not so basically mental as theprevious three stages.5. He identifies the centres in the etheric body and becomes aware of theirindividual existence as force agents.6. The two “triangles of vision and direction” in the head reach a stage oforganisation and becomea. Active and functioning mechanisms.b. Related and functioning, as one expressive instrument. This is an objectiveand subjective activity.7. The galvanising of the physical body into activity through the medium of thedirecting agencies in the head and through the centres up the spine.The question now arises as to how this is to be brought about. This brings us toour second point.b. The use of the Science of the Breath.There has been a great deal of nonsense talked and taught about the science ofthe breath. Many groups give a great deal of dangerous instruction anentbreathing—dangerous because it is based on book knowledge and its exponents havenever practised it extensively themselves, and dangerous because many groupssimply exploit the unready, [254] usually for commercial gain. Fortunately forthe mass of aspirants, the information and the instruction given are bothfeeble, inaccurate and frequently innocuous, though there are many cases ofsignificantly bad reaction; fortunately, also, the purpose of the averageaspirant is so weak that he is incapable of persistent, daily, unchangingcompliance with the requirements and fails to render that application whichwould be the guarantee of a dubious success; hence, in these cases, no dangerexists. Many occult groups exploit the subject in order to build up mystery andto hold out inducements to the unwary, or give their adherents something to doand thus gain kudos for themselves as learned and well trained occultists.Anyone can teach breathing exercises. It is largely a matter of periodicin-breathing and exhalation, timed and spaced according to the wish of theteacher. Where there is persistence in effort, results will be achieved andthese will usually be undesirable because the average teacher emphasises thetechnique of the breath and not the ideas which—upon the energy which thatbreath engenders—should take form in the life of the disciple.The entire science of the breath is built around the use of the Sacred Word, theOM. The use of the Word is intended to be confined to those aspirants who areearnestly pledged to tread the Way, but it has been passed on and its useenjoined by many unscrupulous teachers, particularly those swamis who come fromIndia, pose as Holy Men and get the silly women of the occident into theirclutches. The Word is then used with no spiritual intent but simply as a soundwhich, carried on the breath, produces psychic results which indicate to thegullible their deep spirituality. The trouble is that breathing is inevitablyrelated to the OM, but the effects are dependent upon motive and inner fixedintention. The oriental, unless he has attained the fourth or fifth initiation,has no true understanding of the [255] occidental or of his mechanism andequipment which, as the result of a civilisation and a mode of living, differswidely from that of the oriental. In the East, the problem of the teacher orGuru is to take negatively polarised people and make them positive. In the West,the races are as a whole positive in attitude and need no such training as isrightly given to the oriental. What exactly do I mean when I make thisstatement? I mean that in the East, the will factor (the quality of the firstaspect) is absent. The oriental, particularly the inhabitant of India, lackswill, dynamic incentive and the ability to exert that inner pressure uponhimself which will produce definite results. That is why that particularcivilisation is so unadaptable to modern civilisation, and that is why thepeople of India make so little progress along the lines of regulated municipaland national life, and why they are so behind the times as far as moderncivilised living is concerned. Generalising, the occidental is positive andneeds the directive force of the soul and can produce it with very littleteaching. In the Aryan race, a fusion is today taking place between the willaspect, the mind and the brain. This is not so in the Orient. It will be solater.The only factor which makes the breath effective is the thought, the intent andthe purpose which lie behind it. In this statement, you have the clue to dynamicuseful breathing exercises. Unless there is a clear appreciation of purpose,unless the disciple knows just what he is doing as he practises esotericbreathing, and unless the significance of the words “energy follows thought” isunderstood, breathing exercises are sheer waste of time and can be dangerous.From this it can be gathered that only when there is an alliance betweenbreathing and thinking will results be possible.Behind this lies a third and even more important factor—the WILL. Therefore, theonly person who can safely [256] and usefully practise breathing exercises isthe man whose will is active—his spiritual will and, therefore, the will of theSpiritual Triad. Any disciple who is in process of building the antahkarana canbegin to use, with care, directed breathing exercises. But, in the lastanalysis, it is only the initiates of the third degree and who are coming undermonadic influence who can properly and successfully employ this form of lifedirection and reach effective results. This is fundamentally true. However, abeginning has to be made and to this effort all true disciples are invited.If all the implications in the above paragraph are considered, it will beapparent that the disciple has to establish—as a preliminary step—a directrelation between his brain, his mind and the will aspect of the Spiritual Triad;in other words, the negative receptor of thought (the brain), the agent of thewill (the mind), and the Triad itself, have to be brought into contact with eachother, via the antahkarana. When such a relation exists or is beginning to beestablished, then breathing exercises can safely and profitably be attempted.You see, my brother, only the directed will, using the organised rhythmic breathas its agent, can control the centres and produce an ordered purpose in life.Therefore, it is the dominating idea or line of mental activity with which thedisciple must be concerned as he performs a breathing exercise. This idea mustembody some purpose, some planned activity and some recognised goal before thebreath which will engineer or implement it is generated, assembled, sent forthand thus becomes the carrier of power. This has to be done upon the wings ofconscious intention, if I may here speak symbolically. I would urge you to readthese last sentences with frequency because they concern the Science of theBreath and hold the clue to needed work. This science is primarily andfundamentally concerned with ideas as formulated into clear thoughtforms [257]and thus condition the life of the disciple upon etheric levels. From there,they eventually condition his physical plane life.I have no intention here of giving any breathing exercises which disciples oraspirants could use—or, more probably, misuse. Their first responsibility is tobecome aware of the impulses within themselves which could galvanise the centresinto activity and so produce conditions and events upon the physical plane. Whenthese are clear and firmly established in the mind consciousness of thedisciple, nothing can then stop their emergence in due time into the light ofday. But they must follow an ordered process of gestation and of timedappearance.When there is true idealism, right thought, plus an understanding of the vehicleof expression and the world of forces into which the idea has to be launched,then the student can safely follow certain scheduled breathing exercises and thesecond phase or the result of sound rhythmic breathing will appear. This isInspiration.Breathing exercises, my brother, have a purely physiological effect when notimpelled or motivated by directed thought and when they are not the result ofthe aspirant attaining and adhering to a point of tension. Steadily, whilst theprocess of inhalation and exhalation is being carried forward, a clear line ofactive thinking must be preserved so that the breath (as it is sent out) isqualified and conditioned by some idea. It is here that the average aspirantfails so often. He is usually so intensely preoccupied with the process ofdirecting breathing and so expectant of some phenomenal results, that the livingpurpose of the breath is forgotten; this is to energise and add quality to thelife of the centres through the medium of some projected and presented thought,expressing some sensed and determined idea. Where this background of idealisticthought is lacking, then the results of the breath will be practically nilor—[258] where there are results of any kind under these circumstances—they willbe in no way concerned with thought but will be psychic in nature. They can thenproduce lasting psychic trouble, for the emanating source of the activity isastral and the projected energy goes to centres below the diaphragm, thusfeeding the lower nature, enriching and strengthening its astral content andthereby enhancing and deepening glamour. The results can also be physiological,producing the stimulation of the etheric body leading to the strengthening ofthe physical nature; this often leads to serious results, for the breath iscarried to centres which should be in “process of elevation” as it isesoterically called; this increases their physical potency, feeds the physicalappetites and makes the task of the aspirant much harder as he seeks tosublimate the lower nature and anchor or focus the life of the centres above thediaphragm or in the head.Glamour and maya are then increased and for the life in which these exercisesare misapplied, the aspirant remains in a static and unprofitable condition. Ashe breathes in or inhales, he draws the breath from within his own aura, hisauric ring-pass-not; he feeds the lower nature and sets up a vicious circlewithin himself which strengthens day by day until he is completely enmeshed bythe glamour and maya which he is constantly establishing and re-establishing.The lower centres are steadily vitalised and become extremely active and thepoint of tension from which the aspirant then works is found in the personalityand is not focussed in relation to the soul; the consciousness of the uniquenessof special breathing and the expectancy of phenomenal results bar out allthought, except lower reactions of a kama-manasic nature; emotion is fosteredand the power of the astral body is tremendously increased; very frequently alsothe physiological results are potent and [259] noticeable, such as a great chestdevelopment and the muscular strengthening of the diaphragm. Something of thiscan be seen in the case of operatic singers. Singing, as now taught, is anexpression of some of the lower aspects of the breath, and the breathing in thecase of the above vocalists produces much breast development, intensifyingemotionalism, producing instability in the life expression (which is oftenreferred to as temperament) and keeps the singing aspect entirely astral innature.There is a higher and better mode of song, actuated by a difference in the pointof tension and involving a breathing process which draws the needed energy uponthe breath from sources higher and far more extensive than those normally used;this will produce the inspiration which will involve the whole man and notsimply his emotional reaction to the theme of his song and his audience. Thiswill bring into being a new mode and type of singing and of breathing, based ona form of mental breathing which will carry energy and consequent inspirationfrom sources without the personality aura. The time for this is not yet. Mywords will be little understood today, but the singing in the next century willbe by those who will know how to tap the reservoirs of inspiration by means of anew method and technique in breathing. These techniques and exercises will betaught, to start with, in the new and coming schools of esotericism.Inspiration is a process of qualifying, vitalising and stimulating the reactionof the personality—via the centres—to that point of tension where soul controlbecomes present and apparent. It is the mode whereby energy from the soul canflood the personality life, can sweep through the centres, expelling that whichhinders, ridding the aspirant of all remaining glamours and maya, and perfectingan instrument whereby the music of the soul and, later, the musical quality ofthe Hierarchy can be heard. Forget not [260] that sound permeates all forms; theplanet itself has its own note or sound; each minute atom also has its sound;each form can be evoked into music and each human being has his peculiar chordand all chords contribute to the great symphony which the Hierarchy and Humanityare playing, and playing now. Every spiritual group has its own tune (if I mayemploy so inappropriate a word) and the groups which are in process ofcollaborating with the Hierarchy make music ceaselessly. This rhythm of soundand this myriad of chords and notes blend with the music of the Hierarchy itselfand this is a steadily enriching symphony; as the centuries slip away, all thesesounds slowly unite and are resolved into each other until some day theplanetary symphony which Sanat Kumara is composing will be completed and ourEarth will then make a notable contribution to the great chords of the solarsystem—and this is a part, intrinsic and real, of the music of the spheres.Then, as the Bible says, the Sons of God, the planetary Logoi, will singtogether. This, my brother, will be the result of right breathing, of controlledand organised rhythm, of true pure thought and of the correct relation betweenall parts of the chorus.Think out this theme as a meditation exercise and gain inspiration thereby.c. The Technique of IndifferenceI have, in my other books, given much information anent the etheric body and thecentres—major and minor—which are to be found within its radius. There is atendency among students to identify the centres with the physical body in theirthinking and not so clearly with the etheric body. This concerns location in themajority of cases and is a mistake. Aspirants would do well to avoid anyconcentration at all [261] upon the physical body and learn gradually to shifttheir focus of attention into the etheric body. Necessarily the physical body isactive and potent but increasingly it should be regarded as an automaton,influenced and directed by:1. The vital body and the forces of maya; or by inspiration, emanating frompoints of spiritual tension.2. The astral vehicle and the forces of glamour; or sentient, conscious love,emanating from the soul.3. The mind and the forces of illusion; or by illumination, coming from highersources than the life in the three worlds.4. The soul, as the vehicle of monadic impression, until such time as theantahkarana is built—that bridge in mental matter which will eventually link theMonad and the personality.One of the problems which disciples have to solve is the source of theincentive, impulses, impressions or inspiration which—via the etheric body—sweepthe physical vehicle into activity upon the physical plane, thus giving ademonstration of the quality, purpose and point of tension of the incarnatingman, and manifesting the nature of the man as he is at any particular point uponthe ladder of evolution. According to the tensions and impulses indicated, willbe the activity of the centres. You can see, therefore, how much that I teachreverses the usual occult procedures. I teach no mode of awakening the centresbecause right impulse, steady reaction to higher impulsions and the practicalrecognition of the sources of inspiration will automatically and safely swingthe centres into needed and appropriate activity. This is the sound method ofdevelopment. It is slower, but leads to no premature development and produces arounded out unfoldment; it enables the aspirant to [262] become truly theObserver and to know with surety what he is doing; it brings the centres, one byone, to a point of spiritual responsiveness and then establishes the ordered andcyclic rhythm of a controlled lower nature. That breathing exercises mayeventually find a place in the training of the disciple is true and possible,but they will be self-initiated as a result of rhythmic living and a constantright use of the Sacred Word, the OM. When, for instance, a disciple inmeditation sounds the OM seven times, it is the equivalent of a breathingexercise; when he can send the energy thus generated on the wings of consciousplanned thought to one or other of the centres, he is bringing about changes andreadjustments within the mechanism which handles force, and when this can becarried out with ease and with the mind held at a point of “thought-fulltension,” then the disciple is well on the way to shifting his entire focus ofattention away from the world of illusion, glamour and maya and into the realmof the soul, in the world of the “clear cold light” and into the kingdom of God.When he also adds to this an understanding and the practice of the Technique ofIndifference, he stands free and liberated and is essentially at all times theObserver and User of the apparatus of manifestation.What is this technique? What is indifference? I wonder, brother of mine, if youunderstand the significance of this word “indifference”? It means in reality theachieving of a neutral attitude towards that which is regarded as the Not-self;it involves a repudiation of similarity; it marks the recognition of a basicdistinction; it signifies refusal to be identified with anything save thespiritual reality as far as that is sensed and known at any given point in timeand space. It is, therefore, a much stronger and vital thing than what isusually meant when the word is used. It is active repudiation without anyconcentration upon that which is [263] repudiated. That is a statement of momentand warrants your careful consideration. It is concerned with the point oftension from which the observing disciple or aspirant is working. The point oftension becomes the emanating source of some type of energy, and this pours downinto and through the etheric body without being in any way affected by maya orby the concentration of diverse forces of which the etheric body is evercomposed. Indifference, technically understood, signifies direct descent fromthere to here, without deviation or distortion. The manifesting entity, thedisciple, stands steady and firm at this point of tension and his first step is,therefore, to ascertain where that is, on what plane it is found, and what isthe strength of the tension upon which he has to depend. The next step is todiscover if that which he seeks to convey to the physical body, and thus produceeffects upon the outer world of experiment and experience, is distorted byillusion of any kind, arrested in its expression by glamour, or liable to besidetracked by uncontrolled forces and by the maya which these produce. This heascertains not by identifying himself, stage by stage of descent, with thehindrances and possible obstructions but by intensifying his point of tension,by the constant recollection of the truth that he is the Self and not thenot-self and by a process of projection; this projection is defined as sendingof energy, qualified and recognised, from the point of tension direct andundeviatingly to the vital body from whence it can find its way to the sevencentres of control.It is at this point that he applies the technique of indifference for, if hedoes not, that which he is seeking to express may be held up and arrested byetheric force or by the veils of maya. He works consequently from a point ofintense concentration; he refuses any “attachment” to any form or plane as heprojects the energy into and [264] through the three worlds. When he discoversany arresting or sidetracking of progress through active illusion, or glamour,he “detaches” himself consciously from such contacts and braces himself for thefinal stage of indifference or repudiation of all forces except those whichhe—consciously and with purpose—is seeking to use upon the physical plane.In the last analysis, my brother, the point of tension for the average disciplewill be found on mental levels, involving the illumined mind and a growing soulcontact:a. He will be able then to “see” clearly in the light of the soul, and with adeveloped sense of values; he can consequently dispel illusion.b. He will be able to project light, consciously, on to the astral plane and canthus dissipate glamour.c. He will be able to pour light energy through the etheric body and anchor thelight or energy in the appropriate centres because there will be completeindifference or non-identification with maya.Where the initiate is concerned, the process is carried on at first from a pointof tension within the soul and later from a point of tension in the SpiritualTriad. In all cases, however, once within the ring-pass-not of the three worlds,the directing energy produces results as outlined in this book and brings about:1. The dispelling of illusion.2. The dissipation of glamour.3. The overcoming of maya.It sounds fairly simple and easy of accomplishment as the aspirant reads thesefairly simple elucidations of a difficult [265] process but that in itself isdelusion. Age-long identification with the form side of life is not easilyovercome and the task ahead of the disciple is a long and arduous one but onewhich promises eventual success, provided there is clear thinking, earnestpurpose and planned scientific work."},{"pageContent":"SECTION FOUR: THE TECHNIQUE OF FUSION[266] In this, our final point, we are concerned with the control—constant andunremitting—of the soul over the personality. We are therefore concerned withthe stage of initiation which brings to an end the path of development forhumanity and inaugurates a cycle of existence of which we know, and can know,nothing except that the liberated Master then begins to function in a dualmanner: as a member of the Hierarchy, cooperating with the Plan and occupiedwith the salvaging of humanity and, secondly, as a disciple of Sanat Kumara. Thetask of Sanat Kumara in relation to the Masters is to prepare Them to tread theWay of the Higher Evolution. When this becomes possible, the shift of thespiritual “attention” (I use this inadequate word for lack of a better one) isaway from the soul and the Angel of the Presence to the mysterious Presenceitself; this has hitherto only been sensed and dimly visioned. The Master—freedfrom the three and five worlds of human and so-called superhuman evolution—hasnow the full gifts of omnipresence and omniscience. He is aware of theunderlying unity, brought about by the factual nature of the One Life and BeingWho pervades all manifestation; He has also mastered all possible techniques andmodes and methods of activity, of control and of fusion. But having developedthose capacities, He now becomes faintly aware of that which conditions the OneBeing, and senses energies and contacts which are extra-planetary and of whichHe has hitherto been totally unaware. Knowledge comes to Him after the fifthinitiation.[267] Before Him lies the attainment of a still higher range of perceptions and,in order to garner the reward of those possible contacts, He has to mastertechniques and methods of development which will make Him omnipotent and,therefore, expressive of the highest of the three divine aspects. Thisdevelopment will put into His grasp potencies and experiences which can only bemanipulated and understood through the scientific activity of the WILL and thismust be implemented from a point of tension, focussed in whatever is meant bythe word “Monad.” Do you know what that means, my brother? I am sure that you donot. Only the Masters of the Wisdom have any appreciation of these finalunfoldments and then only in the sense of the Will-full aspiration—a phase ofaspiration which is characterised by the conscious will, just as the aspirationof the disciple is characterised by sublimated desire. These things are,however, beyond the comprehension of the average disciple; their sole value isto depict the unending opportunity which presents itself at every stage andpoint of crisis upon the everlasting Way.We are concerned at this time with the great point of crisis which faces thedisciple when he attempts to resolve the final pair of opposites, prior tocertain major initiations; this is the confronting the personality by the Angelof the PRESENCE. There is no need for me to define the two aspects of thedisciple’s nature, for that is what they essentially are. You have been told andhave known that the Dweller upon the Threshold is the fully developedpersonality—the sum total of all the past and the composite presentation uponthe physical plane of all unresolved problems, all undeclared desires, alllatent characteristics and qualities, all phases of thought and of self-will,all lower potencies and ancient habits of any of the three bodies (both bad andgood). These, in their totality, are brought to the surface [268] ofconsciousness, there to be dealt with in such a way that their control isbroken. The disciple is then free to take the final initiations. This process isnot consummated in one particular facing of the two antagonistic forces. It is athreefold process, covering each of the three periods before the first threeinitiations or (from the angle of the Hierarchy) before the two initiations ofthe threshold and the first major initiation, the Transfiguration.For many lives, the disciple has been dwelling upon the threshold. He himself isthe Dweller. Behind the slowly opening door he senses life, energy, spiritualembodiment, and the fact of the Angel. Between him and that door is aburning-ground; this he faces, and this he knows he has to cross if he seeks topass through the door. The question for him to answer is whether his will toachieve is strong enough for him to submit his personal lower self to the firesof the final purification. The personal self is now very highly developed; it isa useful instrument which the soul can use; it is a highly trained agent forservice; it is essentially a piece of adequate and useful equipment. It has,however, its points of weakness which are liable at any time to present pointsof crisis; it has likewise its points of strength which can be transmuted withrelative ease into points of tension; on the whole, it is a dependableinstrument and one which can render good service. Can it and should it besacrificed so that (esoterically speaking) its life is lost and in its placeconsecration and devotion are substituted? This is a hard problem for alldisciples to solve, to understand and to make effectively practical. Only bycrossing the burning ground three successive times are all impediments to thefree use of the will destroyed. The relation between the Angel and the Dwellermust be released, by means of the will, to full expression. I here refer to thespiritual will and to its three aspects which [269] must be brought into playbefore the divine will can begin to control. The disciple brings the two aspectsof his nature together in full consciousness and with clear intention through aplanned act of the will, and this act produces a point of tension in the “centreof the burning-ground wherein the two can meet,” as the ancient Archives put it.I would call your attention to the fact that it is at a “midway point” that thegreat submission of the lower to the higher takes place. It does not happen whenthe disciple hovers uncertainly upon the periphery of the burning-ground or whenhe stands before the door with the burning ground experience behind him. Theessential point of crisis, producing the needed point of tension, is the resultof the “invocative decision” of the personality which, in time, produces an“evocative response” from the Angel. The two factors involved (and forget not,my brother, that all this takes place within the field of consciousness of thedisciple) move together and towards each other. In the centre of the burningground they meet, and then the lesser light (a true light in its own right) ofthe personality is absorbed into the greater light of the Angel or soul. TheAngel, therefore, “occultly obliterates” the Dweller who becomes lost to sightin the radiant aura of the Angel. This has been symbolically portrayed for us inthe picture book of the heavens when, according to Catholic Festivals, theAssumption of the Virgin takes place and the constellation Virgo is lost tosight in the radiance of the sun. There you have the three factors:1. The Virgin material form personality Dweller. 2. The Sun spiritual naturesoul Angel. 3. The Earth aspiring man the discipleThe personality remains; it still exists but it is seen no more as of old. Thelight of the Angel envelops it; the burning ground has done its work and thepersonality is now nothing [270] more or less than the purified shell or formthrough which the light, the radiance, the quality and the characteristics ofthe Angel can shine. It is a fusion of lights, with the stronger and the morepowerful obliterating the lesser.How has this been brought about? I refer not here to the preparation of theDweller on the Threshold for this great event or to the aeon of disciplining, ofpreparation, of experiment and of experience from life to life which has madethis consummating event possible and successful. The two aspects in man can onlymeet in full power and with intention and finality when illusion can no longercontrol the mind, when glamour has lost all power to veil and when the forces ofmaya can no longer hinder. Discrimination, dispassion and indifference haveproduced the dispelling through focussed light, the dissipating potency ofdistributed light and the directing power of light energy. Only fiverecognitions now control the disciple:1. The fact of his discipleship.2. The perception of the Angel, waiting and dynamic.3. The invocative appeal of the Dweller on the Threshold.4. The necessity to use the will in a new and different manner.5. The need to cross the burning ground.The issues are now entirely clear. It is a question of timing and of decision. Iwould remind you that in all these processes, it is the disciple who, in fullconsciousness, acts. He initiates all the processes himself. It is not the Angelor the Dweller but the spiritual man himself who has to employ the will and takedefinite forward moving action. Once the disciple has taken the necessary stepsand moved irrevocably forward, the response of the Angel is sure, automatic andall-enveloping. Complete obliteration of [271] the personal self in threesuccessive stages is the immediate and normal result. It was to this that Johnthe Baptist referred when he said “He shall increase but I must decrease.” Whenhe spoke these words, he spoke as a disciple, prior to the second initiation ofthe threshold. This occult waxing and waning is portrayed for us in the phasesof the moon and, for the planet as a whole, in the sign Gemini, where the lightof one of the twins is slowly dimming and the light of the other is gaining inintensity.When this “occult obliteration” has taken place, what then is the destiny of thedisciple? It is complete control by the soul and this, in practice, connotesgroup realisation, group work, group service and eventually group initiation.With these developments, it is not my intent to deal, for I have covered much ofthese matters in my other books. Here I have been dealing in this shortelucidation with the effects that substances and the substantial forces, foundin the three worlds, produce in the disciple and as they affect the aspirant. Ihave not considered the problem of glamour, illusion and maya from the angle ofaverage man. The latter is necessarily immersed in them, and under theirconstant impact he passes his life. By their means he learns. He is not at thepoint where he seeks deliverance from them as does the man upon the Path. Ihave, therefore, considered the problem from the angle of the disciples andaspirants.From them the WAY opens up, and for them comes the conscious recognition of thelight. The need for the service of men and women, free from illusion andglamour, has never been so dramatically present as it is today and it is forthese potential servers of a desperate necessity that I have written.That the Angel of the PRESENCE may make His nearness felt and inspire you topass courageously through [272] the fires of the burning ground is my earnestprayer; that the fact of the PRESENCE may be sensed by you and lead you togreater activity—once the burning ground is passed—is my deepest wish for you;and that the light may shine upon your way and bring a certain and assuredconsummation of all the travail and struggle which has characterised your way oflife is my heart’s desire for you.
