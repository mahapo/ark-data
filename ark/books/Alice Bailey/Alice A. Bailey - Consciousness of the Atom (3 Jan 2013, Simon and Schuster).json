They thus were intendedto serve as an introduction to the more detailed study and application of thelaws of life and human enfoldment generally included in the term of “occultism.”It will be observed that there is in this series a considerable amount ofrepetition, as each lecture briefly reviews the matters covered in the precedingaddresses. As newcomers were present at each lecture in the series, it was foundnecessary on each occasion to present a bird’s eye view of the ground coveredand the reasons for the position then taken. A further advantage was found inthe fixing in the minds of the hearers of certain of these basic concepts whichwere new to many of them, and which helped to enable them to grasp and toreceive readily the further expansion of the theme. In presenting the lecturesin book form it has been deemed advisable to retain the complete text of thelectures as given. Those who are already students of the esoteric wisdom will beable to follow the line of the argument of the lectures without difficulty. Forthose however, who for the first time approach the consideration of the mattershere discussed, the occasional repetition of the fundamental points may help toa ready apprehension, and it is for this class of readers that the book isprimarily intended.ALICE A. BAILEYSeptember, 1922."},{"pageContent":"LECTURE I.THE FIELD OF EVOLUTION.There has probably never been a period in the history of thought entirelyresembling the present. Thinkers everywhere are conscious of two things, first,that the region of mystery has never before been so clearly defined, andsecondly, that that region can be entered more easily than has hitherto been thecase; it may, therefore, perhaps be induced to render up some of its secrets ifinvestigators of all schools pursue their search with determination. Theproblems with which we are faced, as we study the known facts of life andexistence, are susceptible of clearer definition than heretofore, and though wedo not know the answer to our questions, though we have not as yet discoveredthe solution to our problems, though no panacea lies ready to our hand wherebywe can remedy the world’s ills, yet the very fact that we can define them, thatwe can point in the direction in which mystery lies, and that the light ofscience, of religion, and of philosophy, has been shed upon vast tracts whichwere earlier considered lands of darkness, is a guarantee of success in thefuture. We know so much more than was the case five hundred years ago, except ina few circles of wise men and mystics; we have discovered so many laws ofnature, even though as yet we cannot apply them, and the knowledge of “things asthey are” (and I choose these words very deliberately) has made immense strides.Nevertheless, the mystery land still remains to be opened up, and our problemsare still numerous. There is the problem of our own particular life, whateverthat may be; there is the problem of that which is largely termed the“Not-Self”, and which concerns our physical body, our environment, ourcircumstances, and our life conditions; if we are of an introspective turn ofmind, there is the problem of our particular set of emotions, and of thethoughts, desires, and instincts by which we control action. Group problems aremany; why should there be suffering, starvation, and pain? Why should the worldas a whole be in the thrall of the direst poverty, of sickness, of discomfort?What is the purpose underlying all that we see around us, and what will be theoutcome of world affairs, viewing them as a whole? What is the destiny of thehuman race, what is its origin, and what is the key to its present condition? Isthere more than this one life, and is the sole interest to be found in thatwhich is apparent and material? Such queries pass through all our minds atvarious times, and have passed through the minds of thinkers right down throughthe centuries.There have been many attempts to reply to these questions, and as we study them,we find that the answers given fall into three main groups, and that threeprincipal solutions are held out for the consideration of men. These threesolutions are:—First, Realism. Another name for this school is that of Materialism. It teachesthat “the presentation which we have in consciousness of an external world istrue”; that things are what they seem; that matter and force, as we know them,are the only reality, and that it is not possible for man to get beyond thetangible. He should be satisfied with facts as he knows them, or as sciencetells him they are. This is a perfectly legitimate method of solution, but forsome of us it fails in that it does not go far enough. In refusing to concernitself with anything except that which can be proven and demonstrated it stopsshort at the very point where the enquirer says, “that is so, but why?” Itleaves out of its calculation much that is known and realised as truth by theaverage man, even though he may be unable to explain why he knows it to be true.Men everywhere are recognising the accuracy of the facts of the realisticschool, and of material science, yet at the same time they feel innately thatthere is, underlying the proven objective manifestation, some vitalising force,and some coherent purpose which cannot be accounted for in terms of matteralone.Secondly, there is the point of view which we can best, perhaps, callsupernaturalism. Man becomes conscious that perhaps, after all, things are notexactly what they seen to be, and that there remains much which is inexplicable;he awakens to the realisation that he himself is not simply an accumulation ofphysical atoms, a material something, and a tangible body, but that latentwithin him is a consciousness, a power, and a psychic nature which link him toall other members of the human family, and to a power outside himself which hemust perforce explain. This it is which has led, for instance, to the evolutionof the Christian and Jewish point of view, which posits a God outside the solarsystem, Who created it, but was Himself extraneous to it. These systems ofthought teach that the world has been evolved by a Power or Being Who has builtthe solar system, and Who guides the worlds aright, keeping our little humanlife in the hollow of His hand, and “sweetly ordering” all things according tosome hidden purpose which it is not possible for us, with our finite minds, toglimpse, still less to understand. This is the religious and supernatural pointof view, and is based on the growing selfconsciousness of the individual, and ina recognition of his own divinity. Like the point of view of the realisticschool, it embodies only a partial truth, and needs to be complemented.The third line of thought we might call the Idealistic. It posits anevolutionary process within all manifestation, and identifies life with thecosmic process. It is the exact opposite of materialism, and brings thesupernatural deity, predicated by the religionist, into the position of a greatEntity or Life, Who is evolving through, and by means of, the universe, just asman is evolving consciousness through the medium of an objective physical body.In these three standpoints—the frankly materialistic, the purely supernatural,and the idealistic—you have the three main lines of thought which have been putforward as explanatory of the cosmic process; all of them are partial truths,yet none of them is complete without the others, all of them, when followedalone, lead into byways and into darkness, and leave the central mystery stillunsolved. When synthesised, when brought together and blended, and when unified,they embody, perhaps, (I offer this simply as a suggestion) just as much of theevolutionary truth as it is possible for the human mind to grasp at the presentstage of evolution.We are dealing with large problems, and tampering, perhaps, with high and loftythings; we are trespassing into regions which are the recognised domain ofmetaphysics; and we are endeavouring to sum up in a few brief talks what all thelibraries of the world are embodying; we are therefore attempting theimpossible. All that we can do is to take up briefly and cursorily first oneaspect of the truth and then another. All we can possibly accomplish is anoutline of the basic lines of evolution, a study of their relationship to eachother and to ourselves as conscious entities, and then an endeavour to blend andsynthesise the little we can know until some general idea of the process as awhole becomes clearer.We have to remember in connection with every statement of truth that each ismade from a particular point of view. Until we have further developed our mentalprocesses, and until we are able to think in abstract terms as well as inconcrete, it will not be possible for us to fully answer the question, What istruth? nor to express any aspect of that truth in a perfectly unbiassed way.Some people have a wider horizon than others, and some can see the unityunderlying the differing aspects. Others are prone to think that their outlookand interpretation is the only one. I hope in these talks to broaden somewhatour point of view. I hope we shall come to the realisation that the man who isonly interested in the scientific aspect, and who confines himself to the studyof those manifestations which are purely material, is just as much occupied withthe study of the divine as is his frankly religious brother who only concernshimself with the spiritual side; and that the philosopher is, after all,occupied in emphasising for us the very necessary aspect of the intelligencewhich links the matter aspect and the spiritual, and blends them into onecoherent whole. Perhaps by the union of these three lines of science, religion,and philosophy, we may get a working knowledge of the truth as it is,remembering at the same time that “truth lies within ourselves.” No one man’sexpression of the truth is the whole expression, and the sole purpose of thoughtis to enable us to build constructively for ourselves, and to work in mentalmatter.I should like to outline my plan this evening, to lay the groundwork for ourfuture talks, and to touch upon the main lines of evolution. The line that ismost apparent is necessarily that which deals with the evolution of substance,with the study of the atom, and the nature of atomic matter. Next week we willtouch upon that. Science has much to tell us about the evolution of the atom,and has wandered a long way during the past fifty years from the standpoint ofthe last century. Then the atom was regarded as an indivisible unit ofsubstance; now it is looked upon as a centre of energy, or electric force. Fromthe evolution of substance we are led very naturally to the evolution of forms,or of congeries of atoms, and there will then open up to us the interestingconsideration of forms other than the purely material,—forms existing in subtlersubstance, such as forms of thought, and the racial forms, and the forms oforganisations. In this dual study, one of the aspects of deity will beemphasised, should you choose to use the term “deity”, or one of themanifestations of nature, should you prefer that less sectarian expression.We shall then be led to the consideration of the evolution of intelligence, orof the factor of mind which is working out as ordered purpose in all that we seearound us. This will reveal to us a world which is not blindly going on its way,but which has back of it some plan, some coordinated scheme, some organisedconcept which is working itself out by means of the material form. One reasonwhy things appear to us so difficult of comprehension is involved in the factthat we are in the midst of a transition period, and the plan is as yetimperfect; we are too close to the machinery, being ourselves an integral partof the whole. We see a little bit of it here, and another little bit there, butthe whole grandeur of the idea is not apparent to us. We may have a vision, wemay have a high moment of revelation, but when we contact the reality on everyside, we question the possibility of the ideal materialising, for theintelligent relationship between the form and that which utilises it seems sofar from adjustment. The recognition of the factor of the intelligence willinevitably lead us to the contemplation of the evolution of consciousness in itsmany forms, ranging all the way from those types of consciousness which weconsider sub- human, through the human, up to what may be logically posited(even if it may not be demonstrated) to be superhuman consciousness. The nextquestion which will face us will be, what lies back of all these factors? Isthere, behind the objective form and its animating intelligence, an evolutionwhich corresponds to the “I” faculty, to the Ego in man? Is there in nature, andin all that we see around us, the working out of the purpose of anindividualised selfconscious Being? If there is such a Being, and such afundamental existence, we should be able to see somewhat His intelligentactivities, and to watch His plans working towards fruition. Even if we cannotprove that God is, and that the Deity exists, it may be possible to say, atleast, that the hypothesis that He exists is a reasonable one, a rationalsuggestion, and a possible solution of all the mysteries we see around us. Butto do that it has to be demonstrated that there is an intelligent purposeworking through forms of every kind, through races and nations, and through allthat we see manifesting in modern civilisation; the steps that that purpose hastaken, and the gradual growth of the plan, will have to be demonstrated, andfrom that demonstration we shall perhaps be able to see what lies ahead for usin the coming stages.Let us for a minute consider what we mean by the words “evolutionary process”.They are constantly being used, and the average man well knows that the word“evolution” suggests an unfolding from within outwards, and the unrolling froman inner centre, but we need to define the idea more clearly, and thus get abetter concept. One of the best definitions which I have come across is thatwhich defines evolution as “the unfolding of a continually increasing power torespond.” Here we have a definition that is very illuminating as we consider thematter aspect of manifestation. It involves the conception of vibration, and ofresponse to vibration, and though we may in time have to discard the term“matter”, and employ some such expression as “force centre”, the concept stillholds good, and the response of the centre to stimulation is even moreaccurately to be seen. In considering human consciousness this same definitionis of real value. It involves the idea of a gradually increasing realisation, ofthe developing response of the subjective life to its environment, and it leadsus eventually on and up to the ideal of a unified Existence which will be thesynthesis of all the lines of evolution, and to a conception of a central Life,or force, which blends and holds together all the evolving units, whether theyare units of matter, such as the atom of the chemist and the physicist, or unitsof consciousness, such as human beings. This is evolution, the process whichunfolds the life within all units, the developing urge which eventually mergesall units and all groups, until you have that sum total of manifestation whichcan be called Nature, or God, and which is the aggregate of all the states ofconsciousness. This is the God to Whom the Christian refers when he says “in Himwe live, and move, and have our being”; this is the force, or energy, which thescientist recognises; and this is the universal mind, or the Oversoul of thephilosopher. This, again, is the intelligent Will which controls, formulates,binds, constructs, develops, and brings all to an ultimate perfection. This isthat Perfection which is inherent in matter itself, and the tendency which islatent in the atom, in man, and in all that is. This interpretation of theevolutionary process does not look upon it as the result of an outside Deitypouring His energy and wisdom upon a waiting world, but rather as somethingwhich is latent within that world itself, that lies hidden at the heart of theatom of chemistry, within the heart of man himself, within the planet, andwithin the solar system. It is that something which drives all on toward thegoal, and is the force which is gradually bringing order out of chaos; ultimateperfection out of temporary imperfection; good out of seeming evil; and out ofdarkness and disaster that which we shall some day recognise as beautiful,right, and true. It is all that we have visioned and conceived of in our highestand best moments.Evolution has also been defined as “cyclic development”, and this definitionbrings me to a thought which I am very anxious that we should thoroughly grasp.Nature repeats continuously until certain definite ends have been reached,certain concrete results have been brought about, and certain responses made tovibration. It is by the recognition of this accomplishment that the intelligentpurpose of indwelling Existence can be demonstrated. The method whereby this isachieved is that of discrimination, or of intelligent choice. There are, in thetext-books of different schools, many words which are used to convey the samegeneral idea, such as “natural selection”, or “attraction and repulsion”. Iwould like, if possible, to avoid technical terms, because they are used by oneschool of thought to mean one thing, and by another, something different. If wecan find a word similar in intent, yet not tied to any particular line ofthought, we may find fresh light thrown upon our problem. Attraction andrepulsion in the solar system is but the discriminating faculty of the atom orof man demonstrating in the planets and the sun. It will be found in atoms ofall kinds; we can call it adaptation, if we so choose, or the power to grow andto adapt the unit to its environment through the rejection of certain factorsand the acceptance of others. It shows itself in man as free will, or the powerto choose, and in the spiritual man it can be seen as the tendency to sacrifice,for a man then chooses a particular line of action in order to benefit the groupto which he belongs, and rejects that which is purely selfish.We might finally define evolution as ordered change and constant mutation. Itdemonstrates in the ceaseless activity of the unit or the atom, the interactionbetween groups, and the endless play of one force or type of energy uponanother.We have seen that evolution, whether it is of matter, of intelligence, ofconsciousness, or of spirit, consists in an ever increasing power to respond tovibration, that it progresses through constant change, by the practice of aselective policy or the use of the discriminative faculty, and by the method ofpsychic development or repetition. The stages which distinguish the evolutionaryprocess might be broadly divided into three, corresponding to the stages in thelife of a human being: childhood, adolescence, and maturity. Where man isconcerned these stages can be traced in the human unit or in the race, and asthe civilisations pass on and increase, it should surely become possible totrace the same threefold idea in the human family as a whole, and thus ascertainthe divine objective through the study of His image, or reflection, MAN. Wemight express these three stages in more scientific terms, and link them withthe three schools of thought earlier referred to, studying them as,a. The stage of atomic energy.b. The stage of group coherency.c. The stage of unified or synthetic existence.Let me see if I can make my meaning clear. The stage of atomic energy is largelythat which concerns the material side of life, and corresponds to the childhoodperiod in the life of a man or a race. It is the time of realism, of intenseactivity, of development by action above all else, or pure self-centredness andself-interest. It produces the materialistic point of view, and leads inevitablyto selfishness. It involves the recognition of the atom as being entirelyself-contained, and similarly of the human unit as having a separate life apartfrom all other units, and with no relationship to others. Such a stage can beseen in the little evolved races of the world, in small children, and in thosewho are little developed. They are normally self-centred; their energies areconcerned with their own life; they are occupied with the objective and withthat which is tangible; they are characterised by a necessary and protectiveselfishness. It is a most necessary stage in the development and perpetuation ofthe race.Out of this selfish atomic period grows another stage, that of group coherency.This involves the building up of forms or species until you have somethingcoherent and individualised in itself as a whole, yet which is composed of manylesser individualities and forms. In connection with the human being itcorresponds to his awakening realisation of responsibility, and to hisrecognition of his place within the group. It necessitates an ability on hispart to recognise a life greater than himself, whether that life is called God,or whether it is simply regarded as the life of the group to which a man, as aunit, belongs, that great Identity of which we are each a part. This correspondsto the school of thought which we called the supernatural, and it must besucceeded in time by a truer and a wider concept. As we have already seen, thefirst or atomic stage developed by means of selfishness, or the self-centredlife of the atom (whether the atom of substance or the human atom); the secondstage grows to perfection by the sacrifice of the unit to the good of the many,and of the atom to the group in which it has place. This stage is somethingwhich we, as yet, know practically little about, and is what we often vision andhope for.The third stage lies a long way ahead, and may be considered by many a vainchimera. But some of us have a vision, which, even if unattainable at present,is logically possible if our premises are correct, and our foundation is rightlylaid. It is that of unified existence. Not only will there be the separate unitsof consciousness; not only the differentiated atoms within the form, not onlywill there be the group made up of a multiplicity of identities, but we shallhave the aggregate of all forms, of all groups, and of all states ofconsciousness blended, unified, and synthesised into a perfected whole. Thiswhole you may call the solar system, you may call it nature, or you may call itGod. Names matter not. It corresponds to the adult stage in the human being; itis analogous to the period of maturity, and to that stage wherein a man issupposed to have a definite purpose and life work, and a clear-cut plan in view,which he is working out by the aid of his intelligence. In these talks I shouldlike, if I can, to show that something like this is going on in the solarsystem, in the planet, in the human family, and in the atom. I trust that we canprove that there is an intelligence underlying all; and that from separationwill come union, produced through blending and merging into group formation, andthat eventually from the many groups will be seen emerging the one perfect,fully conscious whole, composed of myriads of separated identities animated byone purpose and one will. If this is so, what is the next practical step aheadfor those who come to this realisation? How can we make practical application ofthis ideal to our own lives, and ascertain our immediate duty so that we mayparticipate in, and consciously further the plan? In the cosmic process we haveour tiny share, and each day of activity should see us playing our part withintelligent understanding.Our first aim should surely be self realisation through the practice ofdiscrimination; we must learn to think clearly for ourselves, to formulate ourown thoughts and to manipulate our own mental processes; we must learn to knowwhat we think and why we think it, to find out the nature of our life, and toexperiment. We find ourselves, and know ourselves, through the method ofdiscrimination and of selection and rejection.When this is the practice of our lives, and the habit of our thought, we canthen endeavour to find out the meaning of group consciousness through the studyof the law of sacrifice. Not only must we find ourselves through the primarychildhood stage of selfishness (and surely that should lie behind us), not onlyshould we learn to distinguish between the real and the unreal, through thepractice of discrimination, but we should endeavour to pass on from that tosomething very much better. For us the immediate goal should be to find thegroup to which we may belong. We do not belong to all groups, nor can weconsciously realise our place in the one great Body, but we can find some groupin which we have our place, some body of people with whom we can co-operate andwork, some brother or brothers whom we can succour and assist. It reallyinvolves the conscious contacting of the ideal of brotherhood, and—until we haveevolved to the stage where our concept is universal—it means finding theparticular set of brothers whom we can love and help by means of the law ofsacrifice, and by the transmutation of selfishness into loving service. Thus wecan co-operate in the general purpose, and participate in the mission of thegroup.Next week we will follow out some of these ideas in connection with theevolution of substance, and the part it plays in the general scheme."},{"pageContent":"LECTURE II.THE EVOLUTION OF SUBSTANCE.It is obvious that in such a series of lectures as this it would be impossibleto deal adequately in any way with this stupendous subject, even were I equippedto lecture on such a fundamentally scientific matter. Again, if the conclusionsof science were definite upon the evolution of matter, the topic would be, eventhen, too vast to handle, but they are not, and hence the further complicatingof the subject. Therefore I want to preface my remarks tonight by stating thatmy aim is to speak particularly for those who have no scientific training of anykind, and to give them a general concept of the usually accepted ideas; I seek,then, to make some suggestions which we may find helpful in adjusting our mindsto this great problem of matter. Usually when the substance aspect ofmanifestation has been considered, it has been as a thing apart, and it is onlylately that what I might call the “psychology of matter” is beginning to comebefore the mind of the public through the investigations and conclusions of thebroader minded scientists.You will remember that last week I endeavoured, in a broad and general way, topoint out to you that there were three lines of approach to the study of thematerial universe. There is the line which considers only the materialisticaspect, and is occupied only with that which can be seen, which is tangible, andwhich can be proven. A second line is that of supernaturalism, which recognisesnot so much the material side of things as that which is called divine; it dealswith the life side, and with the spirit aspect, viewing that Life as a powerextraneous to the solar system and to man, and positing that power as a greatcreative Agent, Who creates and guides the objective universe and yet is outsideof it. These two lines of thought can be seen upheld by the franklymaterialistic scientist, the orthodox Christian, and the deist of every faith.I indicated next a third line of approach to the problem, and we called it theidealistic concept. It recognises the material form, but sees also the lifewithin it, and it posits a Consciousness or Intelligence which is evolving bymeans of that outer form. You will find, I think, that that is the line which Ishall emphasise and stress in these lectures. No speaker is able, after all, todissociate himself entirely from his own point of view, and in these talks Ihave set myself the task of working along this third line, for to me itsynthesises the other two, and adds certain concepts which produce a coherentwhole when merged with the other two. It is for you to decide if this thirdstandpoint is logical, reasonable, and clear.The most common fact in life for all of us is that of the material world,—thatworld which we can see and contact by means of the five senses, and which iscalled by the metaphysical thinkers the “not-self”, or that which is objectiveto each one of us. As we all know, the work of the chemist is to reduce allknown substances to their very simplest elements, and it was thought not longago that this had been satisfactorily accomplished. The conclusions of thechemist placed the number of the known elements between seventy and eighty.About twenty years ago, however, (in 1898) a new element was discovered whichwas called Radium, and this discovery entirely revolutionized the world’sthought about matter and substance. If you will go to the text-books of the lastcentury, or search the old dictionaries, seeking for the definition of the atom,for instance, you will usually find Newton quoted. He defined the atom as “ahard, indivisible, ultimate particle”, a something which was incapable offurther subdivision. This was considered to be the ultimate atom in theuniverse, and was called by the scientist of the Victorian era “the foundationstone of the universe”; they considered they had gone as far back as it waspossible to go, and that they had discovered what lay back of all manifestationand of objectivity itself. But when radium, and the other radio-activesubstances, had been discovered, an entirely new aspect of the situation had tobe faced. It became apparent that what was considered the ultimate particle wasnot so at all. As you now have the definition of the atom (I am quoting from theStandard Dictionary) it is:“An atom is a centre of force, a phase of electrical phenomena, a centre ofenergy, active through its own internal make-up, and giving off energy or heator radiation.” Therefore, an atom is (as Lord Kelvin in 1867 thought it wouldultimately turn out to be) a “vortex ring”, or centre of force, and not aparticle of what we understand as tangible substance. This ultimate particle ofmatter is now demonstrated to be composed of a positive nucleus of energy,surrounded—just as is the sun by the planets—with many electrons or negativecorpuscles, thus subdividing the atom of earlier science into numerous lesserbodies. The elements differ according to the number and arrangement of thesenegative electrons around their positive nucleus, and they rotate or move aroundthis central charge of electricity as our planetary system rotates around thesun. Professor Soddy, in one of his latest books, has pointed out that in theatom is to be seen an entire solar system, the central sun can be recognised,with the planets pursuing their orbital paths around it.It would be apparent to each of us that when this definition of the atom iscontemplated and studied an entirely new concept of substance comes before us.Dogmatic assertions are therefore out of order, for it is realised that perhapsthe next discovery may reveal to us the fact that the electrons themselves maybe worlds within worlds. An interesting speculation along these lines is to befound in a book by one of our scientific thinkers in which he suggests that wemight be able to divide and subdivide the electron itself into what he calls“psychons”, and thus be led into realms which are not now considered physical.That may be only a dream, but the thing that I am seeking to impress upon mymind and yours is that we scarcely know where we stand in scientific thought,any more than we know where we stand in the religious and economic world.Everything is passing through a period of transition; the old order changeth;the old way of looking at things is proving false or inadequate; the oldexpressions of thought seem futile. All that the wise man can do just now is toreserve his opinion, ascertain for himself what appeals to him as truth, andendeavour then to synthesise that particular aspect of universal truth with thataspect which has been accepted by his brother.The atom, then, can be predicated as resolving itself into electrons, and can beexpressed in terms of force or energy. When you have a centre of energy oractivity you are involved in a dual concept; you have that which is the cause ofmovement or energy, and that which it energises or actuates. This brings usdirectly into the field of psychology, because energy or force is ever regardedas a quality, and where you have a quality you are really considering the fieldof psychic phenomena.There are certain terms in use when considering substance which are continuouslyappearing, and about which there is a wide diversity of definition. In lookingover one scientific book last week it was discouraging to find the authorpointing out that the atom of the chemist, of the physicist, of themathematician, and of the metaphysician were four totally different things. Thatis another reason why it is not possible to be dogmatic in dealing with thesequestions. Nevertheless, rightly or wrongly, I have a very definite hypothesisto put before you. When we talk about radium, we are, in all probability,venturing into the realm of etheric substance, the region of ether, or ofprotyle. Protyle was a word coined by Sir William Crookes, and is defined by himas follows:“Protyle is a word analogous to protoplasm, to express the idea of the originalprimal matter before the evolution of the chemical elements. The word I haveventured to use for this purpose is compounded of a Greek word ‘earlier than’,and ‘the stuff of which things are made’.”We are, therefore, throwing the concept of matter back to where the orientalschool has always put it, to primordial stuff, to that which the orientalistcalls “primordial ether”, though we must ever remember that the ether of scienceis many, many removes from the primordial ether of the oriental occultist. Weare led back to that intangible something which is the basis of the objectivething which you and I can see and touch and handle. The word “substance” itselfmeans that which “stands under”, or which lies back of things. All, therefore,that we can predicate in connection with the ether of space is that it is themedium in which energy or force functions, or makes itself felt. When we aretalking in these lectures of energy and force, and of matter and substance, wecan separate them in our minds thus: We speak about energy and substance when weare considering that which is as yet intangible, and we use force in connectionwith matter when dealing with that aspect of the objective which our scientistsare definitely studying. Substance is the ether in one of its many grades, andis that which lies back of matter itself.When we speak of energy there must be that which energises, that which is thesource of energy and the origin of that force which demonstrates in matter. Itis here that I seek to lay the emphasis. Whence comes this energy, and what isit?Scientists are recognising ever more clearly that atoms possess qualities, andit would be interesting if one were to take the different scientific booksdealing with the subject of atomic matter, and note which of the many andvarying terms applied to them could be applied to a human being also. On a smallscale I have attempted this, and found it very illuminating.First of all, as we know, the atom is spoken of as possessing energy, and thepower to change from one mode of activity to another. One writer has remarkedthat “absolute intelligence thrills through every atom in the world.” In thisconnection I want to point out to you what Edison is reported by an intervieweras having said, in Harper’s Magazine for February, 1890, and which is enlargedupon in the Scientific American for October, 1920. In the earlier instance he isquoted as follows:“I do not believe that matter is inert, acted upon by an outside force. To me itseems that every atom is possessed by a certain amount of primitiveintelligence. Look at the thousands of ways in which atoms of hydrogen combinewith those of other elements, forming the most diverse substances. Do you meanto say that they do this without intelligence? Atoms in harmonious and usefulrelation assume beautiful or interesting shapes and colours, or give forth apleasant perfume, as if expressing their satisfaction gathered together incertain forms, the atoms constitute animals of the lower order. Finally theycombine in man, who represents the total intelligence of all the atoms.”“But where does this intelligence come from originally?” asked the interviewer.“From some power greater than ourselves,” Edison answered.“Do you believe, then, in an intelligent Creator, a personal God?”“Certainly. The existence of such a God can, to my mind, be proved fromchemistry.”In the long interview quoted last year in the Scientific American, Edison laiddown a number of most interesting surmises from which I have culled thefollowing:1. Life, like natter is indestructible.2. Our bodies are composed of myriads of infinitesimal entities, each in itselfa unit of life; just as the atom is composed of myriads of electrons.3. The human being acts as an assemblage rather than as a unit; the body andmind express the vote or voice of the life entities.4. The life entities build according to a plan. If a part of the life organismbe mutilated, they rebuild exactly as before. . .7. Science admits the difficulty of drawing the line between the inanimate andthe animate; perhaps the life entities extend their activities to crystals andchemicals. . .9. The life entities live for ever; so that to this extent at least the eternallife which many of us hope for is a reality.In an address given by Sir Clifford Allbut, President of the British MedicalAssociation, as reported in the Literary Digest of February 26th, 1921, hespeaks of the ability of the microbe to select and reject, and in the course ofhis remarks he says:—“When the microbe finds itself in the host’s body it may be wholly out of tune,or wholly in tune, with any or all cells that it approaches; in either casepresumably nothing morbid would happen………morbid happenings would lie betweenthis microbe and body-cells within its range but not in tune with it. Now thereseems to be reason to suppose that a microbe, on its approach to a body cellonly just out of its range, may try this way and that to get a hitch on. If so,the microbe, at first innocuous, would become noxious. So, on the other hand,body-cells may educate themselves to vibrate in harmony with a microbe beforedissonant; or there may be mutual interchange and co-adaptation. . . …“But, if things be so, surely we are face to face with a marvelous andfar-reaching faculty, the faculty of choice, and this rising from the utterbottom of biology to the summit—formative faculty—‘auto-determination’, or, ifyou please, ‘mind’.”In the year 1895, Sir William Crookes, one of our greatest scientists, gave aninteresting lecture before a body of chemists in Great Britain, in which hedealt with the ability of the atom to choose its own path, to reject and toselect, and showed that natural selection can be traced in all forms of life,from the then ultimate atom up through all forms of being.In another scientific article, the atom is further accused of having sensationas well:“The recent contest as to the nature of atoms, which we must regard as in someform or other the ultimate factors in all physical and chemical processes, seemsto be capable of easiest solution by the conception that these very minutepasses possess—as centres of force—a persistent soul, that every atom hassensation and power of movement.”Tyndall has likewise pointed out that even the very atoms themselves seem to be“instinct with the desire for life.”If you take these different qualities of the atom—energy, intelligence, abilityto select and reject, to attract and repulse, sensation, movement, anddesire—you have something which is very much like the psychology of a humanbeing, only within a more limited radius and of a more circumscribed degree.Have we not, therefore, really got back to what might be termed the “psyche ofthe atom”? We have found that the atom is a living entity, a little vibrantworld, and that within its sphere of influence other little lives are to befound, and this very much in the same sense as each of us is an entity, orpositive nucleus of force or life, holding within our sphere of influence otherlesser lives, i.e., the cells of our body. What can be said of us can be said,in degree, of the atom.Let us extend our idea of the atom a little further, and touch upon what may befundamentally the cause, and hold the solution of the world problems. Thisconcept of the atom as a positive demonstration of energy, holding within itsrange of activity its polar opposite, can be extended not only to every type ofatom, but also to a human being. We can view each unit of the human family as ahuman atom, for in man you have simply a larger atom. He is a centre of positiveforce, holding within the periphery of his sphere of influence the cells of hisbody; he shows discrimination, intelligence, and energy. The difference lies butin degree. He is possessed of a wider consciousness, and vibrates to a largermeasure than the little atom of the chemist.We might extend the idea still further and consider a planet as an atom. Perhapsthere is a life within the planet that holds the substance of the sphere and allforms of life upon it to itself as a coherent whole, and that has a specificextent of influence. This may sound like a wild speculation, yet, judging fromanalogy, there may perhaps be within the planetary sphere an Entity Whoseconsciousness is as far removed from that of man as the consciousness of man isfrom that of the atom of chemistry.This thought can again be carried still further, .till it includes the atom ofthe solar system. There, at the heart of the solar system, the sun, you have thepositive centre of energy, holding the planets within its sphere of influence.If you have within the atom, intelligence; if you have within the human being,intelligence; if you have within the planet, an Intelligence controlling all itsfunctions, may it not be logical to extend the idea and predicate a stillgreater Intelligence back of that larger atom, the solar system?This brings us ultimately to the standpoint which the religious world has alwaysheld, that of there being a God, or Divine Being. Where the orthodox Christianwould say with reverence, God, the scientist, with equal reverence, would say,Energy; yet they would both mean the same. Where the idealistic teacher wouldspeak of the “God within” the human form, others with equal accuracy would speakof the “energising faculty” of man, which drives him into activity of aphysical, emotional, or mental nature. Everywhere are to be found centres offorce, and the idea can be extended from such a force centre as a chemical atom,on and up through varying grades and groups of such intelligent centres, to man,and thence to the Life which is manifesting through the system. Thus isdemonstrated a marvellous and synthesised Whole. St. Paul may have had somethingof this sort in mind when he spoke about the Heavenly Man. By the “body ofChrist” he surely means all those units of the human family who are held withinHis sphere of influence, and who go to the constitution of His body, as theaggregate of the physical cells form the physical body of the man. What isneeded in these days of religious upheaval is that these fundamental truths ofChristianity should be demonstrated to be scientific truths. We need to makereligion scientific.There is a very interesting Sanskrit writing, many thousands of years old, whichI am venturing to quote h ere. It says:“Every form on earth, and every speck (atom) in space, strives in its effortstowards self-formation, and to follow the model placed for it in the HeavenlyMan. The involution and the evolution of the atom have all one and the sameobject: man.”[paragraph continues] Do you note what a large hope this concept opens outbefore us? Not one atom of matter, showing latent intelligence, discrimination,and selective power, but will, in the course of aeons, reach that more advancedstage of consciousness which we call human. Surely, then, the human atom mayequally be supposed to progress to something still more widely conscious, andeventually reach the stage of development of those great Entities whose bodiesare planetary atoms; and for Them, as well, what is there? Attainment of thatall-including state of consciousness which we call God, or the solar Logos.Surely this teaching is logical and practical. The old occult injunction whichsaid to a man “Know thyself, for in thyself is to be found all that there is tobe known,” is still the rule for the wise student. If each one of us wouldscientifically regard ourselves as centres of force, holding the matter of ourbodies within our radius of control, and thus working through and in them, weshould have a hypothesis whereby the entire cosmic scheme could be interpreted.If, as Einstein hints, our entire solar system is but a sphere, colouring isgiven to the deduction that it, in its turn, may be but a cosmic atom; thus wewould have a place within a still larger scheme, and have a centre around whichour system rotates, and in which it is as the electron to the atom. We have beentold by astronomers that our entire system is probably revolving around acentral point in the heavens.Thus the basic idea which I have sought to emphasize can be traced all the wayup, through the atom of the chemist and physicist, through man, through theenergising Life of a planet, up to the Logos, the deity of our solar system, theIntelligence or Life which lies back of all manifestation or of nature, and onto some greater scheme in which even our God has to play His part and to findHis place. It is a wonderful picture if true.I cannot deal tonight with the different developments of this intelligenceanimating all atoms, but I should like for a moment to take up what is perhapsthe method of their evolution, and this from the human standpoint (whichconcerns us the most intimately) remembering ever that what is true of any oneatom should be true in greater or less degree of all.In considering broadly the atoms of the solar system, including the systemitself, there are two things noticeable: the first is the intense life andactivity of the atom itself, and its internal atomic energy; and the second isits interaction with other atoms—repulsing some and attracting others. Perhaps,then, we may deduce from these facts, that the method of evolution for everyatom is due to two causes: the internal life of the atom itself, and itsinteraction or intercourse with other atoms. These two stages are apparent inthe evolution of the human atom. The first was emphasised by the Christ when Hesaid: “the kingdom of God is within you,” thus pointing all human atoms to thecentre of life or energy within themselves, and teaching them that from andthrough that centre they must expand and grow. Each one of us is conscious ofbeing centred within himself; he considers everything from his own standpoint,and the outer happenings are mostly interesting just in so far as they concernhimself. We deal with things as they affect us personally, and all that occursto others at a certain stage of our evolution is important only as it concernsourselves. That is the present stage of many, and is characteristic of themajority; it is the period of intense individualism, and that in which the “I”concept is of paramount importance. It involves much internal activity.The second way the human atom grows is through its interaction with all otheratoms, and this is something which is only just beginning to dawn upon the humanintelligence, and to assume its just importance. We are only beginning torealise the relative significance of competition and of co-operation, and are onthe verge of realising that we cannot live our life selfishly and apart from thegroup in which we find a place; we are commencing to learn that if our brotheris held back, and is not making progress, and if the other human atoms are notvibrating as they should, every atom in the body corporate is affected. None ofus will be complete until all other units have achieved their fullest and mostcomplete development.Next week I shall enlarge a little upon this, when I take up the question ofform building. I only seek tonight, in bringing this lecture to a conclusion, tobring to your consciousness an appreciation of the place we each hold in thegeneral scheme, and to enable us to realise the importance of the interactionwhich goes on between all atoms. I seek to point out the necessity of findingfor ourselves our place in the group to which we naturally belong (in which weare as the electrons to the positive charge), and of our then proceeding to doour work within that larger atom, the group.This makes the entire hypothesis not merely a wild dream, but a practicallyuseful ideal. If it is true that all the cells of our bodies, for instance, arethe electrons which we hold coherently together, and if we are the energisingfactor within the material form, it is of prime importance that we recognisethat fact, and deal rightly and scientifically with those forms and their atoms.This involves the practical care of the physical body and the wise adaptation ofall our energy to the work to be done, and to the nature of our objective; itnecessitates the judicious utilisation of that aggregate of cells which is ourinstrument, or tool, and our sphere of manifestation. This is something of whichwe, as yet, know little. When this thought is developed, and the human being isrecognised as a force centre, the attitude of people towards their work and modeof living will be fundamentally altered. The point of view of the medical world,for instance, will be changed, and people will study the right methods ofutilising energy. Disease through ignorance, will no longer exist, and themethods of transmitting force will be studied and followed. We shall then betruly intelligent atoms—a thing we, as yet, are not.Again, we shall not only be practical in the handling of our material bodies,because we understand their constitution, but we shall consciously find ourplace within the group, and direct our energy to the benefiting of the group,and not, as now, to the furthering of our own ends. Many atoms have not only aninternal life of their own, but also radiate, and as radio-activity is graduallyunderstood, so the study of man as a centre of active radiation will also comeinto being. We are standing these days on the verge of wonderful discoveries; weare nearing a marvellous synthesis of the thought of the world; we are advancingtowards that period when science and religion will come to the help of eachother, and when philosophy will add its quota to the understanding of the truth.The use of the imagination will frequently open up a wonderful vision, and ifthis imagination is based on essentials, and starts with a logical hypothesis,perhaps it will lead us to the solution of some of the mysteries and problemswhich are distressing the world now. If things are to us mysterious andinexplicable, may it not be because of that great Entity Who is manifestingthrough our planet, and Who is working out a definite purpose and plan, just asyou and I may be doing in our lives. At times we carry our physical vehicle intosituations, and bring about difficulties in connection with it, which are bothpainful and distressing; granted the hypothesis upon which we are working, itmay, therefore, be logical to surmise that the great Intelligence of our planetis similarly carrying His entire body of manifestation (which includes the humanfamily) into situations which are distressing to the atoms. Surely it may belogical to suppose that the mystery of all we see around us may be hidden in thewill and intelligent purpose of that greater Life, Who works through our planetas man works through the medium of his physical body, and yet Who is Himself butan atom within a still larger sphere, which is indwelt by the solar Logos, theIntelligence Who is the sum total of all the lesser lives."},{"pageContent":"LECTURE III.THE EVOLUTION OF FORM, OR GROUP EVOLUTION.I want to enlarge tonight upon the basic idea of the unity of consciousness, orof intelligence, as developed somewhat in the lecture last week, and to extendthe concept still further. It has been said that all evolution proceeds fromhomogeneous, through heterogeneity, back again to homogeneity, and it has beenpointed out that:“Evolution is a continually accelerating march of all the particles of theuniverse which leads them simultaneously, by a path sown with destruction, butuninterrupted and unpausing, from the material atom to that universalconsciousness in which omnipotence and omniscience are realised; in a word, tothe full realisation of the Absolute of God.”This proceeds from those minute diversifications which we call molecules andatoms up to their aggregate as they are built into forms; and continues onthrough the building of those forms into greater forms, until you have a solarsystem in its entirety. All has proceeded under law, and the same basic lawsgovern the evolution of the atom as the evolution of a solar system. Themacrocosm repeats itself in man, the microcosm, and the microcosm is againreflected in all lesser atoms.These remarks and the previous lecture concern themselves primarily with thematerial manifestation of a solar system, but I shall seek to lay the emphasisin our future talks principally upon what we might call the psychical evolution,or the gradual demonstration and evolutionary unfoldment of that subjectiveintelligence or consciousness which lies behind the objective manifestation.As usual, we will handle this lecture in four divisions: First, we will take thesubject of the evolutionary process, which, in this particular case is theevolution of the form, or the group; then the method of group development; nextwe will consider the stages that are followed during the cycle of evolution, andfinally we will conclude with an attempt to be practical, and to gather out ofour conclusions some lesson to apply to the daily life.The first thing necessary for us to do is to consider somewhat the question ofwhat a form really is. If we turn to a dictionary we will find the word definedas follows: “the external shape or configuration of a body.” In this definitionthe emphasis is laid upon its externality, upon its tangibility and exotericmanifestation. This thought is also brought out if the root meaning of the word‘manifestation’ is carefully studied. It conies from two Latin words, meaning“to touch or handle by the hand” (manus, the hand, and fendere, to touch), andthe idea then brought to our minds is the triple thought that that which ismanifested is that which can be felt, contacted, and realised as tangible. Yetin both these interpretations the most vital part of the concept is lost sightof, and we must look elsewhere for a truer definition. To my mind, Plutarchconveys the idea of the manifestation of the subjective through the medium ofthe objective form in a much more illuminating way than does the dictionary. Hesays:—“An idea is a being incorporeal, which has no subsistence by itself, but givesfigure and form unto shapeless matter, and becomes the cause of manifestation.”Here you have a most interesting sentence, and one of real occult significance.It is a sentence which will repay careful study and consideration, for itembodies a concept that concerns itself not only with that little manifestation,the atom of the chemist and the physicist, but of all forms that are constitutedby their means, including the manifestation of a human being and of the Deity ofa solar system, that great Life, that all-embracing, universal Mind, thatvibrant centre of energy, and that great enfolding consciousness Whom we callGod, or Force, or the Logos, the Existence Who is expressing Himself through themedium of the solar system.In the Christian Bible the same thought is borne out by St. Paul in a letter tothe Church at Ephesus. In the second chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians hesays: “We are his workmanship.” Literally, the correct translation from theGreek is: “We are his poem, or idea,” and the thought in the mind of the apostleis that through the medium of every human life, or in the aggregate of liveswhich compose a solar system, God is, through the form, whatever it may be,working out an idea, a specific concept, or detailed poem. A man is an embodiedthought, and this is also the concept latent in the definition of Plutarch. Youhave therein first the idea of a selfconscious entity, you have then torecognise the thought or purpose which that entity is seeking to express, andfinally, you have the body or form which is the sequential result.The term Logos, translated as the Word, is frequently used in the New Testament,in speaking of the Deity. The outstanding passage in which this is the case isthe first chapter of St. John’s Gospel, where the words occur: “In the beginningwas the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” Let us considerfor a minute the meaning of the expression. Its literal translation is ‘theWord’, and it has been defined as “the rendering in objective expression of aconcealed thought.” If you take any noun, or similar word, for instance, andstudy its objective significance, you will find that always a definite thoughtis conveyed to the mind, involving purpose, intent, or perhaps some abstractconcept. If this same method of study can be extended to include the idea of theDeity or the Logos, much light may be gained upon this abstruse question of themanifestation of God, the central Intelligence, by the means of the materialform, whether we see Him manifested through the tiny form of a chemical atom, orthat gigantic physical body of His we call a solar system.We found in our lecture last week that there was one thing that could bepredicated of all atoms, and that scientists everywhere were coming to recogniseone distinguishing characteristic. They have been shown to possess symptoms ofmind and a rudimentary form of intelligence. The atom demonstrates the qualityof discrimination, of selective power, and of ability to attract or repulse. Itmay seem curious to use the word intelligence in connection with an atom ofchemistry, for instance, but nevertheless the root meaning of the word embodiesthis idea perfectly. It comes from two Latin words: inter, between, and legereto choose. Intelligence, therefore, is the capacity to think or choose, toselect, and to discriminate. It is, in reality, that abstract, inexplicablesomething which lies back of the great law of attraction and repulsion, one ofthe basic laws of manifestation. This fundamental faculty of intelligencecharacterises all atomic matter, and also governs the building up of forms, orthe aggregation of atoms.We have earlier dealt with the atom per se, but have in no way considered itsbuilding into form, or into that totality of forms which we call a kingdom innature. We have considered somewhat the essential nature of the atom, and itsprime characteristic of intelligence, and have laid our emphasis upon that outof which all the different forms as we know them, are built, all forms in themineral kingdom, in the vegetable kingdom, in the animal kingdom, and in thehuman. In the sum total of all forms you have the totality of nature asgenerally understood.Let us now extend our idea from the individual forms that go to the constitutionof any of these four kingdoms of nature, and view them as providing that stillgreater form which we call the kingdom itself, and thus view that kingdom as aconscious unit, forming a homogeneous whole. Thus each kingdom in nature may beconsidered as providing a form through which a consciousness of some kind orgrade can manifest. Thus also, the aggregate of animal forms composes thatgreater form which we designate the kingdom itself, and this animal kingdomlikewise has its place within a still greater body. Through that kingdom aconscious life may be seeking expression, and through the aggregate of kingdomsa still greater subjective Life may be seeking manifestation.In all these kingdoms which we are considering—mineral, vegetable, animal andhuman—we have three factors again present, provided, of course, that the basisof our reasoning is correct; first, that the original atom is itself a life;secondly, that all forms are built up of a multiplicity of lives, and thus acoherent whole is provided through which a subjective entity is working out apurpose; thirdly, that the central life within the form is its directingimpulse, the source of its energy, the origin of its activity, and that whichholds the form together as a unity.This thought can be well worked out in connection with man, for instance. Forthe purposes of our lecture, man can be defined as that central energy, life, orintelligence, who works through a material manifestation or form, this formbeing built up of myriads of lesser lives. In this connection a curiousphenomenon has been frequently noticed at the time of death; it was brought veryspecially to my notice some years ago by one of the ablest surgical nurses ofIndia. She had for a long time been an atheist, but had begun to question theground of her unbelief after several times witnessing this phenomenon. Shestated to me that, at the moment of death, in several cases, a flash of lighthad been seen by her issuing from the top of the head, and that in oneparticular case (that of a girl of apparently very advanced spiritualdevelopment and great purity and holiness of life) the room had appeared to belit up momentarily by electricity. Again, not long ago, several of the leadingmembers of the medical profession in a large middle west city were approached byan interested investigator, by letter, and asked if they would be willing tostate if they had noted any peculiar phenomena at the moment of death. Severalreplied by saying that they had observed a bluish light issuing from the top ofthe head, and one or two added that they had heard a snap in the region of thehead. In this last instance we have a corroboration of the statement inEcclesiastes, where the loosing of the silver cord is mentioned, or the breakingof that magnetic link which unites the indwelling entity or thinker to hisvehicle of expression. In both the types of cases above mentioned can apparentlybe seen an ocular demonstration of the withdrawal of the central light or life,and the consequent disintegration of the form, and the scattering of the myriadlesser lives.It may therefore seem to some of us a logical hypothesis that just as the atomof chemistry is a tiny sphere, or form, with a positive nucleus, which holdsrotating around it the negative electrons, so all forms in all the kingdoms ofnature are of a similar structure, differing only in degree of consciousness orintelligence. We can therefore regard the kingdoms themselves as the physicalexpression of some great subjective life, and can by logical steps come to therecognition that every unit in the human family is an atom in the body of thatgreater unit who has been called in some of the Scriptures the “Heavenly Man.”Thus we arrive finally at the concept that the solar system is but the aggregateof all kingdoms and all forms, and the Body of a Being Who is expressing Himselfthrough it, and utilising it in order to work out a definite purpose and centralidea. In all these extensions of our final hypothesis, the same triplicity canbe seen; an informing Life or Entity manifesting through a form, or amultiplicity of forms, and demonstrating discriminative intelligence.It is not possible to deal with the method whereby the forms are built up, or toenlarge upon the evolutionary process by means of which atoms are combined intoforms, and the forms themselves collected into that greater unit which we call akingdom in nature. This method might be briefly summed up in threeterms—involution, or the involving of the subjective life in matter, the methodwhereby the indwelling Entity takes to itself its vehicle of expression;evolution, or the utilisation of the form by the subjective life, its gradualperfecting, and the final liberating of the imprisoned life; and the law ofattraction and repulsion, whereby matter and spirit are co-ordinated, wherebythe central life gains experience, expands its consciousness, and, through theuse of that particular form attains self-knowledge and self-control. All iscarried forward under this basic law. In every form you have a central life, oridea, coming into manifestation, involving itself more and more in substance,clothing itself in a form and shape adequate to its need and requirement,utilising that form as a means of expression, and then—in due course oftime—liberating itself from the environing form in order to acquire one moresuited to its need. Thus through every grade of form, spirit or life progresses,until the path of return has been traversed, and the point of origin achieved.This is the meaning of evolution and here lies the secret of the cosmicincarnation. Eventually spirit frees itself from form, and attains liberationplus developed psychical quality and graded expansions of consciousness.We might look at these definite stages, and study them very cursorily. We havein the first case the process of involution. This is the period in which thelimiting of the life within the form or sheath proceeds, and it is a long slowprocess, covering millions upon millions of years. This great cycle isparticipated in by every type of life. It concerns the life of the Solar Logosmanifesting through a solar system. It is part of the life cycle of theplanetary Spirit manifesting through such a sphere as our Earth planet; itincludes that life which we call human, and sweeps into the path of its energythe tiny life which functions through an atom of chemistry. It is the greatprocess of becoming, and that which makes existence and being itself possible.This period of limitation, of a gradually increasing imprisonment, and of anever deeper descent into matter, is succeeded by one of adaptation, in which thelife and the form become intimately inter-related, and subsequent to this is theperiod wherein that inner relation becomes perfected. The form is then adequateto the needs of the life, and can be utilised. Then, as the life within growsand expands, it is paralleled by the crystallisation of the form, which nolonger suffices as a means of expression. Following upon crystallisation, wehave the period of disintegration. Limitation, adaptation, utilisation,crystallisation, and disintegration,—these are the stages which cover the lifeof any entity, or embodied idea of greater or less degree, which seeksexpression through matter.Let us carry out this thought in connection with the human being. The process oflimitation can be seen in the taking of a physical form, and in those earlyrebellious days, when a man is full of desires, aspirations, longings andideals, which he seems unable to express or to satisfy. Then comes the period ofadaptation, wherein the man begins to utilise what he has, and to expresshimself as best he may through the medium of those myriads of lesser lives andintelligences which constitute his physical, his emotional, and his mentalbodies. He energises his threefold form, forcing it to carry out his behests andfulfil his purposes, and thus carry out his plan, whether for good or evil. Thisis succeeded by the stage in which he utilises the form as far as in him lies,and comes to what we call maturity. Finally, in the later stages of life, wehave the crystallisation of the form, and the man’s realisation of itsinadequacy. Then comes the happy release which we call death, that great momentin which the “spirit in prison” escapes from the confining walls of its physicalform. Our ideas about death have been erroneous; we have looked upon it as thegreat and ultimate terror, whereas in reality it is the great escape, theentrance into a fuller measure of activity, and the release of the life from acrystallised vehicle and an inadequate form.Thoughts similar to these can be worked out in connection with all forms, andnot only with those in connection with the physical body of a human being. Theseideas can be applied to forms of government, forms of religion, and forms ofscientific or philosophical thought. It can be seen working out in a peculiarlyinteresting manner in this cycle in which we live. Everything is in a state offlux; the old order changeth, and a period of transition is in progress; the oldforms, in every department of thought, are disintegrating, but only in orderthat the life which gave them being may escape, and build for itself that whichwill be more satisfactory and adequate. Take, for instance, the old religiousform of the Christian faith. Here I must warn you not to misunderstand me. I amnot trying to prove that the spirit of Christianity is inadequate, and I am notseeking to demonstrate that its well-tried and well-proven truths are erroneous.I am only trying to point out that the form through which that spirit seeks toexpress itself has somewhat served its purpose, and is proving a limitation.Those same great truths, and those same basic ideas, require a more adequatevehicle through which to function. Christian thinkers at this time need todistinguish very carefully between the vital truths of Christianity, and thecrystallised form of theology. The living impulse was given by the Christ. Heenunciated these great and eternal truths, and sent them forth to take form andmeet the need of a suffering world. They were limited by the form, and therecame a long period wherein that form (religious dogmas and doctrines) graduallygrew and took shape. Centuries ensued wherein the form and the life seemedadapted to each other, and the Christian ideals expressed themselves through themedium of that form. Now the period of crystallisation has set in, and theexpanding Christian consciousness is finding the limitations of the theologiansinadequate and restricting. The great fabric of dogmas and doctrines, as builtup by the churchmen and theologians of the ages, must inevitably disintegrate,but only in order that the life within may escape, build for itself a better andmore satisfactory means of expression, and thus measure up to the mission uponwhich it was sent.In the different schools of thought everywhere the same thing can be seen. Allof them are expressing some idea by means of a particular form, or set of forms,and it is very necessary for us to remember that the triple life back of allforms is nevertheless but One, though the vehicles of expression are diverse,and ever prove inadequate as time elapses.What, then, is the purpose back of this endless process of form building, andthis combining of the lesser forms? What is the reason of it all, and what willprove to be the goal? Surely it is the development of quality, the expansion ofthe consciousness, the development of the faculty of realisation, the productionof the powers of the psyche, or the soul, the evolution of intelligence. Surelyit is the gradual demonstration of the basic idea or purpose which that greatEntity Whom we call the Logos, or God, is working out through the solar system.It is the demonstration of His psychic quality, for God is intelligent Love; andthe fulfilment of His determined purpose, for God is intelligent loving Will.For all the different grades and types of atoms there is a goal and a purposealso. There is a goal for the atom of chemistry; there is a point of achievementfor the human atone, man; the planetary atom also will some day demonstrate itsbasic purpose, and the great Idea which lies back of the solar system will someday be revealed. Is it possible for us in a few brief moments of study to get asound conception of what that purpose may be? Perhaps we can get some broad,general idea, if we approach the subject with sufficient reverence andsensitiveness of outlook, bearing carefully in mind always that only theignorant dogmatise, and only the unwise deal in detail when considering thesestupendous topics.We have seen that the atom of chemistry, for instance, demonstrates the qualityof intelligence; it shows symptoms of discriminative mind, and the rudiments ofselective capacity. Thus the tiny life within the atomic form is demonstratingpsychic quality. The atom is then built into all the different forms at varyingtimes and stages, and each time it gains somewhat according to the force andlife of the entity who en souls that form, and preserves its homogeneity. Take,for instance, the atom that goes to the building of a form in the mineralkingdom; it shows not only discriminative selective mind, but elasticity. Thenin the vegetable kingdom these two qualities appear, but a third is also found,which we might call sensation of a rudimentary kind. The initial intelligence ofthe atom has acquired something during the transition from form to form and fromkingdom to kingdom. Its responsiveness to contact, and its general awarenesshave increased. When we come to the study of the evolution of consciousness wecan take this up in greater detail; all I am endeavouring to do tonight is toshow that in the vegetable kingdom forms built up of atoms show not onlydiscriminative intelligence and elasticity, but also are capable of sensation,or of that which, in the vegetable kingdom, corresponds to emotion or feeling,emotion being but rudimentary love. Next we have the animal kingdom, in whichthe animal forms show not only all the above qualities, but to them is addedinstinct, or that which will some day blossom into mentality. Finally, we cometo the human being, who shows all these qualities in far greater degree, for thefourth kingdom is but the macrocosm for the three lower. Man demonstratesintelligent activity, he is capable of emotion or love, and has added yetanother factor, that of intelligent will. He is the deity of his own littlesystem; he is not only conscious, but he is selfconscious. He builds his ownbody of manifestation, just as does the Logos, only on a tiny scale; he controlshis little system by the great law of attraction and repulsion, as does theLogos, and he energises it and synthesises his threefold nature into a coherentunit. He is the three in one, and the one in three, just as is the Logos.There is a future for every atom in the solar system. Before the ultimate atomthere lies a tremendous goal, and as the aeons slip away the life that animatesthat atom will pass through all the varying kingdoms of nature until it find itsgoal in the human kingdom.The idea might now be extended somewhat, and we might consider that great EntityWho is the informing life of the planet, and Who holds all the differentkingdoms of nature within His consciousness. May it not be possible that Hisintelligence, as it informs the totality of all groups and kingdoms, is the goalfor man, the human atom? Perhaps as time progresses the scope of his presentrealisation may also be ours, and for His, as for all those great Lives Whoinform the planets of the solar system, there may be the attainment of thattremendous reach of consciousness which characterises that great Existence Whois the ensouling Life of the solar system. May it not be true that among thedifferent grades of consciousness, extending, for instance, from the atom of thechemist and physicist, up to the Logos of the solar system, there are no gaps,and no abrupt transitions, but there is ever a gradual expansion and a gradualevolution from one form of intelligent manifestation to another, and always thelife within the form gains in quality by means of the experience.When we have built this idea into our consciousness, when it is apparent to usthat there is purpose and direction underlying everything, when we realise thatnot a single thing occurs that is not the outcome of the conscious will of someentity, and that all that happens has a definite aim and goal, then we have theclue to ourselves, and to all that we see happening around us in the world. If,for instance, we realise that we have the building up and care of our physicalbodies, that we have the control of our emotional nature, and the responsibilityfor the development of our mentality, if we realise that we are the energisingfactors within our bodies, and that when we withdraw from those bodies theydisintegrate and fall to pieces; then perhaps we have the clue to what theinforming Life of the planet may be doing, as He works through forms of everykind (continents, civilisations, religions, and organisations) upon this earth;to what has gone on in the moon, which is now a disintegrating form, to what isgoing on in the solar system, and to what will happen in the solar system whenthe Logos withdraws from that which is, for Him, but a temporary manifestation.Let us now make practical application of these thoughts. We are living at thistime in a period in which all the forms of thought seem breaking up, in whichthe religious life of the peoples is no longer what it was, in which dogma anddoctrine of every kind come under criticism. Many of the old forms of scientificthought are likewise disintegrating, and the foundations of the old philosophiesseem to be shaken. Our lot is cast in one of the most difficult periods of theworld’s history, a period which is characterised by the breakup of nations, thesmashing of old relationships and ties, and the apparently imminent disruptionof civilisation. We need to encourage ourselves by remembering that all this isoccurring just because the life within those forms is becoming so strong that itfinds them a prison and a limitation; and we must recollect that this transitionperiod is the time of the greatest promise that the world has ever seen. Thereis no room for pessimism and despair, but only for the profoundest optimism.Many today are upset and distraught because the foundations seem to be shaken,the carefully reared and deeply cherished structures of religious thought andbelief, and of philosophical finding seem in danger of falling, yet our anxietyexists simply because we have been too much engrossed with the form, and toomuch occupied with our prison, and if disruption has set in, it is only in orderthat the life may build for itself new forms and thereby evolve. The work of thedestroyer is as much the work of God as that of the constructor, and the greatgod of destruction has to smash and rend the forms in order that the work of thebuilder may become possible, and the spirit able more adequately to expressitself.To many of us these ideas may seem novel, fantastic, and untenable. Yet even ifthey are only hypotheses, they may prove interesting and give us a possible clueto the mystery. We see civilisations disrupted, we see the religious fabricstottering, we see philosophies successfully attacked, we see the foundations ofmaterial science shaken. Yet, after all, what are civilisations? What are thereligions? What are the great races? Simply the forms through which the greatthreefold central Life, Who informs our planet, seeks to express Himself. Justas we express ourselves through the medium of a physical, an emotional, and amental nature, so He expresses Himself through the totality of the kingdoms ofnature, and through the nations, races, religions, sciences and philosophies, inexistence at this time. As His life pulsates through every department of Hisbeing we, as cells and atoms within that greater manifestation, follow eachtransition, and are swept along from one stage to another. As time progresses,and our consciousness expands, we shall enter more and more into a knowledge ofHis plan as He is working it out, and shall eventually be in a position tocollaborate with Him in His essential purpose.To sum up the central thought of this lecture: Let us endeavour to realise thatthere is no such thing as inorganic matter, but that every atom is a life. Letus realise that all forms are living forms, and that each is but the vehicle ofexpression for some indwelling entity. Let us seek to comprehend that this islikewise true of the aggregate of all forms. Thus we have the clue to ourselves,and perhaps the clue to the mystery of the solar system."},{"pageContent":"LECTURE IV.THE EVOLUTION OF MAN, THE THINKER.This is the fourth in the series of talks which we have had the past month, andperhaps by means of them we have been able to get an idea of one of thefundamental principles which underlie evolution, and which can be seen workingout in the solar system.Let us first briefly recapitulate, in order that we may approach our subjecttonight with certain ideas clearly formulated. We have seen that ourinterpretation of the processes of nature necessitates a threefold concept,which concerns itself with the life aspect, with the substance aspect, and withtheir close interrelation through the faculty of intelligence manifesting asconsciousness of some kind or other. This interrelation will produce, finally,the perfected expression (through the medium of matter) of the conscious purposeof some indwelling entity. I seek to emphasise the fact that the goal of myendeavour is to put before you a hypothesis and a suggestion which may havewithin it the germ of a possible truth, and which seems to some of us theclearest way of explaining the mystery of the universe. We have seen that thethree parts of the one great whole are Spirit, or Life, manifesting through asecond factor which we call substance or matter, and utilising a third factor,which we call the intelligence. In the gradual synthesis of these threecomponent aspects of deity can be seen the evolution of consciousness.We next arrived at a more technical discussion of the subject of substanceitself, dealing not with the differentiated substances or elements, but with theconcept of a primordial substance, and endeavouring to get back as far aspossible toward that which has been called by Sir William Crookes “protyle”, orthat which lies back of the tangible, or objective. We considered the atom, andfound that its latest definition was that it was in reality a unit of force orenergy consisting of a positive charge of electricity energising a number ofnegative particles. It became apparent to us that the tiny atom of the chemistand the physicist was within itself a solar system, with the same generalconformation as the greater system, demonstrating a similar activity andgoverned by analogous laws. We found that it had a central sun, and that aroundthis central sun, pursuing their definite orbits, night be seen the electrons.We noted, also, the fact that the elements differ only according to the numberand the arrangement of these electrons around the central positive charge. Fromthis we passed on to the consideration of the soul, or the psyche, of the atom,and found that scientists recognise the truth that atoms themselves possessquality, show symptoms of mind or intelligence, and can discriminate, select,and choose.We then proceeded to weave what appeared to be a fairytale. We pictured thehuman being as an atom, and traced the resemblance of man to an atom; we foundthat he attracted and held within his sphere of influence the matter of hisvarious bodies, mental, emotional and physical, in exactly the same way as theelectrons were held revolving around their central focal point. The idea provedcapable of still further expansion, and we turned our attention to the planet,picturing it as similar in its nature to the human atom, and to the ultimateatom of substance, being but the expression of a life manifesting through aspheroidal form and working out an intelligent purpose. Then we reached ourconsummation, and viewed the solar system as a cosmic atom, energised by thelife of the Logos.We have, therefore, under consideration, four kinds of atoms:First, the atom of the chemist and physicist.Secondly, the human atom, or man.Thirdly, the planetary atom, energised by a planetary Logos, or the HeavenlyMan.Fourthly, the solar atom, indwelt by the solar Logos, or the Deity.If we are right in our fundamental concept, if there is a grain of reality inour hypothesis, and if there is a substratum of truth in our idea of the atomfrom which the elements are compounded, it is to be recognised as a life workingintelligently through the medium of a form. Then it can perhaps be proven thatman is equally a life or centre of energy, manifesting through his bodies; thenit can perhaps be demonstrated that a planet is also the medium of expression ofa still greater centre of energy, and further, under the law of analogy, it mayperhaps be proven at some distant time that there is a God or central life backof material nature, and an Entity Who functions consciously through the solarsystem.At our last lecture we took up another phase of manifestation. We studied theatom itself, and considered it as it entered into relationship with other atoms,and through their mutual coherence formed groups or congeries of atoms. In otherwords, we considered the atom as it was built into the different forms in thevarious kingdoms of nature, and found that, in the process of evolution, atomsthemselves gravitate towards other and greater central points, becoming in theirturn electrons. Thus, every form is but an aggregate of smaller lives.Very briefly then we touched upon the different kingdoms of nature, and tracedthe development of the soul, or the psyche in all of them. Of the atom we havealready predicated intelligence, or discriminative power, and we found that inthe building up of forms in the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms what weunderstand as sensation begins to appear, and we then have the rudiments ofembryonic emotion, or feeling—the physical plane reflection of love. Thus wehave one aspect of the threefold nature of God, intelligence, demonstratingthrough the atom; and through the form we have the love, or attractive qualitymanifesting. This can also be expressed in the recognition that in these twoaspects of the central divine life you have the third person of the LogoicTrinity co-operating with the second; you have the intelligent activity ofdivinity, or the Holy Spirit aspect, working in connection with the secondaspect, or the Son, Who is the builder of forms. This is brought out in aninteresting manner in Proverbs viii. where Wisdom cries aloud (Wisdom in the OldTestament representing the Christ aspect), and after pointing out that He waswith God before ever there was creation, goes on to say that when “He appointedthe foundations of the earth, then I was by Him as the master worker orbuilder”. Students would do well to study this chapter in connection with theideas that we are here formulating, being careful to ascertain the exacttranslation.We now come to the consideration of our subject for tonight, that of theevolution of man, the thinker. We shall see that in man comes in another aspectof divinity. Browning, in Paracelsus, covers the subject that we have beenconsidering in a most interesting manner, summing it up as follows:“Thus He (God) dwells in all, To man—the consummation of this scheme Of being, the completion of this sphere Of life: whose attributes had here and there Been scattered o’er the visible world before, Asking to be combined, dim fragments meant To be united in some wondrous whole, Imperfect qualities throughout creation, Suggesting some one creature yet to make, Some point where all those scattered rays should meet Convergent in the faculties of man.”Having therefore discovered two aspects of divinity-in the atom and in the form,we shall find the triplicity perfected in man. We have been told that man ismade in the image of God, and we would therefore expect to see him reflectingthe threefold nature of the Logos. He must demonstrate intelligence, he mustshow forth love, and he must manifest will. Let us consider some of thedefinitions of man as found in the dictionary and elsewhere. The definitionfound in the Standard Dictionary is a profoundly uninteresting one, and is asfollows:—Man is “an individual of the human race”, and then follows a long listof suggestive derivations of the word man, running through every known tongue,and concluding with the statement that many of them are improbable. Thatderivation which ascribes the definition of man to the Sanskrit root ‘man’, theone who thinks, is to my mind the most satisfying. Mrs. Besant, in one of herbooks, gives an exceptionally clear definition as follows: “Man is that being inwhom highest spirit and lowest matter are linked together by intelligence.” Manis here pictured as the meeting place for all the three lines of evolution,spirit, matter, and linking intellect; he is shown to be the one who unifies theself, the not-self, and the relation between them, and he is seen to be theknower, that which is known, and knowledge. What is the purpose of theintellect, or of knowledge? Surely its purpose is to adapt the material form tothe need and requirements of the indwelling spirit; surely it is to enable thethinker within the body to utilise it intelligently, and for some definitepurpose; and surely it exists in order that the central energising unit mayconstructively control its negative aspect. We are all of us entities, ensoulinga form, and through the intelligence endeavouring to utilise that form for aspecific purpose which exists within the conscious will of the true self.In a very old occult book—so old that the date of it cannot be ascertained—canbe found a definition of man which is very illuminating, and in line with thethought that we are seeking to develop tonight. Man is there defined as: “theLife and the lives.” We have seen that the atom is a life, manifesting by meansof the little sphere of which it is the centre. We have seen that all forms arean aggregate of lives, built up into the mineral, vegetable, and animalkingdoms. Now we can pass to the next stage on this great ladder of evolution,and we will then find that the human being is the logical sequence that growsout of all these earlier developments. First, the primordial stuff, essentiallyintelligent energy; next, atomic matter, in all its varying activity forming theelemental combination; then the form, the aggregate of these atoms, up to thedweller within the form, who is not only active intelligence, not only inherentattraction and love, but is also a purposeful will. This “dweller within” tookpossession of the form when it had reached a certain o stage of preparedness,and when the component lives had reached a certain vibratory capacity; he is nowutilising it, and repeating, within his own sphere of influence, the work of theatom of matter; he demonstrates, nevertheless, not in one way, nor in two, butin three. In man, therefore, in deed and in truth, you have what the Christianwould term the “image of God.” For, as must be apparent to all thinkers, theonly way in which we can know God is through the study of His nature, or Hispsychic quality. We know that God is intelligence, we know that He is love, orthe great attractive force of the solar system, and we know that He is the greatwill or purpose back of all manifestation. In every Scripture in the world theDeity is pictured under these three aspects, and manifests through nature inthis triple manner.The evolution of substance is a thing of gradual growth; it is in timesupplemented by the slow working out of the inner subjective quality of the lifeof God, and thus His essential nature is demonstrated. First, you have oneaspect demonstrating, then another slowly appears, and finally the third can beseen, and you have the stupendous combination and consummation, the human being.He synthesises and blends the three aspects, uniting them in himself. He is thetotality of the divine attributes, though as yet they are largely embryonic, andhe has to repeat within his cycle of evolution the identical processes that theatom itself has followed. Just as the atom pursues its own internal course, andjust as it also has later to be drawn into and to merge and blend with otheratoms in the formation of a group, so the human atom equally has to find hisplace within a greater form.Let us, therefore, consider for a little what is the method of the evolutionaryprocess for a human being. We have seen that in him the three lines converge,and that he is a point of synthesis, with one aspect as yet predominant, that ofthe intelligence, with the second aspect of love-wisdom just beginning to makeits presence felt, and with the highest aspect of spiritual will as yet purelyembryonic.We have, nearly all of us, been brought up in the belief in what is called “thefall of man”. There are few these days who believe the story of the fall as itis given in the first chapter of Genesis, and we most of us credit it as havingan allegorical interpretation. What is the occult truth underlying this curiousstory? Simply that the truth about the fall of the spirit into matter isconveyed by means of a picture to the infant mentality of man. The process ofthe converging of these lines is a twofold one. You have the descent into matterof the entity, of the central life, and the incarnation of spirit, and then youhave the working up, out of matter, of that life or spirit, plus all that hasbeen gained through the utilisation of form. By experimenting with matter, bydwelling within the form, by the energising of substance, by the going out ofthe Garden of Eden (the place where there is no scope for necessarydevelopment), and by the wandering of the Prodigal Son in the far country, youhave the various stages which are pictured in the Christian. Bible where manmakes the discovery that he is not the form, but that he is the one who utilisesit. He is intelligence, and therefore he is made in the image of the thirdPerson of the Trinity; he is love, and through him the love aspect of the Deitywill some day perfectly manifest, and he will be able to say with his elderBrother, the Christ, in reply to the demand “Lord, show us the Father”, that “hethat hath seen me hath seen the Father”, for God is Love; and finally, throughhim the highest aspect, the will of God, will become manifest, and he will beperfect, even as his Father in heaven is perfect.Just as in the evolution of substance three stages could be seen,—that of atomicenergy, of group coherence, and of eventual synthesis,—so in the evolution ofman will the same appear. You will have, in the early stages of human evolution,that which we might call the atomic stage, in which man comes to a gradualrecognition that he is a selfconscious unit, with an individuality all his own.Anyone who has brought up children knows that stage well. It can be seen in thatconstant utterance of “my, my, my,” the stage of appropriation for himself, withno thought of any other self. Children are naturally, advisedly, and wiselyselfish. It is the stage of the gradual recognition of separative existence, andof the utilisation ever more potently by the human atom of its own internalatomic force. The infant human being rebels against the enforced guardianship ofthose who seek to protect it, and considers itself sufficient unto itself. Thiscan be seen in the individual and the race.Then, as life goes on, the man passes out of the atomic stage to a higher and abetter one, when he becomes cognisant of his group relationships, when hebecomes aware that he has group responsibilities, and that he has functions towork out with other separate atoms. The group consciousness begins to makeitself felt. Thus the human atom finds its place within the group, the largerunit to which it belongs, and the love aspect begins to show itself. The man haspassed out of the atomic stage into that of group coherence.Later comes the stage when the man begins to realise that he has not onlyresponsibilities to the group, but that there is something greater still. Herealises that he is a part of a great universal life which underlies all groups,that he is not just a universal atom, that he is not just part of a group, butthat, after merging his identity with the group—although never losing it—thegroup itself has to be blended again with the consciousness of that greatIdentity Who is the synthesis of them all. Thus he arrives at the final stage ofintelligent appreciation of divine unity.This triple idea can be found summed up in the Bible in a rather interestingphrase, where Jehovah says to Moses, the representative man, “I am that I am”.If you split this verse into its three parts you have what I have been seekingto bring out tonight: First, the atomic consciousness, I AM; then the group, IAM THAT; a consciousness that he is not just a separated individual, not only aselfcentred unit, not only a self-conscious entity, but that he is somethingstill greater. Man then reaches the recognition which will lead him to sacrificehis identity in the service of the group, and to merge his consciousness in thatof the group. Of such a conscious union we know practically nothing as yet. Thisis succeeded by the still greater stage, when I AM THAT I AM will be for us notan impossible ideal, and a visionary concept, but a fundamental reality, whenman in the aggregate will recognise himself as an expression of the universallife, and the group consciousness itself will be merged in that of the Aggregateof all groups.We suppose, and we hope, that we are passing rapidly out of the atomic stage,and that our sphere of influence and interest is not bounded by our atomic wall,but that we are becoming (to use a now familiar term) radio-active. When this isthe case we shall not be circumscribed and limited within our own shell, and thenarrow confines of our own individual life, but we shall begin to radiate, andto contact other atoms, thus reaching the second stage, the attractive.What, therefore, is the goal ahead for each one of us? What is the goal forthese different atoms with which we are concerning ourselves? We are told insome of the old Eastern Scriptures, that the goal for the atom of substance isselfconsciousness. What is, therefore, the goal for the human atom, who isalready selfconscious, who is already individualised, and guiding himself bymeans of his will? What lies ahead for man? Simply the expansion of hisconsciousness to include the consciousness of the great life, or being, in whosebody he is himself a cell. Our physical body is, for instance, made up ofinnumerable lesser lives, or atoms, each one of them separated from itsneighbour, each one of them distinguished by its own inherent activity, and eachone forming a sphere which holds within its periphery other lesser spheres orelectrons.We have seen that man is the positive charge, and holds his multiplicity ofatoms, or lesser lives, energised and bound together into coherent forms. Atdeath, when the spirit aspect withdraws itself, the form disintegrates, and isdissolved, and these little conscious lives, having fulfilled their function,dissipate. The consciousness of the atom within the body is a very differentthing to the consciousness of a man, and this we can realise with very littlethought. If we concede that man is a cell in a greater sphere, may it not bepossible that there is a consciousness which is to the man what hisconsciousness is to the cell in his body? Is it not possible that we may haveahead of us the achievement of that consciousness in the same sense as the atomof substance may some day achieve the consciousness of a human being? May it notbe that this is what Browning had in his mind when he said: “Mankind, made up ofall the single men; in such a synthesis the story ends.” Here he holds up beforeus a concept of a greater Man, who is the synthesis or sum total of all thelesser units. Perhaps that synthesis may be the great Life, or the planetaryEntity Who lies back of our planetary manifestation, and Who is the suns totalof the group consciousness. I suggest that just as selfconsciousness is the goalfor all the sub-human forms of life, and as group consciousness, or theconsciousness of the Heavenly Man, is the goal for the human being, so for him,also, there may be a goal, and for him the achievement may be the development ofGod consciousness. So for him comes the struggle to evolve the realisation whichis that of the solar Logos.Thus can be seen the unity of consciousness from the most minute atom up to theDeity Himself. Thus opens up before us a wonderful picture, and a vista ofpossibility. Thus may the life of God be seen in its essential triplemanifestation, working out in an ever expanding consciousness; demonstrating inthe atom of substance, and expanding through the medium of form, until it findsone point of culmination in man, then proceeding on its course till itdemonstrates as the planetary consciousness, which is the sum total of all thestates of consciousness upon our planet, the earth, until we arrive at thefundamental basic Life, Who holds all the planetary evolutions synthesisedwithin His greater sphere, the solar system. Thus, in summing up, we have fourstates of intelligent activity, which we might term consciousness,selfconsciousness, group consciousness, and God consciousness. These demonstratethrough four types of atoms, first, the chemical atom and all atomic forms;secondly, the human atom; then, the planetary atom, and finally theall-encompassing solar atom. Ensouling these atomic forms can be seenmanifesting all sub-human types of life, from the life of the atom of substanceto the informing life of the higher animals, then that life which we call human,that of man, the thinker; next, the Heavenly Man, and then the great Life of thesolar system, Whom the Christian calls God, or the Logos.Browning expresses this idea of the gradual expansion of the consciousness of ahuman being into something greater and vaster in the following words:“When all the race is perfected alike As man, that is; all tended to mankind, And, man produced, all has its end thus far; But in completed man begins anew A tendency to God. Prognostics told Man’s near approach; so in man’s self arise August anticipations, symbols, types Of a dim splendour ever on before In that eternal circle life pursues. For men begin to pass their nature’s bound, And find new hopes and cares which fast supplant Their proper joys and griefs; they grow too great For narrow creeds of right and wrong, which fade Before the unmeasured thirst for good: while peace Rises within them ever more and more. Such men are even now upon the earth Serene amid the half-formed creatures round Who should be saved by them and joined with them.”"},{"pageContent":"LECTURE V.THE EVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS.Last week we studied, very inadequately, the evolution of man, the thinker, thetenant of the bodies, and the one who uses them during the cycle of evolution.We saw that he was the summation of the evolutions which had preceded him. Weled up to our study of that evolution in two previous lectures in which weconsidered first the substance, or atomic matter prior to its building up into aform, or the tiny atom before it was incorporated in a vehicle of some kind.Then we studied the building of forms by means of the great law of attraction,which gathered the atoms together, causing them to cohere and vibrate in unison,and thus producing a form, or an aggregation of atoms. We came to therecognition that in atomic substance we had one aspect of the Godhead, of theDeity, and of the central Force or energy of the solar system, manifesting underthe aspect of intelligence, and we saw that in the form aspect of nature anotherquality of the Deity became manifest, that of love or attraction, the cohesiveforce which holds the form unified. Then we studied the human being, or man, andnoted how in him all the three divine aspects met; and recognised man as acentral will manifesting through a form composed of atoms, and demonstrating thethree qualities of God, that of intelligence, of love-wisdom, and of will orpower.Today we are stepping out of the matter aspect of manifestation which we havebeen dealing with in the previous lectures, into the consideration of theconsciousness within the form. We have seen that the atom may be regarded as thecentral life, manifesting through a spheroidal form, and showing the quality ofmind; but the human atom may also be considered as a central positive life,utilising a form and demonstrating the different qualities we have enumerated;and then we said that, if we were right in our hypothesis about the atom, if wewere right in considering the human being as an atom, then we night extend thisprimary conception to the planet, and say that within the planetary atom thereis a great Life, manifesting through a form, and showing specific qualitieswhilst working out a specified aim; and we extended this same concept also tothe great sphere of the solar system, and to the Deity Who indwells it.Let us take up the question of consciousness itself, and study the problem alittle and concern ourselves with the reaction of the life within the form. If Ican thus give you a few general ideas in line with what has been earlier said, Ishall be able to lay another stone upon the structure I am endeavouring tobuild.The word consciousness comes from two Latin words: con, with; and scio, to know;and means literally ‘that with which we know’. If you take a dictionary and lookup this word you will find it defined somewhat as follows: “The state of beingaware”, or the condition of perceiving, the ability to respond to stimuli, thefaculty of recognising contacts, and the power to synchronise vibration. Allthese phrases might be included in any definition of consciousness, but the oneI want to lay emphasis upon this evening is that which the Standard Dictionarygives, and which I have earlier quoted. The average thinker who takes up themajority of the text-books dealing with this subject, is apt to find them veryconfusing, for they divide consciousness and the state of being aware intonumerous divisions and subdivisions, until one is left in a state of completebewilderment. Tonight we will only touch upon three types of consciousness,which we might enumerate as follows: Absolute consciousness, universalconsciousness, and individual consciousness, and of these three it is onlypossible, really, to define two in any way with clarity.Absolute consciousness, to the ordinary thinker, is practically impossible ofrecognition. It has been defined in one book as, “that consciousness in whicheverything is, the possible as well as the actual”, and concerns everything thatcan be possibly conceived of as having occurred, or occurring, or going tooccur. This is, possibly, absolute consciousness, and from the standpoint of thehuman being is the consciousness of God, Who contains within Himself the past,the present, and the future. What, then, is universal consciousness? It might bedefined as consciousness, thinking time and space, consciousness with the ideaof location and succession involved within it, or, in reality, groupconsciousness, the group itself forming either a greater or a lesser unit.Finally, individual consciousness may be defined as just as much of theuniversal consciousness as a separated unit can contact and can conceive of foritself.Now, to understand these vague expressions—absolute, universal, and individualconsciousness—it might be helpful if I endeavoured somewhat to illustrate. Itmight be done as follows: In our earlier lectures we have seen that we mustconsider the atom in the human body as a little entity, a tiny, intelligentlife, and a microscopic, active sphere. Now taking that little cell as ourstarting point we may get, by its means, some concept of what these three typesof consciousness are, by viewing them from the standpoint of the atom and man.Individual consciousness to the tiny atom in a man’s body would be its ownvibratory life, its own internal activity, and all that specifically concernsitself. Universal consciousness to the little cell might be considered as theconsciousness of the entire physical body, viewing it as the unit whichincorporates the atom. Absolute consciousness to the atom might be considered asthe consciousness of the thinking man who is energising the body. That would beto the atom something so remote to its own inner internal life as to bepractically inconceivable and unknown, yet it nevertheless sweeps into the lineof its will the form and the atom within the form, and all that concerns them.This idea has only to be extended to man, considered as an atom or cell withinthe body of a great Entity, and one can then work out along similar lines Thisconception of a threefold consciousness. It might here be wise if we were tocome down and consider more practical matters than absolute consciousness.Occidental science is coming gradually to the conclusion of the esotericphilosophy of the East, that consciousness must be predicated not only of theanimal and of the human being, but that it must be recognised also as extendingthrough the vegetable on into the mineral kingdom, and that self consciousnessmust be regarded as the consummation of the evolutionary growth of consciousnessin the three lower kingdoms. It is not possible in the short time now at mydisposal, to go into that most fascinating study of the development ofconsciousness in the animal kingdom, in the vegetable kingdom, and itsappearance also in the mineral kingdom; we should find, should we do so, thateven minerals show symptoms of awareness, of reaction to stimuli; that theymanifest signs of fatigue, and that it is possible to poison a mineral and tomurder it, much as you can murder a human being. The fact that flowers haveconsciousness is being more readily recognised, and articles of very deepinterest have been published on the consciousness of plants, opening up a verywide range of thought. We have seen that in atomic matter the only thing that wecan safely predicate is that it shows intelligence, the power to select, and todiscriminate. This is the predominant feature of consciousness as it manifeststhrough the mineral kingdom. In the vegetable kingdom another quality appears,that of sensation or feeling of a rudimentary nature. It is responsive in adifferent way to the mineral. In the animal kingdom a third reaction appears;not only is the animal showing signs of sensation in greatly increased degree tothe similar response in the vegetable kingdom, but it also shows signs ofintellect, or embryo mind. Instinct is a recognised faculty of all animal units,and the word comes from the same root as the word “instigate.” When the power toinstigate begins within any animal form it is a sign that an embryo mentality isbeginning to manifest. In all these kingdoms you have different grades and typesof consciousness showing themselves, whilst in man you have the first symptomsof selfconsciousness, or the faculty in man whereby he becomes aware that he isa separated identity, that he is the indwelling impulse within the body, and theone who is in process of becoming aware by means of these bodies. This has beenlong taught in the East, and “esoteric philosophy teaches that everything livesand is conscious, but that not all life and consciousness is similar to thehuman”, and it also emphasises the fact that “vast intervals exist between theconsciousness of the atom and of the flower, between that of a flower and a man,between that of a man and a God.” As Browning has said: “In man begins anew atendency to God.” He is not a God yet, but a God in the making; he is workingout the image of God, and will some day produce it in perfection. He is the onewho is seeking to demonstrate the subjective, divine, threefold life through themedium of the objective.The method of the evolutionary development of consciousness in a human being isbut a repetition on a higher turn of the spiral, of the two stages which wenoted in the evolution of the atom, that of atomic energy and of groupcoherence. In the world at present can be seen the human family at the atomicstage of manifestation, leading on to a goal not yet achieved, the group stage.If there is one thing apparent to all of us who are in any way interested in thefaculty of awareness, and who are in the habit of noting that which passesaround us, it is that of the different grades of mentality which we meeteverywhere, and the different types of consciousness among men. We meet peoplewho are alert, alive, aware of all that is going on, keenly conscious,responsive to thought currents of various kinds in human affairs, and consciousof contacts of every kind; then we meet people who seem to be asleep; there isapparently so little that interests them; they seem utterly unaware of contact;they are yet in a stage of inertia, and are not capable of responding to muchouter stimuli; they are not mentally alive. One notices it, also, in children;some respond so quickly, while others we call stupid. It is not really that oneis more or less essentially stupid than another; it is simply due to the innerstage of evolution of the child, to its more frequent incarnations, and thelonger period that it has been occupied in becoming aware.Let us now take the two stages, the atomic and the form stage, and see how theconsciousness of the human being develops, bearing ever in mind that in thehuman atom is stored up all that has been gained in the earlier stages in thethree lower kingdoms of nature. Man is the gainer by that vast evolutionaryprocess which lies behind him. He starts with all that has been gained thereinlatent within him. He is self conscious, and has before him a definite goal, theattainment of group consciousness. For the atom of substance the goal had beenthe attainment of selfconsciousness. For the human being the goal is a greaterConsciousness, and a wider range of awareness.The atomic stage which we are now considering is, for us, a peculiarlyinteresting one, because it is the stage in which the majority of the humanfamily find themselves. In it we pass through the period (a most necessary one)of self-centredness, that cycle in which the man is principally concerned withhis own affairs, with that which primarily interests him, and lives his ownintense, internal, vibratory life. For a long period back of us, and perhaps atthe present stage, ( for I do not believe that many of us would feel insulted ifwe were not regarded as having attained perfection, or having achieved the goal)we are most of us intensely selfish, and only mentally interested in the thingsthat are going on in the world, and then probably because our hearts aretouched, and we do not like being uncomfortable, or we are interested because itis the fashion; and yet, in spite of this mental attitude, our whole attentionis focussed upon the things which concern our own individual life. We are in theatomic stage, intensely active in connection with our own personal problems.Watch the throngs in the streets of any great city, and you will see everywherepeople in the atomic stage, centred entirely in themselves, occupied only withtheir own business, intent upon their own pleasure getting, desirous only ofhaving a good time, and only incidentally occupied with affairs which concernthe group. This is a necessary and protective stage, and one of essential valueto every unit of the human family. The realisation of this, therefore, willsurely lead us all to be patient with our brothers and sisters who may so oftenirritate us.What are the two factors whereby we evolve in and out of the atomic stage. Inthe Orient for many ages the method of evolution has been regarded as a twofoldone. A man has been taught that he evolves and becomes aware first by means ofthe five senses, and later through the development of the faculty ofdiscrimination, coupled with dispassion. Here in the West we have primarilyemphasised the five senses, and have not taught that discrimination which is soessential. If you watch the development of a little child you will become aware,for instance, that a baby develops the five senses in a certain orderedsequence, usually. The first sense it develops is hearing; it will move its headwhen there is a noise. Then the next sense to be noted is that of touch, and itbegins to feel about with its little hands. The third sense which seems toawaken is that of sight. I do not mean by this that a baby cannot see, or thatit is born blind, like a kitten, but it is often several weeks before a babyconsciously sees and looks with recognition. The faculty has always been there,but there has been no realisation. So it is with the graded expansions ofconsciousness and realisations that lie ahead of man today. In these threeparamount, or major senses, hearing, touch, and sight, you have a veryinteresting analogy to, and connection with the threefold manifestation ofDeity, the self, the not-self, and the relation between. The self, occultly,hears and responds to vibration, thus realising Itself. It becomes aware of thenot-self, and of its tangibility, through touch, but it is only when sight orconscious recognition comes in that the relation between the two is established.Two more senses are utilised by the self in making its contacts, those of tasteand smell, but they are not so essential to the development of intelligentawareness as are the other three. Through these five senses we make everycontact that it is possible to make upon the physical plane; through them welearn, we grow, we become aware, and we develop; through them all the greatinstincts are evolved; they are the great protective senses, not only enablingus to contact our environment, but also protecting us from that environment.Having, then, learnt to be intelligent units by means of these five senses, andhaving, through their medium, expanded our consciousness, we reach a certaincrisis, and another factor comes in, that of intelligent discrimination. Here Iam referring to the discrimination which a selfconscious unit demonstrates. Irefer to that conscious choice which you and I evidence, and which we will beforced to utilise as the power of evolution drives us on to the point where wewill learn to distinguish between the self and the not-self, between the realand the unreal, between the life within the form, and the form which it uses,between the knower and that which is known. Here we have the whole object ofevolution, the attainment of the consciousness of the real self through themedium of the not-self.We pass through a long period or cycle of many lives, wherein we identifyourselves with the form, and are so one with the not-self that we recognise nodifference, being entirely occupied with the things which are transient andimpermanent. It is this identification with the not-self which leads to all thepain, dissatisfaction, and sorrow in the world, and yet we must remember thatthrough this reaction of the self to the not-self we inevitably learn, andfinally break loose from the impermanent and the unreal. This cycle ofidentification with the unreal parallels the stage of individual consciousness.As the atom of substance has. to find its way into some form, and add its quotaof vitality to a greater unit, so through the evolutionary development ofconsciousness the human atom has likewise to reach a point where it recognisesits place in a greater Whole, and shoulders its responsibility in groupactivity. This is the stage which a great number of the human family are nowapproaching. Men are realising, as never before, the difference between the realand the unreal, between the permanent and the impermanent; through pain andsuffering they are awakening to the recognition that the not-self suffices not,and they are searching without and also within, for that which will moreadequately meet their needs. Men are seeking to understand themselves, to findthe kingdom of God within themselves, and through Mental Science, New Thought,and the study of psychology they will arrive at certain realisations which willprove invaluable to the human race. The indication is therefore to be found thatthe form stage is rapidly approaching, and that men are passing out of theatomic period into something infinitely better and greater. Man is beginning tosense the vibration of that greater Life within Whose body he is but as an atom,and he is commencing, in a small way, to make a conscious response to thatgreater call, and to find possible channels whereby he can understand thatgreater Life which he senses, but as yet does not know. If he persists in this,he will find the group to which he belongs, and will then change his centre. Nolonger will he be limited by his own little atomic wall, but he will pass beyondit, and become, in his turn, a conscious, active, intelligent part of thegreater whole.And how is this change brought about? The atomic stage was developed by means ofthe five senses, and through the utilisation of the faculty of discrimination.The stage at which a man awakens to group realisation, and becomes a consciousparticipant in the activities of the group, is brought about in two ways,through meditation, and through a series of initiations. Now when I use the word“meditation” I do not mean what is perhaps usually understood by that word, anegative, receptive, state of mind, or a state of trance. There is muchmisconception these days as to what meditation really is, and there is a greatdeal of so called meditation which has been truly described by a person not solong ago, as “I shut my eyes, and open my mouth, and wait for something tohappen.” The true meditation is something that requires the most intenseapplication of the mind, the utmost control of thought, and an attitude which isneither negative nor positive, but an equal balance between the two. In theEastern Scriptures the man who is attempting meditation and achieving itsresults, is described as follows—and from a consideration of these words maycome much help and illumination to us: “The Maha Yogi, the great ascetic, inwhom is centred the highest perfection of austere penance and abstractmeditation, by which the most unlimited powers are attained, marvels andmiracles are worked, the highest spiritual knowledge is acquired, and union withthe great Spirit of the universe is eventually attained.” Here this union withthe group life is held to be the product of meditation, and there is no othermethod of attainment.True meditation (of which the preliminary stages are concentration upon andapplication to any particular line of thought) will differ for different peopleand different types. The religious man, the mystic, will centre his attentionupon the life within the form, upon God, upon Christ, or upon that whichembodies for him the ideal. The business man, or the professional man, who,during his hours of work, is one-pointedly centred upon the matter he has onhand, and who keeps his attention fixed upon the particular problem he has tosolve, is learning to meditate. Later on, when he comes to the more spiritualaspect of meditation, he will find that he has covered the hardest part of theroad. The person who is reading a difficult book, and reads with the full forceand power of his brain, getting at that which lies behind the written word, maybe meditating as much as it is possible for him to meditate at this time. I saythis for our encouragement, because we live in a cycle in which books aboutmeditation are written, and many schools of meditation are found. All of themembody some aspect of the truth, and may be doing much good, but they may notembody that which is best for any particular individual. We need to find our ownway of concentrating, to ascertain our own method of approach to that which lieswithin, and to study for ourselves this question of meditation.I would like here to sound a word of warning. Avoid those schools and methodswhich combine forms of breathing exercises with meditation, which teachdifferent types of physical postures, and teach their students to centre theirattention upon physical organs or centres. Those who follow these methods areheading towards disaster, and apart from the physical dangers involved, and therisk of insanity and nervous disorders, they are occupying themselves with theform, which is limitation, and not with the spirit, which is life. The goal willnot be achieved that way. For most of us the intellectual concentration whichresults in mind control, and the ability to think clearly and to think only thatwhich we wish to think, must precede true meditation, which is a thing fewpeople know much about. This true meditation, which it is impossible for me toenlarge upon here, will result in a definite change of polarisation, will openup to man ranges of experiences undreamt of hitherto, will reveal to himcontacts that as yet he does not realise, and will enable him to find his placewithin the group. He will be no longer confined by the wall of his personallife, but will begin to merge that life within the greater whole. He will nolonger be occupied with the things of selfish interest, but will give hisattention to the problems of the group. He will no longer give his time to theculture of his own identity, but will seek to understand that greater Identityof which he is a part. This is really what all advanced men are beginning moreor less to do. Little as the average man may realise it, great thinkers, such asEdison and others, arrive at a solution of their problems along the line ofmeditation. By a brooding concentration, by a constant recollection, and bystrenuous application to the particular line of thought which interests them,they produce results, they tap the inner reservoirs of inspiration and of power,and bring down from the higher levels of the mental plane results which benefitthe group. When we ourselves have done a certain amount of work along the lineof meditation, when we are cultivating group interest and not self interest,when we have developed physical bodies that are strong and clean, and emotionalbodies that are controlled, and not swayed by desire, when we have mental bodiesthat are our instruments and not our masters, then we shall know the truemeaning of meditation.When a man has made his contact through meditation with the group to which hebelongs, and becomes, therefore, ever more and more group conscious, he is thenin a position to take what are called a series of initiations. These initiationsare simply expansions of consciousness, brought about with the help of Those Whohave already achieved the goal, Who have already identified Themselves with thegroup, and Who are a conscious part of the body of the Heavenly Man. With Theirassistance, and through Their aid, a man will gradually awaken to therealisation that is Theirs.There is great interest everywhere today in this subject of initiation, and anover-emphasis has been laid upon its ceremonial aspect. We need to remember thatevery great unfoldment of consciousness is an initiation. Every step forwardalong the path of awareness is an initiation. When an atom of substance wasbuilt into the form, it was for that atom an initiation. It became aware ofanother type of force, and its range of contact became wider. When theconsciousness of the vegetable and animal kingdom merged, and the life passedfrom the lower kingdom into the higher, that was an initiation. When theconsciousness of the animal expanded into that of the human being, still anothergreat initiation took place. All the four kingdoms have been entered by aninitiation, or through an expansion of consciousness. Ahead of the human familylies now the fifth, or spiritual kingdom, and it is likewise entered through acertain initiation, as can be seen by those who intelligently read their NewTestament. And in all these cases these initiations have been brought about bythe help of Those who already know. Thus we have within the evolutionary schemenot great gaps between one kingdom and another, and between one state ofawareness and another, but a gradual development of consciousness, and one inwhich we, each one of us, have had and will have our share. If we can rememberthis universality of initiation we shall have a better proportioned point ofview in connection with it. Every time that we become more aware of ourenvironment, and our mental content is increased, it is an initiation on a tinyscale. Every time our horizon widens, and we think and see more broadly, it isan initiation, and herein to us lies the value of life itself, and the greatnessof our opportunity.One point I wish to make here is this: every initiation has to beself-initiated. That final stage when definite help is brought to us fromoutside sources is not achieved because there are great Beings anxious to helpus, Who come to us where we are and seek to lift us. It comes to us because wehave done the necessary work, and nothing can stop it coming. It is our right.Those who have achieved can and will and do aid and assist us, but Their handsare tied until we have done our share of the undertaking. Nothing therefore thatwe do to increase our usefulness in the world, no steps that we take to buildbetter bodies, no effort that we make to gain selfcontrol and to equip ourmental body, is ever lost; it is all something which we are adding to the totalwe are piling up, which will some day bring us to a great revelation, and everyhourly, daily effort that we make, swells the tide of energy which will sweep usto the portal of initiation. The meaning of the word “initiation” is to “to gointo.” It means simply that an initiate is one who has taken the first stepsinto the spiritual kingdom, and has had the first series of spiritualrevelations, each one of which is a key to a still greater revelation."},{"pageContent":"LECTURE VI.THE GOAL OF EVOLUTION.In using such a title as the Goal of Evolution, I feel extremely diffident; Irealise that the only thing I can possibly attempt is to put certainsuppositions before you, drawing upon my imagination. Naturally it is notpossible for finite mind to accurately gauge the plan of the Deity. All that wecan do is to study the history of the past, to investigate present conditions,and to ascertain somewhat racial and natural tendencies, and thus follow, aslogically as may be, the various steps and stages. All that is permissible forus is to start from the solid basis of acquired facts and knowledge, then putthem all together, and from their aggregate form an hypothesis as to what may bethe possible goal. Beyond that it is impossible to go.In our talks upon evolution, as I mentioned in the first lecture, we have beendealing somewhat with suppositions, and concerning ourselves with possibilities.Certain things we do know, and certain truths have been ascertained; yet eventhe facts of science, for instance, such as were so much spoken of and insistedupon forty years ago, are no longer regarded as facts, and are not used orpromulgated as drastically and as emphatically as they were. Science itself isfinding every year that its knowledge is very relative. The more a man graspsand knows, the greater is the horizon which opens up before him. Scientists arenow venturing into what are the subtler planes of matter, and therefore into therealms of the unproven, and we should remember that, up till the present,science has refused to admit their existence. We are passing beyond the sphereof what has been called “solid matter”, into such reams as are inferred when wespeak about “centres of energy”, “negative and positive force”, and “electricalphenomena”; and the emphasis is being laid more and more upon quality ratherthan upon what has been called substance. The further we look ahead, the widerour speculations become, and the more we attempt to account for telepathic,psychic and other phenomena, the more we shall trespass into the realm of whatis now the subjective and the subconscious, and the more we shall be forced toexpress ourselves in terms of quality or of energy.If we succeed at all in accounting for that which is unusual, for that which isas yet inexplicable to us, and in ascertaining the reality of the occult, weshall bring about a condition which might almost be called paradoxical. We shallgradually make the subjective the objective.Let us again briefly suns up the substance of the talks we have had during thepast few weeks, and thus start with our ideas clarified. We dealt first with theatom of substance, and found that that atom was a centre of force; that it wasof electrical origin, being the conjunction of a form of negative and positiveenergy, and that it showed psychic quality; we found it demonstrating selectivecapacity and discrimination. We then saw how the atom was gradually built upinto differing forms; that these forms were distinguished by another quality tothat of the atom, which we called attraction, response to sensation, and inreality a recognition of duality. In these two, the atom, and the form composedof atoms, we had two of the aspects of the Godhead manifested. We saw that theactive intelligence, or the mind aspect of Deity, shows itself as thediscriminating faculty, and that the second aspect shows itself as that cohesiveattractive power which holds the form together. Next we found that man is thesummation of the two previous developments of the divine life, combining atomicsubstance into form, whilst manifesting a third factor, that of intelligentpurpose or will. That central will is the real man, the spiritual entity, whouses the form for purposes of his own. Man therefore embodies all the threeaspects of the Godhead, and is verily and in truth made in the image of God. Heis a synthesis. The life of the third Person in the Godhead, showing asintelligence, animates the substance of his bodies; the life of the secondaspect, revealing that God is attractive love, is the force which builds up theatoms into the forms which he occupies, whilst he in essence is the will orspirit aspect. In him, therefore, pulsates the life of God the Father, God theSon, and God the Holy Spirit.Having traced the different lines of evolution until they meet in man weproceeded to weave romances and to expand our ideas into something greater. Weconsidered the sphere of the planet, and we said that it might perhaps be alogical hypothesis to posit that within that great atom, a planet, there mightbe—animating it and working through it—a Life that is expressing itself in andthrough and by that planet. From the planet we leapt to the solar system, and wesaw that, if it were logical to deduce such facts concerning the planet, itmight be equally logical to say that the solar system is a cosmic atom, a vastspheroidal form, animated by a central LIFE, which is working out, by means ofthat form, an ultimate purpose.Having therefore dealt with the atom of substance, with the human atom, with theplanetary atom, and with the cosmic atom, we left the discussion of theobjective side of manifestation, and our speculations as to the nature of thatwhich indwelt the form, and proceeded in our lecture last week to take up thesubject of consciousness, of the evolution of the life within the form, and ofthe contacts made by means of it. We said that for each of these atoms there wasa specific goal, that for the atom of substance there was the goal ofself-consciousness; that all forms are conscious, but that all forms are notself-conscious, and that between man and the animal there was a profounddistinction marking the difference between consciousness, and thatself-consciousness which becomes possible when the spirit or will aspect ofdivinity indwells the form. For man there is a still greater consciousness orrealisation to be achieved, which we call group-consciousness. Logically, then,we had to predicate for the planetary Deity of our Earth a further stage ofunfoldment which we called God-consciousness, or the realisation of that Lifewhich informs the entire sphere of the solar system, which is the goal for theplanetary spirit. Finally we saw that there may be a still vaster stage ofrealisation to be compassed by the solar Logos, functioning through His solarsystem along some cosmic line inconceivable to us.The subject that I am going to consider now is one that affects us very closely:namely, the attainment by man of that group consciousness which is his goal, andthe expansions of his little consciousness until it measures up to that greaterone which enfolds it. You will remember that in trying to explain the differencebetween self consciousness, group consciousness, and God consciousness, Iillustrated it by pointing out that in the little atom of substance in thephysical body, that tiny centralised life which goes to the constitution of thehuman form, we had a correspondence to the self-consciousness of the humanbeing; that the life of the physical body, considering it in every one of itsdepartments as a whole, is to that little selfcontained cell what groupconsciousness is to us; and that the consciousness of the real man, theinforming entity within the body, is to that atom what God consciousness is tous, as inexplicable and as far removed. If we can extend this concept of theatom in our body and its relation to man, the thinker, to the human atom,regarding it as a unit within a still greater body, we may get an understandingof the radical difference between these three rays of consciousness.There is a very interesting analogy between the evolution of the atom and of man( and I presume therefore of the planetary Deity and the solar Logos) in the twomethods of unfoldment that are followed. We have seen that the atom has its ownatomic life, and that every atom of substance in the solar system is likewise alittle system in itself, having a positive centre, or central sun, with theelectrons, or the negative aspect, revolving in their orbits around it. Such isthe internal life of the atom, its self-centred aspect. We noted too, that theatom is now being studied along a newer line, that of radio-activity, and it isbecoming apparent that in many cases there is an active radiation going on. Justwhere this discovery is going to lead it is impossible yet to tell, for thestudy of radio-active substances is as yet in its infancy, and little isactually known. Much of the earlier teaching of physical science has beenrevolutionised by the discovery of radium, and the more scientists find out, themore it becomes apparent, (as they themselves realise) that we are standing onthe threshold of very great discoveries, and are on the eve of profoundrevelations.In the human being, as he evolves and develops, these two stages can equally beseen. There is the early, or atomic stage, in which a man’s whole centre ofinterest lies within himself, within his own sphere, where self-centredness isthe law of his being, a necessary protective stage of evolution. He is purelyselfish, and concerned primarily with his own affairs. This is succeeded by alater stage, in which a man’s consciousness begins to expand, his interestsbegin to lie outside his own particular sphere, and the period arrives in whichhe is feeling for the group to which he belongs. This stage might be viewed ascorresponding to that of radio-activity. He is now not only a self-centred life,but he is also beginning to have -a definite effect upon his surroundings. He isturning his attention from his own personal selfish life, and is seeking hisgreater centre. From being simply an atom he is, in his turn, becoming anelectron, and coming under the influence of the great central Life which holdshim within the sphere of Its influence.If this is so, we shall have analogous stages transpiring within the life of theplanetary Deity, and this perhaps would account for various vicissitudes andhappenings upon the planet. Often we consider the affairs of the world as due tohuman activity. The world war, for instance, is frequently regarded as theresult of human mistakes and frailties. Perhaps this is so, for undoubtedlyeconomic conditions and human ambitions may have been very largely concerned inbringing it about; but perhaps, also, it may have been partly due to the workingout of the purpose of the great central Life, Whose consciousness is not as yetour consciousness, Who has His own plans and purposes and ideals, and Who,perhaps, also makes His experiments with life. On His vaster scale, and on Hisown high level, this planetary Spirit is learning to live, is learning tocontact, and is likewise expanding His consciousness; He is Himself at school,just as you and I are at school. So, again, it may be with the solar system, andso with events of such magnitude that they escape our ken altogether. Perhapsthere are occurrences within the solar system which may be due to the workingout of the plans of the Deity or Logos, that central Life Who is the energisingsource of all there is within the solar system. I do not know, but it makes aninteresting line of thought for us, and it does no harm to speculate if theeffect is to give us a broader vision, a wider tolerance, and a greater andwiser optimism.Having seen that the two stages of atomic activity and radio activitycharacterise the evolution of all atoms in the solar system, let us now see whatare the different developments which may be expected as the consciousness withinthe human atom evolves. I should like to centre our attention upon this humantype of consciousness, as it is the central evolution in the solar system. Whenthe three aspects of the divine life are brought together—the indwelling life,or spirit, the material form, or substantial vehicle, and the factor ofintelligent activity—certain specific results will eventuate. We shall have thegradual working out of consciousness of a particular kind; the development ofpsychic quality; the effect of the subjective life upon the material form; theutilisation of the form for certain specific ends, and the attainment by theindwelling entity of certain qualities. The true nature of the central life, beit God or man, will be manifested during a life cycle, whether solar or human.That is true of you and it is true of me; it is probably true of the planetaryLogos, and if true of him, therefore also of a solar Logos.Let us try, if we can, to follow some of the different developments inconnection with our four types of atoms—the atom of substance, the human atom,the planetary atom and the cosmic atom. One of the first and most importantdevelopments will be conscious response to every vibration and contact, that is,the ability to respond to the not-self on every plane. Let me illustrate. Icould go down to certain halls in this city, and gather together an audiencecomposed of the unskilled labourers and illiterates. I could talk to them, andrepeat what I have been saying this evening, and get no response whatever. Yet Icould go down and give them a talk such as I gave ten years ago, along strictlyevangelical or Gospel lines, and meet with a rapid reaction. Here the questionof right or wrong does not enter in, but simply the difference in the ability ofdifferent grades and types of men at different stages of evolution to respond tocontact and vibration. It simply means that certain people are at a stage wherethey can be reached by an emotional appeal, and dealt with along the line oftheir own personal salvation, being in the earlier atomic stage as yet. There isanother stage which includes that, but which enables one to respond also to amore intellectual appeal, which gives one a certain amount of interest andsatisfaction in such discussions as we have pursued, and which meansinvestigation of those matters which concern the group, for instance. But bothstages are equally right.We can look at this matter from another angle: it is quite possible for us tomeet great people, wonderful men and women, and fail to be impressed by them; wemight pass them by without recognising them, and thus miss that which they haveto give us. This happened in Palestine in connection with the Christ, twothousand years ago. Why? Because we ourselves are not yet great enough torespond to them. There is something still lacking in us, so that we are unableto realise or feel their particular vibration. I have heard it said, and I thinkit is very true, that if the Christ were to come down upon earth again, and walkamong men as He did before, He might live His life amongst us day after day andwe would not notice anything so very different in Him from the other good andunselfish people whom we know. We have not yet cultivated within ourselves theability to respond to the divine in our brother. We usually see only that whichis bad and coarse, and are cognisant principally of our brother’s faults. We areinsensitive, yet, to the best in people.Another development will be that we shall be able to function consciously on allplanes of being. We function consciously now on the physical plane, and thereare a few people who are able to function equally consciously on the nextsubtler plane, that which is called the astral plane (a word I very muchdislike, as it conveys no real meaning to our minds) or the plane of theemotional nature, on which a man is active when out of the physical body, in thehours of sleep or immediately after death. Very few human beings can function onthe mental plane in fully awakened consciousness, and still fewer upon thespiritual plane. The object of evolution is that we should consciously function,with full continuity of realisation, upon the physical, emotional, and mentalplanes. This is the great achievement which will some day be ours. We shall thenknow what we do every hour of the day, and not for just about fourteen hours outof the twenty-four. At present we remain unconscious of where the real thinkingentity is during the hours of sleep. We do not know what his activities are, northe condition of his environment. Some day we shall utilise and employ everyminute of every hour of every day.Another purpose of evolution is a three-fold one, and it is that we should havepurpose or will, love, and energy co-ordinated. That is not so as yet. We havemuch intelligent energy continuously displayed now, but it is very rare indeedto meet a person whose whole life is animated by a central purpose, which isfollowed unswervingly, and which is animated and instigated by love workingthrough intelligent activity. The time is coming, however, when we shall haveexpanded our consciousness to such an extent, and be so active within ourselves,that we shall become radio-active. We shall then carry forward a definitepurpose which will be the outcome of love, and attain our objective by means ofthe intelligence. This is all that God is doing, is it not? At our present stageof development, we are certainly intelligent, but as yet there is very littlelove. We may have a little love for those we contact or meet, and a greater lovefor our family and immediate friends, but we know practically nothing of grouplove. When group love is voiced for us by the great idealists of the race it isnevertheless true that we have reached the stage where we can respond somewhatto it, and feel that it is something we should like to see realised. It is goodto remember that the more we think along such definitely altruistic lines, themore we shall build up something of very great value, and develop by slow andlaborious degrees the rudiments of a real group consciousness, which as yet liesfar ahead for most of us.There are several other developments during the evolutionary process with whichwe might deal, and which are at present so far ahead that they are practicallyinconceivable unless we have the peculiar type of brain that can think somewhatabstractly. There is the stage in which we can transcend time and space, whenthe consciousness of the group in all parts of the planet, for instance, will beour consciousness, and when it will be just as easy for us to contact theconsciousness of a friend in India, Africa, or elsewhere, as it is here;distance and separation will prove no barrier to intercourse. Symptoms of thiscan be seen in the ability which some people have to communicate telepathically,or to psychometrise.It is all very well to spend some time visioning this distant goal, andpicturing the achievement of the Logos billions of years hence, but the thing ofvital interest for us is to get some idea of the immediate stage ahead; and tounderstand what we may expect to happen in connection with the evolutionaryprocess during the next few thousand years. Let us consider this idea somewhat.There are, as we know, three main lines of thought in the world, the scientific,the religious, and the philosophical. Now, in these three what have we got? Inthe scientific line of thought we have embodied all that concerns matter, thesubstance aspect of manifestation; it deals with objectivity, and with thatwhich is material, tangible, and seen; literally, with that which can be proven.In religious thought we have that which is concerned with the life within theform, which deals with the return of spirit to its source, plus all that hasbeen gained by the use of the form; it has reference to the subjective side ofnature. In philosophical thought we have what I might call the utilisation ofthe intelligence by the indwelling life, in order that the form may beadequately adapted to its need. Let us consider in this connection certaindevelopments which may be looked for in the immediate future, remembering thatall that I say is only intended to be suggestive, and that I speak in nodogmatic spirit.It is obvious to most thinkers that science, having begun the study ofradio-activity, is on the verge of discovering what is the nature of the powerwithin the atom itself; it is very probable that before long we shall harnessthe energy of atomic matter for every conceivable purpose, for heating, forlighting, and for what I might call the motivation of everything that is carriedon in the world. That force, as some of us know, was nearly discovered in theUnited States fifty years ago by a man called Keely, but he was not allowed togive it out to the world because of the danger thereby involved. Men are as yetfar too selfish to be trusted with the distribution of atomic energy. Thatdiscovery will probably parallel the development of group consciousness. Onlywhen man becomes radio-active and can work and think in group terms, will it besafe or wise for him to utilise the power latent in the atom. Everything innature is beautifully co-ordinated, and nothing can be discovered or utilisedbefore the right time. Only as man becomes unselfish will this tremendous powerbe permitted to pass into his hands. Nevertheless, we can, I believe, look toscience to make tremendous strides in the comprehension of atomic energy.Then paralleling the evolution of the human being again, we can look for man todominate the air. There is a great vibratory sphere, or plane, in the solarsystem, called in some occult books the intuitional plane; it is called in theEastern literature the Buddhic plane, and its symbol is the air. Just as man isbeginning to find his way through the development of the intuition on to thatplane now, so science is beginning to discover how to dominate the air, and asthe intuition in man develops and grows, so will his control of the air bedeveloped and grow. Another thing we can look for (and it is already beingrecognised somewhat) is the development of the ability to see in subtler matter.Everywhere there are children being born who see more than you or I can. I amhere referring to something that is based purely on material grounds, andconcerns the physical eye. I refer to etheric vision, which is seeing in thefiner matter of the physical plane, or in that which is called the ethers. Muchinteresting work has been done along this line by students and scientists inCalifornia. Dr. Frederick Finch Strong has been working along this line in avaluable way, and teaching that the physical eye is capable of seeingetherically, and that etheric vision is the normal function of the eye. Whatwill the development of this faculty mean? It will mean that science will havedefinitely to readjust its point of view as to the subtler planes. If there comewithin the range of vision of the normal man or woman within the next onehundred years certain aspects and forms of life that have been regarded hithertoas imaginary, we have broken once and for all that rank materialism which hasdistinguished us for so long, and if that which is now invisible is recognisedalong any particular line, who shall say how far forward it will be possible forus to go as time progresses? Again, the whole trend of evolution is towardsynthesis. As we go down into matter, as we tend toward materialisation, weshall have heterogeneity; as we work back towards spirit we shall tend towardsunity; so that in the religious world we can look for unity to make itsappearance. There is, even now, a much greater spirit of tolerance abroad thanwas the case fifty years ago; but the time is rapidly approaching when the greatfundamental unity that underlies all the different religions, and the fact thateach faith is a necessary part of one great whole, will be recognised by meneverywhere, and through this recognition, we shall have the simplification ofreligion. We shall have the great central facts emphasized and utilised, and thesmall and petty differences of organisation, and of explanation, overlooked.Again, we can look for a very interesting happening in connection with the humanfamily to take place, for the moment that group consciousness becomes, on alarge scale, the conscious objective of man, what will occur? You will have manputting his foot upon what is called in the religious world, the PATH. You willhave him definitely taking himself in hand, endeavouring to live the life of thespirit, refusing any longer to live a selfcentred atomic life; you will have himsearching for his place within the greater whole, finding it by means ofdefinite self-initiated endeavour, and then unifying himself with that group.This is all that is really meant by the teaching given about the Path in theProtestant, Catholic, and Buddhist churches. They all teach the treading of thisPath, calling it by different names, such as the Way, the noble Eight-fold Path,the Path of Illumination, or the Path of Holiness. Yet it is the one Path, thatwhich shineth ever more and more unto the perfect day.We can look, too, for the development of the power to think abstractly, and forthe awakening of the intuition. As the great races have succeeded one anotherupon the planet, there has ever been an ordered, directed unfoldment of thepowers of the soul, and a definitely planned sequence. In the third root race,the Lemurian, the physical aspect of man was carried to a high stage ofperfection. Later in the great race which preceded ours, the Atlantean, andwhich perished in the flood, the emotional nature of man was developed. Then inthe race to which we belong, the Aryan, or fifth race, the development of theconcrete, or lower mind, is the goal, and this we are developing each decade. Afew are also beginning to develop the power to think in abstract terms.When this is the case we shall see more of that peculiar, interesting capacitywhich some people evince, and which we call the ability to be inspired. I am nothere speaking of mediumship, nor do I mean mediumistic ability. There is nothingmore dangerous than that which is usually meant by the term of “medium.” Theaverage medium is a man of a negative, or receptive nature, and usually soloosely co-ordinated in his threefold nature that an extraneous force or entitycan use his brain, his hand, or his body. It is quite a common phenomenon.Automatic writing, ouija boards, and spiritualistic seances of a low order, arerampant these days, and are driving thousands into insanity, or into nervousdisorders. But there is something of which mediumship is simply a distortion,and this something is inspiration. To be capable of being inspired means that ahuman being has reached a stage in his evolution where he is consciously andpositively under the control of his own higher self, the God within. That innerruler, the real self, can, by definite contact, control his physical brain, andenable the man to make decisions, and to understand the truth, apart from thereasoning faculty altogether; this inner God can enable the man to speak, towrite, and to pass on the truth without the use of the lower mind. Truth lieswithin ourselves. When we can contact our own inner God all truth will berevealed to us. We shall be Knowers. But this is a positive, not a negativething, and means the putting of oneself in direct conscious alignment with one’sEgo, or higher self, and not the throwing open of one’s personality to anypassing entity or spook.This can be seen occurring now, occasionally, but it is not very often that theaverage man comes in contact with his higher self. Only in our moments ofhighest endeavour, only at the great crises of our lives, and only as the resultof long discipline and strenuous meditation does this occur. But some day weshall govern our entire lives, not from the personal, selfish point of view, butfrom the point of view of the God within, Who is a direct revelation of Spiriton the highest plane.The final thing I seek to bring out tonight is that the goal for each one of usis the development of the powers of the soul, or of the psyche. This means thatyou and I are going to be psychics. But I am not using this word ‘”psychic” asit is usually understood, nor in its every day connotation. The psyche is,literally, the soul within, or the higher self, who emerges from out of thethreefold lower self, as the butterfly emerges out of the chrysalis; it is thatbeautiful reality, which we are going to produce as the result of our life, orlives, down here. The true psychic powers are those which put us in contact withthe group. The powers of the physical body, which we use every day, put us incontact with individuals, but when we have developed the powers of the soul, andhave unfolded its potentialities, we shall be true psychics. Now what are thosepowers? All I can do tonight is to enumerate a few out of the many.One is the conscious control of matter. The majority of us control our physicalbodies consciously, making them carry out our behests upon the physical plane.Some of us control our emotions consciously, but very few of us can control themind. Most of us are controlled by our desires, and by our thoughts. But thetime is coming when we shall consciously control our threefold lower nature.Time will then not exist for us at all. We shall have that continuity ofconsciousness upon the three planes of being —physical, emotional, andmental—which will enable us to live as does the Logos, in that very metaphysicalabstraction, the Eternal Now.Another power of the soul is psychometry. Now what is psychometry? It might bedefined as the ability to take a tangible something, belonging perhaps to anindividual, and through the medium of that, to put oneself en rapport with thatindividual, or with a group of individuals. Psychometry is the law ofassociation of ideas applied to the vibratory quality of force for the purposeof obtaining information.Again, the race will become clairaudient and clairvoyant, which means thecapacity to hear and see as clearly and accurately upon the subtler planes as wedo upon the physical. It will involve the ability to hear and see all thatconcerns the group, that is, to hear and see in the fourth and fifth dimensions.I am not enough of a mathematician to attempt to explain these dimensions, andam apt myself to get very confused when considering them, but an illustrationthat was given me may make the whole thing somewhat clearer. A young Swedishthinker explained it to me thus:“The fourth dimension is the ability to see through and around a thing. Thefifth dimension is the ability, for instance, to take an eye, and by means ofthat eye to put oneself en rapport with all other eyes in the solar system. Tosee in the sixth dimension might be defined as the power to take a pebble offthe beach, and by means of it to put oneself in accord with the entire planet.Now in the fifth dimension, where you took the eye, you were limited to aparticular line of manifestation, but in the case of the sixth dimension, whereyou took a pebble, you were put in touch with the entire planet.” This issomething very far ahead of us, but it is interesting to speak about, and holdsa promise for each and all.There is not time to deal with the other powers, nor can I enumerate what theyall may be. Healing by touch will be amongst them. The manipulation of themagnetic fluids, and conscious creation by means of colour and sound, areothers. All that really concerns us at this time is that we should consciouslytake ourselves in hand, seek to come ever more and more under the control of theinner ruler, endeavour to become radio-active, and to develop groupconsciousness."},{"pageContent":"LECTURE VII.COSMIC EVOLUTION.It might well be considered ridiculous for anyone to undertake to give a lectureon Cosmic Evolution, because, of course, it is a subject which neither I nor anyother mortal knows anything about, and consequently we are utterly unable toexpress ourselves upon it. Nevertheless, there are certain deductions we canmake under the law of analogy which may lead us to very interesting realms ofthought. We have for several weeks been considering the evolution of the atomfrom stage to stage, until we included the entire solar system under the term“atom”.We studied first, along general lines, the atom of substance, then we studiedthe human atom, and later we applied what we knew about both these atoms to thestill larger sphere, or atom, a planet, which we called a planetary atom; thenwe extended the idea still further to the atom of the solar system, predicatingit as having a position within a still greater whole.We studied three methods of evolution, or development, in connection with thissubject. We considered the aspects which were evolved by means of these atoms,their qualities, or psychic nature, and we saw how in the atom of substance theonly psychic quality we could postulate about it was the quality ofintelligence. We passed on them to atomic forms, subhuman forms, and saw how theforms in the two kingdoms of nature, the vegetable and animal, demonstratedanother quality of the Deity, that of sensation, feeling, or embryo love andemotion; we found that in the animal kingdom also a third quality, that ofrudimentary mind, began to show itself, and that when we arrived at the humanatom, we had three aspects demonstrating, intelligence, love, and a centralwill. We extended this concept to the planet and to the solar system, and foundthat, working out through the form of the solar system, we had a greatIntelligence or Mind; that the object of His utilisation of form was thedemonstration of another quality, love or wisdom, the whole being energised by agreat central WILL. We deduced therefrom that this central Will might be themanifestation of an Entity Who informs the entire system, from the very lowestatom of substance up to that great Life Who energises the planetary scheme.Having laid down these fundamentals we passed on to the consideration of theevolution of the conscious life within the atomic form, finding that a highertype of consciousness is consistently evolved by each atom; that the humanconsciousness is distinguished from all other lower forms in that it isself-conscious; that man is an intelligent will, consciously performing everyaction, becoming aware of his surroundings, and working out a definite line ofactivity with a specific objective in view. The self-consciousness of man leadson again to something wider still, to the consciousness of the great planetarySpirit, which may perhaps be best expressed in the term ‘group consciousness’.As evolution proceeds man will pass from the stage of self-consciousness inwhich you and I now are, to a realisation of what is meant by groupconsciousness, something as yet practically unknown, except as some beautifulideal, and a dream which may, at some distant time, materialise. Groupconsciousness, again, will logically lead on to that which we, for lack of abetter term, might call God-consciousness, though I deprecate the use of theword God because of the many quarrels it causes in the world between thedifferent thinkers of the human family. These differences are founded largelyupon differences in phraseology, upon the terms used to express fundamentalideas, and upon varying methods of organisation. When the scientist, forinstance, speaks of force, or energy, and the Christian speaks of God, and theHindu uses terms analogous to the ‘I am that I am’, or the Self, they are allspeaking of one and the same great life, but have lost much time in endeavouringto prove each other wrong, and to demonstrate the accuracy of their owninterpretation.We next saw that, roughly speaking, atomic evolution could be divided into twoparts or stages; one stage we called the atomic stage, and another we called,for lack of a better term, the radio-active stage. The atomic stage is that inwhich the atom pursues its own self-centred life, is concerned entirely with itsown evolution, and the effect of the contacts it makes. As evolution proceeds,it becomes apparent that in time the atom begins to react to a greater lifeoutside itself, and in this you have the period analogous to that of theform-building stage, in which these atoms of substance are attracted by agreater charge of energy, or positive electrical force, (if you like to call itsuch) which draws them, or attracts them to itself, and builds out of them aform; these atoms of substance, in turn, become then electrons. We found, then,how, in your case and mine, as in the case of every self-conscious unit, thesame procedure is followed, and that you have a central life holding within thesphere of its influence the atoms that constitute the different bodies, mental,emotional, and physical; that we manifest, that we move and carry on our life,and work out our purposes, by attracting to ourselves the atoms of substancethat are adequate to our needs, and through which we can make the necessarycontacts. These atoms are to us, the central life, what the electrons are to thecentral positive charge in the atom of substance. Then we saw that if this istrue, namely, that there is a self-centred stage, or purely atomic period, forthe atom, and for the human atom, then again for the atom of the planet, indweltby its central spiritual life, we should be able to predicate logically asimilar state of affairs. Thus we were led into the field of speculation. Weconsidered then whether all that transpires upon our planet may not be due tothe self-centred condition of the Entity Who is working out His purposes bymeans of it. Finally we carried forward the same idea in connection with thesolar system itself.We passed on then to the consideration of the second stage, that which thescientist has been studying in connection with the atom of the chemist andphysicist for the last twenty years, the radio-active stage; we saw how therewas a condition analogous to this in the evolution of the human atom, and thatthere is a period preceding it which parallels the atomic stage, wherein man ispurely selfish, entirely self-centred, and pays no attention to the welfare ofthe group of which he is a part. This prior stage is very apparent in the worldtoday. A large percentage of the human family is in the atomic stage, but wemust remember that it is a protective and necessary one; it is passed through byevery unit of the human family in the process of finding its place within thegroup, and enables it to develop something of value to give to that group whenthe second stage is entered.In the world today there are also units of the human family who are passing intothe second stage, they are becoming radio-active and magnetic, they influenceother forms and are becoming group conscious; they are passing out of the “I am”stage into the “I am that” realisation; the life and purpose of the great Entityof Whose body they are a part, is beginning to be cognised by them; they arebecoming aware of the purpose back of the life of the planetary Spirit Who isthe subjective impulse lying behind objective manifestation upon our earth. Theyare beginning to co-operate with His plans, to work for the betterment of theirgroup; and the difference between them and other atoms of the human family isthat they are now group conscious, they have a wider horizon, a grouprecognition, and a larger purpose. At the same time they do not lose theirself-consciousness, nor their own individual identity, and their own spheroidallife remains, but they put the whole force and energy which flows through themnot into the working out of their own plans, but into an intelligentco-operation with the greater Life of which they are a part. Such men are fewand far between, but when they are more in number, then we can look for a changein world conditions, and for that time to arrive, of which St. Paul speaks whenhe says: “There should be no division in the body, but the members should havethe same care one for another. Whether one member suffer, all members sufferwith it, or one member be honoured, all rejoice with it... . it is the same Godwhich worketh all in all. There are diversities of gifts but the same spirit;there are differences of ministries (or service) but the same Lord.” When we areall group conscious, when we are all aware of the purpose which lies back ofmanifestation upon our planet, when we are consciously active, and throwing allour energy into the working out of group plans, then we shall have what theChristian calls the “millennium”.Now, if you have in the evolution of the atom of substance, and the human atom,these two stages, if they are the basis of all future development, then withinthe planetary atom you will have the same two stages, that in which theplanetary Life is working out His own plans, and a later one in which He fallsin with the greater plans of the Life which animates the solar system. Not yetbeing in a position to have an interview with the planetary Spirit, I am unableto tell you whether He is as yet co-operating in the purposes of the solarLogos; but we might be able to get some idea of the general purpose by the studyof race evolution and the development of the great international plans withinthe planet. We must bear in mind also, that, though we human beings considerourselves as the highest and greatest manifestation upon the planet, there maybe other evolutions through which the central Life may be working, of which weknow as yet but little, We must study not only man, but should consider also theangel evolution, or the deva evolution, as the Hindu calls it. This opens up forus an immense field of study and speculation.Again, within the solar system we shall expect to find analogous stages. Weshall find, probably, that the great Life animating the entire solar system, thegreat Entity Who is using it for the working out of a definite purpose,energises it by means of these great centres of force which we call planetaryatoms; that these centres, in their turn, work by means of lesser centres orgroups, passing their energy on down through groups of human atoms to thevarious kingdoms of nature, and thus to the little atom of substance which, inits turn, reflects the entire solar system. This question of atomic life, if wethink it out, is vastly interesting, and leads us into many lines of conjecture.One of the main points of interest which it opens up is the intimatecorrelation, and close interaction of the atoms of every kind, and theall-pervading unity which must ultimately be recognised. If we have found thatthere comes a stage in the evolution of all atoms of every kind in which theyfeel and search for their place within the group, and from being positive becomenegative in regard to a greater life, if it is true in all these manifestationsof consciousness there is a self-conscious stage and a group conscious stage, isit not logical and possible that perhaps, after all, our solar system is but anatom within a greater whole? May there not be for our solar system, and oursolar Logos, a central larger life towards which the informing Spirit within thesolar sphere is gradually attracted, and towards Whose consciousness our Deityaspires? Are there anywhere indications of such an attractive force, or goal?Are there greater spheres of solar life outside our system, that have a definiteeffect upon it? This may be but a speculation, but it has its points ofinterest. If we study astronomical books, and seek to ascertain whetherastronomers say that this is so, we shall meet with a vast amount ofcontradictory opinion; we shall find that some astronomers say that within thePleiades is a central point around which our solar system revolves; others saythat in the constellation of Hercules, is the point of magnetic attraction forour solar system. On the other hand, you will find this flatly contradicted. Weshall find some astronomers talking about “star-drift,” and saying that thedrift, or trend, of certain stars is in a specific direction; others argue thatthe distances are so vast that it is impossible to determine whether certainsystems are following a definite orbit or not.Nevertheless, if we go to some of the ancient books, those which we callmythological ( and a myth may be defined as something which holds a great truthhidden until we are ready to understand it), and if we study the ancient booksof the East, we shall find that in all of them there are two or threeconstellations which are regarded as having a peculiarly intimate relation toour solar system. Towards these views modern astronomers as yet hold an agnosticattitude, and from the point of view of materialistic science, rightly so. WhatI seek to emphasize here is that a topic upon which scientists and astronomersare divided, yet which is nevertheless a subject of contention, and one uponwhich the oriental books sound a clear note, must have a basis in fact, and thatthere is probably an aspect of truth in the assertion. I would personallysuggest here that that aspect of truth will be found, not along physical linesof interpretation, but along the lines of consciousness; that it is the psychicevolution that is going on within all atoms (using psychic in the sense of thesubjective consciousness) which is hinted at in these books, and the emphasis islaid upon our having an occult relationship with other solar systems. Here thetruth may perhaps be found. The life subjective may be one; the energy flowingbetween them may be one; but in the physical form lies diversity. Perhaps in theevolution of the intelligence, in the manifestation of love, or groupconsciousness, and in the development of will or purpose, lies unity, theone-ness of the subjective life, and the eventual recognition that within theform, and in the form only, lies separation and differentiation.The ancient books of the East point out, in considering this subject, that theseven stars of the Great Bear, the seven stars of the Pleiades, and the sunSirius, have a very close connection with our solar system, and that they holdan intimate psychic magnetic relation to our solar Logos. We have seen that thegoal for the atom of substance is self-consciousness; and that for the EntityWho is evolving through a planet, the goal may be God consciousness. Now, ofcourse, when you consider the solar Logos words fail, yet for Him also theremust be a goal. You can call this Absolute Consciousness, if you like. Let usagain illustrate this. Our body, we have been told, is made up of a multiplicityof little lives, or cells, or atoms, each having its own individualconsciousness. This corresponds to its self-consciousness. The consciousness ofthe physical body, viewed as a whole, might, from the atom’s point of view, beregarded as its group consciousness. Then we have the consciousness of man, thethinker. He is the one who energises the body, and turns it to his will; thatis, to the atom in his body, analogous to what we might call God consciousness.Our self-conscious realisation is as far removed from that of the atom as theconsciousness of the solar Logos is from ours. Now to the atom in our body thatconsciousness of the solar Logos might be called Absolute Consciousness, mightit not? This thought can be extended to the human atom, to the planetary atom,and you can further predicate that the solar Logos reaches out to aconsciousness beyond His own analogous to that which stretches between the atomin your body and Him. Here you have a very marvellous vista opening up. Yet thisis, in itself, encouraging; for if we study closely the cell in a physical body,and consider the long road that has been travelled between its consciousness,and that which a man now knows to be his, we have for ourselves the promise andhope of future achievement, and the incentive to persist in our endeavour.The old books of the East have held secreted for many ages the truth about muchwhich is only now beginning to sink into the consciousness of the occidental.They taught the radio-activity of matter thousands of years ago, and so perhaps,after all, there may be an equal amount of truth in their teaching about theconstellations. Perhaps in the stars that we can see in the distant heavens, andin the life that is evolving within them, we have the objective of our solarLogos, and the influences that are flowing towards him, attracting him towardsthem, and making him, in due course of time, radio-active. In the Eastern booksthey say that in the sun Sirius lies the source of wisdom, and that theinfluence or the energy of love emanates from there. Then they say that there isa constellation that is even more closely connected with our solar Logos, thereason being that He is not, as yet, sufficiently evolved so that He can respondcompletely to Sirius, but He can respond to the influence of the seven sistersor the Pleiades. This group is a most interesting one. If you will go to thedictionary and look up the word “electricity”, you will find it suggested thatit may be traced back to the star Electra, one of the seven sisters, andsupposed by some to be the little lost Pleiad. The Eastern teachers say that inthe mystery of electricity is hidden all knowledge, and that when we havefathomed that we shall know all there is to be known. What the relationship ofthe Pleiades to our solar system may be, it is not possible for us to say, buteven our Christian Bible recognises it, and Job speaks of “the sweet influencesof the Pleiades,” whilst some of the Oriental Scriptures affirm that theconnection lies in sound, or vibration. Perhaps the Pleiades are the source ofthe atomic life of our Logos, the active intelligent aspect, that one which wasfirst developed, and which we might call electrical matter.Then there is the Great Bear. There is much that is interesting said about therelation between the Great Bear and the Pleiades in Oriental writings. The sevensisters are said to be the seven wives of the seven stars of the Great Bear. Nowwhat is perhaps the truth back of that legend? If the Pleiades are the source ofelectrical manifestation, the active intelligent aspect of the solar system, andtheir energy that which animates all matter, they may perhaps represent thenegative aspect, whose polar opposite, or the positive aspect, is their sevenhusbands, the seven stars of the Great Bear. Perhaps the union of these two iswhat produces our solar system. Perhaps these two types of energy, one from thePleiades, and the other from the Great Bear, meet, and in their conjunctionproduce that blazing forth in the heavens which we call our solar system.The relationship of these two constellations, or rather their subjectiverelationship, must surely have some basis in fact, or we would not have ithinted at in the different mythologies. There must be something that connectsthem, out of all the myriads of constellations, with our solar system. But whenwe endeavour to give it a purely physical application we go astray. If we workit out along the lines of the subjective life, and connect it with energy,quality, or force, we are liable to stumble upon truth, and find out some of thereality which may underlie what appears at first sight to be a senseless fable.Anything that widens our horizon, that enables us to take a broader vision and aclearer view of what is going on in the evolutionary process, is of value to us,not because the accumulation of ascertained facts is of value, but because ofwhat it enables us to do within ourselves; our ability to think in wider andlarger terms is increased; we are enabled to look beyond our self-centred pointof view, and to include within our consciousness other and different aspectsthan our own. In doing this we are developing group consciousness, and we shallrealise eventually that the apparently stupendous facts which we fought and diedfor down the ages, and emphasised as the entire truth, were after all butfragments of a plan, and infinitesimal portions of a gigantic sum total.Perhaps, therefore, when we come back to earth again, and can look back upon thethings that interest us now, and which we consider so important, we shall findhow erroneous facts were as we then apprehended them. Facts, after all, do notmatter; the facts of the last century are not facts now, and in the next centuryscientists may laugh at our dogmatic assertions, and wonder how we could havelooked upon matter as we did. It is the development of the life, and therelationship of the life to all that is around, that really matters; and, aboveall, the effect that we are having upon those with whom we are associated, andthe work we do, which affects, for better or for worse, the group in which wefind ourselves. In closing this series of lectures, I cannot do better than quote again fromSt. Paul, where he says: “I reckon that the sufferings of this present time arenot worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us……for weare saved by hope……for I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angelsnor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, norheight, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from thelove of God.” FINIS"}]
