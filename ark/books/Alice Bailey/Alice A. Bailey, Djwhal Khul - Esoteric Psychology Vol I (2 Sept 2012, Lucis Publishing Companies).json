I live in a physical body like other men, on theborders of Tibet, and at times (from the exoteric standpoint) preside over alarge group of Tibetan lamas, when my other duties permit. It is this fact thathas caused it to be reported that I am an abbot of this particular lamasery.Those associated with me in the work of the Hierarchy (and all true disciplesare associated in this work) know me by still another name and office. A.A.B.knows who I am and recognises me by two of my names.I am a brother of yours, who has travelled a little longer upon the Path thanhas the average student, and has therefore incurred greater responsibilities. Iam one who has wrestled and fought his way into a greater measure of light thanhas the aspirant who will read this article, and I must therefore act as atransmitter of the light, no matter what the cost. I am not an old man, as agecounts among the teachers, yet I am not young or inexperienced. My work is toteach and spread the knowledge of the Ageless Wisdom wherever I can find aresponse, and I have been doing this for many years. I seek also to help theMaster M. and the Master K.H. whenever opportunity offers, for I have been longconnected with Them and with Their work. In all the above, I have told you much;yet at the same time I have told you nothing which would lead you to offer methat blind obedience and the foolish devotion which the emotional aspirantoffers to the Guru and Master Whom he is as yet unable to contact. Nor will hemake that desired contact until he has transmuted emotional devotion intounselfish service to humanity–not to the Master.The books that I have written are sent out with no claim for their acceptance.They may, or may not, be correct, true and useful. It is for you to ascertaintheir truth by right practice and by the exercise of the intuition. Neither Inor A.A.B. is the least interested in having them acclaimed as inspiredwritings, or in having anyone speak of them (with bated breath) as being thework of one of the Masters. If they present truth in such a way that it followssequentially upon that already offered in the world teachings, if theinformation given raises the aspiration and the will-to-serve from the plane ofthe emotions to that of the mind (the plane whereon the Masters can be found)then they will have served their purpose. If the teaching conveyed calls forth aresponse from the illumined mind of the worker in the world, and brings aflashing forth of his intuition, then let that teaching be accepted. But nototherwise. If the statements meet with eventual corroboration, or are deemedtrue under the test of the Law of Correspondences, then that is well and good.But should this not be so, let not the student accept what is said.August 1934"},{"pageContent":"THE GREAT INVOCATIONFrom the point of Light within the Mind of GodLet light stream forth into the minds of men.Let Light descend on Earth.From the point of Love within the Heart of GodLet love stream forth into the hearts of men.May Christ return to Earth.From the centre where the Will of God is knownLet purpose guide the little wills of men—The purpose which the Masters know and serve.From the centre which we call the race of menLet the Plan of Love and Light work out.And may it seal the door where evil dwells.Let Light and Love and Power restore the Plan on Earth.“The above Invocation or Prayer does not belong to any person or group but toall Humanity.

The teaching to be given must likewise increase their mentalcompetency, and lead to that stabilisation of the emotional body which will mostrapidly set them free for service. It must be remembered that constant study (ofpapers), and the apprehension by the ear and eye of statements anent the AgelessWisdom, serve only to increase responsibility, or produce brain fatigue andstaleness, with subsequent revolt from instruction. Only that which is broughtinto use in the life is of practical value and retains its livingness. Sincerityis the first thing for which those of us who teach inevitably look.Let me remind those I reach through these books that the main result I look foris one of group co-operation and understanding, and not that of individualbenefit. By studying and reading with care, a group interplay is set up, thegroup becomes more closely integrated, the units in it more closely linkedtogether and as a group more closely blended in the unfolding Plan of the treatOnes. We are building and planning for the future and for humanity, and not forthe personal unfoldment of any particular aspirant. The individual growth is ofno tremendous significance. The formation and development of a band of pledgedaspirants, trained to work together and to respond in unison to a teaching, isof real moment [xviii] to those of us who are responsible for the training andfor the preparation of the group of world disciples who will function withfreedom and power in a later cycle. You see a tiny portion of the Plan. We seethe Plan as it unfolds for a series of lives ahead, and we are today seekingthose who can be taught to work in group formation and who can constitute one ofthe active units in the vast happenings that lie ahead, connected with thattwo-thirds of humanity who will stand upon the Path at the close of the age, andwith that one-third who will be held over for later unfoldment. We are trainingmen and women everywhere so that they can be sensitive to the Plan, sensitive totheir group vibration, and thus able to co-operate intelligently with theunfolding purpose. It is a mistake to think that the Plan is to train aspirantsto be sensitive to the vibration of a Master or to the Hierarchy. That is butincidental and of minor importance.It is for the purpose of training aspirants so that group awareness may bedeveloped that these books have been written. Recognise clearly that youpersonally do not count, but that the group most surely does. Teaching is notgiven only in order to train you or to provide you with opportunity. All life isopportunity, and individual reaction to opportunity is one of the factors whichindicate soul growth. For this, the training school of the world itselfsuffices.There should be in all impartation of truth no imposition of authority.Aspirants must be left free to avail themselves of the teaching or not, andspiritual work must go forward because of the free choice and self-initiatedeffort of the individual student.In the books already published three basic lines of teaching can be traced:First, a relatively new technique has been given as to the control of the body.[xix] Second, teaching has been given anent the formation of the New Group ofWorld Servers.Third, the general lines of the magical work of creation have receivedattention.The first line of teaching concerns the individual and his development; thesecond indicates the nature and ideals of the group into which he may find hisway if he profits by the teaching and learns control; the third, could you butrealise it, details in some measure the methods and modes of work during thecoming new age.Ponder upon these three main approaches to truth, and think upon them withclarity of thought. Mental appreciation of their significance will produceunderstanding and will likewise increase the group apprehension of the teachingwhich I have sought to impart. Any student who thinks clearly and applies theteaching to his daily life is contributing most valuably to the group awareness.Oft an aspirant says to himself: “Of what real use am I? How can I, in my smallsphere, be of service to the world?” Let me reply to these questions by pointingout that by thinking this book into the minds of the public, by expressingbefore your fellow men the teaching it imparts, and by a life lived inconformity with its teaching, your service is very real.This will necessarily involve a pledging of the entire personality to thehelping of humanity, and the promise to the Higher Self that endeavour will bemade to lose sight of self in service—a service to be rendered in the place andunder the circumstances which a man’s destiny and duty have imposed upon him. Imean a renewal of the effort to bring about the purification of all the bodiesso that the entire lower man may be a pure channel and instrument through whichspiritual force may flow unimpeded. I mean the attaining of an attitude [xx]wherein the aspirant desires nothing for the separated self, and in which heregards all that he has as something which he can lay upon the altar ofsacrifice for the aiding of his brethren. Could all who read this book see theresults of such a united effort, there would emerge a group activity,intelligently undertaken, which would achieve great things. So many people runhither and thither after this individual or that, or this piece of work or that,and, working with lack of intelligent co-ordination, achieve nothing and nogroup results. But united group effort would eventuate in an inspiredreorganisation of the entire world, and the elimination of hindrances; therewould be the making of real sacrifices and the giving up of personal wishes anddesires in order that group purposes may be served.Above all, there must be the elimination of fear. With this I have dealt atlength in A Treatise on White Magic , and have given likewise certain rules andformulas for its control. How many who have read the teaching profited by theinformation imparted? Will you not, with determination and because the worldcries out for help, cast away fear and go forward with joy and courage into thefuture?There has been, behind all the books which I have written, a definite purposeand a planned sequence of teaching. It may be of interest to you if I trace themfor you:The first book issued was Initiation, Human and Solar . This book was intendedfor the average aspirant, to lead him on from where he was to a vision of anorganised band of teachers who were seeking to aid humanity (and incidentallyhimself), and to give some idea of their technique of work and modes ofprocedure.Letters on Occult Meditation indicated how these teachers could be reached andthe discipline of life that the treading of the Path involved. These two areespecially for aspirants.[xxi] A Treatise on Cosmic Fire is in an entirely different category. In thelast analysis, it is for the guidance of the initiates of the world, and willlift the aspirant’s eyes away from himself and his own growth to a vasterconception and a universal ideal. The mark of the initiate is his lack ofinterest in himself, in his own unfoldment and his own personal fate, and allaspirants who become accepted disciples have to master the technique ofdisinterestedness. Their eyes have also to be lifted away from the group ofworkers and from the hierarchy which they constitute and to be fixed on widerhorizons and vaster realms of activity. The great creative Plan, its laws andtechnique of unfoldment, and the work of the Builders of the Universe was dealtwith; emerging out of the mass of imparted facts, and underlying all theteaching, was the idea of a great Life with its own psychology and ideas. It wasan attempt to give a synthetic picture of the unfolding Mind of God as It worksout Its plans through the lesser Sons of Mind. In symbolism and archaic phrasesit veiled the truths and principles which lie at the root of the creativeprocess, and in its entirety is beyond the grasp of the advanced student. At thesame time, it is a most valuable compendium of information, and will serve toconvey truth and to develop the intuition.The last book, A Treatise on White Magic , is a parallel volume to A Treatise onCosmic Fir e. Just as the first dealt with the psychology of Deity, the work ofthe Macrocosm, and the laws whereby the Solar Logos works, so this bookconstitutes a treatise on the psychology of the Son of God and the work of theMicrocosm. It intimately concerns His place in the larger whole.I have also aided A.A.B. in getting out a translation of the Yoga Sutras ofPatanjali, which is a bridging book, intended to show the aspirant the ruleswhereby the light within him [xxii] may be developed and the power of theintuition be brought to bear on all problems and on the phenomena of lifeitself. This book was given the name The Light on the Soul .Here I am fulfilling my intention to write a book on the subject of the SevenRays . This topic has always been of real interest for students, but about theserays little is known. We know, from The Secret Doctrine , that they are thebuilding Forces and the sum total of all that is in the manifested universe, buttheir effect in the human kingdom, and their essential quality and nature,remain as yet a mystery. It will be necessary for me to avoid the cosmic note,if I may so call it, for I seek to make the information of practical value tothe student and to the intelligent reader. I shall therefore approach thesubject entirely from the standpoint of the human family and deal with thesubject in terms of psychological values, laying the foundation for that newpsychology which is much needed, and so dealing primarily with the humanequation. What I have to say will be a commentary upon an expansion of the wordsfound in the proem of The Secret Doctrine , that “All Souls are one with theOversoul.”We shall, from the outset, accept the fact of the soul. We shall not considerthe arguments for or against the hypothesis of there being a soul-universal,cosmic, and divine, or individual and human. For our purposes of discussion, thesoul exists, and its intrinsic reality is assumed, as a basic and provenprinciple. Those who do not admit this assumption can, however, study the bookfrom the angle of a temporarily accepted hypothesis, and thus seek to gatherthose analogies and indications which may substantiate the point of view. To theaspirant, and to those who are seeking to demonstrate the existence of the soulbecause they believe in its existence, this expression of its laws andtradition, its nature, origin and [xxiii] potentialities will become a graduallydeepening and experienced phenomenon.What I indicate and the suggestions I may make, will, I forecast, bedemonstrated, in the scientific sense, during the coming Aquarian Age. Sciencewill then have penetrated a little further into the field of intangible yet realphenomena; it will have discovered mayhap it has already made this discovery)that the dense and concrete do not exist; it will know that there is but onesubstance, present in nature in varying degrees of density and of vibratoryactivity, and that this substance is impelled by urgent purpose and expressiveof divine intent.We shall seek to avoid as far as possible those loose generalities which are sodistressing to the academic and critical mind, and in which the mystic findssuch relief and joy. I will however ask those who study this treatise to reservetheir opinion and come to no crystallised judgment until the entire propositionhas been presented to them, and its outlines have been clearly sensed and itsdetail somewhat elaborated.It will be necessary for us to introduce the subject on a wide basis and to linkthe individual with the general, and this may (at the first) seem too vast atheme, too speculative a presentation and too misty and vague an outline. Butthis situation cannot be avoided, for the argument—as must be the case in alltruly occult work-must be considered from the universal to the particular, fromthe cosmic to the individual. Men are, as yet, too interested in the particularand the individual to find it easy to apply the same interest to the greaterWhole in which they “live and move and have their being,” nor do they at thistime (as a general rule) possess that inner mechanism of thought and thatintuitive perception of truth which will enable them easily to grasp thesignificance of that which underlies the symbolism of words, or to see clearlythe subjective [xxiv] outline under the objective form. But the effort tounderstand carries its own reward, and the attempt to grasp and comprehend theSoul-cosmic, universal, planetary and individual leads inevitably to anunfoldment of the mental apparatus (with a subsequent development of the, asyet, quiescent brain cells) which must eventually produce a co-ordination of thethinking faculty, and resultant illumination.The nature of our septenary universe must be considered, and the relation of thethreefold human being to the divine Trinity must be noted. A general idea of theentire symbolic picture is of value. Each student, as he takes up the study ofthe rays, must steadily bear in mind that he himself–as a human unit–finds hisplace on one or other of these rays. The problem thus produced is a very realone. The physical body may be responsive to one type of ray force, whilst thepersonality as a whole may vibrate in unison with another. The ego or soul mayfind itself upon still a third type of ray, thus responding to another type ofray energy. The question of the monadic ray brings in still another factor inmany cases, but this can only be implied and not really elucidated. As I haveoft told you, it is only the initiate of the third initiation who can come intouch with his monadic ray, or his highest life aspect, and the humble aspirantcannot as yet ascertain whether he is a monad of Power, of Love or ofIntelligent Activity.In concluding, I ask for your sincere cooperation in the work which we areundertaking. It may be of more general and public value than any other of mywritings. I shall seek to make this treatise upon the soul relatively brief. Ishall seek to express these abstract truths in such a way that the generalpublic, with its profound interest in the soul, may be intrigued and won to adeeper consideration of what is as yet a veiled surmise. The Aquarian Age willsee the fact of the soul demonstrated. This is an attempt, carried forward inthe difficulties [xxv] of a transition period which lacks even the neededterminology, to aid that demonstration.Let me also add that your attitude to the imparted instruction should be that ofthe student who is seeking truth that can be verified and information that canbe applied to the daily life and tested in the crucible of life experience. If,for instance, there are indeed seven rays, embodying seven types of divineenergy, then a man should be able to recognise these types and energies in theparticular field of phenomena in which he plays his little part. If the truthgiven is veiled in symbolism and offered as an hypothesis, it should at the sametime be unveiled sufficiently so as to be recognisable, and should have in it ifsufficient intelligent appeal to warrant its investigation. The words “All soulsare one with the Oversoul” may and do, I believe, embody a basic and essentialpiece of information, but unless there is evidence in the world that there isappearing a living relation between all sentient beings, then the statement ismeaningless. But the fact is that universal sentiency and a general awarenessare recognised everywhere as existing and as developing. The world is full ofknowledge , which is in the last analysis sentient response to conditions whichexist, by minds which are developing but are not fully developed. It is becominggradually apparent that under diversity lies a basic unity, and that ourawareness is right and true and correct in so far as we can identify ourselveswith this unity.In closing, may I beg all of you to go forward. Let nothing in the past—physicalinertia, mental depression, lack of emotional control—keep you from taking freshhold and with joy and interest making that needed progress which will fit youfor more active and useful service. That none of you may be hindered by the pastor by the present, but may live as Onlookers, is the prayer, constant andbelieving, of your teacher.THE TIBETAN."},{"pageContent":"SECTION 1 - CHAPTER I ... INTRODUCTORY REMARKS1. THE THREE OBJECTIVES IN STUDYING THE RAYS[3] The study of the rays, and a true and deep comprehension of the innersignificance of the teaching, will do for us three things:A. It will throw much light upon the times and cycles in the unfolding panoramaof history. In the last analysis, history is an account of the growth anddevelopment of man from the stage of the cave man, with his consciousnesscentred in his animal life, up to the present time wherein the humanconsciousness is steadily becoming more inclusive and mental, and so on and upto the stage of a perfected son of God. It is an account of the apprehension, byman, of the creative ideas which have moulded the race and are establishing itsdestiny. It gives us a dramatic picture of the progress of those souls who arecarried in or out of manifestation by the appearance or disappearance of a ray.We shall find, as we study, that words will greatly handicap our expression ofthe realities involved, and we must endeavour to penetrate beneath the surfacemeaning to the esoteric structure of truth. These rays are in constant movementand circulation, and demonstrate an activity which is progressive and cyclic andevidences increasing momentum. They are dominant at one time and [4] quiescentat another, and according to the particular ray which is making its presencefelt at any particular time, so will be the quality of the civilisation, thetype of forms which will make their appearance in the kingdoms of nature, andthe consequent stage of awareness (the state of consciousness) of the humanbeings who are carried into form life in that particular era. These embodiedlives (again in all four kingdoms) will be responsive to the peculiar vibration,quality, colouring and nature of the ray in question. The ray in manifestationwill affect potently the three bodies which constitute the personality of man,and the influence of the ray will produce changes in the mind content and theemotional nature of the man and determine the calibre of the physical body.I am aware, therefore, that in giving out this relatively new teaching upon therays I may, in my endeavour to shed fresh light, temporarily increase thecomplexity of the subject. But as experiment is made, as people are studied inthe laboratories of the psychologists and the psychoanalysts in connection withtheir ray indications, and as the newer sciences come into wise use and theirproper sphere, we shall gain much and the teaching will find corroboration. Weshall see emerging a new approach to the ancient truths, and a new mode ofinvestigating humanity. In the meantime let us concentrate upon the clearenunciation of the truth anent the rays, and seek to tabulate, outline andindicate their nature, purpose and effects.The seven rays, being cyclic in appearance, have continuously passed in and outof manifestation and have thus left their mark down the ages upon mankind, andtherefore hold the clue to any true historical survey. Such a survey stillremains to be made.B. A second result of the study of the rays will be to clarify our knowledge asto the nature of man. Modern psychology, experimental and academic, has donemuch to gather [5] information as to how a man functions, what is the nature ofhis reactions, the calibre of his thought apparatus and the quality of hisphysical mechanism, the mode of his thinking and the sum total of complexes,psychoses, neuroses, instincts, intuitions and intellectual fixations which heundoubtedly is. Medical psychology has also given us much, and we have learntthat the human being is entirely conditioned by his instrument of expression andcan express no more than his nervous system, brain and glands permit. We find,however, that some of the theories, even the best proven, break down, givenvarying conditions. The field covered by psychology today is so vast, itsschools so many and varied, and its terminology so cumbersome, that I can makeno attempt to deal with it here.The indebtedness of the world to the trained psychologists cannot be estimated,but unless there is a key idea interjected into the whole field of thought, itwill fall of its own weight, and produce (as it is already producing) problems,complexes and diseases of the mind which are direct results of its own methods.The knowledge we now have of how men work on the physical plane as integratedpersonalities, and of how they can be expected to work, given certainconditions, is broad and sound, and the wideness of its grasp can be somewhatgauged if we compare what we know today with what was known a hundred and fiftyyears ago. But it has been largely based upon a study of the abnormal, and uponthe form aspect (this latter being the true scientific method), and is thereforelimited and circumscribed when it is put to the test in the last analysis and inthe light of the undoubtedly existent supernormal. What I seek to do, and thecontribution I seek to make to the subject, have to do with the emphasis weshall lay upon the nature of the integrating principle found within all coherentforms and on that which can (for lack of [6] a better word) be called the soulor self. This principle, which informs the body nature and expresses itsreactions through the emotional and mental states, is of course recognised bymany schools of psychology, but remains nevertheless an unknown and undefinablequantity. They find it impossible to discover its origin; they know not what itis, whether or no it is an informing entity, detached and separate from the bodynature; they question whether it is an integrated energetic sum total broughtinto existence through the fusion of the body cells, and therefore, through theprocess of evolution, constituting a thinking, feeling entity; or whether it isno more than the aggregated life and consciousness of the cells themselves.The above is a generalisation which will serve our purpose and will cover thegeneral proposition. It will appear, as we study, that the energies which informthe personalities and which constitute the nature of the human being fallnaturally into three groups:1. Those energies which we call “the spirits in men.” You note here the uttersuperficiality of that phrase. It is meaningless and misleading. Spirit is One ,but within that essential unity the “points of fire” or “the divine sparks” canbe seen and noted. These unities, within the unity, are coloured by and reactqualitatively to, three types of energy, for it is scientifically true, and aspiritual fact in nature, that God is the Three in One and the One in Three. Thespirit of man came into incarnation along a line of force emanation from one orother of these three streams, which form one stream, emanating from the MostHigh.2. These streams of energy differentiate into a major three, yet remain onestream. This is an occult fact worthy of [7] the deepest meditation. In theirturn they differentiate into seven streams which “carry into the light,” as itis called, the seven types of souls. It is with these seven that we shall deal.3. The energies into which the three distribute themselves, thus becoming seven,in their turn produce the forty-nine types of force which express themselvesthrough all the forms in the three worlds and the four kingdoms in nature. Youhave therefore:a. Three monadic groups of energies. The essential Unity expresses, throughthese three, the qualities of Will, Love and Intelligence.b. Seven groups of energies which are the medium through which the three majorgroups express the divine qualities.c. Forty-nine groups of forces to which all forms respond and which constitutethe body of expression for the seven, who in their turn are reflections of thethree divine qualities.In some mysterious ways, therefore, the differentiations which manifest innature are found in the realm of quality and not in the realm of reality.It is with the seven groups of souls (or soul energies) that we shall deal, andwith the threefold forms in the fourth kingdom of nature which they create, andthrough which they have to express the quality of their ray group and the energyof that one of the three essential groups to which their soul ray is related. Weshall therefore, if possible, endeavour to add to modern psychology and enrichits content with that esoteric psychology which deals with the soul or self, theensouling entity within the form. [8]C. The third effect of the study of these rays should be twofold. Not only shallwe understand somewhat the inner side of history, not only shall we gain an ideaof the divine qualities emerging from the three aspects and determining theforms of expression on the physical plane, but we shall have a practical methodof analysis whereby we can arrive at a right understanding of ourselves asensouling entities, and at a wiser comprehension of our fellowmen. When, throughour study, we ascertain for instance that the tendency of our soul ray is thatof will or power, but that the ray governing the personality is that ofdevotion, we can more truly gauge our opportunity, our capacities and ourlimitations; we can more justly determine our vocation and service, our assetsand our debits, our true value and strength. When we can add to that knowledgean analysis which enables us to realise that the physical body is reactingpreeminently to the soul ray, whilst the emotional body is under the influenceof the personality ray which is historically in manifestation at the time, weare then in a position to gauge our particular problem with judgment. We canthen deal more intelligently with ourselves, with our children and with ourfriends and associates. We shall find ourselves able to cooperate more wiselywith the Plan as it is seeking expression at any particular time.It is a platitude to say that the true meaning of “psychology” is the “word ofthe soul.” It is the sound, producing an effect in matter, which a particularray may make. This is in some ways a difficult way of expressing it, but if itis realised that each of the seven rays emits its own sound, and in so doingsets in motion those forces which must work in unison with it, the entirequestion of man’s free will, of his eternal destiny and of his power to beself-assertive comes up for solution. These questions we shall seek to answer aswe proceed.[9] Some of the points which I may seek to make clear will not be capable ofsubstantiation and cannot be proved by you. These it would be wise to accept asworking hypotheses, in order to understand that whereof I seek to speak. Some ofthe points I may make you may find yourself capable of checking up in your ownlife experience, and they will call forth from you a recognition coming fromyour concrete mind; or they may produce in you a reaction of the intensestconviction, emanating from your intuitively aware Self. In any case, readslowly; apply the laws of analogy and of correspondence; study yourself and yourbrethren; seek to link what I say to any knowledge you may possess of the moderntheories, and remember that the more truly you live as a soul the more surelyyou will comprehend that which may be imparted.As you study you must not forget the basic concept that in all occult work oneis occupied with energy—energy units, energy embodied in forms, energy streamsin flow; and that these energies are made potent and embody our purpose throughthe use of thought; they follow along the well-defined thought currents of thegroup.It must be remembered, however, that it is in this region of thought that thecleavage comes between black and white magic. It is in the use of thought powerthat the two aspects of magic can be seen functioning, and therefore it is truethat there is no black magic, per se, until one reaches the realm of mind. Noone can be a black magician until the will and the thought work in unison, untilmind control and the creative work of the focussed mind can be seen. It has oftbeen said the black magician is rare, indeed, and that is verily true, becausethe creative thinker, with power to use the sustained will, is also rare.Let me illustrate. There is need for clear thinking on these matters, for as westudy the psychology of the microcosm [10] and arrive at an understanding of hisray impulses and energies we shall need to see clearly the way we go so that weshall tread the path of selflessness, leading to group awareness, and not thepath of individualism, leading eventually and inevitably (as the mind aspectbecomes organised) to the left hand path of black magic.Those strong souls who consciously and knowingly enter into the realms ofspiritual force and take thence that which they need and that which they choose,must work with intelligence, so that there may be a subsequent wise distributionof force within a chosen area. Those who know themselves to be in the rank andfile of aspirants, but who possess the persistence which will drive them forwardto the goal, need to remember that theirs is the responsibility of adding theirquota to the sum total, and that this is done every time they think of thegroup, correspond with a fellow aspirant or meditate.Extend the idea, then, from the student in a group to the group itself,regarding it as a group unit within a larger group. You have there a perfectanalogy to the way the Great Ones work at this time. Regard, therefore, all yourwork as group work, causing effects which are inevitable and contributing to thepotency of the group thought form.The second thing upon which I seek to touch concerns the testing going oninevitably among the aspirants and disciples at this time. This is not so much atesting of their place upon the Path, as of their power to live in the world ascitizens of another kingdom, and as the custodians of that which the world as arule does not recognise. In so far as that testing is applied, and in so far asit can be gauged, I seek to point out that the testing is not applied, as somethink, because of their affiliation with any group or because of theirone-pointed determination to tread the Path. It is applied because theaspirants” own souls so ordained it, prior to incarnation, and it [11] was thewill of their souls that a certain measure of growth, hitherto unknown, shouldbe attained, a certain degree of detachment from form should be achieved, and acertain preparation should be undergone which would lead to a liberation fromthe form life. The idea that a renewed effort towards the goal of spirituallight is the cause of trouble or precipitates disaster is not a statement offact. The extent of the discipline to be undergone by a disciple is settled andknown by his soul before he even takes a body; it is determined by law.It is this problem of energy units and their mutual interplay which underliesthe entire subject of the rays which we shall seek to investigate. Every groupin the world is a nucleus for the focussing and interplay of the seven types offorce, just as every human being is also a meeting place for the seven types ofenergy,—two in the ascendant and five less potent. Every group can consequentlybe a creative centre and produce that which is an expression of the controllingenergies and of the directed thought of the thinkers in the group. From thestandpoint of Those Who see and guide, therefore, every group is constructingsomething that is relatively tangible and governed by certain building laws. Thegreat work of the Builders proceeds steadily. Often that which is built isinchoate, futile and without form or purpose, and of no use to either gods ormen. But the race as a whole is now coming into an era wherein the mind isbecoming a potent factor; many are learning to hold the mind steady in thelight, and consequently are receptive to ideas hitherto unrecognised. If a groupof minds can be so drawn together and fused into an adequate synthesis, and ifthey (in their individual and daily meditation) keep focussed or orientedtowards that which can be apprehended, great concepts can be grasped and greatideas intuited. Men can train themselves—as a group—to think these intuitedideas of the true and the beautiful and of the Plan into manifested [12]existence, and thus a creation of beauty, embodying a divine principle, can bebuilt. Ponder on this, seek to fit yourselves for the registering of theseideas, and train yourselves to formulate them into thoughts and to transmit themso that others can apprehend them also. This is the nature of the real work tobe done by the new groups, and students today who can grasp this idea have theopportunity to do some of this pioneering work.Always the individual of advancement and of poise has been able to do thisintuiting, and to concretise the idea. Groups of students meditatingsynchronously should now attempt to do the same. The effort to synchroniseeffort does not relate so much to the time element as to unity of intent and ofpurpose.There is to be found today in the realm of the intuition much of wonder; thiscan be contacted. It is now the privilege of the race to contact that “raincloudof knowable things” to which the ancient seer Patanjali refers in his fourthbook; the race, through its many aspirants, can today precipitate this“raincloud” so that the brains of men everywhere can register the contact.Hitherto this has been the privilege of the illumined and rare seer. In this waythe New Age will be ushered in and the new knowledge will enter into the mindsof humanity.This can be practically demonstrated if those who are interested in thisTreatise on the Seven Rays can attune themselves to think clearly, and with apoised and illumined mind seek to understand what is relatively a new aspect oftruth.In undertaking to reveal something anent the nature of the seven rays, I feel itnecessary to remind all of you who take up this study that any speculation as tothe emanating source of the rays must remain profitless until there is developedwithin each student that apparatus of response and that sensitive mechanismwhich will enable him to register a wider field of contacts than is at presentpossible. Many are as yet in [13] the initial stage of registering an awarenessof a field of expression which they know exists—the field of soul awareness—butwhich is not yet for them their normal field of expression. Many know a greatdeal about it, theoretically, but the practical effects of applied knowledge arenot yet theirs. Many are conscious of consciousness, and are aware of thekingdom of the soul and of an occasional reaction to impression from thatkingdom, but they are not yet consciousness itself, nor so identified with thesoul that consciousness of all else drops away. To achieve that is their aim andobjective.Let me also remind you that the career of the Monad (an aspect of energy foundon one or other of the three major rays) can be roughly divided into threeparts, leading to a fourth:1. A lower realisation of a unity which is the unit of the form nature. In thisunity, the soul is so closely identified with the matter aspect that it sees nodistinction, but is the form, and knows not itself as soul. This often reachesits height in some life of full personality expression, wherein the soul iscompletely centred in personality reactions; the lower life is so strong andvital that a powerful and material expression eventuates.2. A subsequent and painful differentiation of the consciousness into a realisedduality. In this condition, the man is distinctly aware of what is termed hisessential duality; he knows he is spirit-matter, is form-life, and is the soulin manifestation. During this stage, which covers many lives and carries the manalong the path of probation and discipleship as far as the third initiation, thecentre of gravity (if I may so express it) shifts steadily out of the form sideand centres itself more and more in that of the soul. There is a growingconsciousness that there is a [14] Reality which embraces, and at the same timeextinguishes, duality.Remember that the entire story of evolution is the story of consciousness, andof a growing expansion of the “becoming-aware” principle, so that from themicroscopic interest of the self-conscious man—for we shall retain the parablewithin the confines of the fourth kingdom in nature—we have a slowly developinginclusiveness which finally leads him into the consciousness of the cosmicChrist.3. The higher realisation of unity follows upon this sense of duality, and inthis final stage the sense of being soul and body is lost. The consciousnessidentifies itself with the indwelling Life of the planet and of the solarsystem. When this happens, there is the registering of a state of being whichlies beyond word, mind and form expression of any kind.The great Jewish seer sought to convey these three stages in the words, IAm—That—I Am . He thus expressed them tritely and succinctly and adequately, hadwe but the development to know it. The third (however understood) defiesexpression, and hints at a fourth type of realisation which is that of Deityitself, about which it profits us not to speculate.2. LIFE-QUALITY-APPEARANCEIn our study of the rays it must therefore be remembered that we are dealingwith life-expression, through the medium of matter-form. The highest unity willbe cognised only when this dual relation is perfected. The theory of the OneLife may be held, but I deal not basically with theory but with that which maybe known, provided there is growth and intelligent application of truth. I dealwith possibility and with that which is capable of achievement. Many these dayslike to [15] talk and think in terms of that One Life, but it remains but speechand thought, whilst the true awareness of that essential Unity remains a dreamand an imagining. Whenever this reality is put into words duality is emphasisedand the spiritual controversy (using the word in its basic meaning and not inits ordinary warlike connotation) is enhanced. Take for example the words: “Ibelieve in the One Life” or “To me, there is but one Reality,” and note how theyare in their phraseology an expression of duality. Life cannot be expressed inwords nor can its realised perfection. The process of “becoming,” which leads to“being,” is a cosmic event, involving all forms, and no son of God liesseparated from that mutable process as yet. As long as he is in form he cannotknow what Life is, though, when he has attained certain steps and can functionon the higher planes of the system in full awareness, he can begin to glimpsethat awful Reality. Certain great initiates, down the ages, have fulfilled theirfunction of revealers, and have held before the eyes of the pioneering disciplesof life the ideal of Oneness and of Unity. It has nevertheless been a matter ofshifting the focus of attention progressively out of one form into another, andthus, from a higher standpoint getting a fresh glimpse of a possible truth. Eachage (and the present is no exception) has believed its grasp of Reality and itssensitivity to the inner Beauty to be greater and nearer the True than was everpreviously possible. The highest realisation of what is termed the One Life isthe awareness (of the initiate of high degree) of the embodied Logos, of Deity,and his identification with the consciousness of that stupendous Creator Who isseeking expression through the medium of the solar system. No initiate on theplanet can identify himself with the consciousness of that Identified Being (inthe esoteric sense of the term) Who, speaking in the Bhagavad Gita , says:“Having [16] pervaded the entire universe with a fragment of Myself, I remain.”These thoughts I commend to your consideration and to your careful pondering,begging you to see to it that there is a steady expansion of your sense ofawareness and a growing capacity to make understanding contacts with thatemerging Truth, Reality and Beauty which the universe declares. Guard yourselfat the same time from mystical rhapsodies anent the One Life, which are apt tobe no more than the negation of all mental apprehension and a luxuriating in thesensuous perception of a highly developed and high grade emotional nature.All our considerations therefore in this Treatise on the Seven Rays willnecessarily be held within the realm of thought which involves awareness ofduality. I shall employ the language of duality, and this I shall do, notbecause I seek to emphasize it to the neglect of unity (for this unity is to mesomewhat of a reality and I glimpse more than a possibility), but because allaspirants and disciples and all initiates up to the third initiation—as Iearlier said—are swinging as a pendulum between the pairs of opposites, spiritand matter. I speak not here of the pairs of opposites of the astral oremotional plane, which are illusory reflections of the true pairs of opposites,but of the basic duality of manifestation. I seek to deal with that materialwhich is of practical value and which can be grasped by the illuminedintelligence of the average man. It is necessary for all students who seekillumination and a right apprehension of truth to drop the emphasis so oftenlaid upon certain aspects and presentations of truth being spiritual and othersbeing mental . It is in the realm of so-called mind that the great principle ofseparateness is found. It is also in the realm of mind that the greatat-one-ment is made. The words of the initiate Paul have here a fitting place,wherein he says: “Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ,” and adds[17] in another place that Christ had made “in himself, of twain, one new man”.It is through the mind that theory is formulated, truth distinguished and Deityapprehended. When we are more advanced upon the Path, we shall see naught butspirit everywhere, and the aphorism, enunciated by that great disciple, H.P.B.,that “matter is spirit at the lowest point of its cyclic activity” and “spiritis matter on the seventh plane,” or the highest, will be a realised fact in ourconsciousness. It is as yet but an intellectual phrase which means little exceptthe enunciation of a truth, incapable of proof. Everything is an expression of aspiritual consciousness, which spiritualises by its inherent life allmatter-forms. A grub or worm working out its little life in a mass of decayingsubstance is as much a spiritual manifestation as an initiate working out hisdestiny in a mass of rapidly changing human forms. It is all manifested Deity;it is all divine expression and all a form of sensitive awareness and ofresponse to environment, and therefore a form of conscious expression.The seven rays are the first differentiation of the divine triplicity ofSpirit-Consciousness-Form, and they provide the entire field of expression forthe manifested Deity. We are told in the scriptures of the world that theinterplay, or the relation between, Father—Spirit and Mother—Matter produceseventually a third, which is the Son, or the consciousness aspect. That Son, theproduct of the two, is esoterically defined as “the One Who was third but is thesecond.” The reason for this wording is that there first existed the two divineaspects, Spirit-Matter, or matter impregnated with life, and it was only whenthese two realised their mutual unity (note the necessary ambiguity of thatphrase) that the Son emerged. The esotericist, however, regards Spirit-Matter asthe first unity, and the Son therefore is the second factor. This Son, Who isdivine Life incarnate in matter, and consequently the producer [18] of thediversity and immensity of forms, is the embodiment of divine quality. We mighttherefore utilise—for the sake of clarity—the terms Life-Quality-Appearance asinterchangeable with the more usual trinity of Spirit-Soul-Body, orLife-Consciousness-Form.I shall utilise the word Life when referring to Spirit, to energy, to theFather, to the first aspect of Divinity, and to that essential dynamic electricFire which produces all that is, and is the sustaining, originating Cause andSource of all manifestation.I shall use the word Appearance to express that which we call matter, or form,or objective expression; it is that illusory tangible outer appearance which isanimated by life. This is the third aspect, the Mother, overshadowed andfertilised by the Holy Ghost, or Life, united with intelligent substance. Thisis fire by friction—a friction brought about by life and matter and theirinterplay, and producing change and constant mutation.I shall use the word Quality as expressive of the second aspect, the Son of God,the cosmic Christ incarnate in form—a form brought into being by the relation ofspirit and matter. This interplay produces that psychological Entity which wecall the Christ. This cosmic Christ demonstrated to us His perfection, as far asthe human family is concerned, through the medium of the historical Christ. Thispsyphological Entity can bring into functioning activity a quality within allhuman forms which esoterically can “obliterate the forms” and so engross theattention as to be regarded eventually as the main factor and as constitutingall that is. This truth as to life and quality and form is made most clearlyapparent to us in the story of the Christ of Galilee. He was constantlyreminding the people that He was not what He appeared to be, neither was He theFather in Heaven, and He is ever referred [19] to by those who know and love Himin terms of quality. He demonstrated to us the quality of the love of God, andin Himself He embodied not only that which He had evolved of the seven rayqualities, but also—as do few of the sons of God—a basic principle of the ray ofthe Solar Logos Himself, the quality of Love. This we shall study more closelywhen we take up the consideration of the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.The seven rays are therefore embodiments of seven types of force whichdemonstrate to us the seven qualities of Deity. These seven qualities haveconsequently a sevenfold effect upon the matter and forms to be found in allparts of the universe, and have also a sevenfold interrelation betweenthemselves.Life-quality-appearance are brought together into a synthesis in the manifesteduniverse and in man incarnate, and the result of this synthesis is sevenfold,producing seven types of qualified forms which emerge on all planes and in allkingdoms. It must be remembered that all the planes which we, from our littlepoint of view, regard as formless are not really so. Our seven planes are butthe seven subplanes of the cosmic physical plane. We shall not deal with theplanes, except in their relation to man’s unfoldment, nor shall we deal with themacrocosm, or with the developing life of the Cosmic Christ. We shall confineour attention entirely to man and to his psychological reactions to thequalified forms in three directions: to those in the subhuman kingdoms innature, to those with whom he associates in the human family and to the guidingHierarchy and the world of souls. The seven ray types must be dealt withentirely from the human angle, for this treatise is intended to give the newpsychological approach to man through an understanding of the energies, seven innumber, with their forty-nine differentiations, which animate him and make himwhat he is. Later, as we take up each ray [20] type, we shall subject man to aclose analysis and study his reactions in these three directions.These seven rays are the seven streams of force issuing from a central energyafter (in point of time) that vortex of energy had been set up. Spirit andmatter became mutually interactive and the form or appearance of the solarsystem began its process of becoming,—a process leading to an eventual being .This idea is ancient and true. We find reference to the seven aeons and theseven emanations and to the life and nature of the seven “Spirits which arebefore the Throne of God” in the writings of Plato and of all initiates who laiddown in ancient times the basic propositions which have guided the humanmentality down the ages. These great Lives, functioning within the boundaries ofthe solar system, gathered to Themselves that substance which They required formanifestation and built it into those forms and appearances through which Theycould best express Their innate qualities. Within the radius of Their influence,They gathered all that now appears. This aggregated, qualified materialconstitutes Their body of manifestation, just as the solar system is the body ofmanifestation of the Trinity of aspects.This idea can best be apprehended if one remembers that every human being is, inhis turn, an aggregate of atoms and cells built into form and having scatteredthroughout that form organs and centres of differentiated life which function inrhythm and relation, but which have varying influences and differing purposes.These aggregated and animated forms present an appearance of an entity orcentral life which is characterised by its own quality, and which functionsaccording to the point in evolution, thus making an impress by its radiation andlife upon every atom and cell and organism within the radius of immediateinfluence and also upon every other human being contacted. Man is a psychicentity, a Life Who, [21] through radiatory influence, has built a form, colouredit with His own psychic quality and thus presented an appearance to theenvironing world which will persist for as long a time as He lives in form.This statement covers also the life story and the qualified appearance of anyone of the seven rays. God, Ray, Life, and Man are all psychological entitiesand builders of forms. Therefore a great psychological life is appearing throughthe medium of a solar system. Seven psychological lives, qualified by seventypes of force, are appearing through the medium of the seven planets. Eachplanetary life repeats the same technique ofmanifestation—life-quality-appearance—and in its second aspect of qualitydemonstrates as a psychological entity. Every human being is a miniature replicaof the entire plan. He is also spirit-soul-body, life-quality-appearance. Hecolours his appearance with his quality and animates it with his life. Becauseall appearances are expressions of quality and the lesser is included in thegreater, every form in nature and every human being is found upon one or otherof the seven qualifying rays and his appearance in a phenomenal form is colouredby the quality of his basic ray. It is qualified predominantly by the ray of theparticular life upon whose emanation he issued forth, but it will include alsoin a secondary measure the six other ray types.Let us therefore posit—as a symbolical analogy—the fact of a Central Life(extraneous and outside our solar system yet within it during the process ofmanifestation) Which decides within Itself to take a material form and toincarnate. A vortex of force is set up as a preliminary step and we then haveGod immanent and God transcendent at the same time. This vortex, as a result ofthis initial activity, demonstrates through the medium of what we call substanceor (to use a technical term of modern science, which is the best we can do atthis time) [22] through the ether of space. The consequence of this activeinterplay of life and substance is that a basic unity is constituted. Father andmother are at-one. This unity is characterised by quality. Through thistriplicity of life-quality-form, the central Life evokes and manifestsconsciousness, or awareness of response to all that is eventuating, but in adegree which it is impossible for us to cognise, limited as we are by ourpresent relatively undeveloped point in evolution.Students of this treatise must bear in mind, from the very start of theirstudies, the necessity for familiarising themselves with these four conditioningfactors—life-quality-appearance—and their result or synthesis which we callConsciousness .Always, therefore, we predicate that which stands outside of the appearance andwhich is conscious of that appearance. This involves awareness of its materialdevelopment and consequent adequacy of expression, and also awareness of itspsychic unfoldment. No study of the rays is possible apart from this fourfoldrecognition. Our grasp of the subject will be much facilitated if we trainourselves to regard ourselves as an accurate (though as yet undeveloped)expression and reflection of this initial creative quaternary. We are lives,making an appearance, expressing quality and slowly becoming aware of theprocess and the objective, as our consciousness becomes more like that ofDivinity Itself.3. THE SEVEN RAYS ENUMERATEDAs part of the initial Plan, the one Life sought expansion, and the seven aeonsor emanations came forth from the central vortex and actively repeated theearlier process in all its details. They too came into manifestation and in thework of expressing active life, qualified by love and limited by an outwardphenomenal appearance, they swept into a secondary activity and became the sevenBuilders, the seven Sources of [23] life and the seven Rishis of all the ancientscriptures. They are the original psychic Entities, imbued with the capacity toexpress love (which involves the concept of duality, for the loving and theloved, the desiring and the desired, must here be posited) and to emerge fromsubjective being into objective becoming. We call these seven by various names,as follows:1. The Lord of Power or Will. This Life wills to love, and uses power as anexpression of divine beneficence. For His body of manifestation He uses thatplanet for which the sun is regarded as the esoteric substitute.2. The Lord of Love-Wisdom , Who is the embodiment of pure love, is regarded byesotericists as being as close to the heart of the Solar Logos as was thebeloved disciple close to the heart of the Christ of Galilee. This Life instilsinto all forms the quality of love, with its more material manifestation ofdesire, and is the attractive principle in nature and the custodian of the Lawof Attraction, which is the life-demonstration of pure Being. This Lord of Loveis the most potent of the seven rays, because He is on the same cosmic ray asthe solar Deity. He expresses Himself primarily through the planet Jupiter,which is His body of manifestation.3. The Lord of Active Intelligence . His work is more closely linked to matterand He works in cooperation with the Lord of the second ray. He is themotivating impulse in the initial work of creation. The planet Saturn is Hisbody of expression within the solar system, and through the medium of matter(which beneficently obstructs and hinders) He provides humanity with a vastfield of experiment and experience.I should like to point out here that when I speak in terms of [24] personalityand perforce employ the personal pronoun, I must not be accused of personalizingthese great forces. I speak in terms of entity, of pure Being, and not in termsof human personality. But the handicap of language persists; and in teachingthose who think in terms of the lower concrete mind, and whose intuition isdormant or only manifesting in flashes, I am compelled to speak in parables anduse the language of word symbols. Let me point out also that all statementswhich I may make are in relation to our particular planet and couched in termsthat can be understood by the humanity which our planet has produced. The work,as I outline it, constitutes only a fraction of the work undertaken by theseBeings; They each have Their own purpose and radius of influence, and as ourEarth is not one of the seven sacred planets (nor the body of manifestation ofone of the basic seven rays), They have purposes and activities in which ourEarth plays only a minor part.4. The Lord of Harmony, Beauty and Art. The main function of this Being is thecreation of Beauty (as an expression of truth) through the free interplay oflife and form, basing the design of beauty upon the initial plan as it exists inthe mind of the solar Logos. The body of manifestation of this life is notrevealed, but the activity emanating from it produces that combination ofsounds, colours and word music that expresses—through the form of the ideal—thatwhich is the originating idea. This fourth Lord of creative expression willresume activity upon the Earth about six hundred years hence, though already thefirst faint impress of His influence is being felt and the next century will seea re-awakening of creative art in all its branches.5. The Lord of Concrete Knowledge and Science. This is a Great Life in closetouch with the mind of the creative [25] Deity, just as the Lord of the secondray is in close touch with the heart of that same Deity. His influence is greatat this time, though not as potent as it will be later. Science is apsychological unfoldment in man due to this ray influence, and is only enteringinto its real work. His influence is waxing in power, just as the influence ofthe sixth Lord is waning.6. The Lord of Devotion and Idealism. This solar Deity is a peculiar andcharacteristic expression of the quality of the solar Logos. Forget not that inthe great scheme of the universal universe (not just our universe) our solarLogos is as differentiated and distinctive in quality as are any of the sons ofmen. This ray force, with the second ray, is a true and vital expression of thedivine nature. A militant focussing upon the ideal, a one-pointed devotion tothe intent of the life urge, and a divine sincerity are the qualities of thisLord, and set their impress upon all that is found within His body ofmanifestation. Advanced esotericists debate as to whether Mars is, or is not,the planet through which He manifests. You must remember that only a few of theplanets are the bodies of expression of the Lords of the rays. There are ten“planets of expression” (to use the term employed by the ancient Rishis), andonly seven ray Lives are regarded as the Builders of the system. The greatmystery, which is finally revealed in the higher initiations, is the relation ofa ray to a planet. Therefore seek not full information at this time. Theinfluence of this sixth Lord is now passing out.7. The Lord of Ceremonial Order or Magic is now coming into power and is slowlybut surely making His pressure felt. His influence is most potent upon thephysical plane, for there is a close numerical interrelation between (for [26]instance) the Lord of the seventh ray and the seventh plane, the physical, justas the seventh root race will see complete conformity to and a perfectexpression of law and order. This ray of order and its incoming is partiallyresponsible for the present tendency in world affairs toward governmentaldictatorship and the imposed control of a central governing body.It may be of value here if I give you the following statement as to theactivity, or non-activity, of the rays, begging you to bear in mind that thisstatement refers only to our Earth and its evolutions:Ray One Not in manifestation. * Ray Two In manifestation since 1575 A.D. * RayThree In manifestation since 1425 A.D. Ray Four To come slowly intomanifestation after 2025 A.D. * Ray Five In manifestation since 1775 A.D. RaySix Passing rapidly out of manifestation. It began to pass out in 1625 A.D. *Ray Seven In manifestation since 1675 A.D.These are of course all lesser cycles within the influence of the sign Pisces.You will see that four rays are in manifestation at this time—the second, third,fifth, and seventh.The question arises here: How does it happen that we find people in incarnationon all the rays at practically the same time? The reason is that, as you caneasily see, the fourth is beginning to approach and the sixth is passing out,which puts six of the rays in the position of having their egos inmanifestation. There are however very few of the fourth ray egos on the Earth atthis time, and a very large number of sixth ray egos, for it will be about twohundred years before all the sixth ray egos pass out of incarnation. As to thefirst ray egos, there are no pure first ray types on the planet. All so-called[27] first ray egos are on the first subray of the second ray, which is inincarnation. A pure first ray ego in incarnation at this time would be adisaster. There is not sufficient intelligence and love in the world to balancethe dynamic will of an ego on the ray of the destroyer.Just as the human family has a relation to the planetary Logos of our Earthwhich is best expressed by stating that it constitutes His heart and brain, sodoes the sum total of analogous evolutions within the entire solar systemconstitute the heart and brain of the solar Logos. Intelligent activity and loveare the outstanding characteristics of a developed son of God, whilst theirlower reflections—sex and desire—are the characteristics of the average man andthe undeveloped sons of God.These seven living qualified emanations from the central vortex of force arecomposed of untold myriads of energy units which are inherently and innatelyaspects of life, endowed with quality and capable of appearance. Below thehuman, the combination of these three produces conscious response to theenvironment, regarding the environment as composed of the sum total of alllives, qualities and appearances,—the synthesis of the seven rays or emanationsof the Deity. They produce in the human kingdom a self-conscious awareness, andin the superhuman world a synthetic inclusiveness. All human monads, carriedinto manifestation by the will and desire of some ray Lord, are part of His bodyof manifestation. Potentially they express His quality and appear phenomenallyaccording to the point in evolutionary expression which has been reached. “As Heis, so are we in this world,” but only as yet potentially,—the goal of evolutionbeing to make the potential into the real, and the latent into the expressed.The work of the esotericist is just this very thing: to bring out of latency,the hidden quality.4. THE FUNCTION OF CHRISTIANITY[28] I have now laid down the basic premise that all that is known to us is amanifesting divine Entity, expressing Itself through three aspects which (forthe purposes of this treatise and because they are more in line with theterminology of emerging modern thought) I choose to callLife-Quality-Appearance. These are but other names for the Trinity of all thegreat religions, and are synonymous with the Christian phrase, Father, Son andHoly Ghost (those old anthropomorphic terms!); with Spirit, Soul and Body, thecurrent phraseology; and with the Life, Consciousness and Form of the Indianphilosophy.May I interpolate here the comment that modern thinkers would do well to bear inmind that the importance of Christianity lies in the realisation that it is abridging religion. This is symbolised for us by the fact that the Master of allthe Masters took incarnation in Palestine, that slice of land which is midwaybetween Asia and Europe, and which partakes of the character of both.Christianity is the religion of the transitional period which links the era ofself-conscious existence with that of a group-conscious world. It is extant inthe age which will see that type of thought prevailing which (when rightlyapplied) will serve as the connecting link between the worlds of concrete and ofabstract mind. The Old Commentary puts it thus:“When the hour arrives wherein the light of the soul reveals the antaskarana(the bridge between the personality consciousness and the soul consciousness,A.A.B.) then shall men be known by their knowledge, be coloured by the despairof desire unappeased, be divided into those who recognise their dharma (meet allimplied obligations and duties) and those who only see the working out of karma,and from the very nature of their need find light and peace at last.”[29] Christianity is primarily a religion of cleavage, demonstrating to man hisduality and so laying the foundation for future unity. This is a most neededstage and has served humanity well; the purpose and intent of Christianity hasbeen definite and high, and it has done its divine work. Today it is in theprocess of being superseded, but by what new formulation of truth is not yetrevealed. The light is slowly pouring into man’s life, and in this lightedradiance he will formulate the new religion and arrive at a fresh enunciation ofancient truth. Through the lens of the illumined mind, he will shortly seeaspects of divinity hitherto unknown. Has it ever dawned on you that there maybe qualities and characteristics of the divine nature, latent as yet within theform, that have hitherto remained totally unknown and not even dimly sensed, andwhich, as yet, are literally unprecedented and for which we have neither wordsnor other adequate medium of expression? So it is. Just as the phrase“group-consciousness” would carry, for early primitive man, no significancewhatsoever, and would have been only a meaningless string of alphabetical forms,so (lingering just below the surface of our manifested world) lie divinequalities and a purpose which is as far removed from the consciousness of ourpresent humanity as the idea of collective awareness was from the consciousnessof prehistoric humanity. Take courage from this thought. The past guarantees theinfinite expansion of the future."},{"pageContent":"SECTION 1 - CHAPTER II ... CERTAIN QUESTIONS AND THEIR ANSWERS[33] I indicated that in this treatise we would give our main attention to thecentral one of the three aspects, and would concentrate upon quality . What do Imean by this? I mean that we shall occupy ourselves with that which is emergingthrough the medium of form, with that which veils or hides itself behind theappearance, which is expressive of life or spirit, and which is produced throughthe interplay of life with matter. This, when posited of man, the reflection ofdivinity, and when applied to the subject of his quality, involves threerecognitions:1. That a human being is, as earlier said, an embodied Life, expressing qualityand registering that quality in consciousness or as sensitive response to theinterplay going forward, during the evolutionary process, between spirit andmatter.2. That man, being a synthesis (and the only complete synthesis, except theMacrocosmic Deity), registers a self-recognition which is potent enough today toenable him to differentiate reactions to...a. The triplicity (as the Bhagavad Gita calls it) of the Knower, the field ofknowledge, and knowledge.b. A growing realisation that the field of knowledge is but an appearance or anillusion, that knowledge itself can be a hindrance unless transmuted intowisdom. [34]c. An evolutionary growth in responsiveness to one or other of these three, andwhich indicates a developing sensitivity. This is leading to a growth ofinterest in the Knower and to a belief that this Knower is the Soul, one withDeity, illimitable and eternal and—in time and space—the determining factor inhuman existence.3. That the endless diversity of forms hides a subjective synthesis. Man cantherefore eventually see, expressing itself through all forms in all kingdoms, auniversal septenate , and when this happens, he is then entering into the worldof subjective unity, and can proceed on his way consciously towards the One. Hecannot as yet enter into the consciousness of that basic essential Unity, but hecan enter into that of his own ray-life, of the emanating source of his owntemporarily specialised life.This triplicity of ideas requires careful study. It might be expressed thus:o The One Life. Unity. o o o The Major three Rays] Making o o o o The Minor fourRays ] seven o The Unity of AppearanceWith the one Life we shall not concern ourselves. We accept it as a basic truthand we realise that we are on our way back from the unity of form-identifiedexistence, through the varying unfoldments of a conscious response to divineinterplay and activity, to a final identification with the one Life. Formawareness has to give place to the qualified radiation of the self-consciousspiritual identity which is that of a son of God, appearing through form. Thiswill be finally superseded by two phases of expression wherein there is:1. A sense of divine synthesis, of which our bodily “well-being” [35] is thelowest form of material, yet symbolic, reflection. It is a sense of coordinatedblissful satisfaction, based on realised Being.2. A withdrawal from even this life-awareness to a phase still more intensiveand detached, which involves an awareness of the life of God Itself, free fromform, but still, in a mysterious sense, aware of quality.In the language of mysticism it might be expressed this way:“I take a body. That body is alive. I know its life. I therefore know my mother.“I use a body. That body is not me. I serve the group and in this serving livewithin the body, detached, a son of God. I know my Self.“I infuse a body. I am its life and in that life shall I see life. That life isknown as love. I am the love of God. I know the Father, and know His life islove.“I am the body and its loving life. I am the Self, whose quality is love. I amthe life of God Himself. The Mother-Father-Son am I.“Behind these three there stands the unknown God. That God am I.”Let us be perfectly clear even at the expense of reiteration. In this treatise,though we may touch upon form and consider its nature, we shall lay emphasisupon self-consciousness as it expresses itself as responsiveness, as awarenessof a peculiar kind which we call the “quality of consciousness,” or its inherentcharacteristic. We have always the subsidiary triplicities, which are onlyadjectival terms employed to express the quality of the appearing life.Form Mutability, conscious response to radiation. Matter. Self-ConsciousnessResponsiveness. Awareness of identity. Soul. Life Immutability. Emanation.Cause. Source. Spirit.[36] The synthesis of all these in manifestation we call God, the Isolated, theAll-pervading, the Detached and the Withdrawn.The above abstract truths are difficult of apprehension, but need here to beexpressed, so that our platform is understood and we are not open to thecriticism that we neglect reality and regard diversity as the only truth.We shall now answer five questions that I have formulated and answered for thereader.QUESTION 1. WHAT IS THE SOUL? CAN WE DEFINE IT? WHAT IS ITS NATURE?Here I shall give but four definitions which will serve as a basis for all thatfollows.A. The soul can be spoken of as the Son of the Father and of the Mother(Spirit-Matter) and is therefore the embodied life of God, coming intoincarnation in order to reveal the quality of the nature of God, which isessential love. This life, taking form, nurtures the quality of love within allforms, and ultimately reveals the purpose of all creation. This is the simplestdefinition for average humanity, being couched in the language of mysticism,thus linking the truth as found in all religions. It is necessarily inadequate,for it fails to emphasize the truth that what can be posited of man can also beposited of the cosmic reality, and that just as a human appearance on Earthveils both the quality and purpose (in varying degree), so does that synthesisof all forms or appearances, within that unity which we call a solar system,veil the quality and purpose of Deity. It is only when man is no longer deludedby appearance and has freed himself from the veil of illusion that he arrives ata knowledge of the quality of God’s consciousness and at the purpose which it isrevealing. This he does in a triple way:a. He discovers his own soul, the product of the union of his [37] Father inheaven with the Mother or the material nature. This last is the personality. Hethen, having discovered the personality, discovers the quality of his own soullife, and the purpose for which he has “appeared.”b. He finds that this quality expresses itself through seven aspects or basicdifferentiations, and that this septenate of qualities colours, esoterically,all forms in all kingdoms in nature, thus constituting the totality of therevelations of the divine purpose. This, he finds, is essentially a septenaryaggregation of energies, each energy producing differing effects andappearances. This discovery he makes by finding that his own soul is tincturedby one of the seven ray qualities, that he is identified with his raypurpose—whatever it may be—and is expressing a particular type of divine energy.c. From this point he proceeds to a recognition of the entire septenate, andupon the Path of Initiation he gains a glimpse of a Unity, hitherto unrealised,nor even sensed.Thus from a consciousness of himself, man arrives at an awareness of theinterrelation between the seven basic energies or rays; and from that heproceeds to a realisation of the triple deity, until at the final initiation(the fifth) he finds himself consciously at-one with the unified divine intentlying behind all appearances and all qualities. It might be added thatinitiations, higher than the fifth, reveal a purpose wider and deeper than thatwhich is working out within our solar system. The purpose of our manifestedLogos is but a part of a greater intent. It might also be noted that in thefourth kingdom of nature, on the path of evolution and of probation, a manarrives at a knowledge of his individual soul, and glimpses the quality andpurpose of that soul. On the path of discipleship and of initiation, he glimpsesthe quality and purpose of his [38] planetary Life, and discovers himself as apart of a ray Life, Which is appearing through the form of a planet and isembodying an aspect of the divine purpose and energy. After the third initiationhe glimpses the quality and purpose of the solar system; he sees his ray lifeand energy as a part of a greater whole. These are but modes of expressing theemerging quality and the hidden purpose of the graded Lives which inform allappearances and colour them with qualityB. The soul can be regarded as the principle of intelligence—an intelligencewhose characteristics are mind and mental awareness, which in turn demonstrateas the power to analyse, to discriminate, to separate, and to distinguish, tochoose or to reject, with all the implications conveyed in these terms. As longas a man is identified with the appearance, these aspects of the mentalprinciple produce in him the “great heresy of separateness.” It is theappearance of the form nature that glamours him and completely deludes him. Heregards himself as the form, and then proceeds from a realisation of himself asthe material form, and as identified with the outer appearance, to a realisationof himself as an insatiable desire. He then becomes identified with his desirebody, with his appetites, good and bad, and considers himself as one with hismoods, his feelings, his longings, whether they ray out in the direction of thematerial world or inward toward the world of thought or the Kingdom of the soul.He is torn by a sense of duality. Later, he becomes identified with stillanother of the appearances,—with the mind body or nature. Thoughts become to himso tangible that he is swayed, turned and influenced by them; and to the worldof material appearances, and to the world of the great Illusion is added theworld of thought forms. He is then subjected to a triple illusion, and he, theconscious life behind the illusion, begins to unify the forms into onecoordinated whole, in order the better to control them.[39] Thus the Personality of the soul makes its appearance. He stands then onthe verge of the probationary path. He enters the world of quality and of value,and begins to discover the nature of the soul and to shift the emphasis from theappearance to the quality of the Life which has produced it. This identificationof the quality with the appearance grows steadily upon the path until the fusionof quality and appearance, of energy and that which it energises, is so perfectthat appearance no longer veils the reality, and the soul is now the dominantfactor; consciousness is now identified with itself (or with its ray) and notwith its phenomenal appearance. Later, the soul itself is superseded by theMonad, and that Monad becomes, in verity, embodied purpose.The process can be expressed by a very simple symbology, as follows:—o.o.o. oro.o...o or o...o.o., thus portraying the separateness of the three aspects. Theunion, then, of the aspects of appearance—quality—purpose or life, results in anabstraction from the appearance, and therefore the end of phenomenal existence.Ponder on the simple arrangement of these signs, for they portray your life andprogress:[Image00001.jpg]This is true of the human being, of the Christ in incarnation; it is equallytrue of the cosmic Christ, of God incarnate in the solar system. In the system asimilar fusion and blending is going on, and the separated aspects are enteringinto an evolutionary relationship, resulting in an eventual synthesis ofappearance and quality, and then of quality and purpose. It might be noted herethat the Hierarchy as a whole is distinguished by the sign o..oo; the New Groupof World [40] Servers by the sign oo..o; and the unevolved masses by o o o.Forget not, that in all three groups, as in nature, there are the intermediatestages composed of those who are on their way to a transitional accomplishment.The work before all students of this Treatise on the Seven Rays is the fusion ofquality and appearance, and therefore they need to study the nature of thatquality in order to produce a true appearance. In the ancient rules given tomystics in Atlantean times we find these words:“Let the disciple know the nature of his Lord of Love. Seven the aspects of thelove of God; seven the colours of that manifesting One; sevenfold the work;seven the energies and sevenfold the Path back to the centre of peace. Let thedisciple live in love, and love in life.”In those olden days no thought of purpose entered into the minds of men, for therace was not mental nor was it intended so to be. The emphasis was laid upon thequality of the appearance in all preparation for initiation, and the highestinitiate of that time endeavoured to express only the quality of God’s love. ThePlan was the great mystery. The Christ, cosmic and individual, was sensed andknown, but purpose was as yet veiled and unrevealed. The “noble eightfold path”was not known, and only seven steps into the Temple were seen. With the comingin of the Aryan race, the purpose and the plan began to be revealed. Only whenthe appearance is beginning to be dominated by quality, and consciousness isexpressing itself in directed awareness through the form, is the purpose dimlysensed.I seek in various ways to convey through the symbol of words the significance ofthe soul. The soul is therefore the son of God, the product of the marriage ofspirit and matter. The soul is an expression of the mind of God, for mind andintellect are terms expressing the cosmic principle of intelligent [41] love,—alove which produces an appearance through the nature of mind and thus is thebuilder of the separate forms or appearances. The soul also, through the qualityof love, produces the fusion of appearance and of quality, of awareness and ofform.C. The soul is (and here words limit and distort) a unit of light, coloured by aparticular ray vibration; it is a vibrating centre of energy found within theappearance or form of its entire ray life. It is one of seven groups of millionsof lives which in their totality constitute the One Life. From its very nature,the soul is conscious or aware in three directions. It is God-conscious; it isgroup-conscious; it is self-conscious. This self-conscious aspect is brought tofruition in the phenomenal appearance of a human being; the group-consciousaspect retains the human state of consciousness, but adds to it awareness of itsray life, progressively unfolded; its awareness then is the awareness of love,of quality, of spirit in its relationships; it is God-conscious onlypotentially, and in that unfoldment lies, for the soul, its own growth upwardand outward after its self-conscious aspect is perfected and its group-awarenessis recognised. The soul therefore has the following points, or appearances:[Image00002.jpg]Aspirants who are studying and training themselves to live the life of servicemight be regarded as having reached the point where the line is to be found. Tovisualise this correctly [42] the sign should be regarded as in rapidrevolution, thus producing a turning wheel, which is the wheel of life.Let me again repeat:1. The soul is the son of God, the product of the union of spirit and matter.2. The soul is an embodiment of conscious mind, the expression, if one might sophrase it, of divine intelligent awareness.3. The soul is a unit of energy, vibrating in unison with one of the seven rayLives, and coloured by a particular ray light.The personality of the soul is intended to be an embodiment of love, appliedwith intelligence and producing those “attractive” forms which will serve toexpress that loving intelligence. The soul in its turn is intended to be theembodiment of divine purpose or will, intelligently applied in the greatcreative work, which is produced through the power of creative love.Each son of God can say: I am born of the love of the Father for the Mother, ofthe desire of life for form. I express, therefore, the love and the magneticattractiveness of the God nature, and the responsiveness of the form nature, andam consciousness itself, aware of Deity or Life.Each intelligent point of life can say: I am the product of intelligent will,working through intelligent activity and producing a world of created formswhich embody or veil the loving purpose of Deity.Each vibrating unit of energy can say: I am part of a divine whole, which in itsseptenary nature expresses the love and life of the One Reality, coloured by oneof the seven qualities of the love of Deity and responsive to the otherqualities.For our purposes in this treatise, we must grasp the fact [43] that the world ofappearances is energised by and vibrating to the world of qualities or values,which world, in its turn, is energised by or vibrating to the world of purposeor of will. Therefore, as is stated in The Secret Doctrine and in A Treatise onCosmic Fire , the electric fire of will, and the solar fire of love, incooperation with fire by friction, produce the world of created and creativeforms. These proceed under the law of attractive magnetic love towards theevolutionary accomplishment of a purpose at present inscrutable. This purposeremains unknown only on account of the limitations of the “appearance” which isnot yet responsive to the quality. When the illusory appearance and the veiledquality of the life are known and comprehended the underlying purpose willemerge with clarity. Indications of this can be dimly sensed and the attributeof this growing awareness can be noted in the tendency of modern thought tospeak of patterns and of plans, of blue prints and synthetic formulations ofideas, and in the tracing of historical developments—national, racial, human andpsychological. As we read, ponder and study, the dim outlines of the Planappear, but until the consciousness has transcended all human limitations andhas included the subhuman, as well as the superhuman, within its range ofcontacts, the true Plan cannot be rightly grasped. The will, lying behind thepurpose, cannot be understood until the consciousness has transcended even thatof the superhuman man, and has become one with the divine.Will or the energy of life are synonymous terms and are an abstraction, existingapart from all form expression. The will-to-be emerges from outside the solarsystem altogether. It is the all-pervading energy of God which informs with afraction of itself the solar system, and yet remains outside. Plan and purposeconcern the emanating energies of that central Life and involve duality,—will orthe life urge plus attractive [44] magnetic love which, in its turn, is theresponse of the vibrating universal substance to the impact of the energy ofwill. This initial activity precedes the creative process of form building; andthe play of the divine will on the ocean of space, matter, or etheric substanceproduced the first differentiation into the major rays, and their mutualinterplay produced the minor four rays. Thus the seven emanations, the sevenpotencies and the seven rays came into manifestation. They are the seven breathsof the one Life, the seven basic energies; they streamed forth from the centreformed by the impact of the will of God on divine substance, and divided intoseven streams of force. The radius of the influence of these seven streamsdetermined the extent or scope of activity of a solar system and “outlined” thelimits of the form of the incarnated cosmic Christ. Each of these seven streamsor emanations of energy was coloured by a divine quality, an aspect of love, andall of them were needed for the ultimate perfecting of the latent and unrevealedpurpose.The will of Deity coloured the stream of energy units which we call by the nameof the Ray of Will or Power, the first ray, and the impact of that stream on thematter of space insured that the hidden purpose of Deity would inevitably andeventually be revealed. It is a ray of such dynamic intensity that we call itthe ray of the Destroyer. It is not as yet functioning actively. It will comeinto full play only when the time comes for the purpose to be safely revealed.Its units of energy in manifestation in the human kingdom are very few. As Iearlier said, there is not a true first ray type in incarnation as yet. Its mainpotency is to be found in the mineral kingdom, and the key to the mystery of thefirst ray is to be found in radium.In the vegetable kingdom the second ray is peculiarly active, producing amongother things the magnetic attractiveness [45] of flowers. The mystery of thesecond ray is found to be hidden in the significance of the perfume of flowers.Perfume and radium are related, being emanatory expressions of ray effects upondiffering groupings of material substance. The third ray is, in its turn,peculiarly related to the animal kingdom, producing the tendency to intelligentactivity which we note in the higher domestic animals. The correspondence toradioactivity and to emanatory perfumes which we found in the mineral andvegetable kingdoms, we here call devotion, the characteristic of the attractiveinterplay between the domestic animals and man. Devotees of personalities mightmore rapidly transmute that devotion into its higher correspondence—love ofprinciples—if they realised that they were only displaying an animal emanation.The desire of the Deity expresses itself through the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.Desire is a word which has been prostituted to cover the tendency of humanity tocrave material things or those pleasures which bring satisfaction to thesensuous nature. It is applied to those conditions which will satisfy thepersonality, but in the last analysis, desire is essentially love. This desireexpresses itself by attractiveness, by its capacity to draw to itself and intothe radius of its influence that which is loved. It is the bond of coherence,and is that principle of magnetic cohesion which lies behind all creative workand which produces the emergence into the light of manifestation of those formsor appearances through which it is possible to satisfy desire. This second rayis pre-eminently the ray of applied consciousness, and works through thecreation and development of those forms which are found throughout the universe.They are essentially mechanisms for the development of responsiveness orawareness; they are sensitive machines, responsive to an enveloping environment.This is true of all [46] forms, from that of a crystal to that of a solarsystem. They have been created in the great process of satisfying desire and ofproviding the media of contact which will guarantee a progressive satisfaction.In the human family, the effect of this dual interplay of Life (desiringsatisfaction) and of form (providing the field of experience) is a consciousnesswhich is striving towards a love of the formless instead of desire for form, andthe wise adaptation of all experience to the process of transmuting desire intolove. Hence this ray is, par excellence, the dual ray of the solar LogosHimself, and hence colours all manifested forms, directing all consciousness inall forms in all kingdoms of nature, and in all fields of development; itcarries the life through the range of forms in that basic search or urge for theattainment of bliss through the satisfaction of desire. This urge and theinteraction of the pairs of opposites produced the varying types of consciousreaction to experience which, in their main stages, we call consciousness,animal consciousness, and allied differentiating phrases.This second ray is the ray of Deity Itself, and is coloured by distinctiveaspects of desire or love. They produce the totality of the manifestedappearances, animated by the Life Which determines the quality. The Father,Spirit or Life, wills to seek the satisfaction of desire. The Mother or mattermeets the desire and is attracted also by the Father. Their mutual responseinitiates the creative work, and the Son is born, inheriting from the Father theurge to desire or love, and from the Mother the tendency actively to createforms. Thus, in the language of symbolism, have the form worlds come into being,and through the evolutionary work the process is going forward of satisfying thedesire of spirit. Thus in the two major rays of Will and Love we have the twomain characteristics of the divine nature, which lie latent behind all the [47]myriad of forms. The aeons will see these two energies steadily dominating allappearance and driving the created world on to a full display of the divinenature. This is true of gods and men.But in the same way in which the Father contributes to the Son the divinequalities of will and love, so the Mother contributes much also, and the initialduality is increased and the qualities are enhanced by the addition of a qualityinherent in matter itself,—the quality or Ray of Intelligent Activity. This isthe third of the divine attributes and completes, if I may so express it, theequipment of the appearing forms, and predisposes all creation to an intelligentappreciation of the true goal of desire and to an intelligent use of thetechnique of form building in order to reveal divine purpose. The Knower (man)is the custodian of that wisdom which will enable him to further the divine planand bring the will of God to fruition. The field of knowledge is so constitutedthat it vibrates with intelligent response to the slowly emerging will.Knowledge itself is that which knows its own ends and works towards those endsthrough the process of experiment, expectation, experience, examination andexaltation which produces a final exit. Words such as these are syntheticsymbols, conveying a cosmic story in terms of constructive brevity.Thus the three rays of Will, Love and Intelligence produce appearance, donatequality and, through the life principle which is the underlying aspect of unity,ensure continuity of growth until such time as the will of God has evidenceditself as power, has attracted to itself the desired, has with wisdom utilisedthe experience of a gradually growing satisfaction, and has intelligentlyapplied the gain of experience to the production of forms more sensitive, morebeautiful and more fully expressive of the quality of the life.[48] Each ofthese rays is dual in time and space, though only the second ray is dual whenthey are regarded from the standpoint of the final abstraction. In theirtemporary duality can be seen, for each of them, the interplay which we callcause and effect.Ray I Will, dynamically applied, emerges in manifestation as power. Ray II Love,magnetically functioning, produces wisdom. Ray III Intelligence, potentiallyfound in substance, causes activity.The result of the interplay of these three major rays can be seen in theactivity of the four minor rays. The Secret Doctrine speaks of the Lords ofKnowledge and of Love, and also of the Lords of Ceaseless Devotion. We might, inorder more clearly to understand the mystical significance of these names, pointout that the dynamic persistent will of the Logos expresses itself through theLords of Ceaseless Devotion. Here devotion is not the quality to which Ireferred earlier in this treatise, but is the persistent directed one-pointedwill of God, embodied in a Life which is that of the Lord of the first ray. TheLords of Love and of Knowledge are the two great Lives Who embody or ensoul theLove-Wisdom and the creative Intelligence aspects of the two major rays. Thesethree are the sum total of all forms or appearances, the givers of allqualities, and the emerging Life aspect behind the tangible manifestations. Theycorrespond, in the human family, to the three aspects of Personality, Soul andMonad. The Monad is dynamic will or purpose, but remains unrevealed until afterthe third initiation. The Monad is Life, the sustaining force, a Lord ofpersevering and ceaseless devotion to the pursuit of a seen and determinedobjective. The soul is a Lord of love and wisdom, whilst the personality is aLord of knowledge [49] and of intelligent activity. This use of terms involvesthe realisation of an achieved goal. It is not true of the present stage asregards expression, for this is the intermediate stage. None are as yet workingwith full intelligent activity, though some day each will do so. None are as yetmanifesting Lords of love, but they sense the ideal and are striving towards itsexpression. None are as yet Lords of ceaseless will and none realise as yet theplan of the monad nor the true goal towards which all are striving. Some day allwill. But potentially every human unit is all these three, and some day theappearances which were called personalities, that mask or veil reality, willfully reveal the qualities of Deity. When that time comes, the purpose for whichall creation waits will burst upon the awakened vision, and we shall know thetrue meaning of bliss, and why the morning stars sang together. Joy is thestrong basic note of our particular solar system.One of the foundational septenate of rays embodies in itself the principle ofharmony, and this fourth Ray of Harmony gives to all forms that which producesbeauty and works towards the harmonising of all effects emanating from the worldof causes, which is the world of the three major rays. The ray of beauty, of artand harmony is the producer of the quality of organisation through form . It isin the last analysis the ray of mathematical exactitude and is not the ray ofthe artist, as so many seem to think. The artist is found on all rays, just asis the engineer or the physician, the home-maker or the musician. I want to makethis clear, for there is much misunderstanding on this matter.Each of the great rays has a form of teaching truth to humanity which is itsunique contribution, and in this way develops man by a system or technique whichis qualified by the ray quality and is therefore specific and unique. Let mepoint out to you the modes of this group teaching: [50]Ray I Higher Expression: The science of statesmanship, of government. LowerExpression: Modern diplomacy and politics. Ray II Higher Expression: The processof initiation as taught by the hierarchy of adepts. Lower Expression: Religion.Ray III Higher Expression: Means of communication or interaction. The radio,telephone, telegraph and the power to travel. Lower Expression: The use andspread of money and gold. Ray IV Higher Expression: The Masonic work, based onthe formation of the hierarchy, and related to the second ray. Lower Expression:Architectural construction. Modern city planning. Ray V Higher Expression: Thescience of the soul. Esoteric psychology. Lower Expression: Modern educationalsystems and mental science. Ray VI Higher Expression: Christianity anddiversified religions. (Notice here relation to Ray II.) Lower Expression:Churches and organised religions. Ray VII Higher Expression: All forms of whitemagic. Lower Expression: Spiritualism of “phenomena.”The fourth ray is essentially the refiner, the producer of perfection within theform, and the prime manipulator of the energies of God in such a way that theTemple of the Lord is indeed known in its true nature as that which “houses” theLight. Thus the Shekinah will shine forth within the secret place of the Templein its full glory. Such is the work of the seven Builders. This ray isexpressive primarily on the first [51] the formless planes, counting from belowupwards, and its true purpose cannot emerge until the soul is awakened andconsciousness is adequately recording the known. The planes or manifestedspheres of expression are influenced in manifestation in a numerical order:Ray I Will or Power Plane of divinity. Ray II Love-Wisdom Plane of the monad.Ray III Active Intelligence Plane of spirit, atma. Ray IV Harmony Plane of theintuition. Ray V Concrete Knowledge Mental Plane. Ray VI Devotion, IdealismAstral Plane. Ray VII Ceremonial Order Physical Plane.The fifth ray therefore works actively on the plane of the greatest moment tohumanity, being, for man, the plane of the soul, and of the higher and the lowermind. It embodies the principle of knowledge, and because of its activity andits close relation to the third Ray of Active Intelligence might be regarded asa ray having a most vital relation to man at this time in particular. It is theray which—when active, as it was in Lemurian times,—produces individualisation,which is literally the shifting of the evolving life of God into a new sphere ofawareness. This particular transference into higher forms of awareness tends, atthe beginning, to separativeness.The fifth ray has produced what we call science. In science we find a conditionwhich is rare in the extreme. Science is separative in its approach to thediffering aspects of the divine manifestation which we call the world of naturalphenomena, but it is non-separative in actuality, for there is little warringbetween the sciences and little competition between scientists. In this theworkers in the scientific field differ profoundly from those of the religious.The reason for this is to be found in the fact that the true scientist, being acoordinated personality and working therefore on mental levels, works very closeto the soul. The developed personality produces the [52] clear distinctions ofthe dominant lower mind, but (if one may use such a symbolic way of expression)the close proximity of the soul negates a separative attitude. The religious manis pre-eminently astral or emotional and works in a more separative manner,particularly in this Piscean age which is passing away. When I say the religiousman I refer to the mystic and to the man who senses the beatific vision. I refernot to disciples nor to those who are called initiates, for they add to themystical vision a trained mental apprehension.The sixth Ray of Devotion embodies the principle of recognition. By this I meanthe capacity to see the ideal reality lying behind the form; this implies aone-pointed application of desire and of intelligence in order to produce anexpression of that sensed idea. It is responsible for much of the formulation ofthe ideas which have led man on, and for much of the emphasis on the appearancewhich has veiled and hidden those ideals. It is on this ray primarily—as itcycles in and out of manifestation—that the work of distinguishing betweenappearance and quality is carried forward, and this work has its field ofactivity upon the astral plane. The complexity of this subject and the acutenessof the feeling evolved become therefore apparent.The seventh Ray of Ceremonial Order or Magic embodies a curious quality which isthe outstanding characteristic of the particular Life which ensouls this ray. Itis the quality or principle which is the coordinating factor unifying the innerquality and the outer tangible form or appearance. This work goes on primarilyon etheric levels and involves physical energy. This is the true magical work. Ishould like to point out that when the fourth ray and the seventh ray come intoincarnation together, we shall have a most peculiar period of revelation and oflight-bringing. It is said of this time that then “the temple of the Lord willtake on an added glory and the Builders will rejoice together.” This will be thehigh moment [53] of the Masonic work, spiritually understood. The Lost Word willthen be recovered and uttered for all to hear, and the Master will arise andwalk among His builders in the full light of the glory which shines from theeast.The spiritualising of forms might be regarded as the main work of the seventhray, and it is this principle of fusion, of coordination and of blending whichis active on etheric levels every time a soul comes into incarnation and a childis born on earth.D. The soul is the principle of sentiency, underlying all outer manifestation,pervading all forms, and constituting the consciousness of God Himself. When thesoul, immersed in substance, is simply sentiency, it produces through itsevolutionary interplay an addition, and we find emerging quality and capacity toreact to vibration and to environment. This is the soul as it expresses itselfin all the subhuman kingdoms in nature.When the soul, an expression of sentiency and quality, adds to these thecapacity of detached self-awareness, there appears that self-identified entitywhich we call a human being.When the soul adds to sentiency, quality and self-awareness, the consciousnessof the group, then we have identification with a ray-group, and there appearsthe disciple, the initiate and the master.When the soul adds to sentiency, quality, self-awareness and groupconsciousness, a consciousness of divine synthetic purpose (called by us thePlan), then we have that state of being and knowledge which is distinctive ofall upon the Path of Initiation, and includes those graded Lives, from the moreadvanced disciple up to the planetary Logos Himself.But forget not that when we make these distinctions it is nevertheless one Soulthat is functioning, acting through vehicles of varying capacities, ofdifferentiated refinements and of greater and lesser limitations, in just thesame sense as [54] a man is one identity, working sometimes through a physicalbody and sometimes through a feeling body or a mental body, and sometimesknowing himself to be the Self—a rare and unusual occurrence for the majority.Every form in manifestation does two things:1. Appropriates, or is pervaded by, as much of the world soul as its capacitywill permit. The atom of substance, the molecule or the cell all have soul, butnot in the same degree as has an animal; and an animal has soul, but not in thesame degree as has a Master, and so on up or down the scale.2. Through the interaction between the indwelling soul and the form, two thingsoccur:a. Sentiency and quality are expressed according to the type of body and itspoint of evolution.b. The pervading soul drives the body nature into activity, and forces itforward along the path of development, and thus provides for the soul a field ofexperience and for the body the opportunity to react to the higher soul impulse.Thus the field of expression is benefited, and the soul masters the technique ofcontact which is its objective in any particular form.The soul therefore, viewed from one angle, is an aspect of the body, for thereis a soul in every atom comprising all bodies in all kingdoms in nature. Thesubtle coherent soul which is the result of the bringing together of spirit andmatter exists as an entity apart from the body nature, and constitutes (whenseparated from the body) the etheric body, the double, as it is sometimescalled, or the counterpart of the physical body. This is the sum total of thesoul of the atoms constituting the physical body. It is the true form; it is theprinciple of coherence in every form.The soul, in relation to the human being, is the mind principle [55] in twocapacities, or the mind expressing itself in two ways. These two ways areregistered and become part of the organised equipment of the human body when itis adequately refined and sufficiently developed:1. The lower concrete mind, the mental body, the “chitta” or mind stuff.2. The higher spiritual or abstract mind.These two aspects of the soul, its two basic qualities, bring into being thehuman kingdom and enable man to contact both the lower kingdoms in nature andthe higher spiritual realities. The first, the quality of mind in its lowermanifestation, is owned potentially by every atom in every form in every kingdomin nature. It is a part of the body nature, inherent and potential, and is thebasis of brotherhood, of absolute unity, of universal synthesis and divinecoherence in manifestation. The other, the higher aspect, is the principle ofself-awareness, and when combined with the lower aspect produces theself-consciousness of the human being. When the lower aspect has informed andpervaded the forms in the subhuman kingdoms, and when it has worked upon thoseforms and their latent sentiency so as to produce adequate refinement andsentiency, the vibration becomes so potent that the higher is attracted andthere is a fusion or at-one-ing. This is like a higher recapitulation of theinitial union of spirit and matter which brought the world into being. A humansoul is thus brought into existence and begins its long career. It is now adifferentiated entity.“Soul” also is a word used to express the sum total of the psychic nature—thevital body, the emotional nature and the mind stuff. But it is also more thanthat, once the human stage is reached. It constitutes the spiritual entity, aconscious psychical being, a son of God, possessing life, quality andappearance— [56] a unique manifestation in time and space of the threeexpressions of the soul as we have just outlined them:1. The soul of all the atoms, composing the tangible appearance.2. The personal soul or the subtle coherent sum total which we call thePersonality, composed of the subtle bodies, etheric or vital, astral oremotional, and the lower mental apparatus. These three vehicles humanity shareswith the animal kingdom as regards its possession of vitality, sentiency, andpotential mind; with the vegetable kingdom as regards vitality and sentiency;and with the mineral kingdom as regards vitality and potential sentiency.3. The soul is also the spiritual being, or the union of life and quality. Whenthere is the union of the three souls, so called, we have a human being.Thus in man you have the blending or fusion of life, quality and appearance, orspirit, soul and body, through the medium of a tangible form.In the process of differentiation these various aspects have attractedattention, and the underlying synthesis has been overlooked or disregarded. Yetall forms are differentiations of the soul, but that soul is one Soul, whenviewed and considered spiritually. When studied from the form side, naught butdifferentiation and separation can be seen. When studied from the consciousnessor sentiency aspect, unity emerges. When the human stage is reached andself-awareness is blended with the sentiency of forms and with the tinyconsciousness of the atom, some idea of a possible subjective unity begins dimlyto dawn on the thinker’s mind. When the stage of discipleship is reached, a manbegins to see himself as a sentient part of a sentient whole, and slowly reactsto the purpose and intent [57] of that whole. He grasps that purpose little bylittle as he swings consciously into the rhythm of the sum total of which he isa part. When more advanced stages and more rarefied and refined forms arepossible, the part is lost in the whole; the rhythm of the whole subjects theindividual to a uniform participation in the synthetic purpose, but therealisation of individual self-awareness persists and enriches the individualcontribution, which is now intelligently and willingly offered, so that the formnot only constitutes an aspect of the sum total (which has always and inevitablybeen the case, even when unrealised), but the conscious thinking entity knowsthe fact of the unity of consciousness and of the synthesis of life. Thus wehave three things to bear in mind as we read and study:1. The synthesis of life . . . . . . . . . . spirit.2. The unity of consciousness . . . . .soul.3. The integration of forms . . . . . . .body.These three always have been at-one, but the human consciousness has not knownit. It is the realisation of these three factors and their integration into thetechnique of living which is, for man, the objective of his entire evolutionaryexperience.Let us, talking necessarily in symbols, consider the universal Soul, or theconsciousness of the Logos Who brought our universe into being. Let us regardthe Deity as pervading the form of His solar system with life, and as beingconscious of His work, of His project and His goal. This solar system is anappearance, but God remains transcendent. Within all forms God is immanent, yetpersists aloof and withdrawn. Just as a thinking, intelligent human beingfunctions through his body but dwells primarily in his mental consciousness orin his emotional processes, so God dwells withdrawn in His mind nature; theworld that He has created and pervaded with His life, goes forward towards thegoal for which He has [58] created it. Within, however, the radius of Hisappearing form, greater activities are going forward; varying states ofconsciousness and stages of awareness are to be seen; developing degrees ofsentiency emerge, and even in the symbolism of the human form we have suchdiffering states of sentiency as are registered by the hair, by the internalorganisms in the body, by the nervous system, by the brain, and by the entity wecall the self (who registers emotion and thought). In the same way does theDeity, within the solar system, express as wide a divergence of consciousness.There is a body consciousness; there is a sensory apparatus, registeringreaction to the environment; there is a consciousness of moods, of quality, ofmental reactions to a world of ideas; there is a higher consciousness of planand of purpose; there is a consciousness of life.It is interesting to note in connection with the Deity that this sensoryresponse to environment provides the entire basis for astrology and for theeffect of the constellations upon the solar system and the interplanetaryforces.We might sum it all up in relation to man as follows:Man’s form nature reacts in its consciousness to the form nature of Deity. Theouter garment of the soul (physical, vital and psychic) is part of the outergarment of God.Man’s self-conscious soul is en rapport with the soul of all things. It is anintegral part of the universal Soul, and because of this can become aware of theconscious purpose of Deity; can intelligently cooperate with the will of God,and thus work with the plan of Evolution.Man’s spirit is one with the life of God and is within him, deep-seated in hissoul, as his soul is seated within the body.This spirit will in some distant time put him en rapport with that aspect of Godwhich is transcendent, and thus each son of God will eventually find his way tothat centre—withdrawn [59] and abstracted—where God dwells beyond the confinesof the solar system.These are words which are formulated in an endeavour to convey an idea of order,of plan, of universal synthesis, of the integration and incorporation of thefragment in the whole, and of the part with the all.Let us endeavour now to answer the second question, remembering as we proceed,that it is not possible for us to do more than enter symbolically into thepractical purposes of Deity. As I write for simple aspirants, I cannot conveythe truth until such time as their rapport with their own souls is complete, ormore complete than is now the case. The effort, however, to grasp that whichcannot be expressed in words produces a downpouring of the abstract mind or ofthe intuition, and this, in its turn, stimulates and develops the brain cellsand produces a steady stabilisation of the power to stand in “spiritual being”;then it becomes possible to grasp the inexpressible and to live by its power.QUESTION 2. WHAT ARE THE ORIGIN, GOAL, PURPOSE AND PLAN OF THE SOUL?The seven rays are the sum total of the divine Consciousness, of the universalMind; They might be regarded as seven intelligent entities through Whom the planis working out. They embody divine purpose, express the qualities required forthe materialising of that purpose, and They create the forms and are the formsthrough which the divine idea can be carried forward to completion.Symbolically, They may be regarded as constituting the brain of the divineHeavenly Man. They correspond to the ventricles of the brain, to the sevencentres within the brain, to the seven centres of force, and to the seven majorglands which determine the quality of the physical body. They are the consciousexecutors of [60] divine purpose; They are the seven Breaths, animating allforms which have been created by Them to carry out the plan.It may perhaps be easier to understand the relation of the seven rays to Deityif we remember that man himself (being made in the image of God) is a seven-foldbeing, capable of seven states of consciousness, expressive of the sevenprinciples or basic qualities which enable him to be aware of the seven planesupon which he is, consciously or unconsciously, functioning. He is a septenateat all times, but his objective is to be consciously aware of all the states ofbeing, to express consciously all the qualities, and to function freely on allthe planes.The seven ray Beings, unlike man, are fully conscious and entirely aware of thepurpose and the Plan. They are “ever in deep meditation,” and have reached thepoint where, through Their advanced stage of development, They are “impelledtoward fulfillment.” They are fully self-conscious and group-conscious; They arethe sum total of the universal mind; They are “awake and active.” Their goal andTheir purpose is such that it is idle for us to speculate about it, for thehighest point of achievement for man is the lowest point for Them. These sevenRays, Breaths and Heavenly Men have the task of wrestling with matter in orderto subjugate it to divine purpose, and the goal—as far as one can sense it—is tosubject the material forms to the play of the life aspect, thus producing thosequalities which will carry the will of God to completion. They are therefore thesum total of all the souls within the solar system, and Their activity producesall forms; according to the nature of the form so will be the grade ofconsciousness. Through the seven rays, the life or spirit aspect flows, cyclingthrough every kingdom in nature and producing thus all states of consciousnessin all fields of awareness.For the purpose of this treatise students will have to accept [61] thehypothesis that every human being is swept into manifestation on the impulse ofsome ray, and is coloured by that particular ray quality, which determines theform aspect, indicates the way he should go, and enables him (by the time thethird initiation is reached) to have sensed and then to have cooperated with hisray purpose. After the third initiation he begins to sense the synthetic purposetowards which all the seven rays are working; but as this treatise is writtenfor aspirants and disciples, and not for initiates of the third degree, it isneedless to speculate upon this ultimate destiny.The human soul is a synthesis of material energy, qualified by intelligentconsciousness, plus the spiritual energy which is, in its turn, qualified by oneof the seven ray types.Thus the human being emerges, a son of God incarnate in form, with one hand (asthe Old Commentary says) holding firmly to the rock of matter and with the otherhand plunged into a sea of love. An ancient scripture puts it thus:“When the right hand of the man of matter grasps the flower of life and plucksit for himself, the left hand remains in emptiness.“When the right hand of the man of matter grasps the golden lotus of the soul,the left descends seeking the flower of life, though he seeks it not for selfishends.“When the right hand holds the golden lotus firm and the left hand grasps theflower of life, man finds himself to be the seven-leaved plant which flowers onearth and flowers before the Throne of God.”The purpose of Deity, as it is known to the Creator, is totally unknown to allsave the higher initiates. But the purpose of each ray Life may be sensed anddefined, subject of course to the limitations of the human mind and to theinadequacy of words. The planned activity of every ray qualifies every formfound within its body of manifestation.We come now to a technical statement which must be accepted for the sake ofargument, being incapable of proof. [62] All the Lords of the rays create a bodyof expression, and thus the seven planets have come into being. These are theirmajor expressions.The Sun (Veiling Vulcan)JupiterSaturnMercuryVenusMarsThe MoonThe energies of these seven Lives however are not confined to their planetaryexpressions, but sweep around the confines of the solar system just as the lifeimpulses of a human being—his vital forces, his desire impulses, and his mentalenergies—sweep throughout his body, bringing the various organs into activityand enabling him to carry out his intent, to live his life, and to fulfill theobjective for which he created his body of manifestation.Each of the seven kingdoms in nature reacts to the energy of some particular rayLife. Each of the seven planes similarly reacts; each septenate in naturevibrates to one or another of the initial septenates, for the seven raysestablish that process which assigns the limits of influence of all forms. Theyare that which determines all things, and when I use these words I indicate thenecessity of Law. Law is the will of the seven Deities, making its impressionupon substance in order to produce a specific intent through the method of theevolutionary process.A. The Three Rays of Aspect.We shall now express the ray purpose in the form of an ancient teachingpreserved on leaves that are so old that the writing is slowly fading. I nowtranslate it into modern language though much is lost thereby. [63]THE FIRST PURPOSE OF DEITYRay I. Will or Power.Behind the central sacred sun, hidden within its rays, a form is found. Withinthat form there glows a point of power which vibrates not as yet but shines aslight electric.Fierce are its rays. It burns all forms, yet touches not the life of Godincarnate.From the One who is the seven goes forth a word. That word reverberates alongthe line of fiery essence, and when it sounds within the circle of the humanlives it takes the form of affirmation, an uttered fiat or word of power. Thusthere is impressed upon the living mold the thought of ..... (the hidden,inexpressible ray name.)Let dynamic power, electric light, reveal the past, destroy the form that is,and open up the golden door. This door reveals the way which leads towards thecentre where dwells the one whose name cannot be heard within the confines ofour solar sphere.His robe of blue veils his eternal purpose, but in the rising and the settingsun his orb of red is seen.His word is power. His light, electric. The lightning is his symbol. His will ishidden in the counsel of his thought. Nought is revealed.His power is felt. The sons of men, reacting to his power, send to the utmostbounds of light a question:Why this blind power? Why death? Why this decay of forms? Why the negation ofthe power to hold? Why death, Oh Mighty Son of God?Faintly the answer comes: I hold the keys of life and death. I bind and looseagain. I, the Destroyer, am.This ray Lord is not yet in full expression, except as He causes destruction andbrings cycles to an end. The Monads of power are much fewer in number than anyothers. Egos upon the power ray are relatively not so few. They arecharacterised by a dynamic will, and their power within the human family worksout as the force of destruction, but in the last analysis it is a destructionthat will produce liberation. We shall see as we continue to study first rayegos and personalities [64] that death and destruction are always to be found intheir work, and hence the apparent cruelty and impersonality of their reactions.Form does not count with first ray types; their energy produces death to form,but ushers in great periods of cyclic pralaya; the first ray is the controllerof the death drama in all kingdoms—a destruction of forms which brings aboutrelease of power and permits “entrance into Light through the gateway of Death.”The intent of the Lord of the first ray is to stand behind His six Brothers, andwhen They have achieved Their purpose, to shatter the forms which They havebuilt. This He does by passing His power through Their bodies, and Their unitedeffort leads to abstraction and a return to the center whence the initialimpulse came. The first ray purpose therefore is to produce death, and some ideaof that purpose may be gleaned if we study some of the names by which the rayLord is called:The Lord of DeathThe Opener of the DoorThe Liberator from FormThe Great AbstractorThe Fiery Element, producing shatteringThe Crystallizer of the FormThe Power that touches and withdrawsThe Lord of the Burning GroundThe Will that breaks into the GardenThe Ravisher of SoulsThe Finger of GodThe Breath that blastsThe Lightning which annihilatesThe Most HighThe qualities and characteristics of this Lord Who brings release may begathered from the following six aphorisms which, an ancient legend says, His sixBrothers gave to Him, as They begged Him to hold His hand till They had had timeto work out Their purposes: [65]1. Kill out desire when desire has fulfilled its work. Thou art the one whoindicates fulfillment.Quality......clear vision.2. Seek out the gentle way, Oh Lord of Power. Wait for thy brother on the pathof Love. He builds the forms that can withstand thy power.Quality...... dynamic power.3. Withhold the hand until the time has come. Then give the gift of death, OhOpener of the Door.Quality......sense of time.4. Stand not alone, but with the many join thyself. Thou art the One, theIsolated. Come forth unto thine own.Quality...... solitariness.5. Lead thine own forth but learn to know thine own. Hate not attachment but seeits plan and purpose.Quality...... detachment.6. Through thee the life pulsates, the rhythm is imposed. The life is all. Lovelife in all its forms.Quality......singleness of purpose.The six qualities enumerated above express the force of this ray as it makes itspresence felt in the fourth kingdom in nature. The effects in other kingdomsdiffer, but we shall confine our attention to the standpoint of humanity. Thepurpose of the first ray, and its main work, is to produce cessation and thedeath of all forms in all kingdoms in nature and on all planes. The energy ofthis ray Lord brings about the death of an ant or of a solar system, of anorganisation, a religion, or a government, of a race type or of a planet. Hiswill or purpose works out through the law of periodicity.THE SECOND PURPOSE OF DEITYRay II. Love-WisdomThe Word is issuing from the heart of God, emerging from a central point oflove. That Word is love itself. Divine desire colours all that life of love.Within the human hierarchy, the affirmation gathers power and sound.The Word in the beginning was. The Word hath dwelt and dwells with God. In Himwas light. In Him was life. Within His light we walk. [66]His symbol is the thunder, the Word that cycles down the ages.Some of the names of this ray Lord which convey his purpose are as follows:The Displayer of GloryThe Lord of Eternal LoveThe Cosmic MagnetThe Giver of WisdomThe Radiance in the FormThe Master BuilderThe Conferrer of NamesThe Great GeometricianThe One Who hides the LifeThe Cosmic MysteryThe Light BringerThe Son of God IncarnateThe Cosmic ChristThe legend tells us that the six Brothers summarise His qualities in thefollowing aphorisms:1. Send forth the Word and speak the radiant love of God. Make all men hear.Quality......love divine.2. Let the glory of the Lord shine forth. Let there be radiant light as well asradiant love.Quality......radiance.3. Draw to thyself the object of thy search. Pull forth into the light of dayfrom out the night of time the one thou lovest.Quality......attraction.4. When light and love are shewn forth then let the power within produce theperfect flower. Let the word that heals the form go forth. That secret word thatthen must be revealed.Quality......the power to save.5. Salvation, light, and love, with the magnetic power of God, produce the wordof wisdom. Send forth that word, and lead the sons of men from off the path ofknowledge on to the path of understanding.Quality......wisdom. [67]6. Within the radius of the love of God, within the circle of the solar system,all forms, all souls, all lives revolve. Let each son of God enter into thiswisdom. Reveal to each the Oneness of the many lives.Quality......expansion or inclusiveness.The third ray, which is one that has a very long cycle, having been inmanifestation since A.D. 1425, has a direct effect upon the fifth root race, theAryan, and has connected with it a set of curious phrases which express itspurpose.THE THIRD PURPOSE OF DEITYRay III. Active Intelligence or AdaptabilityLet the Warden of the South continue with the building.Let him apply the force Which will produce the shining living stone that fitsinto the temple’s plan with right exactitude. Let him prepare the corner stoneand wisely place it in the north, under the eye of God Himself, and subject tothe balance of the triangle.Let the Researcher of the past uncover the thought of God, hidden deep withinthe mind of the Kumaras of Love, and thus let him lead the Agnishvattas, waitingwithin the place of darkness, into the place of light.Let the Keeper of the sparks breathe with the breath divine upon the points offire, and let him kindle to a blaze that which is hidden, that which is notseen, and so illumine all the spheres whereon God works.I would call attention to the fact that all I can do here is to put into wordscertain ancient symbols, and so emphasize the process (adopted by the earlyinitiate-teachers) of enunciating a word or sound, which produces a symbolicform, which in its turn, is capable of translation into words. These must intheir turn be comprehended intuitively and adapted to individual need, and thusbe assimilated into the life practice. Otherwise these ancient and interestingideas, these interpretative names, and these aphorisms, conveying the “power ofqualities”, are worse than useless and serve but to increase responsibility. Thecapacity to see objective significances and [68] then apply them to life is anexpression of the true esoteric sense. If one studies these tabulations andphrases with care, they will be found to convey indication as to one’sindividual ray, life tendencies and purpose; if the appeal the variousstatements make anent a particular ray evoke an intuitive understanding on thepart of the student, so that he recognises himself, his ray energy and aspectsof his latent and deeply desired spiritual nature, then these communications Iam making here as to Purpose, Name and Quality will be profitable and useful.Some of the names of the Lord of the third ray indicate His use of force and Hisreal nature. They are as follows:The Keeper of the Records.The Lord of MemoryThe Unifier of the lower FourThe Interpreter of That Which is seenThe Lord of BalanceThe Divine SeparatorThe Discriminating Essential LifeThe One Who produces AllianceThe Three-sided TriangleThe Illuminator of the LotusThe Builder of the FoundationThe Forerunner of the LightThe One Who veils and yet revealsThe Dispenser of TimeThe Lord of SpaceThe Universal MindThe Threefold WickThe Great Architect of the Universeand many others terms which indicate relation to light, to time, to space, tothe manifested Logos, to matter and to the “power which evokes the form.”If all these names are studied in connection with modern developments or modernculture and science, it will become apparent how potent and influential in ourday and time is [69] this particular ray Life, and how His energies (havingproduced the tangible objective worlds) are turned to the manifestation of ourmodern civilisation, with its material emphasis, its search as to the nature oftime and space, and that mental unfoldment which it is the glory and the destinyof our particular race to demonstrate.The qualities which characterise this ray Lord might be enumerated in thefollowing phrases. We must bear in mind that the seventh or syntheticcharacteristic of each of the rays is denoted by the ray name and is notspecifically stated in the other six qualities. His six Brothers, Sons of theone Father, chanted these injunctions to Him on the day of His renewed activity(on what we call the day of creation):1. Produce the dual form and veil the life. Let form appear, and prove itselfdivine. All is of God.Quality......the power to manifest.2. Conform the shell to that which dwells within. Let the world egg appear. Letages pass, then let the soul appear. Let life emerge within a destined time.Quality......the power to evolve.3. Let mind control. Let the clear shining of the sun of life reveal the mind ofGod, and set the shining one upon his way. Then lead him to the central pointwhere all is lost within the light supernal.Quality......mental illumination.4. God and His form are one. Reveal this fact, Oh sovereign Lord of form. Godand His form are one. Negate the dual concept. Lend colour to the form. The lifeis one; the harmony complete. Prove thus the two are one.Quality...... the power to produce synthesis on the physical plane.5. Produce the garment of the Lord; set forth the robe of many colours. Thenseparate that robe from That Which hides behind its many folds. Take off theveiling sheaths. Let God be seen. Take Christ from off the cross.Quality......scientific investigation.6. Let the two paths converge. Balance the pairs of opposites [70] and let thepath appear between the two. God and the Path and man are one.Quality......balance.Thus the three major rays sum up in themselves the process of creation, ofenergising, through the urge of the divine will; and the work of the four minorrays (as they are called, though with no idea of there being lesser or greater)is to elaborate or differentiate the qualities of the life, and so produce theinfinite multiplicity of forms which will enable the life to assume its manypoints of focus and express—through the process of evolutionarymanifestation—its diverse characteristics.B. The Four Rays of Attribute.THE FOURTH PURPOSE OF DEITYRay IV. Harmony, Beauty, ArtColour, and yet no colour now is seen. Sound and the soundless One meet in aninfinite point of peace. Time and the timeless One negate the thoughts of men.But time is not.Form is there found, and yet the psychic sense reveals that which the form ispowerless to hide,—the inner synthesis, the all-embracing prism, that point ofunity which—when it is duly reached—reveals a further point where all the threeare one, and not the two alone.Form and its soul are merged. The inner vision watches o’er the fusion, knowsthe divine relation and sees the two as one. But from that point of highattainment, a higher vision blazes forth before the opened inner eye. The threeare one, and not alone the two. Pass on, O pilgrim on the Way.In reading these words, the student must bear in mind that the antechamber hasbeen left behind and man stands (when he has allowed the fourth ray to do itswork and can therefore function on the fourth or buddhic plane) within thetemple of the Lord. He has found a measure of light, but in that light he nowsees light, and visions a greater revelation and brilliance. This now becomesthe object of his search. [71] He has mastered the uses of duality and haslearnt to at-one soul and body into one instrument for spirit. Now he passes onhis way to achieve the greater synthesis.The Lord of the fourth ray has many names which warrant careful study and muchconsideration. In less than a hundred years this Lord of harmonising power willhave more influence and will offset some of the Saturn disruption of the firstdecanate of Aquarius. In the meantime a study of His names will produce asimplification of His efforts and build up a body of constructive thought whichwill facilitate His work when He is again in active manifestation. He is always,however, more or less in power where the human family is concerned, for there isa numerical alliance between the fourth ray, the fourth Creative Hierarchy, orthe human monads, and the fourth kingdom in nature. His power is alwaysconsequently active.The Perceiver on the WayThe Link between the Three and ThreeThe Divine IntermediaryThe Hand of GodThe Hidden OneThe Seed, that is the FlowerThe Mountain whereon Form diesThe Light within the LightThe Corrector of the FormThe One Who marks the parting of the WayThe MasterThe Dweller in the Holy PlaceThe Lower than the Three, the Highest of the FourThe Trumpet of the Lord.The aphorisms connected with this fourth ray are not easy of comprehension. Theyrequire an exercise of the intuition and are conveyed by six short andexcessively brief commands uttered, curiously enough, late in the creativeperiod [72] and at the time when the fourth Creative Hierarchy came intoincarnation:1. Speak low the Word. Speak low.Quality......power to penetrate the depths of matter.2. Champion desire. Give what is needed to the seeker.Quality......the dual aspects of desire.3. Lower the thread. Unfold the Way. Link man with God. Arise.Quality......power to reveal the path.4. All flowers are thine. Settle the roots in mud, the flowers in sun. Prove mudand sun, and roots and flowers are one.Quality......power to express divinity. Growth.5. Roll and return, and roll again. Cycle around the circle of the Heavens.Prove all is one.Quality......the harmony of the spheres.6. Colour the sound. Sound forth the colour. Produce the notes and see them passinto the shades, which in their turn produce the sounds. Thus all are seen asone.Quality......the synthesis of true beauty.This instruction on the rays is of deeper significance than can as yet becomprehended. Careful systematic study and a sane refraining from the forming ofrapid deductions will be the wisest way in which to approach its consideration.It is not possible for me to deal with the definite human psychologicalapplications at this early stage. I am occupied with stating a general outline,with the impartation of ideas, with the grounding of a few basic concepts in theconsciousness of the reader, and with an attempt to clothe this most abstruseand difficult subject in such a form that some new rhythm of thought may be setin motion, and some new realisations be grasped and held. These concern atpresent a prototypal cosmic process, and will lead eventually to anunderstanding of the part an individual may play in a stupendous cosmicwhole.[73] We begin with the universal and end with the particular, which isever the truly occult method.However, all that I am positing about a ray Life may be equally well positedanent a human life, but it should be borne in mind that the pure ray type doesnot as yet exist, for there is not to be found that perfect form, mechanism orexpression of the ray quality, nor that absolutely purified appearance in thehuman family, except in such rare cases as the Buddha, or Christ, and (inanother field of expression) an Alexander or Julius Caesar. Leonardo da Vinciwas an analogous expression. The rays concern energy and consciousness, anddetermine expression, but where the matter utilised and the vehicle informed isas yet imperfectly evolved, there is then limitation and the “tuning out”automatically of much of the energy. The effect of ray force, working throughimperfect forms, must be distorted and curtailed and misapplied. Let meillustrate. I have said that first ray energy works out as the destruction offorms; it must be remembered that a pure destroyer is utterly unknown, andmercifully for the race this is so. It is a beneficent condition that as yet afirst ray ego is so handicapped and limited by the form nature and the qualityof that form nature that it is unable to make adequate or intelligent use of itsdestructive force. First ray personalities are oft destructive, as well youknow, but the energy generated is insufficient to work much harm. Again, purelove is incapable of expression today, its flow being impeded by the formnature. A consideration of these two cases will help the reader to appreciatethe situation. But the time is near at hand wherein there will be a fullerexpression of ray purpose, type or quality, and therefore a truer appearance.This is owing to the imminent appearance, or manifestation, of certain greatLives Who will embody the energy of rays two, three, five and seven. They willthus constitute focal [74] points for the inflow of these four types of divineenergy and, this will produce a tremendous stimulation of their correspondingand responding units of life. These four Beings, Who will appear as human beingsin the field of the modern world, may be looked for before the end of thiscentury and Their united effort will inaugurate definitely the New Age, andusher in the period which will go down in history as the time of glory for thefifth root race. Each of these four Masters, for that They will be, is alsosubjectively the focal point for a triple inflow of energy from the centre inthe Body of God which is symbolically spoken of as “the heart of the Sun.” Foreach ray is in its turn a triple manifesting entity as is the solar DeityHimself. Love will be Their outstanding characteristic, and through thatattractive magnetic force the new forms will come into being which will permitof purer ray types, and thus of more truly expressive appearances. A great dealof the destructive energy extant in the world today is due to the presence onthe astral plane of a first ray disciple of the planetary Logos. His work it isto clear the way for the manifestation of these other four major Disciples, Whoare primarily Builders; They will enter on Their work when the task of thewreckers of form has been accomplished.I should like here to give a suggestion, for it is necessary that some of themethods of the Hierarchy should begin to be understood. The work of what in theWest is called “the Christ Principle” is to build the forms for the expressionof quality and life. That is the characteristic work of the second aspect ofdivinity. The work of the Antichrist is to destroy forms, and this isessentially the work of the first expression of divinity. But the work of thedestroyer is not the work of black magic, and when ignorant humanity regardsAntichrist as working on the black side, their error is great. His work is asbeneficent as that of the building aspect, and it is but man’s [75] hatred ofthe death of forms which makes him regard the work of the destroyer as “black,”as being against the divine will, and as subversive of the divine programme. Thework of the representatives of that mysterious power which we call cosmic evil,and their responding representatives, is indeed worthy of the word “black”; butit is not applicable to the work of Antichrist. It might be added that the workof the black forces wells up from below, whilst the work of the destroyers isimpelled from above. The symbols of these two ways are the sword and the cross.After these preliminary remarks, which are intended to indicate the magnitude ofthe subject, we shall now proceed to an analysis of the three rays which stillremain to be considered.THE FIFTH PURPOSE OF DEITYRay V. Concrete Knowledge or ScienceThe thunders crash around the mountain top; dark clouds conceal the form. Themists, arising from the watery sphere, serve to distort the wondrous...... foundwithin the secret place. The form is there. Its note is sounding forth.A beam of light illuminates the form; the hidden now appears. Knowledge of Godand how He veils Himself finds consummation in the thoughts of man. The energiesand forces receive their secret names, reveal their inner purpose, and all isseen as rhythm, a returning on itself. The great scroll can now be read. God’spurpose and His plans are fixed, and man can read the form.The plan takes form. The plan is form. Its purpose is the revelation of the mindof God. The past reveals the form, but the present indicates the flowing in ofenergy.That which is on its way comes as a cloud which veils the sun. But hid behindthis cloud of immanence is love, and on the earth is love and in the heaven islove, and this,—the love which maketh all things new—must stand revealed. Thisis the purpose back of all the acts of this great Lord of Knowledge.Before enumerating the names of this great Life, I should [76] like to point outthat the fifth ray is one of unique and peculiar potency in relation to thehuman kingdom. The reason is that the fifth plane of mind is the sphere of Hismajor activity and it is on this plane that we find the triple aspects of mind:1. Abstract or higher mind, the embodiment of a higher triad.2. The concrete or lower mind, the highest aspect of the lower self.3. The ego or solar Angel, the pure Son of Mind, Who expresses intelligence,both abstractly and concretely, and is the point of unification.This Life has also much power today in connection with the fifth root-race andwith the transference of the consciousness of humanity into the fifth orspiritual kingdom. Students would learn much if they contrasted the buildingpower of the higher mind with the destroying power of the lower. Just as thepersonality has no other function in the divine plan than to be a channel for,and the medium of expression of, the soul, so the lower mind is intended to bethe channel for the pure inflow of higher mind energy.This fifth ray is a Being of the intensest spiritual light and in Hismanifestation on this fifth plane, which is peculiarly His, He symbolises thethree aspects in a way achieved by no other ray. Through His quality of highermind, this ray is a pure channel for the divine will. Through the septenarygrouping of the solar lives on the mental levels whereon they appear, He broughtinto functioning activity seven corresponding reflections of the seven centresof Deity, as far as our planet is concerned, a thing which none of His sixbrother rays have done. This statement means little to you, but the tremendoussacrifice and effort thus involved are paralleled only by the life of theBuddha, and this is one of the reasons why, [77] in this fifth race, love andmind must eventually and mutually reveal each other.Some of the names given to the Lord of this ray are as follows:The Revealer of TruthThe great ConnectorThe Divine IntermediaryThe Crystallizer of FormsThe Three-fold ThinkerThe Cloud upon the Mountain-topThe Precipitator of the CrossThe Dividing SwordThe Winnower of the ChaffThe Fifth great JudgeThe Rose of GodThe Heavenly OneThe Door into the Mind of GodThe Initiating EnergyThe Ruler of the Third HeavenThe Guardian of the DoorThe Dispenser of KnowledgeThe Angel with the Flaming SwordThe Keeper of the SecretThe Beloved of the LogosThe Brother from SiriusThe Master of the HierophantsThis fifth ray has so many names, owing to His close connection with man (sinceman was originally created), that it has not been easy to choose those which areof the most use in enabling the student to form an idea of the fifth raycharacteristics and mission; but the study of the six aphorisms, and thequalities which they indicate, will show how potent and important is this rayLord. These six aphorisms were chanted by His six Brothers at that momentouscrisis wherein the human family came into existence and the solar Angelssacrificed themselves. Esoterically speaking, they “went down into hell, andfound their place in prison.” On that day souls [78] were born. A new kingdom ofexpression came into being, and the three highest planes and the three lowerwere brought into a scintillating interchange.1. God and His Angels now arise and see. Let the mountaintops emerge from outthe dense wet mist. Let the sun touch their summits and let them stand in light.Shine forth.Quality...... emergence into form and out of form.2. God and His Angels now arise and hear. Let a deep murmur rise and let the cryof seeking man enter into their ears. Let man listen. Let man call. Speak loud.Quality......power to make the Voice of the Silence heard.3. God and His Angels now arise and touch. Bring forth the rod of power. Extendit outward toward the sons of men; touch them with fire, then bring them near.Bring forth.Quality...... initiating activity.4. God and His Angels now arise and taste. Let all experience come. Let all theways appear. Discern and choose; dissect and analyse. All ways are one.Quality......revelation of the way.5. God and His Angels now arise and sense the odor rising from theburning-ground of man. Let the fire do its work. Draw man within the furnace andlet him drop within the rose-red centre the nature that retards. Let the fireburn.Quality......purification with fire.6. God and His Angels now arise and fuse the many in the One. Let the blendingwork proceed. Let that which causes all to be produce the cause of theircessation. Let one temple now emerge. Produce the crowning glory. So let it be.Quality......the manifestation of the great white light. (The Shekinah. A.A.B.)There is much of practical usefulness to the reader in a study of thesequalities. When he believes himself to be upon a particular ray, they willindicate to him some of the characteristics for which he may look, and perhapsdemonstrate [79] to him what he has to do, what he has to express, and what hehas to overcome. These qualities should be studied from two angles: their divineaspect and their reverse aspect or the form side. This ray, for instance, isshown to be the revealer of the way, and it should be remembered therefore thatthis fifth ray reveals the way down into death or into incarnation (which is thedeath-like prison of the soul), or it reveals the way up and out of darknessinto the pure light of God’s day. I mention this as I am exceedingly anxiousthat all who read this treatise should make application of this teaching totheir daily lives. I am not interested in imparting weird or unusual items ofinformation anent these matters for the delectation of an unhealthy mentalappetite. The stocking of the memory with occult detail which serves no usefulpurpose only strains the brain cells and feeds the pride.THE SIXTH PURPOSE OF DEITYRay VI. Devotion or IdealismThis ray which is just going out of manifestation, is of vital interest to us,for it has set its mark upon our western civilisation in a more definite waythan any of the others. It is for us the most familiar and the best known of therays. The mantram which defines its purpose is unlike the others and might beexpressed somewhat as follows:The Crusade is on. The warriors march upon their way. They crush and kill allthat impedes their way, and aught that rises on their onward path is trampledunder foot. March towards the light.The work goes forward. The workers veil their eyes from pity as from fear. Thework is all that counts. The form must disappear so that the loving spirit mayenter into rest. Naught must arrest the progress of the workers with the plan.They enter upon the work assigned with paean and with song.The cross is reared on high; the form is laid thereon, and [80] on that crossmust render up its life. Each builds a cross which forms the cross. They mountupon the cross.Through war, through work, through pain and toil, the purpose is achieved. Thussaith the symbol.It will be noted how this purpose, when applied by man to himself, works hisrelease. When applied by man to man, it has produced the corrupt and awful storyof man’s cruelty to man. In the above mantram you will find the clue to thesixth ray purpose as it appears in the human kingdom, and a close expansivestudy (note that paradoxical phrase) of the underlying ideas will reveal alittle of the larger purpose. The soul is and should be pitiless to its form andits problem. The soul can, however, comprehend the need for pain and difficultyin the world, for he can extend a knowledge of his own technique with himself tothe technique of God with His world; but he does nothing knowingly that couldpossibly increase the world’s pain or sorrow.Some of the names for this beneficent yet somewhat violently energised Lord of aray are as follows:The Negator of DesireThe One Who sees the RightThe Visioner of RealityThe Divine RobberThe Devotee of LifeThe Hater of FormsThe Warrior on the MarchThe Sword Bearer of the LogosThe Upholder of the TruthThe Crucifier and the CrucifiedThe Breaker of StonesThe Imperishable Flaming OneThe One Whom Naught can turnThe Implacable RulerThe General on the Perfect WayThe One Who leads the TwelveCuriously enough, this sixth ray Lord has always been a [81] loved enigma to Hissix Brethren. This comes out in the questions which They addressed to Him on oneoccasion when They met “under the eye of the Lord” to interchange Their plansfor united, divine, harmonious action. They asked these questions in a spirit ofheavenly joy and love, but with the intent to throw some light upon the somewhatobscure quality of Their loved Brother.1. Why is desire red? Why red as blood? Tell us, Oh Son of God, why thy way isred with blood?Quality......power to kill out desire.2. Why do you turn your back upon the sphere of earth? Is it too small, toopoor? Why kick it as a ball upon a playing field?Quality...... spurning that which is not desired.3. Why set the cross from earth to heaven? But earth can be a heaven. Why mountthe cross and die?Quality......self-immolation.4. Why battle thus with all that is around? Seek you not peace? Why standbetween the forces of the night and day? Why thus unmoved and calm, untired andunafraid?Quality..... endurance and fearlessness.5. See you not God in all, the life in all, and love in all? Why separateyourself and leave behind the loved and the well-known?Quality......power to detach oneself.6. Can you arrest the waters of the sixth great sphere? Can you stem the flood?Can you recover both the raven and the dove? Can you, the Fish, swim free?Quality......overcoming the waters of the emotional nature.This out-going ray of devotion to the ideal, and the incoming ray of magicalorder or organisation are largely responsible for the type of man’sconsciousness today. Man is essentially devoted (to the point of fanaticism) towhatever may be the goal of his life’s attention. This goal may be to achievediscipleship, or to raise a family, or to get money, or to achieve [82]popularity, or any other objective to which he consecrates his time and energy;but whatever it may be, to it he devotes all that he is or has. Man also isessentially and inherently a producer of law and order, though this quality isonly just beginning to make its presence felt. This is because mankind is, atlast, becoming mentally centred, and hence we have in the world at this time themany and varied attempts to straighten out affairs along business, national,economic, social and other lines, to produce some system and order, and to bringabout the re-arranging of all energies with the objective (unrealisedconsciously as yet) of inaugurating the New Age. Owing, however, to defectivemental control and to an almost universal ignorance as to the laws of thought,and in addition, to a profound lack of knowledge as to man’s own nature, manworks blindly. The ideals sensed are not correctly interpreted by the mind norapplied in such a way that they are of general and appropriate application.Hence the confusion and the chaotic experimentation going on, and hence also theimposition of personal authority to enforce an individual’s idea of the ideal.The need today is for sound teaching as to the laws of thought, and the ruleswhich govern the building of those thought-forms which must embody the ideassent forth from the universal divine Mind. Men must begin on the subjectiveplanes of life to work out the needed order. When this is realised, we shallhave every important group of men engaged in world affairs, or in the work ofgovernment in all its branches, aided on the mental plane by trained thinkers,so that there may be right application and correct adjustment to the Plan. Thistime is as yet far away, and hence the distortions and misrepresentations onearth of the Plan as it exists in heaven, to use the Christian phraseology.It was the realisation of the present world need for illumined [83] thinkers andsubjective workers which prompted Those Who guide so to direct the incomingspiritual energies that the formation of the esoteric groups everywhere cameabout; it led also to the publication of the mass of mystical and Orientalliterature on meditation and allied topics which has flooded the world today.Hence also the effort that I, a worker on the inner side of life, am making toteach the newer psychology in this treatise, and so show to man what is hisequipment and how well suited he is to the work for which he has been created,and which he has as yet failed to comprehend. The force and the effect of theseventh ray influence will, however, reveal to him the magical work, and thenext twenty five hundred years will bring about so much change and make possiblethe working of so many so-called “miracles” that even the outer appearance ofthe world will be profoundly altered; the vegetation and the animal life will bemodified and developed, and much that is latent in the forms of both kingdomswill be brought into expression through the freer flow and the more intelligentmanipulation of the energies which create and constitute all forms. The worldhas been changed beyond belief during the past five hundred years, and duringthe next two hundred years the changes will be still more rapid and deep-seated,for the growth of the intellectual powers of man is gathering momentum, and Man,the Creator, is coming into possession of His powers.THE SEVENTH PURPOSE OF DEITYRay VII. Ceremonial Order or Magic“Let the Temple of the Lord be built”, the seventh great Angel cried. Then totheir places in the north, the south, the west and east, seven great sons of Godmoved with measured pace and took their seats. The work of building thus began.The doors were closed. The light shone dim. The temple walls could not be seen.The seven were silent and their forms were veiled. The time had not arrived forthe breaking [84] forth of light. The Word could not be uttered. Only betweenthe seven Forms the work went on. A silent call went forth from each to each.Yet still the temple door stayed shut.As time went on, the sounds of life were heard. The door was opened, and thedoor was shut. Each time it opened, the power within the temple grew; each timethe light waxed stronger, for one by one the sons of men entered the temple,passed from north to south, from west to east and in the centre of the heartfound light, found understanding and the power to work. They entered through thedoor; they passed before the Seven; they raised the temple’s veil and enteredinto life.The temple grew in beauty. Its lines, its walls, its decorations, and its heightand depth and breadth slowly emerged and entered into light.Out from the east, the Word went forth: Open the door to all the sons of men whocome from all the darkened valleys of the land and seek the temple of the Lord.Give them the light. Unveil the inner shrine, and through the work of all thecraftsmen of the Lord extend the temple’s walls and thus irradiate the world.Sound forth the Word creative and raise the dead to life.Thus shall the temple of the light be carried from heaven to earth. Thus shallits walls be reared upon the great plains of the world of men. Thus shall thelight reveal and nurture all the dreams of men.Then shall the Master in the east awaken those who are asleep. Then shall thewarden in the west test and try all the true seekers after light. Then shall thewarden in the south instruct and aid the blind. Then shall the gate into thenorth remain wide open, for there the unseen Master stands with welcoming handand understanding heart, to lead the pilgrims to the east where the true lightshines forth.“Why this opening of the temple?” demand the greater Seven. “Because the work isready; the craftsmen are prepared. God has created in the light. His sons cannow create. What can else be done?”“Naught!” came the answer from the greater Seven. “Let the work proceed. Let thesons of God create.”These words will be noted by many as of deep significance and as indicating awide intention (during the coming cycle) [85] to open the door wide into thetemple of the hidden mystery to man. One by one we shall undergo the esotericand spiritual counterpart of the psychological factor which is called “a mentaltest.” That test will demonstrate a man’s usefulness in mental work and power,it will show his capacity to build thought-forms and to vitalise them. This Idealt with in A Treatise on White Magic , and the relation of that treatise tothe magical work of the seventh ray and its cycle of activity will becomeincreasingly apparent. A Treatise on White Magic is an attempt to lay down therules for training and for work which will make it possible for the candidate tothe mysteries to enter the temple and to take his place as a creative worker andthus aid in the magical work of the Lord of the Temple.The names whereby this ray Lord is known are many, and their meaning is of primesignificance today. The work of the future can be seen from a study of thesenames.The Unveiled MagicianThe Worker in the Magical ArtThe Creator of the FormThe Bestower of Light from the Second LordThe Manipulator of the WandThe Watcher in the EastThe Custodian of the Seventh PlanThe Invoker of WrathThe Keeper of the Magical WordThe Temple GuardianThe Representative of GodThe One Who lifts to LifeThe Lord of DeathThe One Who feeds the Sacred FireThe Whirling SphereThe Sword of the InitiatorThe Divine Alchemical WorkerThe Builder of the SquareThe Orienting ForceThe Fiery Unifier [86]The Key to the MysteryThe Expression of the WillThe Revealer of BeautyThis ray Lord has a peculiar power on earth and on the physical plane of divinemanifestation. His usefulness to His six Brothers is therefore apparent. Hemakes Their work appear. He is the most active of all the rays in this worldperiod, and is never out of manifestation for more than fifteen hundred years.It is almost as if He whirled in and out of active work under a very rapidcycle, and His closest relation, symbolically, is to His Brethren of the secondand fifth rays in this world period .He builds (using second ray cooperation) through the power of thought (thuscooperating with the Lord of the fifth ray and on the physical plane, which isHis own essential and peculiar sphere). In another world period His relationwith the other ray Lords may undergo change, but at this time His work will bemore easily understood when He is recognised as aiding the building Lord of thesecond ray and utilising the energies of the Lord of concrete thought.The aphorisms embodying His qualities run as follows, and were esotericallywhispered into His ears when He “left the most high place and descended into theseventh sphere to carry out the work assigned.”1. Take thy tools with thee, brother of the building light. Carve deep.Construct and shape the living stone.Quality......power to create.2. Choose well thy workers. Love them all. Pick six to do thy will. Remain theseventh in the east. Yet call the world to enter into that which thou shaltbuild. Blend all together in the will of God.Quality......power to cooperate.3. Sit in the centre and the east as well. Move not from there.[87] Send out thyforce to do thy will and gather back thy forces. Use well the power of thought.Sit still.Quality...... power to think.4. See all parts enter into the purpose. Build towards beauty, brother Lord.Make all colours bright and clear. See to the inner glory. Build the shrinewell. Use care.Quality......revelation of the beauty of God.5. Watch well thy thought. Enter at will into the mind of God. Pluck thence thepower, the plan, the part to play. Reveal the mind of God.Quality......mental power.6. Stay in the east. The five have given thee a friendly Word. I, the sixth,tell thee to use it on the dead. Revive the dead. Build forms anew. Guard wellthat Word. Make all men seek it for themselves.Quality......power to vivify.Thus we have studied a little the work of the seven rays. The teaching has hadto be conveyed symbolically and its understanding necessitates an awakenedesoteric sense; to comprehend it all is not as yet possible.The Chohans of the sixth initiation have the guidance of those units ofconsciousness in whom their particular ray vibration and colour predominate. Thevast importance of this fact is often overlooked, even when theoreticallyacknowledged by aspirants to initiation. Hence the importance of determining theray of the ego and of the Monad,—something of vital moment after the thirdinitiation. A majority and a minority always exist in every department of life.So it is in the work of the Logos, for at the end of the greater cycle(manvantara) the majority will find their way to the synthetic love ray; a smallminority will find their way to the power ray. This minority are destined for animportant function. They will constitute the nucleus which (in the next solarsystem) will constitute the majority, finding their synthesis on ray one. Thisis a great mystery and not easily understood. [88] Some hint towards itssolution will be found hidden in the real meaning of the words “exoteric” and“esoteric.”The fact should be remembered that only five rays dominate at any one time. Allmanifest, but only five dominate. A distinction should be made between the raysdominating in a solar system and those dominating in a scheme, or a chain. Tothis reference has been made in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire . Three rays out ofthe seven synthesise. One ray out of the three will synthesise at theculmination. For the first solar system the third ray was the synthetic ray, butfor this solar system the second ray is the synthetic ray, and for the nextsolar system the first ray will perform a similar function.Two rays are largely the goal of human endeavour, the first ray and the secondray. One ray is the goal of the deva or angel evolution, the third ray. Allthese three rays contact the two poles, and the attainment of the goal at theend of the cycle marks the achievement of the solar Logos. This again is hiddenin mystery. The seventh ray and the first ray are very closely allied, with thethird ray linking them, so that we have the relation expressed thus,— 1. 3. 7.There is a close association also between rays 2. 4. 6., with the fifth ray in apeculiar position, as a central point of attainment, the home of the ego orsoul, the embodied plane of mind, the point of consummation for the personality,and the reflection in the three worlds of the threefold monad.Ray I Will, demonstrating as power in the unfolding of the Plan of the Logos.Ray III. Adaptability of activity with intelligence. This ray was the dominantone in the past solar system; it is the foundation or basis of this system, andis controlled by the Mahachohan. Ray VII Ceremonial ritual or organisation. Thisis the reflection on the physical plane of the two above, and is likewiseconnected with the Mahachohan. It controls the elemental forces and theinvolutionary process and the form side of the three kingdoms in nature. Itholds hid the secret of physical colour and sound. It is the law.[89] These three rays together embrace and embody all. They are Power, Activityand the Law in manifestation.Ray II Love and Wisdom, the synthetic ray which is the goal for this system,holding all in close harmony and relation. Ray IV The expression of Harmony,beauty, music and unity. Ray VI The ray of Devotion to the ardour of aspiration,and of the sacrifice of the personal self for the good of all, with the objectin view of harmony and beauty, impelled thereto by loveThese two groups of rays might be related to each other as follows:Rays 1. 3. 7 are the great rays connected with the form, with the evolutionaryprocess, with the intelligent functioning of the system, and with the lawscontrolling the life in all forms in all the kingdoms in nature. Rays 2. 4. 6are the rays connected with the inner life, expanding through those forms,—therays of motive, aspiration and sacrifice. Rays pre-eminently of quality. Rays 1.3. 7 deal with things concrete and with the functioning of matter and form fromthe lowest plane to the highest. Rays 2. 4. 6 deal with things abstract, withspiritual expression through the medium of form. Ray 5 forms the connecting linkof the intelligence.Our third question comes up now for consideration and is as follows:QUESTION 3. CAN THE FACT OF THE SOUL BE PROVED?The soul has been satisfactorily disproved from the standpoint of academicscience. For ages the search has gone on, [90] with the objective of thesearch—scientifically speaking— being laid on the demonstration of the locationof the soul in the human bodv. That has been the emphasis and the importantfactor to the scientific mind, which is so different to that of its moremystically inclined brother.All research, especially that carried on lately in connection with the modernmaterialistic schools and with the fuller understanding of the mechanism of thehuman body, has tended to prove that the soul is a superstition, a defensemechanism, and that conscious thought with all the higher manifestations of thehuman mind (and hence also the lower expressions of personality, selfhood andconscious integration) can well be provided for and accounted for by man’spresent equipment of brain, nervous system and the endocrine system. All thesein their turn are understood to be the result of a long evolutionary andselective process. The wonder of the machine itself is divine in its completionand in its scope. From a primeval germ, developing under the pressure ofnature’s laws, and of environing conditions plus a consistent adaptation torequirements and a most careful selection, man has developed; he now possesses amechanism which is responsive to the natural world, to sensation and to thought.That which is called the soul is regarded frequently as the result of thisselective process and as constituting the sum total of the responsive anddiscriminating powers of the cells and organs of the body, plus the lifeprinciple. All, we are told, is inherent in the parental germ, and theconditions of the environment, added to heredity and education, are sufficientto account for the phenomena of the human consciousness. Man is a machine, apart of a still greater machine which we call nature, and both man and natureare run on immutable laws. There is no free will except within certain clearlydefined limits, which are defined by equipment and by circumstance. [91] Therecan be no immortality, for when the machine breaks down and disintegrates thereis nothing left but the dissociated cells and atoms of which it was originallycomposed. When the principle of coherence or of integration ceases to function,that which it produced—the coherent functioning body—likewise ceases tofunction. Consciousness and choice, awareness and affection, thought andtemperament, life and love, character and capacities—all disappear, and there isnothing left but the atoms of which the body had been composed. These in theirturn are dissipated and disappear, and all has finally been reabsorbed into thegeneral reservoir of forces and atoms.Of the countless millions of human beings who have lived and loved, suffered andrejoiced upon our planet, what is left today to guarantee to us their existencein the past, not to speak of their continuing existence in the present? A fewbones, a few buildings, and, later, traces of their historical influence; laterstill, we note what they have left behind of beauty in the field of literature,of architecture, of painting, and in those forms in which they have embodiedtheir thought and aspiration, their visions and their ideals. On the planettoday we find a humanity at all stages of development, with mechanisms ofvarying kinds, adequate and inadequate. We find all of them, without exception,breaking down under test and limited by disease, or hiding the seeds of disease;the perfect equipment is totally unknown, and every man harbors the germs oftrouble. No man possesses a perfect mechanism, but owns one that must inevitablybreak down at some point that is conditioned by an under-developed orover-developed glandular system, that hides at some point inherited disease andracial weaknesses, and that fails somewhere, in some portion of the mechanism,to meet the needs (physical, emotional, and mental) of the day and hour. Of whatdoes this speak? Of the sum total of the united cell life; of the environing[92] group in which a particular form finds itself; of the life, impersonal andabstract in nature, which pervades it; of a vague group spirit that isexpressing itself through the fourth kingdom in nature; of a temporary andimpermanent self; or of an immortal entity who is the dweller in the body?Such are some of the questions which arise today; and in the last analysis,belief in the soul can be posited as being largely a matter of temperament, ofthe wish and desire of the ages wherein man struggled and suffered and relievedthe strain of living by constructing a body of thought around a happy immortalbeing, who was to be free, eventually and finally, from all the difficulties ofphysical existence. The soul can be regarded as a beautiful vision or as anhallucination, for all that tends to prove its existence is the testimony of themany mystics down the ages to a contact and an experience which can be accountedfor in terms of dream life, of brain lesions or of escape reactions, but whichrests on no sure foundation. So say the materialists and the upholders of provenscientific facts. Belief, verbal testimony, hope, curious and inexplicablepsychic happenings, the mass of untrained opinion and the findings of visionarypeople (who were probably psychopathic cases) are not enough to prove the factof the soul. They prove only man’s power to imagine, to build images andpictures, and to lose himself and his dreadful present in a dream world of apossible and ardently desired future in which frustration will end, in whichfull expression will be achieved, and in which each man will enter into animpossible heritage which he has himself constructed out of the unrealised hopesand dim unuttered longings of his deeply hidden thought life. Belief in God andHeaven and in an immortal future have grown out of the ancient awe and ignorantterror of infant humanity. They saw in all the phenomena of nature(incomprehensible and terrifying) the [93] activity of a gigantic man, built onlines which were the projection of their own consciousness, and who could bepropitiated or angered by the behaviour of a human being. The result of a man’seffect upon this deity provided man’s destiny, which was either good or badaccording to the reactions of this God to his deeds. Thus we have the origin ofthe heaven or hell complexes of the present religious faiths. From this grew,automatically, the idea of a persistent entity called the soul, which couldenjoy heaven or suffer hell at the will of God and as the result of actions donewhilst in the human form. As the forms of man grew in sensitivity; as theybecame more and more refined under the influence of the law of selection and ofadaptation; as the group life grew closer and the group integration wasimproved; as the heritage of history, of tradition and of the arts grew richerand made its impress, so that ideas of God grew, and likewise ideas of the souland of the world, man’s concepts of reality grew richer and deeper, so thattoday we are faced with the problem of a thought inheritance which testifies toa world of concepts, ideas and intuitions which deal with the immaterial and theintangible, and which testify to an age-long belief in a soul and itsimmortality for which there is no true justification. At the same time we havedemonstrated to us by science that all we can really know with certainty is thetangible world of phenomena, with its forms, its mechanisms, its test tubes andits laboratories, and the bodies of men “fearfully and wonderfully made,”diverse and different. These in some mysterious way produce thoughts and dreamsand imaginings, and which, in their turn, find expression in the formulatedschemes of the past, the present and the future, or in the fields of literature,art and of science itself, or in the simple everyday life of the ordinary humanbeing who lives and loves and works and plays and bears children and eats foodand earns money and sleeps.[94] And then what? Does man disappear into nothingness, or does, somewhere, apart of him (hitherto unseen) live on? Does this aspect survive for a time andthen in its turn disappear, or is there an immortal principle, a subtleintangible entity which has an existence either in the body or out of the body,and which is the undying immutable Being, belief in Whom has sustained countlessmillions down the ages? Is the soul a fiction of the imagination and has sciencesatisfactorily disproved its existence? Is consciousness a function of the brainand of the allied nervous system, or shall we accept the idea of a consciousdweller in the form? Does our power to become aware of and to react to oursurroundings find its source in the body-nature, or is there an entity whobeholds and takes action? Is this entity different to and separable from thebody, or is it the result of the body type and life, and so either persistsafter the body disappears, or disappears with it and is lost? Is there nothingbut matter or energies in constant movement which produce the appearances of menwho react in their turn and express the energy that is pouring through themblindly and unconsciously, having no individual existence? Or are all thesetheories partially true, and shall we really comprehend the nature and being ofman only in the synthesis of all of them and in the acceptance of the generalpremises? Is it not possible that the mechanically minded and scientificinvestigators are right in their conclusion anent the mechanism and the formnature, and that the spiritually minded thinkers who posit an immortal entityare also right? As yet perhaps something is lacking which would bridge the gapbetween the two positions. Is it possible that we may discover a something whichwill link the intangible world of true being with the tangible world (so-called)of form life?When humanity is assured of divinity and of immortality, and has entered into astate of knowledge as to the nature of [95] the soul and of the kingdom in whichthat soul functions, its attitude to daily life and to current affairs willundergo such a transformation that we shall verily and indeed see the emergenceof a new heaven and a new earth. Once the central entity within each human formis recognised and known for what it essentially is, and once its divinepersistence is established, then we shall necessarily see the beginning of thereign of divine law on earth—a law imposed without friction and withoutrebellion. This beneficent reaction will come about because the thinkers of therace will be blended together in a general soul awareness, and a consequentgroup consciousness will permit them to see the purpose underlying the workingof the law.Let us put this a little more simply. We are told in the New Testament that wemust endeavour to let the mind which was in Christ also be manifest in us. Weare working towards the perfecting of the rule of Christ on earth; we are aimingat the development of the Christ consciousness and at the bringing in of therule or law of Christ, which is Love. This will come to fruition in the AquarianAge, and we shall see brotherhood established on earth. The rule of Christ isthe dominance of the basic spiritual laws. The mind of Christ is a phraseconveying the concept of the rule of divine intelligent love, which stimulatesthe rule of the soul within all forms, and brings in the reign of the Spirit. Itis not easy to express the nature of the revelation which is on the way. Itinvolves the recognition by men everywhere that the “mind-stuff,” as the Hinduscall it, to which their own minds are related and of which their mental bodiesare an integral part, is also part of the mind of Christ, the cosmic Christ, ofWhom the historical Christ is—upon our planet—the ordained representative. Whenmen, through meditation and group service, have developed an awareness of theirown controlled and illumined minds, they [96] will find themselves initiatedinto a consciousness of true being and into a state of knowledge which willprove to them the fact of the soul, beyond all doubt or questioning.The Mystery of the Ages is on the verge of revelation, and through therevelation of the soul that mystery which it veils will stand revealed. Thescriptures of the world, we know, have ever prophesied that at the end of theage we shall see the revelation of that which is secret, and the emergence intothe light of day of that which has hitherto been concealed and veiled. This, ourpresent cycle, is the end of the age, and the next two hundred years will seethe abolition of death, as we now understand that great transition, and theestablishing of the fact of the soul’s existence. The soul will be known as anentity, as the motivating impulse and the spiritual centre back of allmanifested forms. The next few decades will see certain great beliefssubstantiated. The work of Christ, and His main mission two thousand years ago,was to demonstrate the divine possibilities and powers latent in every humanbeing. The proclamation which He made to the effect that we were all sons of Godand own one universal Father will, in the future, no longer be regarded as abeautiful, mystical and symbolic statement, but will be regarded as a scientificpronouncement. Our universal brotherhood and our essential immortality will bedemonstrated and realised to be facts in nature. He came, He said, not to bringpeace but a sword, and esoterically, He has been the “Cosmic Divider.” Why?Because, in establishing unity, He also makes a distinction between body andsoul. Body and soul are, however, only two parts of one whole, and this must notbe forgotten. In establishing the fact of the soul and its expression, the body,the totality emerges in completeness.How will this revelation come? We enter here into the realm of foretelling andof prevision to which many have an [97] objection on the ground that the thingof the moment is that which aids the soul’s spiritual living; they feel that theholding out of promises of future help and revelation, and the encouragement inthe aspirant of a happy speculation and an idle expectancy carry the seeds ofdanger, of static inertia, and of idle imaginings. But “where there is novision, the people perish,” and so much has happened during the last two hundredyears, and so much has already been revealed, that we are provided with a firmbasis for all our forward looking. Had the unfoldments of the nineteenth andtwentieth centuries, in the departments of science and psychology alone, beenforecast to the thinkers of the world in the sixteenth century, how strange andimpossible it would all have seemed to them! Stranger than anything I might hereprophecy to you, for we have already seen so much occur, and the testimony tothe world of true being is accumulating so fast, that we can no longer standamazed at any occurrence.The fact of the soul will be brought to the racial recognition in many ways, andthe revelation will come along so many lines that all types of minds will besatisfied. I shall indicate only a few.The psychics of the world are increasing greatly in number, and the growingsensitivity of the race to impression is a cause of rejoicing and of danger. Allover the world aspirants are registering contacts hitherto unknown, are seeing aphenomenal world usually hidden to them, and are generally becoming aware of anexpansion of consciousness. They are registering a world of phenomena—oftenastral, sometimes mental, and occasionally egoic—which does initiate them into anew dimension of consciousness and into a different state of being. Thisexpansion of consciousness serves both to encourage them in their endeavour andto complicate the way of the aspirant. This growing sensitivity is universal;hence the [98] rapid growth of spiritualism and of the psychic sciences, andhence also the increase among men of nervous tension, of neurotic conditions,and of the greatly increased problems of the psychiatrist; hence also the spreadof new nervous and mental diseases. This sensitivity is the response of themechanism of man to the approaching developments, and the race as a whole isbeing brought into a condition wherein it will be ready to “see and hear” thatwhich has been up to the present unrevealed.The growth of the colour sense and the capacity to respond musically to quartertones and subtle nuances indicate a thinning of the veil which separates theworld of external and tangible phenomena from that of subjective being and ofmore subtle matter. The growth also of etheric vision and the largely increasednumbers of clairvoyant and clairaudient people are steadily revealing theexistence of the astral plane and the etheric counterpart of the physical world.More and more people are becoming aware of this subjective realm; they seepeople walking around who are either the so-called “dead,” or who in sleep havedropped the physical sheath. They become aware of colours and distinctive huesand streams of organised light which are not of this physical world; they hearsounds and voices which emanate from those who are not using the physical vocalapparatus, and from forms of existence which are not corporeal.The first step towards substantiating the fact of the soul is to establish thefact of survival, though this may not necessarily prove the fact of immortality.It can nevertheless be regarded as a step in the right direction. That somethingsurvives the process of death, and that something persists after thedisintegration of the physical body, is steadily being proved. If that is notso, then we are the victims of a collective hallucination, and the brains andminds of thousands [99] of people are untrue and deceiving, are diseased anddistorted. Such a gigantic collective insanity is more difficult to credit thanthe alternative of an expanded consciousness. This development along psychiclines does not prove the fact of the soul, however; it only serves to break downthe materialistic position.It is among the thinkers of the race that the first assured recognition of thesoul will come, and this event will be the result of the study and analysis, bythe psychologists of the world, of the nature of genius and the significance ofcreative work.Some men and women in the world tower above their fellow men, and produce thatwhich is superlative in its own field; their work has in it the element ofdivinity and of immortality. The work of creative artists, the intuitiveperception of great scientific investigators, the inspired imagination of thepoets of the world and the vision of the illumined idealists, have all to beaccounted for and explained, for the laws under which such men and women workhave yet to be discovered. The close study, by the psychologist, of the abnormaland the subnormal, of warped and distorted minds and of defective equipments,has been over-emphasized, and due attention has not been given to the divinelyabnormal, and to those types of consciousness which transcend the ordinary humanstate of intelligent awareness. These latter super-normal states find expressionthrough the medium of the great artists, musicians, dramatists, writers, and themany other types of creative workers who have been the glory of the humankingdom down the ages, and who will flame forth during the coming century withgreater glory still.When the hypothesis of the soul is accepted, when the nature of the spiritualenergy which flows through the soul is admitted, and when the mechanism of theforce centres is [100] studied, we shall make rapid progress towards knowledge.When, through meditation, experiment is made to produce creatively some of thebeauty contacted, some of the ideas revealed and some of the patterns seen, weshall learn to cultivate genius and understand how to train people to workcreatively. Then much will be discovered about the centres in man where thedivine principle has its dwelling, and from which the Christ within can work.The study of the super-conscious must be undertaken, and not simply the study ofthe self-conscious or of the sub-conscious. Through this study, carried forwardwith an open mind, modern psychology will eventually arrive at a recognition ofthe soul.The range of investigation is so wide that I can only indicate some of thepossible fields of research:1. The investigation of the nature of genius, and its definite and specialisedcultivation.2. Training in creative work and a study of the difference between this kind oftraining and training for vocational work. Creative work proves the fact of thesoul; vocational training demonstrates the type of the personality.3. Scientific investigation of the powers in man, with particular attention totelepathy. It will be found that telepathic work is from mind to mind, or fromsoul to mind, and does not necessarily imply brain to brain communication andcontact. This is one of the most promising fields of investigation, though itstill presents much difficulty. The fact of the existence of the soul will notbe proved through the medium of telepathy until after the year 1945. By thattime an event will have happened in the world and a particular new teaching willhave been given which will put the entire subject of telepathic phenomena in anew light.4. The scientific training of clairvoyants and the intelligent development ofclairvoyant powers by the intelligentsia of [101] the world leaves as yet muchto be desired, but it will come as the result of mind control and illumination.Men will learn to subject the mechanism of the body to a downflow of spiritualenergy and stimulation, and thus will bring the powers of the psychic natureinto activity, and the old method of sitting for development in order to awakenthe centres will be seen as dangerous and unnecessary.In the field of modern psychology we can look for a gradual recognition of thefact of the self. The problem of the psychologists is to comprehend therelationship or the identity of that self with the soul.It is, however, from the field of science that the greatest help will come. Thefact of the soul will eventually be proved through the study of light and ofradiation and through a coming evolution in particles of light. Through thisimminent development we shall find ourselves seeing more and penetrating deeperinto that which we see today. One of the recognised facts in the realm ofnatural science has been the cyclic change in the fauna and flora of our planet.Animals, plentiful and familiar many thousands of years ago, are now extinct,and by means of their bones we endeavour to reconstruct their forms. Flowers andtrees that once covered the surface of our planet have now entirely disappearedand only their fossilized remains are left to indicate to us a vegetation vastlydifferent to that which we now enjoy. Man himself has changed so much that wefind it difficult to recognise homo sapiens in the early primitive races of thefar distant past. This mutability and obliteration of earlier types is due to amajor factor among many. The quality of the light which promotes and nurturesgrowth, vitality and fertility in the kingdoms of nature has changed severaltimes during the ages, and as it has changed it has produced correspondingmutations in the phenomenal world. From the standpoint of the esotericist, all[102] forms of life on our planet are affected by three types of lightsubstance, and at the present time a fourth type is gradually making itspresence felt. These types of light are:1. The light of the sun.2. The light in the planet itself—not the reflected light of the sun but its owninherent radiance.3. A light seeping in (if I may use such a phrase) from the astral plane, asteady and gradual penetration of the “astral light” and its fusion with theother two types of radiance.4. A light which is beginning to merge itself with the other three types andwhich comes from that state of matter which we call the mental plane—a light inits turn reflected from the realm of the soul.An intensification of the light is going on all the time, and this increase inintensity began on the earth at about the time when man discovered the uses ofelectricity, which discovery was a direct result of this intensification. Theelectrification of the planet through the wide-spread use of electricity is oneof the things which is inaugurating the new age, and which will aid in bringingabout the revelation of the presence of the soul. Before long thisintensification will become so great that it will materially assist in therending of the veil which separates the astral plane from the physical plane;the dividing etheric web will shortly be dissipated, and this will permit a morerapid inflow of the third aspect of light. The light from the astral plane (astarry radiance) and the light of the planet itself will be more closelyblended, and the result upon humanity and upon the three other kingdoms innature cannot be over-emphasized. It will, for one thing, profoundly affect thehuman eye and make the present sporadic etheric vision a universal asset. Itwill bring within the radius of our range of [103] contact the infra-red andultra-violet gamut of colours, and we shall see what at present is hidden. Allthis will tend to destroy the platform upon which the materialists stand, and topave the way, first, for the admission of the soul as a sound hypothesis, andsecondly, for the demonstration of its existence. We only need more light, inthe esoteric sense, in order to see the soul, and that light will shortly beavailable and we shall understand the meaning of the words, “And in Thy lightshall we see light.”This intensification of the light will continue until A.D. 2025, when there willcome a cycle of relative stability and of steady shining without muchaugmentation. In the second decanate of Aquarius these three aspects will againbe augmented by increased light from the fourth aspect, that is the light fromthe soul realm, reaching us via the universal “chitta” or mind stuff. This willflood the world. By that time, however, the soul will be recognised as a fact,and as a consequence of this recognition our entire civilisation will havechanged so radically that we cannot today even guess at the form it will take.The next ten years will see a greatly increased merging of the first three formsof light, and those of you who are awake to these issues and happenings willfind it interesting to note what is going on. The consensus of opinion in thereligious and spiritualistic fields and in the field of biblical prophecy, andlikewise a study of the symbolism of the Pyramid, lead students to believe thatthe immediate future will see some great event and some unforeseen spiritualhappening. This should be duly anticipated, and careful preparation should bemade for it. I refer not to any coming of any individual. I refer to a naturalprocess with far-reaching effects.There are certain other fields of activity which will all do their part indemonstrating the fact of the soul.There is an aspect of human consciousness which has for [104] long baffled thematerialistic psychologist, and this is the curious power of prevision, theability to foresee and foretell with accuracy events coming in the immediatefuture, or distant happenings. There are warnings given by some inner monitorwhich have again and again saved man from death and disaster; there are theappearances, to their friends and relatives, of men or women who have just died,before any word of their death has been received. This is not in the field oftelepathic knowledge of the death, but involves the appearance of the person.There is the power to participate in events in distant places and to recover therecollection of what transpired with accuracy as to place, personnel and detail.These powers and many similar previsions and recognitions have long bewilderedinvestigators and must find correct explanation. In their wise investigation, inthe accumulation of responsible evidence, and in the later substantiation of theprevision, it will begin to be seen that some factor exists in man which is notbound by space-time limitations, but which transcends the normal humanconsciousness. The present attempted investigation and explanations areinadequate and do not account satisfactorily for all the facts. When, however,they are approached from the standpoint of the soul, with its faculty ofomniscience and its freedom from categories of past, present and future (forthey are lost in the consciousness of the Eternal Now), we shall begin tounderstand the process a little more clearly. When the true Dweller in the bodyis recognised and the laws of prevision are discovered, and when the power toforesee is generally prevalent, then we shall begin to find ample proof of theexistence of the soul. It will be impossible to account for the ordinaryphenomena then current without admitting its existence.Along these various lines proof of the soul will accumulate. In the massing oftestimony and of evidence a fruitful field of [105] activity lies. In thetraining of the higher types of men in the use of the soul force and soulpowers, and in the trained control of the mechanism, that evidence so producedwill be seen to be of so high an order and will be so scientifically presentedthat it will be regarded as of as much importance and as justifiable as anyviews presented by our leading scientists in their various fields of researchtoday. The study of the soul will before long be as legitimate and respectablean investigation as any scientific problem, such as research into the nature ofthe atom. The investigation of the soul and its governing laws will, beforelong, engross the attention of our finest minds. The newer psychology willeventually succeed in proving the fact of its existence, and the parallelingintuitive and instinctive response of mankind to soul nurture, emanating fromthe invisible side of life, will steadily and successfully prove the existenceof a spiritual entity in man,—an entity all-wise, immortal, divine and creative.But the process would be slow were it not for the work now being done by a groupof disciples and initiates working in collaboration with the Master P—, Who hasHis headquarters in America and Who, with His disciples, is doing much tostimulate the various psychological schools in the world today. It is needlessfor students to endeavour to ascertain His identity. He works through movementsand schools of thought, and does no work with private individuals. He workspractically entirely on the mental plane, with the power of thought, and isquite unknown and unrecognised, except by His fellow workers in the variouscountries in the world, and by the disciples on His ray, the fourth ray. Muchthat is opening in the world of psychology today is due to the work He does instimulating the minds of the leaders of movements. He works with them on themental plane, but does not contact them as physical plane individuals.[106] The urgency of the time is great, and the Masters are exceedingly activeand profoundly concerned at this time with the work of salvaging the world. Theyhave not the time for personal work, except with Their own groups of acceptedchelas, all of whom are active in the world work, or they would not be in theMasters’ group. Also They may work intermittently with small groups ofprobationers to whom They offer opportunity and give an occasional hint. Each ofThem has a few, a very few, probationers in training, to take the place ofchelas who pass on to initiation, but beyond these two groups, during thiscentury, They do no personal work, leaving the many aspirants to the care oflesser initiates and chelas. Even Their work and Their personal chelas at thistime are much restricted, and word has been sent out to the working disciples inthe world to stand on their own feet, to use their own judgment and not handicapthe Masters at this time of intense strain and danger by attracting Theirattention needlessly. The world issues today are of such importance, and theopportunity before humanity is so great, and the Masters are so entirelyoccupied with world affairs and with the dominant and prominent figures in highplaces in the nations, that the instruction of unimportant people in the variouslittle occult groups and societies is temporarily suspended. The time isrelatively so short in which to accomplish and carry out certain aspects of thePlan as entrusted to the Great Ones, that all true chelas are going about theirwork and endeavouring to solve their own problems without having to call on theMaster’s help, thus leaving Him free for more important work. The closer adisciple is to a Master, the more deeply he realises this fact, and the more heendeavours to fulfill his duty, learn his lessons, serve humanity, and lift someof the load of work off the shoulders of the Master.The world today is full of disciples of varying degree, and [107] each of themis, in his place, able to guide and help some aspirants. The world is full ofteaching and of books able to inspire and help all true seekers after spiritualknowledge. The last fifty years have seen much teaching given out and muchesoteric training given to the world and available now to all who earnestly seekit. Aspirants have much to work upon and much theory to render into practice,and this leaves the Masters free for more important work.One of the interesting things that is happening, and one of the factors whichwill serve eventually in the work of demonstrating the fact of the soul, is themass of communications, inspired writings, and telepathic dictations which isflooding the world today. As you know, the spiritualistic movement is producinga vast amount of this inspired or pseudo-inspired literature, some of it of thevery highest order and unquestionably the work of highly evolved disciples, andsome of it most mediocre in quality. The various theosophical societies havebeen the recipients of similar communications, and they are found in everyoccult group. True communications are frequently of deep spiritual value, andcontain much teaching and help for the aspirant. Students of the times would dowell to remember that it is the teaching that is of moment, not the supposedsource; by their intrinsic value alone these writings and communications must bejudged. These communications emanate in the majority of instances from the soulplane, and the recipient or the communicator (the intermediary or scribe) iseither inspired by his own soul or has tapped the thought level and knowledge ofthe ray group to which his soul belongs. He tunes in on a reservoir of thought,and his mind and brain translate these thoughts into words and phrases.In a lesser number of cases, the man who is receiving a dictation or writing isin telepathic rapport with some more advanced [108] disciple than himself, andhis mind is being impressed by some chela in his group. This chela, who iscloser to the Master than he is, passes on to him some of the knowledge that hehas absorbed through being able to live within the Master’s aura. But the Masteris not concerned in the process; it lies between the chela and the aspirant. Inthese cases the receiver of the communication is often misled, and thinks thatthe Master Himself is dictating to him, whereas in reality he has—through a moreadvanced chela than himself—tuned in on the Master’s thought atmosphere.None of the Masters of the sixth initiation (such as the Masters M. and K. H.)are at this time working through dictation with Their disciples. They are toomuch engrossed with world problems, and with the work of watching over thedestinies of the prominent world figures in the various nations, to have anyopportunity to dictate teaching to any particular disciple in some small fieldof activity and upon subjects of which sufficient is already known to enable thedisciple to go ahead alone and unaided. Two of the Masters are workingtelepathically and through dictation with several accepted disciples, and Theireffort is to inspire these disciples, who are active in world work, to greaterusefulness in the Plan. They are working in this way in order to impress a fewof the prominent thinkers in the field of science and of social welfare with theneeded knowledge which will enable them to make the right moves in the emergenceof the race into greater freedom. But I know of no others, in this particulargeneration, who are so doing, for They have delegated much of this work to Theirinitiates and disciples. The bulk of the communicators today (working throughaspirants on the physical plane) are active working chelas of accepted degreewho (living as they do in the thought aura of the Master and His group) aresteadily endeavouring to reach all kinds of people, all over the world, [109] inall groups. Hence the increasing flood of communications, of inspired writings,and of personal messages and teaching.When you add to the above the equally large flood of communications whichemanate from the transmitters’ own souls and from the realm of the subconscious,you have accounted for the mass of the material going out now. In all this thereis need for deep thankfulness at the growing responsiveness and sensitivity ofman.That the first reaction and effect of such an outpouring of communications isoft an increase of spiritual pride and ambition, and that the stepping down ofthe teaching from the mind to the brain and from the brain into words andsentences often fails in adequacy is sadly true, and that there is frequentlymisapprehension as to the emanating source of the instructions is also true, forthe lack of humility in man and the lack of a true sense of proportion aregreat. But out of this inflow from the subjective side of life are coming newknowledge, increased devotion to the Plan, and those indications which willeventually bring us assurance. Men will know, and know soon, that the soul isnot an imaginary fiction, that it is not just a symbolic way of expressing adeep-seated hope, and is not man’s method of building a defense mechanism; noris it an illusory way of escape from a distressing present. They will know thatthe soul is a Being, a Being that is responsible for all that appears upon thephenomenal plane.We have two more questions to consider now, and they are as follows:QUESTION 4. OF WHAT VALUE IS IT TO KNOW ABOUT THE SEVEN RAYS?QUESTION 5. WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE OUTSTANDING SOUL QUALITIES SUCH ASSENTIENCY, CONSCIOUSNESS, AWARENESS AND LIGHT?[110] Above everything else, it is necessary that the aspirant be practical.The days of a mystical and dreamy consciousness are rapidly passing away, and asman, through understanding of psychology, comes to a more accurate knowledge ofhimself he will begin to act with precision and with intelligence; he will knowwith exactitude the way that he should go, and will comprehend the forces in hisown nature which will lead to specific action when brought into touch with theforces of his environment. Aspirants should endeavour to make practicalapplication of the imparted truths, and so minimise their responsibility. Wherethere is acquired knowledge and when no use is made of it there exists acondition of danger and subsequent penalty.Much has been given in previous books which awaits your adaptation and usefulservice. Much will be given in the present volume, but students need to rememberthat they themselves evoke and call forth the teaching they receive. Theposition between me and those who are reading is not that of a teacher imposinga system of knowledge upon a group of waiting pupils. The group is simply thechannel through which a particular aspect of the Ageless Wisdom can reach awaiting world. I do not regard you as a body of good men and women, who, becauseof your point in evolution, are deemed worthy to receive something esoteric andunusual, and hence withheld from the rest of the race. I regard you as sincerelyinterested in the spiritual life, as concerned with the endeavour to beintelligent, and as willing (more or less) to try to live as souls, and to useas much of the imparted teaching as can be understood. What use students make ofit is entirely their own affair. But the value of any group of aspirants anddisciples consists [111] in this: They can—if they so choose and if their unitedaspiration is strong enough—draw forth the teaching, and so form a centrethrough which that teaching may go forth and begin its work of moulding humanthought, of throwing light upon the problems of psychology, and of so expandingthe point of truth (anent the seven rays, an ancient septenate, but littlecomprehended) that a new realisation may be evolved and a new science ofpsychology may be launched upon its career.You ask, therefore: What must we as a group do that we may be of service, and soconstitute a good channel for the helping of humanity?First of all, you must see to it that your attitude towards all teaching is thatof willing service, with no thought of self. The growth in spiritual realisationand the lifting of humanity is that which is of moment, and not your ownpersonal growth or development, nor your own satisfaction at receiving specialand new information. You will grow, and your soul will take increasing hold uponits instrument, when your mind and effort are turned towards group service, andwhen your tongue is rendered harmless, through the inflow of Love.Secondly, let not your mind be occupied with idle speculations as to theidentity of the teacher. What matters it who he is? Can you prove his identityin one way or another? And of what value is it to accept the statements of anyfellow student who may claim to be informed on the matter, be he who he may? Youcannot prove him right or wrong, and therefore it remains a waste of time whichcould well be given to more fruitful service, to closer study of thelife-essentials, and to meditation.What is taught should matter. The aspects of truth which I present to yourconsideration should count; the measure of help which I can give and thespiritual and mental stimulation which I may impart are of moment to you. Thetraining [112] of the intuition to recognise spiritual truth should be thesubject of your effort. The sole authority is the teaching, and not the teacher;upon the rock of authority many schools have foundered. There is but oneauthority—each man’s own immortal soul, and that is the only authority whichshould be recognised.Learn to grasp the teaching correctly, and see it for what it is. Some of it iswritten for a distant time, and the true significance of this Treatise on theSeven Rays will begin to emerge as part of the general knowledge of humanityonly towards the close of this century, unless the imminent outpouring evokesgreater change than is now deemed possible by the watching Hierarchy. Some ofthe teaching is of immediate usefulness to all of you. Some of it will throwlight upon the problems of modern psychology, and link the many aspects of thescience of the soul. Disciples grow these days by finding out the reservoir oftheir soul’s nourishment; they will discover that the source of their strengthis to be found in group teaching and in group endeavour. We are training men tolive as souls and not as children to be nursed and cared for in a protectednursery run by rules and orders. As souls, men derive their life from the oceanof the universal, and not from the tiny well of the particular. Carrying theirlittle pitchers, they find their way to that ocean, and for themselves they drawinto that receptacle that which they need. In the light of your own intuitionand illumined mind (developed and brought to usefulness through meditation) takethat aspect of the teaching which suits and aids you, and interpret it in thelight of your own need and growth.The days of personality contact, of personality attention and of personalmessages are over, and have been over for quite a while, save in the vale ofillusion, on the astral plane. This is a hard message, but no true disciple willmisunderstand. From [113] the depths of his own experience and struggle he knowsit to be so. It is the group of Masters, the Hierarchy as a whole, that is ofmoment and its interaction with humanity; it is the Masters’ group of disciplesthat counts, and its relation to probationary disciples on the physical plane,who are seen by the group as existing in group formation all over the world, nomatter where its units may be; it is the body of teaching that can be madeavailable, and its effect upon the collective mind of the thinkers of the race,that is of vital importance; it is the interplay between the subjective group ofworld workers and—on the outer plane of objectivity—the lovers of humanity whichseems to us, the teachers, to be of supreme importance. The satisfying ofindividual aspiration, the meeting of the desire of the probationers and thefeeding of spiritual ambition appeal to us not at all. The times are tooserious, and the crisis too acute.It is of course a fact that there are today groups of aspirants receivingdefinite instruction, and disciples being subjected to definite training. But itmust be remembered (in spite of all statements by the devotees of the world tothe contrary) that no training is given in these cases as to the handling of thedetails of the personality life; the specific problems of health, finance andfamily concerns are not dealt with nor considered; nor is comfort given or timetaken to reassure or satisfy the unstable personality. Training aspirants as tothe technique of spiritual growth is undertaken; correction of the hiddenfactors producing emotional conditions may be suggested; meditations may bearranged in order to bring about certain results; and instruction in the lawsgoverning soul union may be offered; but no personality work is attempted.Disciples handle their own personalities. In the pressure of world work, theMasters are finding Themselves with less and less time to give even to Theirdisciples. How then do those who are not in the [114] ranks of accepteddisciples expect the Master to have the time to deal with their little affairs?In the future, however, groups will be formed increasingly, which will functionon a new basis, and some of these new “group organisms” are forming in the worldat this time. They are still in the nature of an experiment and may provepremature or undesirable. The teaching given in these new groups, thesuggestions made, the experiments in training to be attempted, and the techniqueimparted will not be given personally and privately to an individual groupmember, but all of it is open and can be read, known and considered by everyother member in the group. These groups are as yet necessarily few, and verysmall in number. They are in the nature of an attempt to see if it will bepossible eventually to externalise the groups gathered around a Master on theinner planes. These groups of accepted disciples on the inner side are sensitiveorganisms, and each member of these circles gathered around a Master is aware ofthat which concerns his fellow disciples” spiritual unfoldment, within theradius of the circle in which he finds himself. These small outer attempts at atentative duplication are in an embryonic condition as yet. It is a test and atrial effort, and may fail. The members of these tiny outer groups (whosemembership and grouping are known only to those who form part of them) have tobe willing to be instructed and developed as group units, with the other membersof their group aware of their failures or successes. They have also to preservecomplete silence as to the existence of the group, and a breaking of thissilence warrants their elimination from the group. The personnel of these groupsis forgotten in the life of the group entity as a whole. The members are trainedin the group, and the group is trained as a whole, with no emphasis upon theindividual but only on the group interplay and interaction, its integration andgrowth. [115] Only those factors in the life of the individual are noted andhandled which would hinder the growth of the group life and expression. It isthe group note, the group colour, and the group development which count with thetraining staff of workers, and the individual is never considered as anindividual, but only in his relation to the group. What he is told to do, andthe discipline applied, is all based on the desire to preserve the groupbalance, and not on any personal interest in the individual. In this experimenta man is tried out to see his fitness. He will be tested early in his career asa group unit. If he passes the test and makes the grade, the group is enrichedand grows thereby. If he fails, he drops out and others take his place untilsuch time as the group unit is attuned and completed, and those who are sincereand true, impersonal and mentally poised, self-forgetful and loving, are foundto work together in harmony. Thus they can, as a group entity, form a focalpoint for the transmission of spiritual force to a needy and waiting world.But it is important to remember that the attitude of the training initiate orteacher is one of complete detachment and impersonality; he is aware of the soullight and condition, and of the mental state, but he does not turn his attentionto the handling of the affairs of the aspirant on the physical plane, nor to thetraining of his emotional nature and his astral development. Aspirants learn tobe master and adept by handling their own physical plane affairs and theirastral idiosyncrasies. This they must do in the light and strength of their ownsouls. We who teach would break a law and hinder their development if weattempted to enforce conditions which come not naturally. We should alsooverstimulate their lower natures. When will aspirants learn that the teachersand senior disciples in charge of them work only on mental levels and with thesoul? When will they grasp the fact that until a man has contacted his own [116]soul, and has learned to function as a controlled mind as well, there is littlewe can do for him? Again I say, we are not interested in personalities and theirsmall affairs. We have neither the time nor the inclination to interfere withthe way and method of a man’s daily life. Why should we, when enough has beenprinted and taught to occupy the attention of the aspiring man for many a day?When a man is beginning to live as a soul, and when his consciousness hasshifted away from the world of illusion, then he can be useful. The first lessonhe has to learn is a sense of values in time and space, and to know that we workwith souls and do not nurse the personality.Seems this too hard a saying to you? If it is indeed so to you, it means thatyou are as yet somewhat self-centred and in love with your own individual soul,having not yet duly contacted it, and having but perhaps sensed its vibrationand no more. You have not yet that true picture of the world’s need which willrelease you from your own ambition and set you free to work as we (on thesubjective side) work, with no thought of self or of spiritual happiness, andwith no desire for any self-appointed task; with no longing for glitteringpromises of future success, and with no demanding ache for the tender touch andcontact with those greater in consciousness than ourselves. If this lies stillbeyond your realisation, recognise the fact, and understand that there is noblame attached. It only indicates to you the ground whereon you stand, and thatthe illusion of the astral plane still holds you in its thrall and still leadsyou to place personality reactions before group realisation. As long as you walkon that plane and function on that level of consciousness, it is not possible todraw you consciously into the Masters’ groups on mental levels. You are stilltoo destructive and personal; you would be apt to hurt the group and causetrouble; you would see things (through the group stimulation) with a clarity forwhich you are not yet [117] ready, and would be shattered thereby. You have needto learn the lessons of accepting guidance from your own soul, and of learningto work with harmony and impersonality on the physical plane with the group orgroups to which your destiny impels you. When you have learnt the lesson ofself-forgetfulness, when you seek nothing for the separated self, when you standfirmly on your own feet and look for aid within yourself, and when the trend ofyour life is towards cooperation, then you may pass from the stage of Observerto that of Communicator. This will happen because you can be trusted tocommunicate only that which is impersonal and truly constructive, and which willnot feed the emotional nature and satisfy the desire-self.An interesting point might here be noted and a question answered. In A Treatiseon White Magic I referred to the two groups of Observers and Communicators (thethird group lies outside our present discussion), and the question was asked:Who trains these Observers and Communicators? I should like to make it clearthat the observers train themselves or—more accurately—the soul of each trainsthe personality in true observation. In the case of the communicators, they areslowly and gradually trained by senior disciples, working from the subjectiveside of life. The training is never organised and arranged for on the physicalplane,nor are any disciples—working on the physical plane—engaged in traininggroups of communicators to be employed later by the Hierarchy. In this matter(as in all else in the spiritual life) the disciple first trains himself to beresponsive to his own soul, and then trains himself to be responsive to theinner group of workers, who later, as a result of his self-initiated effort,teach him to be a communicator, an intermediary. The hallmark of suchcommunicators is mental clarity, true impersonality, spiritual tolerance, [118]and a frugality in the use of words, when embodying concepts. It should beremembered that in the wealth of psychic writings pouring into the world today,the work of the true communicators will concern itself with the Plan and notwith personalities; with principles and not with individual purposes; and thatall such communicators will be mental types, channels for the love of God, andgroup conscious. There will be nothing in their work to produce separativeness,and nothing to feed the fires of controversy, antagonism or partisanship. Muchof value may come along other lines than through this group of communicators,and you may look for an increased flood of inspirational writings of a highorder, and for an outpouring of wisdom from the world of souls through thehundreds who are in touch with their own souls; there will also be muchemanating from the highest level of the astral plane, of a high order alongdevotional lines, but none of this will be the work of the band of communicatorsnow in process of forming. Only a handful are doing this work as yet, and thetrue influx of communicators will not start for another fifteen years.To return to our two questions, and particularly to the one concerning the valueof studying the rays. I have felt the need to write on this matter for thefollowing reasons:1. Modern psychology is in a cul-de-sac. The many psychologies have made theircontribution to the whole subject, and all of them have value, for all haveembodied an aspect of truth. Through them we have arrived at an amazingknowledge of man, of his instincts and animal mechanisms, of his reactions tohis environment and of his sensitive apparatus; we have learnt much about thesub-conscious, through which ancient racial sins and knowledges, suppressedcomplexes and latent desires, as well as highly organised psychic reactions,[119] well up into the conscious mind so disastrously. We know much anent theman as a whole functioning unity, and of the interactions existing between thenervous system, the glandular system, the muscles, and their expression, informs of quality, character, personality, and the environment. We have learntmuch, therefore, about that composite being called man, and man, as a psychicentity, is an established fact in nature, as is man, the animal. But man, thesoul, remains still a speculation, a hope, a belief. The fact of the soul is notyet substantiated; and in helping the truth into the light I seek to bring thesubject of the seven rays to the notice of the thinkers of modern times, so thatthe light of this esoteric knowledge may be thrown upon the science ofpsychology. Thus may the work of revelation be aided.2. If there is one thing that has emerged into the minds of investigators, asthey have studied man, it is the fact that he is essentially dual. Psychologyhas shown that in the consciousness of every human being is a sense of duality,that man is in some mysterious sense two beings, and that it is the warfarebetween these two which has led to all the neuroses and complexes which tax theingenuity of trained psychologists to solve. The initiate Paul referred to thiswhen he spoke of the eternal warfare going on between the carnal mind and theheavenly nature, and all aspirants who are occupied with an intelligent struggletowards liberation bear witness to the same. Paul points out that victory is wonthrough Christ, and I give a clue to the importance of this study of the rayswhen I state that, esoterically, these seven rays are the sevenfold expressionsof the Cosmic Christ, the second Person of the Trinity. Bewildered men and womengo in their thousands to the clinics of the psychologists, carrying with themthe burden of their dual natures; and psychologists in their thousands recognise[120] this duality and seek to unify the dissociated aspects. When the truenature of the seven rays is grasped, and when their effect on humanity inexpressing the seven types of men is also understood, we shall then approach thesubject of man”s duality with greater intelligence. We shall comprehend betterthe nature of the forces which constitute one or another of these dualities.This is the true esoteric science. The science of the seven qualities or rays,and their effect upon the myriad forms which they mould and energise, is thecoming new approach to the correct method of training and developing the humanfamily. Modern exoteric science knows much about the outer form, or matteraspect, and its electrical nature. Esoteric science knows much about the natureof the subjective energies and the qualities which colour and condition theform. When these two knowledges are brought intelligently together, we shallevolve a truer and more accurate psychology and a new science of human culture.Then the work of unifying man—man, the psychic entity, and man, the conditioningsoul—will go rapidly forward.3. A knowledge of the rays and their tendencies and energies will bring muchillumination to the workers in the field of the various sciences. All thesciences find themselves on some one or other of the rays, and a science isliterally the light thrown by a ray into a particular field of divinemanifestation. The four kingdoms in nature are embodiments of four great LivesWho are found, each on one of the four minor rays. The Being Who is the life ofthe fourth or human kingdom in nature (regarding that kingdom as a distinctorganism, just as man’s body nature or personality is a distinct organism,separable from him as a soul) is on the fifth ray. The Being Who ensoulssimilarly the third kingdom, the animal kingdom, vibrates to the sixth ray. TheBeing Who is the expression [121] and active force of the entire vegetablekingdom is to be found upon the fourth ray. Therefore we have:Humanity 4th Kingdom 5th Ray Concrete Knowledge. Animal 3rd Kingdom 6th RayDevotion upwards or forwards. Vegetable 2nd Kingdom 4th Ray Harmony and Beauty.Mineral 1st Kingdom 7th Ray Organisation and Ritual.These statements mean little to you at present, but we shall elaborate themlater, when we come to the consideration of these rays in greater detail. I ambut giving a general impression at this time. It is apparent nevertheless thatwhen the nature of the energy permeating and animating any particular kingdom innature is recognised and accepted (even if hypothetically) by the scientists,much light will be thrown upon the outer form qualified by a particular forceand life.There is, for instance, a definite reason why the bulk of the wild flowers andgarden flowers in the occident, and also those found during the autumn season,are at this time found in tones of yellow and orange; and the mental calibre ofthe later sub-races of the Aryan race, as well as its general tone throughoutthe Aryan age, is also related to the same reason. The influence of the fourthRay of Harmony and Beauty, and the developing power of the fifth Ray ofKnowledge (synonymous to the merging of the intuition and the intellect inhighly evolved man) have a definite effect upon the vegetable kingdom and uponthe human aura. Yellow-orange shines forth in both. I mention this as anillustration of an externalisation of ray force, and as an indication of thevalue of the esoteric science when applied to the exoteric.The blue ray of devotion passes now into the violet of what we term theceremonial ray. What do these words mean? Simply that the great Musician of theuniverse is moving the [122] keys, is sounding another note and thus bringing inanother turn of the wheel, and swinging into the arc of manifestation the ray ofviolet, the great note G. These rays bring with them—in every kingdom innature—all that is attuned to them: Human beings, devas of order high or low,elementals of a desirable or undesirable nature, flowers, fruits, and vegetablelife of a certain kind, and animals and forms of varying species. It is thepassing out of a ray that signals the ultimate extinction of some particularform, some type of animal life, and leads to some vegetable aspect coming to anend. Hence the confusion among the scientists at this time. The process ofcoming in is slow, as is all work in nature, and as is the process of passingout. Simultaneously with the cyclic birth and emergence of a new ray is the slowreturn to its source of the prevailing ray, present at the advent of the new.At this time the sixth ray is passing out and is taking with it all those formswhose keynote is blue—those people, for instance, who with devotion (misplacedor not) followed some particular object, person or idea. With it passes,therefore, those whom we term fanatics, those who with one-pointed zeal worktowards some sensed objective. Many of the flowers in which you now rejoice arepassing out, the bluebell, the hyacinth and the olive for example; the sapphirewill become scarce and the turquoise will lose its hue. Flowers of violetcolour, of lavender and of purple will come into favour. Behind all this lies apurpose profound.The physical plane, in its densest aspect, holds little of mystery for mantoday; he has knowledge on these matters. But the rarer levels of the physicalplane lie hid and are, for man, his next field of discovery. The ceremonial raybrings with it the means whereby that knowledge may be acquired and revealed toall, and thus not be the sole property of the wise and of the occultists. Thethree higher etheric levels, with their [123] denizens, are waiting to becomethe property of all, and with their inhabitants comes the next approximation.It is possible at this time to foretell certain events which will come to passduring the next one hundred years.First, in about ten years time the first ether, with all that is composed ofthat matter, will be recognised scientific fact, and the scientists who workintuitionally will come to recognise the devas of that plane. People coming intoincarnation on this seventh ray will have the eyes that see, and the purpledevas and the lesser devas of the etheric body will be visioned by them.Secondly, when He Whom both angels and men await, will approach near unto thisphysical plane, He will bring with Him not only some of the Great Ones and theMasters, but some of the Devas who stand to the deva evolution as the Masters tothe human. Forget not that the human evolution is but one of many, and that thisis a period of crisis among the devas likewise. The call has gone forth for themto approach humanity, and with their heightened vibration and superior knowledgeunite their forces with those of humanity, for the progression of the twoevolutions. They have much to impart anent colour and sound, and their effectupon the etheric bodies of men and animals. When that which they have to give isapprehended by the race, physical ills will be nullified and attention will becentred upon the infirmities of the astral or emotional body.These violet devas of the four ethers form, as you may imagine, four greatgroups with seven subsidiary divisions. These four groups work with the fourtypes of men now in incarnation, for it is a statement of fact that at no timein this round are more than four types of men in incarnation at any one time.Four rays dominate at any given period, with one in excess of the other three. Imean by this, that only four rays are in physical incarnation; for on the planeof the soul all [124] seven types are of course found. This idea is brought outin the four castes in India, and you will find that these four are founduniversally. The four groups of devas are a band of servers to the Lord, andtheir special work is to contact men and to give them definite and experimentalteaching.They will instruct in the effect of colour in the healing of disease, especiallythe effect of the violet light in the lessening of human ills and in the cure ofthose physical plane sicknesses which have their origin in the etheric body ordouble.They will teach men to see etherically, by heightening human vibration by actionof their own.They will demonstrate to the materialistic thinkers of the world the fact thatthe superconscious states exist—not the superhuman only—and will also make clearthe hitherto unrecognised fact that other beings, besides the human, have theirhabitat on earth.They will also teach the sounding of the tones that correspond to the gradationsof violet, and through that sounding enable man to utilise the ethers, as he nowutilises physical plane matter for his various needs.They will enable human beings so to control the ethers that weight will be forthem transmuted, and motion will be intensified, becoming more rapid, moregliding, noiseless, and therefore less tiring. In the human control of theetheric levels lie the lessening of fatigue, rapidity of transit, and theability to transcend time. Until this prophecy is a fact in consciousness, itsmeaning is obscure.They will also teach men how rightly to nourish the body and to draw from thesurrounding ethers the requisite food. Man will in the future concentrate moreon the sound condition of the etheric body, and the functioning of the densephysical body will become practically automatic.They will enable human beings, as a race, and not as individuals, [125] toexpand their consciousness so that it will embrace the superphysical. Forget notthe important fact that in the accomplishment of this the web that divides thephysical plane from the astral plane will be discovered by the scientists, andits purpose will eventually be acknowledged. With that discovery will come thepower to penetrate the web, and so link up consciously with the astral body.Another material unification will have been accomplished.Then what else will occur, and what will be the method of approach to thesedevas?More and more, during the next fifteen years, will men receive definiteteaching, often subconsciously, from devas to whom they are linked. This will bedone telepathically at first. Doctors today get much information from certaindevas. There are two great devas belonging to the green group on mental levelswho assist in this work, and some physicians get much knowledge subjectivelyfrom a violet deva working on the atomic subplane of the physical plane, aidedby a deva of the causal level who works with, or through, their egos. As menlearn to sense and recognise these devas, more and more teaching will be given.They teach in three ways:a. By means of intuitional telepathy.b. Through demonstration of colour, proving the accomplishment of certain thingsin this way.c. By definite musical sounds, which will cause vibrations in the ethers, whichin their turn will produce forms.The ether will eventually appear to the enhanced vision of humanity to have moresubstance than it now has, and as etheric vision increases, the ethers will berecognised as being strictly physical plane matter. Therefore when in sicknessmen shall call a deva, when that deva can destroy diseased [126] tissue bysounding a note that will result in the elimination of the corrupt tissue, whenby the presence caused by the vibration new tissue is visibly built in, then thepresence of these devas will be generally acknowledged and their power will beutilised.By what means will their presence be realised and their powers employed?First of all, by a definite development of the human eye, which will then seethat which is now unseen. It will be a change within the eye, and not a form ofclairvoyance.Next, by a steady experimentation with invocations, and through their use themethod of calling the devas will be discovered. This development must beapproached with caution, for to the unprotected it leads to disaster. Hence thenecessity to inculcate pure living, the learning of protective invocations andformulas, and the power of the church and of Masonry to protect. Forget not thatevil entities exist on other planes than the physical, that they can respond toanalogous vibrations, and that the invocations that call a deva may, if soundedinaccurately, call a being that will work havoc. In ritual lies protection.Hence the emphasis laid upon church forms and on the Masonic rituals,—anemphasis which will increase and not grow less as the years slip by. The forceof invocations will be known later.Every individual vibrates to some particular measure. Those who know and whowork clairvoyantly and clairaudiently find that all matter sounds, all matterpulsates, and all matter has its own colour. Each human being can therefore bemade to give forth some specific sound; in making that sound he flashes intocolour, and the combination of the two is indicative of some measure which ispeculiarly his own.Every unit of the human race is on some one of the seven [127] rays; thereforesome one colour predominates, and some one tone sounds forth; infinite are thegradations and many the shades of colour and tone. Each ray has its subsidiaryrays which it dominates, acting as the synthetic ray. These seven rays arelinked with the colours of the spectrum. There are the rays of red, blue,yellow, orange, green and violet. There is the ray that synthesises them all,that of indigo. There are the three major rays—red, blue and yellow—and the foursubsidiary colours which, in the evolving Monad, find their correspondence inthe spiritual Triad and the lower quaternary. The Logos of our system isconcentrating on the love or blue aspect. This—as the synthesis—manifests asindigo. This matter of the rays and their colours is confusing to the neophyte.I can but indicate some thoughts, and in the accumulation of suggestion lightmay eventually come. The clue lies in similarity of colour, which entails aresemblance in note and rhythm. When, therefore, a man is on the red and yellowrays, with red as his primary ray, and meets another human being who is on theblue and yellow rays, with a secondary resemblance to the yellow, there may berecognition. But when a man on the yellow and blue rays, with yellow as hisprimary colour, meets a brother on the yellow and red rays, the recognition isimmediate and mutual, for the primary colour is the same. When this fundamentalcause of association or dissociation is better understood, the secondary colourswill be made to act as the meeting ground, to the mutual benefit of the partiesconcerned.Of the colours, red, blue and yellow are primary and irreducible. They are thecolours of the major rays.a. Will or Power . . . . . . . . Redb. Love-Wisdom . . . . . . . .Bluec. Active Intelligence . . . .Yellow[128] We have then the subsidiary rays:d. Orange.e. Green.f. Violet.and the synthesising ray, Indigo.4. It is of course to the human interest that a study of the rays makes its mainappeal. It is this study that will vivify and awaken psychologists to the trueunderstanding of man. Every human being finds himself upon one of the sevenrays. His personality is found, in every life, upon one of them, in varyingrotation, according to the ray of the ego or soul. After the third initiation helocates his soul (if one may use such an inappropriate word) on one of the threemajor rays, though until that time it may be found in one of the seven raygroups. From that exalted attitude he strives towards the essential unity of theMonad. The fact of there being seven ray types carries great implications, andthe intricacy of the subject is baffling to the neophyte.A ray confers, through its energy, peculiar physical conditions, and determinesthe quality of the astral-emotional nature; it colours the mind body; itcontrols the distribution of energy, for the rays are of differing rates ofvibration, and govern a particular centre in the body (differing with each ray)through which that distribution is made. Each ray works through one centreprimarily and through the remaining six, in a specific order. The raypredisposes a man to certain strengths and weaknesses, and constitutes hisprinciple of limitation, as well as endowing him with capacity. It governs themethod of his relations to other human types and is responsible for hisreactions in form to other forms. It gives him his colouring and quality, hisgeneral tone on the three planes of the personality, and it moulds his physicalappearance. Certain attitudes of mind are easy for one ray type and difficultfor [129] another, and hence the changing personality shifts from ray to ray,from life to life, until all the qualities are developed and expressed. Certainsouls, by their ray destiny, are found in certain fields of activity, and aparticular field of endeavour remains relatively the same for many lifeexpressions. A governor or statesman has learnt facility in his craft throughmuch experience in that field. A world Teacher has been teaching for age-longcycles. A world Saviour has been, for many lives, at the task of salvaging. Whena man is two-thirds of the way along the evolutionary path his soul ray typebegins to dominate the personality ray type and will therefore govern the trendof his expression on earth, not in the spiritual sense (so-called) but in thesense of pre-disposing the personality towards certain activities.A knowledge therefore of the rays and their qualities and activities is, fromthe standpoint of psychology, of profound importance, and hence this treatise.5. Groups of people, organisations, nations and groups of nations are all theresult of ray activity and magnetism. Hence an understanding of the forces whichstream forth from the divine creative centre, and which we call the rays, is ofvalue in understanding the quality, nature, and destiny of vast human masses.The seven planets are governed by one or other of the rays. Countries (viewedindependently of their nationals) are likewise the result of ray activity, andthus the importance of the subject cannot be overestimated.QUESTION 5. WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THE FOLLOWING WORDS: SENTIENCY; CONSCIOUSNESSOR AWARENESS; THE ENERGY OF LIGHT?We shall now consider our last question, and I shall indicate to you, in generalterms,—necessarily limited by the inadequacy [130] of language,—the significanceof the outstanding soul qualities:a. Sentiency, or sensitive response to contact, and by that means the subsequentgrowth in knowledge.b. Consciousness, awareness of environment, and the development of instrumentswhereby consciousness may be increasingly developed.c. Light, or radiation, the effect of the interplay between the life and theenvironment.The first point that I seek to make is a difficult one to grasp for thosebeneath the rank of initiate or accepted disciple of the higher stages. The soulis that factor in matter (or rather that which emerges out of the contactbetween spirit and matter) which produces sentient response and what we callconsciousness in its varying forms; it is also that latent or subjectiveessential quality which makes itself felt as light or luminous radiation. It isthe “self-shining from within” which is characteristic of all forms. Matter, perse, and in its undifferentiated state, prior to being swept into activitythrough the creative process, is not possessed of soul, and does not thereforepossess the qualities of response and of radiation. Only when,—in the creativeand evolutionary process,—these two are brought into conjunction and fusion doesthe soul appear and give to these two aspects of divinity the opportunity tomanifest as a trinity and the chance to demonstrate sentient activity andmagnetic radiatory light. As all that we shall posit in this treatise is to beapproached from the angle of human evolution, it might be stated that only whenthe soul aspect is dominant is the response apparatus (the form nature of man)fulfilling its complete destiny, and only then does true magnetic radiation andthe pure shining forth of light become possible. Symbolically, in the earlystages of human evolution, [131] man is, from the angle of consciousness,relatively unresponsive and unconscious, as is matter in its early stages in theformative process. The achievement of full awareness is of course the goal ofthe evolutionary process. Again symbolically speaking, the unevolved man emitsor manifests no light. The light in the head is invisible, though theclairvoyant investigators would see the dim glow of the light within theelements which constitute the body, and the light hidden in the atoms whichconstitute the form nature.As evolution proceeds, these dim points of “dark light” intensify their glow;the light within the head flickers at intervals during the life of the averageman, and becomes a shining light as he enters upon the path of discipleship.When he becomes an initiate, the light of the atoms is so bright, and the lightin the head so intense (with a paralleling stimulation of the centres of forcein the body), that the light body appears. Eventually this body of light becomesexternalised and of greater prominence than the dense tangible physical body.This is the body of light in which the true son of God consciously dwells. Afterthe third initiation, the dual light becomes accentuated and takes on a stillgreater brilliancy through the blending with it of the energy of spirit. This isnot really the admission or the re-combining of a third light, but the fanningof the light of matter and the light of the soul into a greater glory throughthe Breath of the spirit. Something anent this light has been earlier indicatedin A Treatise on Cosmic Fire . Study it and seek to understand the significanceof this process. In the understanding of these aspects of light comes a truerperspective as to the nature of the fires in the human expression of divinity.It must never be forgotten that the soul of all things, the anima mundi , as itexpresses itself through all the four kingdoms in nature, is that which gives toour planet its light in [132] the heavens. The planetary light is the sum totalof the light, dim and uncertain, to be found in all atoms of radiatory andvibratory matter or substance, which compose all forms in all kingdoms. Added tothis, there is, within the planet and also within each kingdom in nature, thecorrespondence to the etheric body with its centres of radiant energy, foundunderlying or “substanding” the outer physical form. Man’s etheric body is acorporate part of the planetary etheric body, and constitutes its most refinedand most highly developed aspect. As the aeons pass away there is a growingintensity of light radiating forth from our planet. This does not necessarilymean that a dweller on Neptune would see our planet glowing with an increasinglybrighter light, though this does happen in a few cases in the universe. But itmeans that, from the standpoint of a clairvoyant vision, the etheric planetarybody will grow in vivid radiation and glory as that radiation expresses more andmore the true light of the soul.The soul is light essentially , both literally from the vibratory angle, andphilosophically from the angle of constituting the true medium of knowledge. Thesoul is light symbolically , for it is like the rays of the sun, which pour outinto the darkness; the soul, through the medium of the brain, causes revelation.It throws its light into the brain, and thus the way of the human being becomesincreasingly illumined. The brain is like the eye of the soul, looking out intothe physical world; in the same sense the soul is the eye of the Monad, and in acurious and occult sense, the fourth kingdom in nature constitutes on our planetthe eye of the planetary Deity. The brain is responsive to the seven senses:1. Hearing2. Touch3. Sight4. Taste5. Smell6. The mind, the common-sense7. The intuition or the synthetic sense.[133] Through these seven senses contact with the world of matter and of spiritbecomes possible. The seven senses are, in a peculiar way, the physical planecorrespondences of the seven rays, and are closely related to and governed bythem all. The following tabulation will be found suggestive. That is all that itis intended to be:1. Hearing 7th Ray Magic The Word of Power. 2. Touch 1st Ray Destroyer TheFinger of God. 3. Sight 3rd Ray Vision The Eye of God. 4. Taste 6th Ray IdealismThe Desire of Nations. 5. Smell 4th Ray Art The Beauty of Revelation. 6. TheIntellect 5th Ray Mind The Knowledge of God. 7. The Intuition 2nd RayLove-Wisdom Understanding of God.Through the Words of Power the worlds came into ordered being, and the Lord ofthe Ray of Ceremonial Magic brings about the organisation of the divineorganism.Through the application of the Finger of God in its directing and forceful work,we have the cyclic destruction of forms, so that the manifestation of Deity maygrow in power and beauty. Thus the Lord of Power or Will performs the task ofdestruction, thereby bringing beauty into being and the revelation of God’s willand His beneficent purpose.By means of the Eye of God light shines forth upon the way of the sun, the pathof the planets, and the path of man. The Lord of Adaptability and the Intellectbrings into expression and into objectivity the intelligent working out of thedivine idea and Plan.When the “Desire of all nations” shall come, and the Cosmic Christ shall standrevealed, all men and all creatures shall occultly [134] “taste” or share inthat great happening, and the Lord of the Ray of Devotion and Idealism shall seethe consummation of His work and be “satisfied.”Also the Lord of the fourth Ray of Harmony, Beauty and Art will add His share tothe great creative work, and it will be found that, in the elusive following toits source of that mysterious revelation which we call beauty, there will beexpressed that subtle quality of which “smell,” in the animal sense, is thesymbol. The great search and the esoteric “following of the scent” will come toan end. This fourth ray is pre-eminently the way of the seeker, the searcher andthe sensitive reflector of beauty. The Jewish nation has a close relation tothis fourth ray and to the fourth root race, and hence their eminence at thistime in the world of art, and hence the magnitude of their endless symbolicwandering and searching.When the Knowledge of God shall shine forth universally (and this is not theknowledge of, or awareness of a great Being but the expression through humaninstrumentality of the divine omniscience), then will the Lord of ConcreteScience, Who is the embodiment of the fifth principle of mind, see His workbrought to a conclusion. He stimulates the sense of awareness in humanity andnurtures the consciousness aspect in the subhuman kingdoms, producing theresponse, therefore, of matter to spirit, and bringing about the interpretationof that to which there has been a sentient rapport.The intuition is literally the synthetic and immediate grasp of the truth, as itessentially exists, and the Lord of the second ray will bring to a conclusionthe entire evolutionary process through the development in humanity of thatperfect insight which will make every human being a complete and intelligentcooperator with the Plan.[135] A close study of these ray forces in relation to the creative work and thefurthering of the Plan (in so far as we can, at this time, grasp it) will revealhow closely the entire building-wrecking-rebuilding process is tied up with thequestion of the three qualities of the soul, sentiency, consciousness andawareness, and will demonstrate how the problem of light, with which I have justbeen dealing, has a definite relation to our ability to interpret and comprehendthese three qualities.Consciousness, in the esoteric teaching, concerns the response of the formaspect in the three subhuman kingdoms:1. To the world of living, vibratory and magnetic forms, in which each form isimmersed. Every form, through its radiation, affects every other form, andaccording to the quality of the form and according to its evolutionary status,so will be its response to its environment.2. To the subjective world of forces which we call the etheric world. All formsin all four kingdoms thus respond in some degree and manner.3. To the world of quality, or of desire intent. All forms in all kingdomsrespond, en masse, to the urge or the desire aspect of divinity which lies atthe root of the entire evolutionary process. This is recognised as an incentiveand is more or less self-directed in the human family; it is blindly followed bythe forms in the other kingdoms, who respond according to the nature of theirresponse mechanisms to these varying urges.When we deal with the inflow of mental energy and with the forces emanating fromthe fifth plane of mind (higher mind, lower mind and the egoic intelligententity) we enter more entirely into the domain of human evolution itself, andthe vague word “consciousness” could well be superseded by the word “awareness.”In varying degree man is aware, but [136] only man is aware that he is aware.His response apparatus responds to, and is influenced by, all the contacts towhich the subhuman forms respond, but he is also aware of himself, and hisresponse mechanism is capable of reacting, not only to external stimuli but tocontacts emanating from within himself, from the Self so called, and also fromthe worlds of introspection and of mystical vision which seem sealed to allsubhuman forms of life.In the larger picture, with which we are not to occupy ourselves in thistreatise, the planet constitutes the response apparatus of a superhuman Life,and that Life responds consciously to impacts emanating from the solar system asa whole, and from certain constellations (embodied Lives) with which our solarsystem is linked. Similarly the solar Logos functions through the medium of thatgigantic response apparatus which is bounded by the ring-pass-not of a solarsystem. Each form, from that of the tiniest atom to that of a vastconstellation, is an embodiment of a life, which expresses itself asconsciousness, awareness, and responsive sentiency through the medium of sometype of response mechanism. Thus we have the establishing of a universe oflives, interacting and interrelated, all of them conscious, some of themself-conscious, and others group-conscious, but all grounded in the universalmind, all possessing souls, and all presenting aspects of the divine Life.Life, quality, appearance remain thus the primal triplicity. Appearance isobjective, and forms have been studied scientifically, analysed and classified,for ages. Now we are introverting and introspecting, and have the commencementof a cycle wherein the world of quality and of meaning will be subjected to asimilar investigation and classification. This will result in the giving of newvalues to life, to an enriching of our understanding, and will produce, as aresult, the growth and substitution of the intuition for the intellect.[137] May I urge upon all to live more continuously in the world of meaning andless in the world of appearances? It is a truer world and less full of illusion.When the understanding is developed, when men have learnt to see below thesurface and have cultivated true vision, then we shall have the steady emergenceof the quality of the soul in all forms and the relative subsiding into thebackground of the power of the form nature. It is this world of meaning which itis the privilege of humanity to reveal, and all true esoteric students should bepioneers in this field."},{"pageContent":"SECTION 1 - CHAPTER III ... TEN BASIC PROPOSITIONS[141] In concluding this section of our treatise, and before starting on ourreal study of the rays, I seek to formulate for you the fundamental propositionsupon which all this teaching is founded. They are for me, a humble worker in theHierarchy, as they are for the Great White Lodge as a whole, a statement of factand of truth. For students and seekers they must be accepted as an hypothesis:One : There is one Life, which expresses Itself primarily through seven basicqualities or aspects, and secondarily through the myriad diversity of forms.Two : These seven radiant qualities are the seven Rays, the seven Lives, whogive Their life to the forms, and give the form world its meaning, its laws, andits urge to evolution.Three : Life, quality and appearance, or spirit, soul and body constitute allthat exists. They are existence itself, with its capacity for growth, foractivity, for manifestation of beauty, and for full conformity to the Plan. ThisPlan is rooted in the consciousness of the seven ray Lives.Four : These seven Lives, Whose nature is consciousness and Whose expression issentiency and specific quality, produce cyclically the manifested world; Theywork together in the closest union and harmony, and cooperate intelligently withthe Plan of which They are the custodians. They are the [142] seven Builders,Who produce the radiant temple of the Lord, under the guidance of the Mind ofthe Great Architect of the Universe.Five : Each ray Life is predominantly expressing Itself through one of the sevensacred planets, but the life of all the seven flows through every planet,including the Earth, and thus qualifies every form. On each planet is a smallreplica of the general scheme, and every planet conforms to the intent andpurpose of the whole.Six : Humanity, with which this treatise deals, is an expression of the life ofGod, and every human being has come forth along one line or other of the sevenray forces. The nature of his soul is qualified or determined by the ray Lifewhich breathed him forth, and his form nature is coloured by the ray Lifewhich—in its cyclic appearance on the physical plane at any particular time—setsthe quality of the race life and of the forms in the kingdoms of nature. Thesoul nature or quality remains the same throughout a world period; its form lifeand nature change from life to life, according to its cyclic need and theenvironing group condition. This latter is determined by the ray or rays inincarnation at the time.Seven : The Monad is the Life, lived in unison with the seven ray Lives. OneMonad, seven rays and myriads of forms,—this is the structure behind themanifested worlds.Eight : The Laws which govern the emergence of the quality or soul, through themedium of forms, are simply the mental purpose and life direction of the rayLords, Whose purpose is immutable, Whose vision is perfect, and Whose justice issupreme.Nine : The mode or method of development for humanity is self-expression andself-realisation. When this process is consummated the self expressed is the OneSelf or the ray Life, and the realisation achieved is the revelation of God asthe [143] quality of the manifested world and as the Life behind appearance andquality. The seven ray Lives, or the seven soul types, are seen as theexpression of one Life, and diversity is lost in the vision of the One and inidentification with the One.Ten : The method employed to bring about this realisation is experience,beginning with individualisation and ending with initiation, thus producing theperfect blending and expression of life-quality-appearance.This is a brief statement of the Plan. Of this the Hierarchy of Masters in Itsseven divisions (the correspondences of the seven rays) is the custodian, andwith Them lies the responsibility in any century of carrying out the next stageof that Plan."},{"pageContent":"SECTION 2 - CHAPTER I ... THE SEVEN CREATIVE BUILDERS, THE SEVEN RAYS[149] We have now completed our first section, and have therefore laid thegroundwork for our future studies. First, I seek to give a brief exegesis of thebasic theory of The Secret Doctrine , called the hylozoistic theory. This positsa living substance, composed of a multiplicity of sentient lives which arecontinuously swept into expression by the “breath of the divine Life.” Thistheory recognises no so-called inorganic matter anywhere in the universe, andemphasizes the fact that all forms are built up of infinitesimal lives, which intheir totality—great or small—constitute a Life, and that these composite lives,in their turn, are a corporate part of a still greater Life. Thus eventually wehave that great scale of lives, manifesting in greater expression and reachingall the way from the tiny life called the atom (with which science deals) up tothat vast atomic life which we call a solar system.This is a briefly and inadequately expressed definition of the doctrine ofhylozoism, and is an attempt to interpret and find a meaning in the manifestedphenomenal world, with its three main characteristics oflife-quality-appearance. Forget not to find the meaning behind all forms andlife experiences, and thereby learn to enter into that world of subjectiveforces which is the true world wherein all occultists work.Let us take these three words and seek to understand their significance inrelation to the rays.[150] As to the significance of the word “life” our task is wellnighinsuperable, for no human being has, or can have, any comprehension of thenature of life until he has attained the third initiation. I repeat this withemphasis, and in order to impress upon you the futility of idle speculation uponthis subject. Disciples who have undergone the third initiation and have climbedthe mount of Transfiguration can—from that high point—glimpse the radiance ofthe subjective centre of energy (the central spiritual sun of The SecretDoctrine ) and so gain a flash of realisation as to the meaning of the word“life.” But they cannot, and they dare not, pass on the knowledge gained. Theirefforts to convey such information would be futile, and language itself would beinadequate to the task. Life is not what anyone has hitherto surmised. Energy(in contradistinction to force, and using the word to express the emanatingcentre which differentiates into forces) is not what idle speculation hasportrayed it to be. Life is the synthesis of all activity—an activity which is ablend of many energies, for life is the sum total of the energies of the sevensolar systems, of which our solar system is but one. These, in their totality,are the expression of the activity of that Being Who is designated in ourhierarchical archives as the “One About Whom Naught May Be Said.” Thisseven-fold cosmic energy, the fused and blended energies of seven solar systems,including ours, sweeps automatically through each of the seven, carrying thequalities of1. Impulse towards activity.2. Active impulse towards organisation.3. Active organised impulse towards a definite purpose.I have worded these impulses as above in order to show the emergent tendencythrough their mutual interplay. This triple energetic impulse, borne on theimpetus of the seven great [151] breaths or rays, started the world process ofBecoming, and manifested as the urge towards evolution,—towards an evolutionwhich is active, organised, and which works undeviatingly and unerringly towardsa specific goal. This goal is known in its fullest measure only to thatincomprehensible Existence Who works through seven solar systems (in their turnthe expression of seven great Lives) just as our solar Deity works through theseven planetary Logoi. All this has been hinted at and outlined in A Treatise onCosmic Fire , and I do not propose enlarging upon it here. I would point out,however, because it has a definite bearing on the evolution of quality in thehuman family, that the seven creative Builders or planetary Logoi of our solarsystem are embodiments of the will, energy, and magnetic force which streamsthrough Them from the seven solar systems into Their various spheres ofactivity. Thus, through Their united activity, the organised solar system isproduced, whose energies are in constant circulation and whose emergingqualities are balanced and demonstrated throughout the entire system. All partsof the solar system are interdependent; all the forces and energies are inconstant flux and mutation; all of them sweep in great pulsations, and through aform of rhythmic breathing, around the entire solar atom; so that the qualitiesof every solar life, pouring through the seven ray forms, permeate every formwithin the solar ring-pass-not, and thus link every form with every other form.Note therefore the fact that each of the seven rays or creative Buildersembodies the energy, will, love and purpose of the Lord of the solar system, asthat Lord in His turn embodies an aspect of the energy, will, love and purposeof the “One About Whom Naught May Be Said.” Therefore the first proposition tobe grasped by the student of the rays is as follows: [152]I. Every ray Life is an expression of a solar Life, and every Planet isconsequently ...1. Linked with every other planetary life in the solar system.2. Animated by energy emanating from one or other of the seven solar systems.3. Actuated by a triple stream of life forces coming from:a. Solar systems outside our own.b. Our own solar system.c. Its own planetary Being.It is impossible for the average thinker to grasp the significance of thisstatement, but he can understand somewhat the statement that every planet is afocal point through which forces and energies circulate and flow ceaselessly,and that these energies emanate from the outer cosmos or universe itself, fromthe solar system of which his own planet is a part, and of which our sun is thecentre, and from that Being Who constitutes our own particular planetary Lord orLife.I should like at this point to make clear the distinction between aconstellation and a solar system, according to the esoteric teaching, eventhough the modern scientist may not agree.A solar system consists of a sun as the central focal point, with its series ofattendant planets, which are held in magnetic rapport in their orbits aroundthat sun.A constellation consists of two or more solar systems or series of suns withtheir attendant planets. These systems are held together as a coherent whole bythe powerful interrelation of the suns, whose magnetic rapport is so balancedthat occultly “they tread the Path together within the radius of each other’spower;” they preserve their relative distances, and vitalise their planets, butat the same time they preserve an equality of balance and of influence. In a fewrare cases this balance is disturbed, and there is a waxing or a waning ofinfluence and of magnetic power.[153] This condition is governed by a cosmic law of rhythm so obscure as to beincomprehensible at this time.An illustration of this waxing and waning of influence and of radiance(synonymous terms in occultism) on a large scale can be seen today in theconstellation Gemini, wherein one of the twins is increasing in brilliance andpower, and the other is decreasing. But this is a somewhat unique example,esoterically.The relation of the constellations to the solar system, which is the basis ofastrological research, will be considered later. I seek to point out here onlythe dual fact that the seven rays are themselves1. Expressions of energies emanating from the seven solar systems, which are, intheir turn, animated by the Life of the “One About Whom Naught May Be Said.”2. Influenced by, and therefore under the astrological control of, the twelveconstellations whose energies are contacted by our solar system during thecourse of the journey of our sun through the greater Zodiac, during the vastperiod of approximately 25,000 years, and in a lesser degree during the courseof the twelve months of the year, wherein the lesser path of the Zodiac istrodden.The complexity of the subject is very great, and only the broad general outlineof the system, and the basic principles governing the law of evolution, can bedimly sensed and grasped. The sweep of the subject is so vast that the concretemind and the rationalising nature lose themselves in the realised complexitiesand problems. But the illumined intuition, with its power to synthesise (whichis the emerging characteristic of the disciples and initiates under training),can and does lead them into a measured sequence of expansions of consciousnesswhich eventually land them at last on the summit of the Mount [154] ofTransfiguration. From that eminence the disciple can gain the vision which willenable him to see the whole scheme in a moment of time, and to share with Arjunathe experience of the Gita wherein he “saw all forms gathered together in thebody of that God of Gods.” He can then descend from that mountain with hispersonality transfigured and radiant. Why? Because he now knows that spirit is afact and the basis of immortality; he knows, past all controversy, that there isa Plan, and that the love of God is the basic law of all manifestation and theorigin of all evolutionary momentum; and he can rest back upon the knowledgethat the fact of spirit, the immediacy of love and the synthetic scope of thePlan provide a foundation upon which he can place his feet, take his stand withassurance, and then go forward in certain confidence of an assured goal.Our second statement of fact is therefore:II. Each one of the rays is the recipient and custodian of energies coming from1. The seven solar systems.2. The twelve constellations.Each ray passes these energies through its body of manifestation (a planet), andthereby imparts them to the planetary form, and to all forms upon and within it.These differentiated forms are therefore animated by energy coming from thecosmic Life, from the solar Deity, and from the planetary Life, and areconsequently coloured by qualities from the seven solar systems and the twelveconstellations. This blend of energies, working on substance, produces theforms, and each subjective form, in its turn, produces the outer appearance.It is not possible for us to study these forces and qualities in detail,especially in connection with an individual human being, for the scale is sominute, relatively, and the detail to be considered is so intricate. But thenature of the qualities [155] and energies can be somewhat grasped as we studythe seven ray Lives with their seven psychological types, and the twelvecreative Hierarchies, as outlined for us in The Secret Doctrine. The 7+12=19,and if you add to these 19 expressions of the Life the 3 major aspects of Deity,which we call the life of God the Father, the love of God the Son, and theactive intelligence of God the Holy Ghost, you arrive at the mystic number 22which is called (in esotericism) the number of the adept. This simply means thatthe adept is one who comprehends the nature of the 19 forces as they expressthemselves through the medium of the triple divine manifestation, as it in itsturn relates itself to human consciousness. It does not mean that the adept hasmastered and can wield these 19 types of energy. They are consciously wieldedonly by the three synthetic Builders or Creators, Who are:1. The Life which expresses Itself through seven solar systems.The One About Whom Naught May Be Said.2.The Life which expresses Itself through seven planets.The Solar Deity . . . God.3. The Life which expresses Itself through seven planetary centres, orcontinents.The Planetary Logos . . . The Ancient of Days.What the adept has done has been to bring his seven centres of force, located inthe etheric body, into a responsive condition to the higher spiritual forces; ashe progresses he will find that he will gradually and sequentially becomeequally responsive to the above three types of synthetic force.On the path of discipleship, and until the third initiation, he learns torespond to the energy and to the spiritual purpose of the Life of his ownplanet. At the first and second initiations, and until the third initiation, hehas been led on and initiated by the influence of the Christ, and under Hisdirection he has submitted to two expansions of consciousness and [156] hasprepared himself for a third. When ready for this, he comes under the initiatorypower of the planetary Logos; and through the mediating activity of that greatBeing the initiate becomes actively aware of energy emanating from the solarDeity. He is therefore learning to respond to the second type of syntheticforce.After he has taken the highest initiation possible on this planet, he is, forthe first time, responsive to energy emanating from the outer cosmic Centre .This last stage of expansion is rare indeed, and only one hundred and elevenhuman beings, during our planetary history, have passed on to this state ofawareness.Of what use is this information to you or to any student? Practically none,beyond indicating the vastness of the Plan and the amazing scope of the humanconsciousness. What that contact with the highest type of synthetic force maymean, I cannot tell you. The planetary Logoi themselves walk in the light ofthat sublime Consciousness, and towards that privilege the Christ Himself, andHis great Brother, the Buddha, with the three Buddhas of Activity, are at thistime aspiring. More than that I know not, nor may I further enlarge upon thematter. But the wonder and the immensity of the drama unfolding in the universeis a proof of its reality, and the grasp of man, small though it may appear tobe, is a guarantee of his divinity. Stage by stage we slowly make our approachto the goal of conscious and intelligent awareness. Step by step we aremastering matter and making more adequate the mechanism of awareness and ofcontact. Little by little we (and by that I mean the human family, as a whole)are approaching the “place of recognition,” and are preparing to climb themountain of vision. If aspirants but realised the wonders of that revelation,and if they grasped the magnificence of the reward [157] given to their efforts,we would have less failure, more courage, a greater and steadier achievement,and consequently a more rapidly illumined world.The scope of that imparted vision warrants careful study, and the proffering ofthe divine ambition to the soul for recognition. It is not the multitude ofwords read which is of moment, but the accuracy of the recording by the brainand the adaptation of the teaching to the individual need. The vision cannot beappropriated. It is ever on ahead, but if the entire life is given to vision,and if the serving of one’s fellow man is overlooked, the vision profits not. Ihave sought to convey the magnitude of the Plan and the steps upon theevolutionary stairway which lie ahead of every aspirant and of every member ofthe hierarchy.I. THE RAYS AND LIFE-QUALITY-APPEARANCEWe come at this time to consideration of the rays, which brings us immediatelyinto the realm of psychology and of the various psychological influences. As wedeal with the second of the ray manifestations, with the Quality aspect, we aredealing with those pre-determining factors which produce the myriaddifferentiations in the phenomenal world. The quality, the colouring, or thetype nature of living energy (which is our inadequate definition of the word“life”) settles or determines the aspect assumed and the characteristicsexpressed by all the forms in the four kingdoms of nature; the individual formemanations are settled thereby, and under the modifying influence of the contactof the living quality with the substance affected and with the kingdom which isthe focus of attention, there is consequently produced the characteristicappearance, the specialised activity and the [158] intrinsic emanation of anyform in any kingdom. In my earlier books, I divided the rays into two groups:Group I. . . Rays of Aspect, the three major rays.Group II. . .Rays of Attribute, the four minor rays.The three great rays, which constitute the sum total of the divinemanifestation, are aspect rays, and this for two reasons:First, they are, in their totality, the manifested Deity, the Word inincarnation. They are the expression of the creative purpose, and the synthesisof life, quality and appearance.Secondly, they are active in every form in every kingdom, and they determine thebroad general characteristics which govern the energy, the quality and thekingdom in question; through them the differentiated forms come into being, thespecialised lives express themselves, and the diversity of divine agents fulfilltheir destiny in the plane of existence allocated to them.Along these three streams of qualified life-force the creative agencies of Godmake their presence powerfully felt, and through their activity every form isimbued with that inner evolutionary attribute which must eventually sweep itinto line with divine purpose, inevitably produce that type of consciousnesswhich will enable the phenomenal unit to react to its surroundings and thusfulfill its destiny as a corporate part of the whole. Thus intrinsic quality andspecific type radiation become possible. The interplay of these three raysdetermines the outer phenomenal appearance, attracts the unity of life into oneor other of the kingdoms in nature, and into one or other of the myriaddivisions within that kingdom; the selective and discriminating process isrepeated until we have the many ramifications within the four kingdoms, thedivisions, groups within a division, families and branches. Thus the creativeprocess, in its wondrous beauty, sequence and unfoldment, [159] stands forth toour awakening consciousness, and we are left awestruck and bewildered at thecreative facility of the Great Architect of the Universe.Looking at all this beauty from a symbolic angle, and thereby simplifying theconcept (which is ever the work of the worker in symbols), we might say that RayI embodies the dynamic idea of God, and thus the Most High starts the work ofcreation.Ray II is occupied with the first formulations of the plan upon which the formmust be constructed and the idea materialised, and (through the agencies of thisgreat second emanation) the blue prints come into being with their mathematicalaccuracy, their structural unity and their geometrical perfection. The GrandGeometrician comes thus to the forefront and makes the work of the Builderspossible. Upon figure and form, number and sequences will the Temple be built,and so embrace and express the glory of the Lord. The second ray is the ray ofthe Master Builder.Ray III constitutes the aggregate of the active building forces, and the GreatArchitect, with His Builders, organises the material, starts the work ofconstruction, and eventually (as the evolutionary cycle proceeds upon its way)materialises the idea and purpose of God the Father, under the guidance of Godthe Son. Yet these three are as much a unity as is a human being who conceivesan idea, uses his mind and brain to bring his idea into manifestation, andemploys his hands and all his natural forces to perfect his concept. Thedivision of aspects and forces is unreal, except for the purpose of intelligentunderstanding.The readers of this treatise who really want to profit by this teaching musttrain themselves ever to think in terms of the whole. The arbitrary tabulations,the divisions into triplicities and septenates, and the diversified enumerationof forces [160] which are seen as emanating from the seven constellations, theten planets, and the twelve mansions of the zodiac, are but intended to give thestudent an idea of a world of energies in which he has to play his part. Fromthe standpoint of esoteric psychology, it should be noted that all the schoolsof psychology go astray in their handling of the human unit, for just thisreason; they do not judge a man as a synthetic whole, and—owing to the lack ofknowledge, and to the failure, as yet, of the intuitive faculty—the averagepsychologist seldom enters into the realms of true quality and of the lifeaspect; the man under investigation is considered more or less objectively, andthe true sources of the phenomenal nature are seldom touched. The determiningaspects of the personality ray which produce the sum total of the physical,emotional and mental qualities is in process of tabulation and research and muchhas been done of a valuable nature. A man’s physical reactions, his emotionalhabits, and his mental processes—normal and abnormal—are far better understoodthan they were twenty-five years ago. Nevertheless, until there is a moreadequate knowledge of ray qualities, and until a man’s soul ray is determinedand the effect of that ray upon the personality ray is charted and known, thetrue nature of his temperament and the real subjective cause of his variedreactions, his complexes and inhibitions will remain a problem most difficult tohandle. When, for instance, psychologists realise that it is the play of soulquality and energy which determines whether a man in any particular life willfunction as an introvert or an extrovert, then they will work to produce thatbalancing of the ray forces which will make the man able to express himself insuch a way that the path to the outer world is left open, and that to the innerworld is also cleared of obstacles.What is the real nature of a true mystic or introvert? He is [161] one whosesoul force, ray or quality is too strong for the personality to handle. The manthen finds that the path to the inner worlds of desire-emotion, of mind and ofspiritual vision are, for him, the line of least resistance, and the physicalplane integration and expression suffer as a consequence. The “pull” of the souloffsets the outer “pull,” and the man becomes a visionary mystic. I refer not tothe practical mystic who is on the way to becoming a white occultist. Thereverse condition can also be true, and then you have the pure extrovert. Thepersonality ray focusses itself upon the physical plane, and the inner lure ofthe soul is temporarily offset, sometimes for several lives. Where this outercondition and “pull” is over-strong, and when all the personality ray qualitiesare focussed to a point, you will have either a display of exhibitionism, as itis called, or a constructive high grade personality, expressing genius and thecreative possibilities of a coordinated physical, emotional and mentalexpression. The manifestation of this coordination will be outward into theworld of doing, and not inward into the world of being or of the soul. Boththese conditions indicate the “genius towards perfection”; where the equipmentis mediocre, you have a thwarted or frustrated complex and a strong sense ofinferiority which may diverge towards an abnormal exhibitionism. Where theequipment is fine and trained, you will have a brilliant worker in the varyingfields of human endeavour. When, as is occasionally the case, you have added tothe above a tendency to introvert, with the consequences of soul knowledge andof intuitional development, you then have a leader of men, a teacher from thegods, and a spiritual power. Hence the value to psychologists in these moderndays (temporarily at least) if they will interest themselves in the hypothesesof the school of esoteric psychology. They may gain thereby, and in any casethey lose nothing.[162] The four rays of attribute, which find their synthesis in the third ray ofaspect, produce the varying qualities in greater detail than do the three raysof aspect. It might generally be stated, as we endeavour to clarify our problem,that the three rays of aspect find their main expression in relation to mankindthrough the medium of the three periodical vehicles:Ray I Power Life Ideas The Monad Ray II Love-Wisdom Consciousness Ideals TheSoul Ray III Active Intelligence Appearance Idols PersonalityThey find their secondary expression in the three bodies which form thepersonality of man:Ray I Power Ideas Mental body Purpose. Life. Ray II Love Ideals Astral bodyQuality. Ray III Intelligence Idols Physical Body Form.The rays of attribute, though expressing themselves equally on all the planesand through the periodical vehicles and the three aspects of the personality,find their main expression through one or other of the four kingdoms in nature:Ray IV Harmony, Conflict 4th kingdom Human. The Balance. Ray V ConcreteKnowledge 3rd kingdom Animal. Ray VI Devotion 2nd kingdom Vegetable. Ray VIICeremonial Ritual 1st kingdom Mineral.These are their main fields of influence in the three worlds, and upon this weshall later enlarge.In relation to mankind, these four rays of attribute find a wide expression inconnection with the four aspects of the personality, or with the quaternary. Therelationship is as follows:Ray IV Harmony through Conflict the Physical body. Ray V Concrete Knowledge theEtheric body. Ray VI Devotion the Astral body. Ray VII Organisation the Mentalbody.[163] But again remember that the interrelation and interplay is synthetic onall planes, on the formless levels and also on the planes of form, and in thisconnection, with all states of consciousness and throughout the createduniverse.THE SEVEN RAYSWe are told that seven great rays exist in the cosmos. In our solar system onlyone of these seven great rays is in operation. The seven sub-divisionsconstitute the “seven rays” which, wielded by our solar Logos, form the basis ofendless variations in His system of worlds. These seven rays may be described asthe seven channels through which all being in His solar system flows, the sevenpredominant characteristics or modifications of life, for it is not to humanityonly that these rays apply, but to the seven kingdoms as well. In fact there isnothing in the whole solar system, at whatever stage of evolution it may stand,which does not belong and has not always belonged to one or other of the sevenrays.The following table may explain the various characteristics of the seven rays:No. Characteristics. Methods of development. Planet. Colour. (according toBesant.) I Will or Power Raja Yoga Uranus representing Sun. Flame. II Wisdom.Balance. Intuition Raja Yoga Mercury Yellow. Rose.

Blue. VII Ceremonial Order Ceremonial observances. Controlover forces of nature. Jupiter Bright. Clear. Blue.[164] It will be clear that each of the kingdoms—elemental, mineral, vegetable,and animal as well as the human—is divided into seven primary types or rays, andas individualisation (i.e. the transition from the animal to the human kingdom)can take place at present only through association with man, it follows thatthere must stand at the head of the animal kingdom, on each ray, some species ofanimal susceptible to human influence through which such individualisation cantake place. The elephant is said to stand at the head of the second ray type ofanimal, while the cat and dog occupy a similar position on the fourth and sixthrays respectively. We have had no information as to the others, with thisexception, that the animals of the first ray are no longer in existence onearth.Besides regarding the rays as the channels through which all being flows, wemust recognise them as influences operating on the world in turn. Each ray hasits period of greatest [165] influence to which all are subject to aconsiderable extent, not merely those belonging by nature to that particularray, but those on all the other rays as well. The long period of influence ofeach is divided into seven stages, each of which is qualified by the influenceof the greater ray period, being intensified when its own sub-ray period isreached (i.e. the sixth ray influence is greatest during the period of the sixthsub-ray). We must carefully note that the term “sub-ray” is used merely forconvenience to designate the shorter period of influence, not as indicating anydifference in the nature of the ray.We are told that the dominant ray at the present time, though passing out, isthe sixth, the Ray of Devotion, and that this ray was already in operationbefore the dawn of Christianity; also that the seventh sub-ray became themodifying influence about seventy-five years ago (1860), and of course willcontinue as such. The first outcome of this seventh subray influence was theEcumenical Council at Rome (1870), with its declaration of Papal Infallibility.The Tractarian Movement in England started at the same time, whilst the progressof the seventh sub-ray influence, still going on, is marked by the steadyincrease of ritualism and sacerdotalism in the various churches, and even in thechurch of Rome there has been a distinct tightening of priestly authority in allmatters of dogma and practice. So much for its influence on religious thought;its other aspects will be considered later.We have also been told that the religious revival under Wesley and Whitfield inEngland was under the sixth subray, and I think we are justified in drawing theinference that the rise of Molinos and the Quietists in Spain and CentralEurope, and of St. Martin and his band of spiritual philosophers in France andelsewhere, may have also marked the [166] progress of the same period, duringwhich the Ray of Devotion was accentuated by its own sixth sub-ray.With these few isolated facts before us we may perhaps conclude that the timeduring which each sub-ray exerts its modifying influence is between one hundredand fifty and two hundred years.We do not know how often (perhaps seven times?) the sub-rays are repeatedsuccessively within the cycle of the great ray. It must manifestly be more thanonce, seeing that the great sixth ray was operating before the rise ofChristianity. It is also apparent that Buddhism cannot have been, as was at onetime thought, the last outcome of the great second ray period, for the intervalbetween the rise of Buddhism and that of Christianity was only five hundredyears. It seems probable that Buddhism arose under the influence of the secondsub-ray of the great sixth ray period. In attempting to trace back the influencewhich was the last outcome of the sub-rays, 5.4.3. 2. and 1, it has beensuggested that this period of the Alchemists and Rosicrucians may have beendominated by the fifth sub-ray; the epoch of the Flagellants and other fanaticalenthusiasts who practised self -torture and mutilation was influenced by thefourth sub-ray; and the time when astrology was widely practised as representingthe third sub-ray; while the earlier epoch of the gnostics may have been theoutcome of the second sub-ray. But these are only conjectures, and while thelast named is possible, there can be no such correspondence of time in theprevious cases, as the Alchemists, Flagellants, and Astrologers were all more orless contemporary during the Middle Ages.The rise of modern spiritualism is no doubt due to the seventh sub-rayinfluence, and it may also be a foreshadowing of the great seventh ray still tocome. It is interesting to note that this movement was started by a secretsociety which has [167] existed in the world since the last period of seventhray dominance in Atlantean times.Every great religion which arises is under the influence of one or other of therays, but it does not necessarily follow that each successive ray should have agreat far-reaching religion as its outcome. We have heard that Brahmanism is thelast great religion which arose under first ray influence; we do not know whatmay have been the religion which was the outcome of the last second ray period;but the Chaldean, the Egyptian and the Zoroastrian religions may be taken asrepresenting the third, the fourth, and the fifth rays respectively.Christianity and probably Buddhism were the result of sixth ray influence.Mohammedanism, which numbers so large a following, is also under sixth rayinfluence, but it is not a great root religion, being a hybrid offshoot ofChristianity with the tinge of Judaism.The rays are sometimes considered as divided into three classes; the first rayby itself, the second ray by itself, and the other five in a group. Whenregarded in this way, they are spoken of as the three rays, and typify thevarious Trinities. Another suggestive fragment of symbology describes the threerays as using respectively three kinds of fire to light the sacrifice of thealtar,—the electric, the solar, and the artificial, or fire by friction.Before proceeding to consider the virtues, the vices and the special humancharacteristics which differentiate the individual belonging to one ray from theindividual on another ray, it will be well to refer to the origin of the two rayinfluences which constitute the dominant and the modifying factors in thecharacter of every human being, as well as to the planetary influence, or theray of the personality, which again modifies these two great influences duringany given life.[168] We have seen that seven rays are seven differentiations of one greatcosmic ray, effected within the very being of our solar Logos before He beganHis creation. Now we know that the divine spark, the divine centre ofconsciousness in each one of us, comes from the highest principle of our Logos;it has therefore within it the potentiality of all the rays, but from the timewhen our Logos formed within Himself the countless centres of divineconsciousness, each one of these centres was coloured by the special attributesof one or other of the rays. Seeing that the moment each became limited (i.e.separated from the absolute consciousness of the Logos by even the finest veilof differentiation) it must necessarily belong to one or other of the rays, thevery essence of our being, the central spark of the divine in each one of us,may thus be said to belong to one or other of the seven rays, and this may bespoken of as a man’s primary ray.It will be remembered that the first great outpouring from the Logos vivifieduniversal substance and caused every atom of matter within the “ring-pass-not”of His system to vibrate in seven different measures of vibration. The secondoutpouring caused molecular combinations, thus forming the six subplanes belowthe atomic on each plane, and produced form. It was at the time of the secondoutpouring that each of the divine centres of consciousness put forth a threadof being into an atom of the highest sub-planes of the atmic, the buddhic, andthe manasic planes,—atoms destined to be the nuclei of the future bodies, eachon its respective plane, the three forming the upper triad so often referred to.Now every atom is under the influence of one or other of the rays, and theatmic, buddhic and manasic atoms referred to all belong to the same ray; butthis is not necessarily the same ray as that to which the over-shadowing centreof consciousness belongs. In fact, in the majority of cases, the ray of the[169] centre of consciousness and the ray of the triad are different; the onemodifies the other, the former being the primary (called by Mrs. Besant themonadic ray), the other being the secondary or individual ray, since the manasicatom is the nucleus of the future causal body in which the individual passesfrom life to life. This body is of course gradually built up of particles ofmatter belonging to the same quality and type as its nucleus atom, and when itis so built through long ages of evolution, the over-shadowing divine centre ofconsciousness, which has through the ages also evolved individually, unites withit, and the immortal individual Ego starts on its upward climb through the humankingdom. This is the third outpouring for each soul. The influence of thissecondary or individual ray constitutes the main factor in the earlier stages ofevolution, i.e., in the elemental, mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms; butof course the deepest rooted influence must be that which affects the divinecentre of consciousness; therefore when the union above referred to takes place,and the entity has become the re-incarnating ego, the primary ray becomes andremains the dominant force.But there is still another influence to be spoken of. This is the planetary rayunder which each human being is born, It must of course be understood that theso-called influence of a planet is really the influence of the Hierarchy rulingover that planet. This personal ray is an important factor in the character of aman during the one lifetime of its operation. I say one lifetime, but it may ofcourse be one or more, if the karmic conditions demand it, for the moment ofbirth for every individual is fixed in accordance with karmic necessities, andprobably all of us—whatever our primary or individual rays—have passed lifetimesagain and again under the personal influence of all the seven rays.2. THE PRESENT RAY PLAN AND THE WORKERS[170] The work of the first and second rays is primarily instrumental in thework of materialising the Plan of God for our world and causing itsmanifestation. It would be of interest at this point to consider the Plan as itis at present working out, for the reason that these two types of ray force,that of power-will and that of love-wisdom, are predominantly operative at thistime. All the workers along other lines of force—whether manifesting objectivelyor active subjectively—have temporarily subordinated their interests and to somedegree cancelled their previous arrangements, in order to meet the need of theworld. There is a Plan now coming into effect, and this has demanded theattention and called for the loyal cooperation of all departments of the worldgovernment. In all organised endeavour and in all wide schemes of constructionand of work there must ever be the subordination of certain factors to otherfactors, and never more so than in the working out, at this time, of theHierarchical Plan.If the teachings in this treatise are to achieve the purpose for which they areintended, it is essential that scattered through the occult generalities and theuniversal concepts there should be those points of immediate and imperativeinterest which will make this treatise of practical usefulness and of livingapplication.In A Treatise on White Magic I outlined one of the first steps taken by theHierarchy in the work of inaugurating the new Plan. This Plan was tentativelyformulated in 1900, at one of the great quarterly meetings of the Hierarchy. In1925, at the next great meeting for cooperation, the new Plan was discussed ingreater detail, certain necessary changes [171] (growing out of the results ofthe World War) were negotiated, and the members of that important Councildetermined two things:First, that there should be a united effort by the collective members of theplanetary Hierarchy, over a period of several years (that is until 1950), tobring about certain definite results, and that during that time the attention ofthe Great Ones should be turned towards a definite attempt to expand theconsciousness of humanity and to institute a sort of forcing process, so thatmen’s horizon of thought would be tremendously enlarged, and their faith,assurance and knowledge be equally increased and strengthened. It was decidedthat certain areas of doubt should be cleared up.Secondly, it was determined to link more closely and subjectively the seniordisciples, aspirants and workers in the world. To this end, all the Masters putTheir personal groups of disciples in touch with each other, subjectively,intuitively, and sometimes telepathically. Thus the New Group of World Serverscame into being.Instead, therefore, of seven groups of workers in the world, all engrossed withactivities along the seven major lines of force—their place in the schemedetermined by their ray—the Masters, Their disciples and the probationersgrouped themselves into three main divisions, so that the political, thereligious, and the educational departments of human evolution might beadequately served.At the same time They organised the intermediate group of World Servers, whocould act as liaison officers, interpreters, and intermediaries between theinner active Hierarchy and the thinkers of the world, and also serve as agentsin every country and in every group. Thus all groups which were animated by anydesire to serve, and which were (in spite of errors in technique and method) ofany usefulness in [172] aiding their fellow men, were swept into a current ofspiritual stimulation with the intent to increase their effectiveness. Groupsthat were crystallised and sectarian as a whole would fail to respond, but inall of them, even the most dead, there were found a few who were responsive tothe new impulse.The institution of this new Plan automatically brought about an augmentedtraining of those men and women who showed signs of being responsive tosubjective influences and to the intuition. It was found wise to bring about aforcing process, in order to make mankind more sensitive and to develop certainlatent but hidden powers, and also to attempt to bring the more advanced typesof men up to a standard of sensitivity and to a spiritual receptivity which hadbeen hitherto the prerogative of the few mystics and intuitives. During the pastfew years this process has been going on, and the results have proved betterthan had been anticipated. The war, which devastated the world, cleared awaymuch debris.Roughly speaking, the Plan fell into three divisions in the minds of itsorganisers:First, Political.The objective of the work here planned was the development and the establishmentof an international consciousness. This was an effort along the line of power orwill, of government, or along the line of the first ray. Disciples and aspirantsworking in the field of organisation, and the mass of idealists, were organisedin this work, and the seventh and sixth ray workers were brought into line. Thegroups therefore ranged themselves into one group in this endeavour. It was alsodetermined to demonstrate the need for economic synthesis, as part of the workof relating the nations to each other, so that the spirit which is evidenced bysuch an organisation as the Red Cross, for instance, might also be evidencedinternationally [173] in the interplay of the nations with each other. It isneedless to point out that material stress and strain and the wrecking of oldpolitical parties and trade relations had to play their part. It was determinedto demonstrate the necessity of establishing a spirit of internationaldependence and interrelation, so that the nations would be forced to realisepolitically that isolation, separativeness, and the cultivation of a nationalegoism must go, and that a national spirit coloured by a sense of superiority,by class hatreds and racial antagonisms, constitutes a barrier to the truedevelopment of humanity. The people must be taught that the longing to increasepossessions is a deterrent to real expansion. Thus plans were laid whereby theBrotherhood of Nations, based on mutual need, mutual understanding, and mutualhelpfulness, should gradually come into being.It was the establishing of a state of mind which was the primary objective, andnot the establishing of some impossible and mythical Utopia, or of thosematerial conditions whereby one group is entirely subordinated by thewill-to-power of another group which enforces a standardised and uniformcondition through the use of power in some form or another. The work indicated,and therefore set before the New Group of World Servers, is to enunciate thoseprinciples of national relations which underlie a world state or federation, andtheir instructions were to get the ear of the leaders in various countries, andthus slowly and gradually awaken the masses (through them) to the truesignificance of that easily spoken, but little understood word, Brotherhood.This work is perhaps one of the hardest of the tasks which the Society ofOrganised Minds has ever set itself. Racial hatreds and national aspirations areso strong, and the ignorance of the masses is so great, that all the resourcesof the workers along the line of government and power (the first [174] ray) werenecessary to make the needed impact upon the public consciousness. There hasbeen, and there still is, much to destroy before the nations are reduced to thepoint where they will become sensitive to the new vision, and able to recognisetheir need of each other.It has been interesting to note how the idea of the controlled and beneficentlyapplied power of those who work with and through ideas has—during the past fewyears—materialised on the physical plane through the medium of the dictatorshipof the proletariat, of the workers of a nation, as set up in Russia. This hasbeen subversive of the rule and control of the aristocracy, of the bourgeoisieand of the intelligentsia; it has glorified work and the workers, and has drivenout of the country (by death or exile) some of its best elements. Yet behind allthe mistakes and cruelty, and behind the rank materialism, there lie greatideals,—the supply of the need of all, the beauty of mutual service, and thedivinity of constructive work.In Germany, you have the dictatorship of racial superiority, and the attempt todeify a race. Without humour and real understanding, one race is preparing todictate terms to other races, by the weight of its thought and its achievementsrather than by war. Yet the ideal of a superman is a true ideal, and it needsupholding before the world. Temporarily, it has been forgotten that the supermanis the goal for all, and that Asiatics, Nordics, Jews, Gentiles, Americans, andAnglo-Saxons, the Africans and all other world races are children of the sameFather, fed from the same source of Life, and saved by the same divine Christprinciple. Therefore the superman has been and will be found emerging out of theranks of every people, to find his way into the ranks of the Spiritual Hierarchyand the New Group of World Servers.In America, you have the dictatorship of organised business [175] seeking toregulate and control every department of the economic life of the nation, andcutting deep down, through the trained minds in the government, to the veryroots of the national existence. That certain types of mind may regard this asan infringement of the liberty of the subject is of small importance, relativelyspeaking, compared to the gradually emerging synthesis which aims subjectivelyto kill out greed and end the exploitation of the many by the few. In GreatBritain, we find the dictatorship of empire (if such a paradoxical term may beemployed), but it is an empire of the middle classes, controlling and balancing.In Italy, in Turkey and elsewhere other great experiments are going on.The originators of these various national movements are often ignorant of theimpulses which lie back of their work, and are frequently unable to explain theideals toward which they are working, except in terms of human ambition andpower. Nevertheless, unknown to themselves, they are really sensitive to thegreat ideas thrown into their minds by the Minds behind the scenes. They respondto the idea of general good, of human equality, of the superman, of universaltrade requirements, and of the distribution of wealth, but—and here is theimportant point—because the inner synthesis of effort is not emphasised, becausethere is no general knowledge as to the source of the great concepts, and nounderstanding of the inner Brotherhood which is guiding humanity towards anouter Brotherhood, these great principles are being widely distorted, selfishlyapplied, and separately utilised. The fires of class hatreds, of racialantagonisms, and of national pride are burning intensely strong.Such is the problem before the Great Ones at this time. What will They do tobring the nations, through the agency of the inner department of government andthe political rule which we have been considering, to a realisation of their[176] essential unity, and so further that “peace on earth, good will to men” ofwhich we all dream.Second, Religious.The aim before this department is to establish a universal understanding of thenature of reality, and to foster the growth of the spiritual consciousness.Though in some ways religious differences are the hardest to bridge or heal, yetreal progress has been made in this phase of the Hierarchical work. There istoday in the world a very large number of those who fundamentally believe in thebrotherhood of religions. Though the unintelligent masses everywhere have littleor no idea of things spiritual, they can be more easily brought to believe inthe one God and to the idea of a universal faith than to any other idea. Manythousands of them are frankly agnostic or believe in nothing, whilst many otherthousands are restive under the control of theological authority. They havenevertheless within them that germ of the spirit of love which is normallyinclusive and intuitive. Curiously enough, along this line the seething millionsof the Orient present a more serious problem to the Great Ones than do thepeoples of the Occident, for ignorance is deeply prevalent among the masses ofAsia as to the trend of affairs in the world of religion, owing to thewidespread illiteracy of the races, and their consequent easy exploitation andcontrol by the religious demagogues, fervent prophets and reactionaries.Disciples or workers on the second ray are now actively handling this problem.It is interesting to note that the reason for the success in breaking down oldbarriers and in bringing about a condition of spiritual readiness everywhere inthe Occident, is largely due to the work of the Orientalist scholars in France,Germany and England. They have made the literature of the East available, in allits beauty, to the West, [177] and so have linked the spiritual truths of allages with the truth of the Christian presentation, showing them all to be ofequal progressive value. Now the masses in India, China, and northern Africamust be awakened to the inner significance of their own faiths, and to the partthat Christianity plays in the same great religious programme. This is occupyingthe close attention of certain second ray teachers in India, Japan and Syria.During the next ten years the work of the Fellowship of Religions (of which theouter organisations are an externalisation) will greatly increase. Soon we shallhave the inner structure of a world-faith so clearly defined in the minds ofmany thousands that its outer structure will inevitably make its appearancebefore the end of the century.The inner structure of the World Federation of Nations will eventually beequally well organised, with its outer form taking rapid shape by 2025. Do notinfer from this that we shall have a perfected world religion and a completecommunity of nations. Not so rapidly does nature move; but the concept and theidea will be universally recognised, universally desired, and generally workedfor, and when these conditions exist nothing can stop the appearance of theultimate physical form for that cycle.Third, Scientific.The workers along this line have definitely set themselves the goal of expandingman’s consciousness and so widening his horizon that a synthesis of the tangibleand the intangible will take place. This will bring about the entrance ofmankind into a new and subjective realm, and his apprehension of new states ofawareness. These developments will be brought about by the workers in the fieldsof education, of science, and of psychology. Great things are on the way at thistime, and the [178] activities of workers on the third and fifth rays have neverbeen so well directed nor so potent as today.As I told you, and as I now repeat, the workers on all the rays are organised totake part in one supreme effort,—an effort towards which the entire Christianera has been tending and for which it has been a preparation. The seventh andsixth rays are occupied with the work of government and with the task ofproducing a new synthesis, and thus the force of all the workers along thoselines is combining with the energy of the first ray. The energies of theaspirants and disciples on the third and fifth rays are turned to the work ofexpanding the human consciousness, of bringing to light the hidden wonders ofthe universe, and of hastening the unfoldment of the latent powers in mankind.These powers, when awakened, will be extensions of many of the present sensesand will admit man into that world which lies behind the veil of ignorance andmatter.You will note that so strenuous is the work of breaking down national groupisolation and separativeness that it takes the united energies of three groupsof workers to bring about the desired results. The seven groups of workers areorganised therefore as follows:1. In the department of politics First, sixth and seventh rays. 2. In thedepartment of religion Second and fourth rays. 3. In the department of educationThird and fifth rays.Do not forget that, though the work is being carried forward in three fields ofhuman thought and activity, the net result is one directed effort towards theproduction of synthesis and a great preparatory drive towards a revelation ofsuch wonder that I cannot yet detail it. Recognition of its truth is dependentupon inner growth and illumination, and this growth is being speeded up, leadingto an easier recognition of that which is on the way. Remember, revelationseldom [179] comes along the expected lines. There will be a pouring in of lightupon mankind which will alter his conditions of living, change his outlook uponworld affairs, and inaugurate a new age which will be distinguished by anaptitude for group synthesis and cooperation, and by new mental powers, leadingto a re-orientation of the mind so that it can function with equal facility intwo directions. It will be able to turn outward into the world of manifestedforms, and inward into the world of synthesis, of unity and of spirit. Therewill be a fresh attitude towards life which will evidence itself in a bettersense of values, for life will have a meaning hitherto unknown, and we shallhave an interpretation of that meaning which will enrich our daily experience.Towards this end all true workers are now bending every effort.Earlier in this treatise I referred to the areas of doubt which now exist inman’s mind, and I should like briefly to refer to the three major areaswhich—when cleared up—will facilitate the bringing in of the new age with itsnew civilisations, new sciences and new religion. There are three problems whichthe next few years will see well on the way towards an intelligent solution inthe minds of the most conservative, but which will be regarded as definitelysolved by the intuitive and illumined. These three problems might be regarded asconstituting the three main objectives in the fields of science, of politics andof religion. With their solution will come the more rapid success of the worldproblems of government, of faith and of matter. Please note the distinction andsignificance of these last three words.THE PROBLEM OF IDEASIn the final analysis, the main problem of world government is the wise use ofideas. It is here that the power of [180] speech makes itself felt, just as inthe department of religion or of education the power of the written word, of theprinted page, is felt. In the field of politics, the masses are swayed by theirorators, and never more so than now through the use of the radio. Great ideasare dinned into the ear of the public without cessation—theories as todictatorship, communism, nazism, fascism, marxism, nationalism, and democraticideals. Methods of rule by this or that group of thinkers are presented to thepublic, leaving them no time for consideration, or for clear thinking. Racialantipathies are spread, and personal preferences and illusions find expression,bringing about the deception of the unthinking. The man who has a golden tongue,the man who has the gift of playing with words and can voice with emphasispeople’s grievances, the juggler in statistics, the fanatic with a certain andsure cure for social ills, and the man who loves to fan race hatreds, can everget a following. Such men can with facility upset the balance of the communityand lead a body of unthinking adherents to a transient success and power, or toobloquy and oblivion.In the aggregate of this play with ideas, and in the constant impact upon thehuman consciousness of the great concepts which lie back of our evolutionaryprocess, the race is developing the power to think, to choose, and to build asure foundation. Through the evolutionary presentation of these ideas there is asteady march towards a liberty of thought (through the old method of experiment,of discard, and of renewed effort with ever newer concepts) which will enablemankind to build true to the great thought patterns which underlie the outerstructure of our world. The attentive minds of the age are constantly being madesensitive to these patterns, so that the individual mind can recognise them andwrest them out of the darkness into the light of day. Thus [181] will the truepatterns be made available, to play their part in leading the race towards itsdestiny, towards those deeper realisations which mould the racial types, and tothat synthesis of understanding which will result in a realisation ofBrotherhood. Thus thoughts play their part, and the problem of ideas will beincreasingly understood, until the time may come when we shall have our trainedintuitives and thinkers who will be able to work directly in the world ofconcepts and bring through (for the use of the race) the pattern ideas uponwhich to build. In saying this I realise that I may be accused of romancing andof communicating the impossible; but time will demonstrate the truth of thatwhich I predict. The world structure emerges from and is built upon certaininner thought patterns, and it is these thought patterns which are producing thepresent flood of governmental experiments among all nations. But today there isno training given upon the process of contacting the world of patterns and uponthe true interpretation of ideas, and hence the problems. Later, when the racesees its problem with clarity, it will act with wisdom and train with care itsObservers and Communicators. These will be men and women in whom the intuitionhas awakened at the behest of an urgent intellect; they will be people whoseminds are so subordinated to the group good, and so free from all sense ofseparativeness, that their minds present no impediment to the contact with theworld of reality and of inner truth. They will not necessarily be people whocould be termed “religious” in the ordinary sense of that word, but they will bemen of good will, of high mental calibre, with minds well stocked and equipped;they will be free from personal ambition and selfishness, animated by love ofhumanity and by a desire to help the race. Such a man is a spiritual man. [182]THE PROBLEM OF GODIn the world of religion we shall see the solution of the second problem, andthe ridding of the human consciousness of another area of doubt. The fact of Godwill be established and men’s questioning in this respect will end. Such a Godwill not be a national or a racial God; not Christian, Hindu or Buddhist. Such aGod will not be a figment of man’s creative imagination or an extension of hisown consciousness, but a Deity of essential life, who is the sum total of allenergies; the energy of life itself, the energy of love, the energy ofintelligence, of active experience, and that energy which produces the interplaybetween the seen and the unseen; a God most surely transcendent, but at the sametime most assuredly immanent; a God of such immensity that the Heavens proclaimHim, and so intimate that the humblest child can recognise Him.How can this be? you ask. I give a simple reply to your question, and yet one soscientific and so profound in meaning that only when it is realised to be a factin a natural process will it be appreciated with accuracy. Out of the flesh Godwill be seen and known, yet with the eye of the inner vision can God be seeneven when a man is occupying a body of flesh. Not with the physical eye canDeity be seen, though the hallmark of divinity is everywhere. There is an eyewhich can be developed and used, and which will enable its possessor to see Godworking on the inner side of Life, within Himself and within all forms, for“when thine eye is single, thy whole body is full of light.” In that light shallwe see light, and so see God. The three words: electricity, light and life,express divinity, and their synthesis is God. When we know the three as one inour own experience, then we know God. The lowest aspect we are now using, and ofit we are [183] increasingly aware. The second aspect of light is on the pointof revelation, through the right understanding of electrical phenomena. Therelies the clue to the new age, the age of light, of illumination and ofrevelation. The esotericists of the world will understand a little of that towhich I refer, and in their hands lies the training of humanity so that men mayuse that true vision and learn to utilise the “single eye.” I would have younote, however, that the majority of true esotericists are found outside, and notwithin, the bulk of the schools which call themselves esoteric.THE PROBLEM OF IMMORTALITYThe third area of doubt,—doubt as to the fact of immortality—will be solvedbefore long in the realm of science, as the result of scientific investigation.Certain scientists will accept the hypothesis of immortality as a working basisupon which to base their search, and they will enter upon that search with awillingness to learn, a readiness to accept and a desire to formulateconclusions based upon reiterated evidence. These conclusions will, in theirturn, form the basis for another hypothesis. Within the next few years the factof persistence and of the eternity of existence will have advanced out of therealm of questioning into the realm of certainty. The problem will have shiftedfurther back. There will be no question in anyone’s mind that the discarding ofthe physical body will leave a man still a conscious living entity. He will beknown to be perpetuating his existence in a realm lying behind the physical. Hewill be known to be still alive, awake and aware. This fact will be demonstratedin several ways. The development of a power within the physical eye of a humanbeing (a power which has always been there, but which has been very little used)will reveal the etheric body, the “double,” as it is sometimes called; and men[184] will be seen occupying that body in some definite spatial area whilsttheir dead or disintegrating physical body has been left behind. Then again, thegrowth in the number of those people who have the power to use the “single eye,”sometimes called the “reawakened third eye,” will also add to the demonstrationof the truth of immortality, for they will with facility see the man who hasdiscarded his etheric body as well as his physical body. By the very weight oftheir numbers, and by the reputability of their position, they will carry theirpoint. Through a discovery also in the field of photography, now beinginvestigated, will the fact of survival be proven. Through the use of the radioby those who have passed over will communication be eventually set up, andreduced to a true science.Nevertheless, certain imminent happenings will do more to annihilate the veilbetween the seen and the unseen than any other line of activity hithertoinitiated. Of this I may not speak beyond telling you that an illumination willbe set up and a radiance revealed which will result in a tremendous stimulationof mankind and bring about an awakening of a new order. Man will be keyed up toa perception and to a contact which will enable him to see through , which willreveal the nature of the fourth dimension, and will blend the subjective and theobjective together into a new world. Death will lose its terrors, and thatparticular fear will come to an end.Men are so occupied with their demand for light, so earnest in their cry forrelease from the present blindness, and so anxious for relief from thesurrounding chaos, that they are apt to forget that from the inner side there isalso a great effort and “push” to help, on the part of the Custodians of thePlan and Their assistants. This urge on Their part to help is more active thanever before, as human beings demand more [185] potently the privilege of light.A demand from the race, plus a response from the waiting Hierarchy, mustinevitably produce potent results. The urge to know and the urge to teach areassuredly related and a part of the natural process of conscious development.The next few decades will mark a happening of such profound and widespreadconsequences that the present era in which we live will come to be looked uponas the dark ages. Science will penetrate deeper into the realm of theintangible, and work in mediums and with apparatus hitherto unknown. The releaseof the potencies in an atom will mark a revolutionary era, and science will havemuch to discard and much to give as it works with energies and forms of lifehitherto unrecognised. The spiritualists will make a discovery whereby the meansof contact with those who function out of the physical body will be greatlyfacilitated, and a group of mediums will begin to act as intermediaries for anumber of scientists on the inner side of life and those who are still inphysical bodies. Through the activity of the real esoteric schools, a techniqueof training will be instituted which will develop the new powers that willsubstantiate the old truth and turn men’s beliefs into certainties. Through thestimulating and occultly scientific work of the department of religions, menwill come to new knowledge and awareness, and will arrive at an uplift that willbring mankind to the Mount of Transfiguration. Through the work of thedepartment of government, men will come to an understanding of those ideas whichare needed to carry the nations the next step forward to mutual help.I shall try to express the deepest objective of the Brotherhood, so that you canunderstand and cooperate. Humanity is intended to act as a power house throughwhich certain types of divine energy can flow to the various forms of life foundin the subhuman kingdoms. This flow of energy must be intelligently [186]apprehended and intelligently directed, and thus will be brought to an endconditions of decay and of death now prevalent everywhere. Thus mankind can linkthe higher and the lower manifestations of Life, but this will be possible onlywhen men themselves have (within themselves) linked their higher and their loweraspects. This is, and should be, one of the objectives of all esoteric training.Men are intended to acquire the facility to function freely in either direction,and so with ease contact the life of God as it flows through those forms we callsuperhuman, and those which are subhuman. Such is the emerging goal.The next few years will mark an intensive effort on the part of the hierarchyand on the part of the New Group of World Servers. There is a term set to theireffort, and later this type of activity will end, and workers will enter intomore extensive fields, if the work proves effective. Should the spirituallyminded and intellectually constituted people of the race fail at this time toinitiate the Plan, to wrest it out of the unseen and carry it into the realm ofthe seen, then we shall see a period of difficulty and of slower growth, but noentire collapse of the fabric of civilisation as the fear-mongers indicate. Butwe shall anticipate no such failure and no such setback to the carefully laidplans of the Watchers on the inner side. The word has gone out to rally all thedisciples and aspirants of the world to an intensive work, and with that appealfrom the Great Ones I seek to occupy myself. Everyone is needed and must goforward with hope and certainty. The hierarchy is, with concentration, workingand bending every effort to make the plan a success. The New Group of WorldServers are being more closely integrated, and the work they are to do is beingcarefully planned. In London, in New York and in Geneva are three centres oftheir activity, and at Darjeeling and in Tokyo there is a mustering of forces.[187] I challenge the thinkers of the world to drop their sectarianism, theirnationalism, and their partisanships, and in the spirit of brotherhood to workin their particular nation, regarding it as an integral part of a greatfederation of nations,—a federation that now exists on the inner side but waitsfor the activity of the world thinkers to bring it to materialisation on theouter side. I charge them to work in the cause of religion and in the field ofthat particular religion in which they, by an accident of birth or by choice,are interested, regarding each religion as part of the great world religion.They must look upon the activities of their group, society or organisation asdemanding their help, just in so far, and only so far, as the principles uponwhich they are founded and the techniques which they employ serve the generalgood and develop the realisation of Brotherhood.I ask you to drop your antagonisms and your antipathies, your hatreds and yourracial differences, and attempt to think in terms of the one family, the onelife, and the one humanity. I ask for no sentimental or devotional response tothis challenge. I would remind you that hatred and separateness have broughthumanity to the present sad condition. I would add to that reminder, however,the fact that there is in the world today a large enough number of liberated mento produce a change in the attitudes of mankind and in public opinion, if theymeasure up by an act of the will to what they know and believe.I challenge you also to make sacrifices; to give yourself and your time and yourmoney and your interest to carry these ideas to those around you in your ownenvironment and to the group in which you find yourself, thus awakening yourassociates. I call you to a united effort to inculcate anew the ideas ofbrotherhood and of unity. I ask you to recognise your fellow workers in all thegroups and to strengthen their [188] hands. I ask you to seal your lips to wordsof hatred and of criticism, and to talk in terms of brotherhood and of grouprelationships. I beg of you to see to it that every day is for you a new day, inwhich you face new opportunity. Lose sight of your own affairs, your pettysorrows, worries and suspicions, in the urgency of the task to be done, andspread the cult of unity, of love and of harmlessness.I ask you also to sever your connection with all groups which are seeking todestroy and to attack, no matter how sincere their motive. Range yourself on theside of the workers for constructive ends, who are fighting no other groups ororganisations and who have eliminated the word “anti” out of their vocabulary.Stand on the side of those who are silently and steadily building for the neworder—an order which is founded on love, which builds under the impulse ofbrotherhood, and which possesses a realisation of a brotherhood which is basedon the knowledge that we are each and all, no matter what our race, the childrenof the One Father, and who have come to the realisation that the old ways ofworking must go and the newer methods must be given a chance.If you cannot yourself teach or preach or write, give of your thought and ofyour money so that others can. Give of your hours and minutes of leisure so asto set others free to serve the Plan; give of your money so that the work ofthose associated with the New Group of World Servers may go forward withrapidity. Much time you waste on non-essentials. Many of you give little ornothing of time. The same is the case with money. Give as never before, and somake the physical aspects of the work possible. Some give of their very need,and the power they thereby release is great. Those on the inner side aregrateful for the giving by those who can give only at great personal cost.Others give of what they can spare and only when it needs no sacrifice to give.Let that [189] condition also end, and give to the limit, with justice andunderstanding, so that the age of love and light may be more rapidly ushered in.I care not where or to whom you give, only that you give,—little if you have butlittle of time or money, much if you have much. Work and give, love and think,and aid those groups who are building and not destroying, loving and notattacking, lifting and not tearing down. Be not taken in by the speciousargument that destruction is needed. It has been needed, no doubt; but the cycleof destruction is practically over, could you but realise it, and the buildersmust now get busy.I challenge you above all to a deeper life, and I implore you for the sake ofyour fellow men to strengthen your contact with your own soul so that you willhave done your share in making revelation possible; so that you will have servedyour part in bringing in the light, and will therefore be in a position to takeadvantage of that new light and new information, and so be better able to pointthe way and clear the path for the bewildered seeker at that time. Those who arenot ready for the coming events will be blinded by the emerging light andbewildered by the revealing wonder; they will be swept by the living breath ofGod, and it is to you that we look to fit them for the event.Before we proceed further I want to touch upon the apparent contradictions whichoccur (and which may continue to occur) in this treatise. Sometimes a ray willbe spoken of as being in manifestation. At other times it may be referred to asbeing out of manifestation. We may speak about its influence upon a particularkingdom in nature, and then again still another ray may be regarded as of primeimportance. These discrepancies are only apparent, and their cause lies hid inthe right understanding of the Law of Cycles. Until this basic [190] Law ofPeriodicity is comprehended (and this will not be possible until man hassucceeded in developing fourth dimensional vision) it will not be easy to avoidwhat may look like contradictions. At one time a certain ray may be inincarnation and thus of paramount influence, and yet, at the same time, stillanother ray may govern the major cycle,—a cycle of which the ray underconsideration may be only a temporary aspect. For instance, the seventh Ray ofCeremonial Organisation is now coming in, and the sixth Ray of Devotion is goingout; yet this sixth ray is a major ray cycle and its influence will not entirelydisappear for another 21,000 years. At the same time, this sixth ray might wellbe regarded as the sixth sub-ray of the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict,which has been in manifestation for several thousand years and will remainoperative for another 40,000 years. Yet at the same time, this fourth ray is outof manifestation as regards its minor and cyclic influence.I fully realise that this information is of a most confusing nature to thebeginner in occultism, and only those students who conform to the requirement ofgrasping the general outline and the broad basic propositions will be able togather out of these instructions the true, intended perspective. If the readerloses himself in the mass of possible analyses and intricacies of the imparteddetail, he will not emerge into the realm of that clear vision which isintended. When he eliminates the detail and deals with the general conformationof the solar Plan, he will then be enabled to cooperate with the neededintelligence. Read therefore constructively and not critically, knowing that itis not easy to see the Plan as it exists in the minds of the Builders, Who workin the closest cooperation, conforming to the initial Plan, and yet carryingforward Their individual efforts with concentration and sustained enterprise.3. THREE MAJOR PROPOSITIONS[191] We have been studying the significance of the work of the seven creativeBuilders, as They express the life aspect and qualify the phenomenal appearancethrough which the One Life manifests. It is the quality in time and space thatdetermines the phenomenal appearance, and this is the third major proposition ofwhich the two previous are:a. Every ray Life is an expression of a solar Life, and every planet istherefore linked with every other planet, animated by energy from one or otherof the seven solar systems, and actuated by a triple stream of force.b. Every one of the rays is the recipient and custodian of various energies,coming from varying sources.To these two we add:c. It is the quality of a ray Life, in time and space, which determines thephenomenal appearance.In these three propositions you have summed up the basic teaching of thisSection. Here I can point out with success, I believe, the practical efficacy ofa true understanding of these rather advanced occult teachings. If, forinstance, you study the first proposition, you will note how a ray Life is anexpression of a solar Life. Now take this broad idea and make it personallyspecific by referring the same proposition to an individual man, grasping thefact that every personality is intended to be an expression of a solar angel,and is consequently linked to every other solar angel in the kingdom of souls.Each is animated by the energies coming from all the seven groups of solarangels, and is likewise in touch with the life of the planet, of the solarsystem, and with extra-systemic [192] force also. Is this not of vital,practical import? Does it not warrant close study and consideration of theattitude of the personality towards life, and of the measure of success of thesolar angel at any given point in time and space (which is all that thepersonality is, in the last analysis) as it builds and qualifies its phenomenalappearance? Here we can see the scientific value of the study of ideals, ofconcentration upon the virtues and divine qualities, and upon an intellectualanalysis of the divine attributes of any of the great sons of God.Again, the second proposition states that the seven rays, being each therecipient and custodian of energies coming from the universe, bring in the basicconcept of inter-relation, of inter-communication, of inter-dependence, ofcooperative responsibility, and of service . These relationships, as we wellknow, underlie the principle of Brotherhood, which the race is just beginning tograsp and to discuss. Thus one of the major propositions which govern thebuilding forces of the universe is of real practical application to the mentallife and attitude of man today.The first proposition relates to the ego, or solar angel, and its realisation.The second proposition relates to the mental grasp of the “inspired”man—inspired from on high by his solar angel.The third proposition, which states that quality determines the appearance, isintended to control or direct the feeling or desire life of the personality, foraccording to the quality of his desires will be the gradually emergingappearance.Man is innately and truly divine, but the quality of the solar angel only makesits presence felt slowly and during the evolutionary cycle; it demonstrates onlydimly as yet, and only emerges occasionally; though the sum total ofcharacteristics in any one life is coloured by divine quality according to theegoic capacity to control or express, it is distorted by [193] substance in theearly stages almost past all recognition. These three propositions warrantcareful thought and even meditation, for as they express the laws under whichthe seven creative Builders work, so do they express the laws under which theaspirant can now begin to work.4. QUALITY IN THE WORLD OF APPEARANCESWe now take up the definition of the word “quality,” which embodies the secondray aspect. This second aspect is the determining ray or the second manifestingaspect of divinity. It is the Christ or Vishnu aspect; it is the sentientconsciousness aspect of deity in form. I stated also that we would consider itsexpression in the world of phenomena, meaning by this the world of externalappearance and of tangible forms.The quality that emerges through the process of manifesting, and under theimpulse of the divine Life, is love, which functions through the medium of theLaw of Attraction, with the aim of producing an ultimate synthesis inconsciousness. Let us not forget that the objective of our present evolutionaryprocess is the unfoldment of conscious awareness. The entire process is directedtowards that consummation.Quality, in the last analysis, is neither more nor less than the nature of thatawareness, and the response in terms of quality to sentient contact. Through thegradually unfolding mechanism of contact (itself the result of active quality,determining the life of the unit cells which compose the form) the range ofcontacts extends indefinitely, and the response of the living entity to contactbecomes more vital, more understanding in its capacity, and more syntheticallycomprehended. This response develops in two directions: [194]1. It leads to a comprehension of the response apparatus and to a wise use ofthe mechanism of contact.2. It leads also to an understanding of the response of the individualconsciousness to the consciousness contacted. This is brought about through themedium of the response mechanism. This other response apparatus may be eithermore developed or less developed than the one that does the contacting.It is this interplay between the consciousnesses using the mechanisms thatconfers an understanding of quality. This interplay confers an understanding ofthe activity underlying the appearance, and motivating it. Exoteric scienceenables the activity aspect of the phenomenal forms to be apprehended andstudied, and all the many manifestations of the many schools of human thought,which enlarge through their researches the range of human knowledge, have thesame objective. At the same time, they increase our capacity to grasp theintense activity of every form in every kingdom in nature, and of every atom andcell within those forms. Science has led us on from pinnacle to pinnacle ofachievement, till today we are lost in a world of energies. We have been taughtto picture to ourselves a world of vibrating points of force which constitute inthe aggregate all forms of life, and which present to our astonished andbewildered intellects a planetary life which is the sum total of all knownforms. Each form is a universe in itself, and all forms are alive, vibratingwith divine activity. We use the word “energy” to express this activity, andbeyond that we are as yet unable to pass. Energy is life, and energy is alsodeath. Activity is to be sensed and known in the organic and in the inorganic,—avast series of atomic lives built up into structure after structure and found tobe in ceaseless motion. A vast series of living structures, built up [195] intostill greater and more inclusive forms, are all found, again, to be in equallyceaseless motion. These greater structures, in their turn, are found to bevibrant organisms, and so there unfolds before man’s conscious vision nothingbut life and activity, naught but motion and energy, and always a coherence, anordered purpose, a growing synthesis, a Plan, and a Will . To this, science setsits seal, for scientific knowledge is the indication of man’s response, throughthe collective response apparatus of humanity as a whole, to the mechanism ofawareness of the great Life in which we live and move and have our being, theplanetary Logos of our Earth.The esoteric sciences carry us within the form or forms, and enable us topenetrate to the quality aspect. Students would do well to remember thatoccultism may be the study of forces, and that the occultist moves in the worldsof force, but these are also the worlds of quality and of those qualifyingenergies which are seeking to manifest through the world of appearances. As theyachieve this, they will dominate the activity of the form units which constitutethe phenomenal world. There are energies which lie behind the phenomena producedby the activity of the atomic structures; these are latent and unseen and oftenunfelt; they are subjective. The esoteric sciences have one purpose in view, andthat is to produce the gradual emergence of these energies, so that the skilledoccultist can eventually work in a dual yet unified world of force, and be thecreative will which guides, blends and utilises the world of appearances and therealm of qualities. These two types of active creative energies must becontrolled by the creating Will or Life aspect so that they function as one.Therefore the aspirant is taught to turn within; to study motives; to acquainthimself with the qualities which are seeking [196] expression in the outer worldthrough the medium of his outer mechanism. As he learns to do this, the natureof that outer world of mechanisms alters, and he increasingly becomes aware ofthe qualities struggling for expression behind the outer forms. Thus the rangeof his conscious contacts extends, and he passes (through scientific research)from an exoteric understanding of the world of phenomenal appearances to anesoteric comprehension of the world of qualities. Never forget, therefore, thatthis dual apprehension must be emphasized, and that as a man learns to “knowhimself,” he automatically learns to know the quality underlying allappearances. Look therefore for the quality everywhere. This is what we meanwhen we speak of seeing divinity on every hand, of recognising the note soundedby all beings, and of registering the hidden motif of all appearing. Theunawakened man or woman sees the form, notes its forms of activity, and “judgesby appearances.” The awakening aspirant begins to sense some of the beautiesthat lie unrevealed behind all forms; the awakened disciple lays the focus ofhis attention upon the emerging world of qualities, and becomes steadily awareof colour, of new ranges of sound, of an inner evolving and newer responseapparatus which is beginning to enable him to contact the unseen, theintangible, and the unrevealed. He becomes aware of those subjective impulseswhich condition the quality of the life, and which are slowly and graduallyrevealing themselves.It is this unrevealed inner beauty which lies back of the emphasis laid by thechurches upon the cultivation of the virtues, and by the occultists upon the useof a seed thought in meditation. These seed thoughts and virtues serve avaluable and constructive purpose. The Biblical truism that “as a man thinkethin his heart, so is he,” is based on the same basic [197] realisation, and thedistinction between the spiritual man and the man of worldly and materialpurpose consists in the fact that one is attempting to work with the qualityaspect of the life, and the other is focussing his attention upon the appearanceaspect. He may and does employ certain qualities as he so works, but they arethose qualities which have been developed during the evolutionary process of thedivine Life as It has cycled through the subhuman and human kingdoms.Each of the kingdoms in nature has developed, or is developing, one outstandingquality, with the other divine attributes as subsidiary.The mineral kingdom has the quality of activity primarily emphasized, and itstwo extremes are the tamasic quality, or the static inert nature of the mineralworld, and the quality of radio-activity, of radiation which is its beautifuland divinely perfected expression. The goal for all mineral atomic forms is thisradio-active condition, the power to pass through all limiting and environingsubstances. This is initiation, or the entering into a state of liberation, forall mineral appearances, and the organising of all forms in this kingdom underthe influence of the seventh ray.The vegetable kingdom has the quality of attractiveness, expressed in colour,and its liberation, or its highest form of activity, is demonstrated by theperfume of its highest forms of life. This perfume is connected with its sexlife, which has group purpose and which calls to its aid the initiating wind andthe insect world. This is not just a pictorial way of portraying truth. The verynature of perfume, its purpose and intent, is to affect those agencies whichwill produce the spreading and the continuity of the life of the vegetablekingdom. The “aspirants” in the vegetable kingdom, and the most evolved of itsforms, have beauty and perfume, and are susceptible [198] to the hiddeninfluences of Those to Whom is confided the initiating of the life-forms andtheir bringing to a desired perfection. Hence the influence of the sixth Ray ofDevotion upon this kingdom, and the application of the Ray of Devotion which(symbolically expressed) “fixes the eye upon the sun; turns the life ever to therays of warmth, and causes the blending of the colours and the glory of theperfumed radiance.”The animal kingdom has the quality of growing instinctual purpose which—in itshighest form—works out as the domesticity of the more evolved animals, and theirdevotion to man. Behind the appearance of the animals is to be found a steadyorientation towards understanding, and a consequent gravitation towards theforms of life which evidence that which they desire. Hence the influence of thefifth Ray of Concrete Knowledge, which pours through the human family upon thethird kingdom in nature. Man is the initiating factor here, and to man iscommitted the task of leading the animal kingdom towards liberation—a liberationinto the fourth kingdom, for that is the sphere of its next activity. Thevegetable kingdom is liberated into another evolutionary process altogether, andits lives pass into the so-called deva, or angel, evolution. Hence the wind andthe insect world are its agents, just as man and the agency of water are theinitiators of the animal world. The secret of release for the animal nature ishidden in the “watery nature;” this is the blood aspect, and in the shedding ofthe blood, esoterically understood, lies the clue to the liberation of theanimal kingdom. Hence certain initiatory processes are working out on a largescale in the shedding of blood through the slaughter of the animal form of thehuman being in the Great War, for instance. In the war the blood of thousandswas poured out upon the soil, and from the standpoint of living [199] purpose,certain esoteric results have been achieved. This fact is a difficult one forman to understand, for his awareness is as yet primarily that of the form andnot of the quality of the life. It is difficult for men to comprehend the divinepurpose working out behind the evils of animal slaughter and the shedding ofblood down the ages, pre-human and human. But through the “pouring out of thatwater which is of the colour red” there is eventuating a liberation which willinitiate the life of that kingdom into new states of consciousness and ofawareness. The whole problem of slaughter, whether in the animal or the humankingdom, originated in events which occurred during the original “war inheaven,” when Michael and his angels were cast down and our planetary systemcame into being. Until a man’s consciousness is such that he can, through aninner mechanism as yet unevolved in the majority, respond to the planetaryconsciousness and “enter into the secrets of the Ancient of Days,” the problemof pain, of bloodshed, of war and of suffering must remain an inscrutablemystery. It will be solved—and this is the keynote of most importance—only whenman has himself changed the initiating process for the animals from that ofbloodshed to that of domesticity and of mutual love. When the mentality of therace is more developed, then man can, by arbitration and the right use ofspeech, settle all differences, and thus change the mode of animal initiation,whether this refers to the animal kingdom or to his own animal body.In the fourth kingdom the emerging quality is that aspect of synthetic love orunderstanding which is the intuition. This intuition is a quality of mentalmatter and of the “chitta” or mind stuff. Man is also intended to beradio-active; the incense or the perfume of his life must ascend, and thusattract the attention of the initiating factors which wait to lead him to [200]liberation. These factors are the fire and the members of the fifth kingdom innature. The growing purpose of his animal form must give place to the dynamicwill of the spiritual entity, released from form limitations by the fire of lifeand of initiation. Thus he harmonises in himself all ways of approach and ofrelease, and all achievements, and synthesises in his life the aspirations ofthe other three kingdoms.Radio-activity, the perfume of the aspirant, the devotion to other human beings(the sublimation of domesticity), and the “shedding of blood” or the sacrificeof the life, the expression upon earth (the mineral kingdom) of the devotion andsex life of the vegetable kingdom, plus the sacrifice through blood of theanimal kingdom, bring man to the portal of initiation. There the fire awaits himwith its purifying uses, and thus earth, air, fire and water (the four elements)prepare him for the great liberation and for the release of that quality ofsynthetic apprehension of the underlying truth which we call the intuition. Thisis after all the response of the mechanism to the symbolic appeal of divinequality, expressed in the whole and seen as illumination. Thus the qualitiesemerge and appear in their full glory as man develops himself and unfolds withinhimself the needed apparatus of response, training himself to recognise thesubjective realities or the divine qualities as they seek to manifest. Theprocesses of manifestation produce results upon and in the gradually awakeningconsciousness of man.5. ANALYSIS OF THE RAYS AND THEIR EXPRESSION, FROM AN EARLIER MANUSCRIPT.There is a vast fund of interesting knowledge as to the action and results ofthe ray activity in the lower kingdoms of nature, but on this point no detailscan be given; and [201] the following summary of what we have been told isnecessarily imperfect and admits of endless amplification.FIRST RAY OF WILL OR POWERSpecial Virtues:Strength, courage, steadfastness, truthfulness arising from absolutefearlessness, power of ruling, capacity to grasp great questions in alarge-minded way, and of handling men and measures.Vices of Ray:Pride, ambition, wilfulness, hardness, arrogance, desire to control others,obstinacy, anger.Virtues to be acquired:Tenderness, humility, sympathy, tolerance, patience.This has been spoken of as the ray of power, and is correctly so called, but ifit were power alone, without wisdom and love, a destructive and disintegratingforce would result. When however the three characteristics are united, itbecomes a creative and governing ray. Those on this ray have strong will power,for either good or evil, for the former when the will is directed by wisdom andmade selfless by love. The first ray man will always “come to the front” in hisown line. He may be the burglar or the judge who condemns him, but in eithercase he will be at the head of his profession. He is the born leader in any andevery public career, one to trust and lean on, one to defend the weak and putdown oppression, fearless of consequences and utterly indifferent to comment. Onthe other hand, an unmodified first ray can produce a man of unrelenting crueltyand hardness of nature.The first ray man often has strong feeling and affection, but [202] he does notreadily express it; he will love strong contrasts and masses of colour, but willrarely be an artist; he will delight in great orchestral effects and crashingchoruses, and if modified by the fourth, sixth or seventh rays, may be a greatcomposer, but not otherwise; and there is a type of this ray which is tone-deaf,and another which is colour-blind to the more delicate colours. Such a man willdistinguish red and yellow, but will hopelessly confuse blue, green and violet.The literary work of a first ray man will be strong and trenchant, but he willcare little for style or finish in his writings. Perhaps examples of this typewould be Luther, Carlyle, and Walt Whitman. It is said that in attempting thecure of disease the best method for the first ray man would be to draw healthand strength from the great fount of universal life by his will power, and thenpour it through the patient. This, of course, presupposes knowledge on his partof occult methods.The characteristic method of approaching the great Quest on this ray would be bysheer force of will. Such a man would, as it were, take the kingdom of heaven“by violence.” We have seen that the born leader belongs to this ray, wholly orin part. It makes the able commander-in-chief, such as Napoleon or Kitchener.Napoleon was first and fourth rays, and Kitchener was first and seventh, theseventh ray giving him his remarkable power of organisation.THE SECOND RAY OF LOVE-WISDOMSpecial Virtues:Calm, strength, patience and endurance, love of truth, faithfulness, intuition,clear intelligence, and serene temper.Vices of Ray:Over-absorption in study, coldness, indifference to others, contempt of mentallimitations in others. [203]Virtues to be acquired:Love, compassion, unselfishness, energy.This is called the ray of wisdom from its characteristic desire for pureknowledge and for absolute truth—cold and selfish, if without love, and inactivewithout power. When both power and love are present, then you have the ray ofthe Buddhas and of all great teachers of humanity,—those who, having attainedwisdom for the sake of others, spend themselves in giving it forth. The studenton this ray is ever unsatisfied with his highest attainments; no matter howgreat his knowledge, his mind is still fixed on the unknown, the beyond, and onthe heights as yet unscaled.The second ray man will have tact and foresight; he will make an excellentambassador, and a first-rate teacher or head of a college; as a man of affairs,he will have clear intelligence and wisdom in dealing with matters which comebefore him, and he will have the capacity of impressing true views of things onothers and of making them see things as he does. He will make a good businessman, if modified by the fourth, fifth and seventh rays. The soldier on this raywould plan wisely and foresee possibilities; he would have an intuition as tothe best course to pursue, and he would never lead his men into danger throughrashness. He might be deficient in rapidity of action and energy. The artist onthis ray would always seek to teach through his art, and his pictures would havea meaning. His literary work would always be instructive.The method of healing, for the second ray man, would be to learn thoroughly thetemperament of the patient as well as to be thoroughly conversant with thenature of the disease, so as to use his will power on the case to the bestadvantage.The characteristic method of approaching the Path would be by close and earneststudy of the teachings till they become [204] so much a part of the man’sconsciousness as no longer to be merely intellectual knowledge, but a spiritualrule of living, thus bringing in intuition and true wisdom.A bad type of the second ray would be bent on acquiring knowledge for himselfalone, absolutely indifferent to the human needs of others. The foresight ofsuch a man would degenerate into suspicion, his calmness into coldness andhardness of nature.THE THIRD RAY OF HIGHER MINDSpecial Virtues:Wide views on all abstract questions, sincerity of purpose, clear intellect,capacity for concentration on philosophic studies, patience, caution, absence ofthe tendency to worry himself or others over trifles.Vices of Ray:Intellectual pride, coldness, isolation, inaccuracy in details,absent-mindedness, obstinacy, selfishness, overmuch criticism of others.Virtues to be acquired:Sympathy, tolerance, devotion, accuracy, energy and common-sense.This is the ray of the abstract thinker, of the philosopher and themetaphysician, of the man who delights in the higher mathematics but who, unlessmodified by some practical ray, would hardly be troubled to keep his accountsaccurately. His imaginative faculty will be highly developed, i.e., he can bythe power of his imagination grasp the essence of a truth; his idealism willoften be strong; he is a dreamer and a theorist, and from his wide views andgreat caution he sees every side [205] of a question equally clearly. Thissometimes paralyses his action. He will make a good business man; as a soldierhe will work out a problem in tactics at his desk, but is seldom great in thefield. As an artist his technique is not fine, but his subjects will be full ofthought and interest. He will love music, but unless influenced by the fourthray he will not produce it. In all walks of life he is full of ideas, but is tooimpractical to carry them out.One type of this ray is unconventional to a degree, slovenly, unpunctual andidle, and regardless of appearances. If influenced by the fifth ray as thesecondary ray this character is, entirely changed. The third and the fifth raysmake the perfectly balanced historian who grasps his subject in a large way andverifies every detail with patient accuracy. Again the third and the fifth raystogether make the truly great mathematician who soars into heights of abstractthought and calculation, and who can also bring his results down to practicalscientific use. The literary style of the third ray man is too often vague andinvolved, but if influenced by the first, fourth, fifth or seventh rays, this ischanged, and under the fifth he will be a master of the pen.The curing of disease by the third ray man would be by the use of drugs made ofherbs or minerals belonging to the same ray as the patient whom he desires torelieve.The method of approaching the great Quest, for this ray type, is by deepthinking on philosophic or metaphysical lines till he is led to the realisationof the great Beyond and of the paramount importance of treading the Path thatleads thither.THE FOURTH RAY OF HARMONY THROUGH CONFLICTSpecial Virtues:Strong affections, sympathy, physical courage, generosity, devotion, quicknessof intellect and perception. [206]Vices of Ray:Self-centredness, worrying, inaccuracy, lack of moral courage, strong passions,indolence, extravagance.Virtues to be acquired:Serenity, confidence, self-control, purity, unselfishness, accuracy, mental andmoral balance.This has been called the “ray of struggle” for on this ray the qualities ofrajas (activity) and tamas (inertia) are so strangely equal in proportion thatthe nature of the fourth ray man is torn with their combat, and the outcome,when satisfactory, is spoken of as the “Birth of Horus,” of the Christ, bornfrom the throes of constant pain and suffering.Tamas induces love of ease and pleasure, a hatred of causing pain amounting tomoral cowardice, indolence, procrastination, a desire to let things be, to rest,and to take no thought of the morrow. Rajas is fiery, impatient, ever urging toaction. These contrasting forces in the nature make life one perpetual warfareand unrest for the fourth ray man; the friction and the experience gainedthereby may produce very rapid evolution, but the man may as easily become ane’er-do-well as a hero.It is the ray of the dashing cavalry leader, reckless of risks to himself or hisfollowers. It is the ray of the man who will lead a forlorn hope, for in momentsof excitement the fourth ray man is entirely dominated by rajas; of the wildspeculator and gambler, full of enthusiasm and plans, easily overwhelmed bysorrow or failure, but as quickly recovering from all reverses and misfortunes.It is pre-eminently the ray of colour, of the artist whose colour is alwaysgreat, though his drawing will often be defective. (Watts was fourth and secondrays.) The fourth ray [207] man always loves colour, and can generally produceit. If untrained as an artist, a colour sense is sure to appear in other ways,in choice of dress or decorations.In music, fourth ray compositions are always full of melody, and the fourth rayman loves a tune. As a writer or poet, his work will often be brilliant and fullof picturesque word-painting, but inaccurate, full of exaggerations, and oftenpessimistic. He will generally talk well and have a sense of humour, but hevaries between brilliant conversations and gloomy silences, according to hismood. He is a delightful and difficult person to live with.In healing, the best fourth ray method is massage and magnetism, used withknowledge.The method of approaching the Path will be by self-control, thus gainingequilibrium amongst the warring forces of the nature. The lower and extremelydangerous way is by Hatha Yoga.THE FIFTH RAY OF LOWER MINDSpecial Virtues:Strictly accurate statements, justice (without mercy), perseverance,common-sense, uprightness, independence, keen intellect.Vices of Ray:Harsh criticism, narrowness, arrogance, unforgiving temper, lack of sympathy andreverence, prejudice.Virtues to be acquired:Reverence, devotion, sympathy, love, wide-mindedness.This is the ray of science and of research. The man on this ray will possesskeen intellect, great accuracy in detail, and [208] will make unwearied effortsto trace the smallest fact to its source, and to verify every theory. He willgenerally be extremely truthful, full of lucid explanation of facts, thoughsometimes pedantic and wearisome from his insistence on trivial and unnecessaryverbal minutiae. He will be orderly, punctual, business-like, disliking toreceive favours or flattery.It is the ray of the great chemist, the practical electrician, the first-rateengineer, the great operating surgeon. As a statesman, the fifth ray man wouldbe narrow in his views, but he would be an excellent head of some specialtechnical department, though a disagreeable person under whom to work. As asoldier, he would turn most readily to artillery and engineering. The artist onthis ray is very rare, unless the fourth or seventh be the influencing secondaryrays; even then, his colouring will be dull, his sculptures lifeless, and hismusic (if he composes) will be uninteresting, though technically correct inform. His style in writing or speaking will be clearness itself, but it willlack fire and point, and he will often be long-winded, from his desire to sayall that can possibly be said on his subject.In healing, he is the perfect surgeon, and his best cures will be throughsurgery and electricity.For the fifth ray, the method of approaching the Path is by scientific research,pushed to ultimate conclusions, and by the acceptance of the inferences whichfollow these.THE SIXTH RAY OF DEVOTIONSpecial Virtues:Devotion, single-mindedness, love, tenderness, intuition, loyalty, reverence.Vices of Ray:Selfish and jealous love, over-leaning on others, partiality, [209]self-deception, sectarianism, superstition, prejudice, over-rapid conclusions,fiery anger.Virtues to be acquired:Strength, self-sacrifice, purity, truth, tolerance, serenity, balance and commonsense.This is called the ray of devotion. The man who is on this ray is full ofreligious instincts and impulses, and of intense personal feeling; nothing istaken equably. Everything, in his eyes, is either perfect or intolerable; hisfriends are angels, his enemies are very much the reverse; his view, in bothcases, is formed not on the intrinsic merits of either class, but on the way thepersons appeal to him, or on the sympathy or lack of sympathy which they shew tohis favourite idols, whether these be concrete or abstract, for he is full ofdevotion, it may be to a person, or it may be to a cause.He must always have a “personal God,” an incarnation of Deity to adore. The besttype of this ray makes the saint, the worst type, the bigot or fanatic, thetypical martyr or the typical inquisitor. All religious wars or crusades haveoriginated from sixth ray fanaticism. The man on this ray is often of gentlenature, but he can always flame into fury and fiery wrath. He will lay down hislife for the objects of his devotion or reverence, but he will not lift a fingerto help those outside of his immediate sympathies. As a soldier, he hatesfighting but often when roused in battle fights like one possessed. He is nevera great statesman nor a good business man, but he may be a great preacher ororator.The sixth ray man will be the poet of the emotions (such as Tennyson) and thewriter of religious books, either in poetry or prose. He is devoted to beautyand colour and all things lovely, but his productive skill is not great unlessunder the [210] influence of one of the practically artistic rays, the fourth orseventh. His music will always be of a melodious order, and he will often be thecomposer of oratories and of sacred music.The method of healing for this ray would be by faith and prayer.The way of approaching the Path would be by prayer and meditation, aiming atunion with God.THE SEVENTH RAY OF CEREMONIAL ORDER OR MAGICSpecial Virtues:Strength, perseverance, courage, courtesy, extreme care in details,self-reliance.Vices of Ray:Formalism, bigotry, pride, narrowness, superficial judgments, self-opinionover-indulged.Virtues to be acquired:Realisation of unity, wide-mindedness, tolerance, humility, gentleness and love.This is the ceremonial ray, the ray which makes a man delight in “all thingsdone decently and in order,” and according to rule and precedent. It is the rayof the high priest and the court chamberlain, of the soldier who is a borngenius in organisation, of the ideal commissary general who will dress and feedthe troops in the best possible way. It is the ray of the perfect nurse for thesick, careful in the smallest detail, though sometimes too much inclined todisregard the patients” idiosyncrasies and to try and grind them in the ironmill of routine.It is the ray of form, of the perfect sculptor, who sees and produces idealbeauty, of the designer of beautiful forms and patterns of any sort; but such aman would not be successful [211] as a painter unless his influencing ray werethe fourth. The combination of four with seven would make the very highest typeof artist, form and colour being both in excelsis . The literary work of theseventh ray man would be remarkable for its ultra-polished style, and such awriter would think far more of the manner than of the matter in his work, butwould always be fluent both in writing and speech. The seventh ray man willoften be sectarian. He will delight in fixed ceremonials and observances, ingreat processions and shows, in reviews of troops and warships, in genealogicaltrees, and in rules of precedence.The bad type of seventh ray man is superstitious, and such a man will take deepinterest in omens, in dreams, in all occult practices, and in spiritualisticphenomena. The good type of the ray is absolutely determined to do the rightthing and say the right word at the right moment; hence great social success.In healing, the seventh ray man would rely on extreme exactness in carrying outorthodox treatment of disease. On him the practices of yoga would have nophysical bad results.He will approach the Path through observance of rules of practice and of ritual,and can easily evoke and control the elemental forces.From many of the above remarks it may have been inferred that thecharacteristics of any given ray find closer correspondence with one of theother rays than with the rest. This is a fact. The only one which stands aloneand has no close relationship with any of the others is the fourth. This bringsto mind the unique position which the number four occupies in the evolutionaryprocess. We have the fourth root race, the fourth planetary chain, the fourthplanet in the chain, the fourth planetary manvantara, etc.Between the third and the fifth rays there is a close relationship. [212] In thesearch after knowledge, for example, the most laborious and minute study ofdetail is the path that will be followed, whether in philosophy, the highermathematics or in the pursuit of practical science.The correspondence between the second and the sixth rays shews itself in theintuitive grasp of synthesised knowledge, and in the common bond of faithfulnessand loyalty.Masterfulness, steadfastness, and perseverance are the correspondingcharacteristics of the first and the seventh rays."},{"pageContent":"SECTION 2 - CHAPTER II ... THE RAYS AND THE KINGDOMS IN NATUREINTRODUCTORY REMARKS[215] In starting upon a consideration of the relation of the rays to the sevenkingdoms I shall refer to the seven kingdoms on the upward or evolutionary arc,and not to the seven kingdoms as they can be enumerated on the involutionary ordownward arc. This latter (according to the Theosophical literature) includesthree kingdoms—nebulous, relatively formless, and unexpressed—and the fourkingdoms as enumerated by modern science. With the involutionary arc we havenothing to do. The understanding of it is well nigh impossible to the finitemind of the average reader. Though these three involutionary kingdoms exist, andthough the little known about them in the West has received written form, anyreal comprehension of the implied truths is entirely lacking. This is quiteunavoidable. Their comprehension lies hid in the capacity to “recover” the pastand to see that past as a whole.The kingdoms which we shall consider in connection with the rays may beenumerated under the following terms:1. The Mineral Kingdom. VII 2. The Vegetable Kingdom. VI 3. The Animal Kingdom.V 4. The Kingdom of Men. IV 5. The Kingdom of Souls. III 6. The Kingdom ofPlanetary Lives. II 7. The Kingdom of Solar Lives. I[216] These kingdoms might be regarded as differentiations of the One Life, fromthe angle of:1. Phenomenal appearance, objective manifestation, or the externalisation of thesolar Logos.2. Consciousness or sensitivity to the expression of quality, through the mediumof the phenomenal appearance.Certain of the rays, as might be expected, are more responsible than certainothers for the qualifying of any particular kingdom. Their effect is paramountin its determination. The effect of the other rays is subsidiary, but notabsent. We must never forget that, in the close interrelation of forces in oursolar system, no one of the seven possible forces is without effect. All of themfunction, qualify and motivate, but one or other will have a more vital effectthan the rest. The following tabulation will give the major effect of the sevenrays and the result of their influence upon the seven kingdoms with which we areconcerned:No. Kingdom Ray Expression 1. Mineral VII. Ceremonial OrganisationRadio-Activity. I Will or Power The basic Reservoir of Power. 2. Vegetable II.Love-Wisdom Magnetism. IV. Beauty or Harmony Uniformity of Colour. VI.Idealistic Devotion Upward Tendency. 3. Animal III. Adaptability Instinct. VI.Devotion Domesticity. 4. Human IV. Harmony through Conflict Experience. Growth.V. Concrete Knowledge Intellect. 5.

Will orPower Universal Mind. VII. Ceremonial Magic Synthetic Ritual.[217] You will note one interesting difference in this tabulation, and that isthe fact that the vegetable kingdom is the expression of three rays, whereas theothers are expressions of two. Through these three the vegetable kingdom hasbeen brought to its present condition of supreme beauty and its developedsymbolism of colour. The vegetable kingdom is the outstanding contribution ofour Earth to the general solar plan. Each of the planets contributes a uniqueand specialised quota to the sum total of evolutionary products, and the uniqueproduction of our particular planetary system is the vegetable kingdom. Otherplanets contribute forms and appearances which are their specific offering. Itis needless for me to enumerate them here, for our language has no equivalentterms, and where there is no equivalent in language there is for mankind noequivalent in consciousness. The Earth, then, contributes the vegetable kingdom,and this is possible because it is the only Kingdom in which three rays havefinally succeeded in coalescing, in fusing and blending; they are also the threerays along a major line of forces, 2-4-6. When we come to a more detailedanalysis of the rays and their effects on a kingdom in nature, we shall see whythis has produced so unique a contribution. Its success is demonstrated in theuniformity of its production of green in the realm of colour, throughout theentire planet.You will note also that the mineral kingdom and the kingdom [218] of solar lives(the first and seventh kingdoms) are the result of the activity of the first andthe seventh rays. There is a close numerological interlocking here. These twokingdoms are respectively at the point of the greatest tenuity and the greatestdensity, and are produced by the will and the organising ability of the solarDeity. They embody the nebulous plan and the concretised plan. In the case ofthe seventh or highest kingdom (counting from below upwards) the Will aspectpredominates and is the most powerful, whilst in the case of the mineralkingdom, the organisation aspect is of the most importance. This was to beanticipated, for the energy of Will is the first effect of the initiating divineactivity, whilst the densest aspect of ceremonial organisation is thecounterpart of the initial impulse, its concretisation, if I might so expressit. The other kingdoms in nature, as can be seen in our tabulation, are not sorelated.It will be of value if we now analyse our tabulation with a measure of care andget a little clearer grasp of the effect and influence of the seven rays.As long as the true nature of the atom and its internal organisation remains amatter of investigation and of speculation and theory, the reader should regardwhat I here have to say in connection with this densest of all kingdoms assymbolically and pictorially true, but not to be taken literally. Just as thecentre at the base of the spine is the last one to be aroused into fullfunctioning activity, and is thus aroused only when the head centre is awakenedand alive, so this lowest of all the kingdoms will be rightly understood onlywhen all the seven kingdoms vibrate in unison. Until such time as this occurs,this kingdom and its life will remain an enigma, except to the initiate of highdegree. All I can do is to make such suggestions as will arouse the abstractmind to activity and awaken interest to such a degree that the work of analysisand study will proceed. [219] Conclusions cannot be reached, however, and thismust be realised.Two rays are of prime importance in the Life of God as It pours through thisbasic substance of our planet. In the work of the seventh ray, we have earthysubstance, the solid material of our planetary life, organised into the varyingmineral forms. These mineral forms, in their turn, hold latent those sustainingand vitalising elements from which other forms draw their sustenance. It must beremembered that each kingdom in nature is dependent upon and draws life from thekingdom which precedes it in the time sense, during the evolutionary cycle. EachKingdom is a reservoir of power and of vitality to the next kingdom whichemerges under the divine Plan.The vegetable kingdom, for instance, draws its vital strength from threesources,—the sun, the water and the earth. In the building process it is themineral content from the two latter sources that is of prime importance. Thetrue structure of all forms is produced by the fabric of mineral products whichis gradually built upon the etheric body, and which takes shape and form under avital etheric urge, desire or impulse. It is the magnetic quality of the ethericbody which attracts to itself the minerals needed for this skeleton form.The animal kingdom, in turn, draws its sustenance primarily from the sun, thewater and the vegetable kingdom. The mineral content required for the skeletonstructure is therefore offered in a more advanced and sublimated form, beinggathered out of the offering of the vegetable kingdom instead of out of that ofthe mineral kingdom. Each kingdom offers sacrifice to the next succeedingkingdom in the evolutionary sequence. The Law of Sacrifice determines the natureof each kingdom. Therefore each kingdom may be regarded as a [220] laboratorywherein are prepared those forms of nutriment which are needed for the buildingof ever more refined structures. The human kingdom follows the same procedure,and draws its life (from the form angle) out of the animal kingdom as well asfrom the sun, water and the vegetable world. In the early stages of humanunfoldment, animal food was, therefore, both karmically and in essence, thecorrect food for man; and for unevolved men, and from the standpoint of theanimal form, such food is still right and proper. This brings up the wholequestion of vegetarianism, and I shall deal with it when we come to consider thefourth kingdom. The situation is not at all what is often thought, or aspresented by the thinkers of today, and meat eating—at a certain stage of humanunfoldment—incurs no evil doing.Out of the great experimental school of human existence the kingdom of soulsdraws sustenance and vitality, and in the interlocking and interrelation ofthese four divine organisms does the world of form live and move and have itsbeing. There are certain parallels in the human organism and certaincorrespondences which are of interest, and they may be presented in thefollowing manner:The human kingdom Brain The two head centres. Vocal organs. The animal kingdomStomach The solar plexus. Liver. The vegetable kingdom Heart The heart centre.Lungs. The throat centre. The mineral kingdom Generative organs The sacralcentre. The base of spine.The relation of the seven centres to the various kingdoms in nature can be hereseen, and the symbolism of the human form can be noted. The seven kingdoms as awhole can also be seen as having the following relations:[221]1. Mineral kingdom base of spine Adrenals. 2. Vegetable kingdom heart centreThymus. 3. Animal kingdom solar plexus Pancreas. 4. Human kingdom sacral centreGonads. 5. Egoic kingdom throat centre Thyroid. 6. Planetary kingdom ajna centrePituitary. 7. Solar kingdom head centre Pineal.A study of these correspondences will be of value if the student will rememberthat these are the correspondences studied at the first initiation. They differat the later expansions of consciousness.The influence of the organising seventh ray is best seen in the amazing andgeometrically perfect structure of the elements, as revealed by the microscopeand by a study of the atom. As this treatise is intended for the reader who hasno academic or scientific training, it will suffice to say that the mineralkingdom is a result of the “ritual of rhythm,” as are all the basic forms uponwhich the myriad of structures in manifestation are constructed and founded. Thesystem of numbers demonstrates in its fullest beauty in this kingdom, and thereis no form and no numerological relation which cannot be discovered in minuteform in this foundational kingdom, under the occult microscopic vision. Twofactors determine the structures found in the mineral kingdom:1. The seventh great impulse, or the will to organise.2. The urge to create, or the initial rhythm which led the solar Logos to takeform.The work of the seventh Lord and of the first Lord is essentially the work ofthe architect and of the magician, and Their efforts are seen to perfection inthe mineral world. This will not, however, be realised in full potency andmagical revelation until the inner eye of true vision is developed and the formsunderlying the creative work in the other kingdoms in [222] nature are seen intheir real values. The secrets of transmutation are the true secrets of thisparticular kingdom, and the two words expressing the process and the secret arecondensation and transmutation. Each kingdom has its key words, which can betranslated, though most inadequately, as follows:Kingdom Process Secret Objective 1. Mineral Condensation TransmutationRadiation. 2. Vegetable Conformation Transformation Magnetisation. 3. AnimalConcretisation Transfusion Experimentation. 4. Human Adaptation TranslationTransfiguration. 5. Egoic Externalisation Manifestation Realisation.A general picture of the creative intent emerges as one considers thesignificance of these words. The objectives and processes of the two highestkingdoms are too advanced for the average student to grasp, and constitutelikewise two of the secrets of the higher initiation.As this treatise is intended to be a practical attempt to elucidate the newpsychology, and as its objective is to increase man’s understanding of himself,it is not my intention to do more than convey a few ideas anent the rays andtheir relation to the three subhuman kingdoms in nature. In all esotericwritings it is necessary to show the synthesis and the continuity of the wholeprocess of evolution, for only as man appreciates his position, midway betweenthe higher three kingdoms and the lower three, will the true significance of thecontribution of the fourth kingdom to the entire scheme of evolution appear. Ihave given several tabulations of correspondences and of the ray influences, andthese warrant careful study. It is, for instance, apparent that if the seventhray is now coming into power, and if its effect upon the lower kingdoms isbeginning to be felt, then humanity must be prepared for such changes as areinevitable.Left alone and unaided, man would eventually discover for [223] himself thedesignated events; but it would take much time and only in retrospect would thebroad general outlines of the evolutionary process emerge from the mass ofdetail in which they are lost in the immediate present and foreground. By awillingness to study the truths that are sent out, from time to time, from theoccult centres of the world, and through a readiness to act on suggestedhypothesis will man increase his capacity to see life whole, and be abletherefore to cooperate (with power and intelligence) in the working out of thePlan.I dealt above with the Process, the Secret and the Purpose. For rightunderstanding I shall now give you a synopsis of the information, concerningeach kingdom, as it comes under consideration.1. THE MINERAL KINGDOMInfluence The seventh ray of organisation and the first ray of power are thedominant factors. Results The evolutionary results are radiation and potency, astatic potency, underlying the rest of the natural scheme. Process Condensation.Secret Transmutation. The Treatise on Cosmic Fire defines this as follows:“Transmutation is the passage from one state of being to another through theagency of fire.” Purpose To demonstrate the radio-activity of life. DivisionsBase metals, standard metals, precious stones. Objective agency Fire. Fire isthe initiating factor in this kingdom. Subjective agency Sound. Quality Extremedensity. Inertia. Brilliance.[224] Students must remember that we are not dealing with the elements andatoms, as we study this kingdom. They are the substance out of which all themineral forms are made. But we are dealing with the mineral forms as theymanifest in the concrete world. We are considering the tangible and objectiveworld. The internal constitution and geometrical formation of the minerals donot come under our subject matter. This is not a scientific treatise, as usuallyunderstood, but a study in quality and consciousness as they affect the formaspect. Much, if not nearly all that exoteric science has posited regarding themineral kingdom can, for ordinary uses, be accepted as relative fact. But twopoints should be considered, and they are:1. The consciousness aspect of the mineral world.2. The transmutation of forms by fire in that kingdom, leading to an ultimateradiation.The best known example of the effect of the initiation of the mineral by firecan be seen in the great transition and transformation, allotropically broughtabout, from the carbon stage to that of the perfect diamond. A furtherqualitative stage can be seen as the radiation or the throwing off of rays, asin radium.That there are three stages in the evolutionary processes in the mineral kingdommust be borne in mind, and these (though apparently unrelated to each other fromthe angle of modern science) are nevertheless subjectively and essentially partof a tremendous inner process. These stages are the correspondences in themineral kingdom to the stages of animal consciousness, of self-consciousness,and of the radiant group consciousness of the soul. There is a fourth stage ofpotency or of organised expressed power, but this lies ahead, and is the analogyin this kingdom to the life of the Monad, as expressed in the solarconsciousness of the initiates of high degree.[225] Just as science has discovered the ninety-two elements so that the list ofthe possible elements is relatively complete, so eventually science will havearranged the progressive tables which will show the three stages of the lifecycle of every mineral leading from the static mineral stage, such as carbon,through that of the crystal, semi-precious stone and precious stone to that ofthe radio-active substance. In the determining of this development it isimpossible for man as yet to see the relations, for the cycles covered are sovast, the action of the fire in these tremendous periods so varying, and therecognition of the intermediate stages so difficult, that aught that I could saywould but feed amusement and incredulity. But two basic premises can be laiddown:1. That the many mineral substances fall naturally into seven main groups,corresponding to the seven subdivisions of the influencing rays, those oforganisation and power.2. That only in those world cycles when the seventh ray is in manifestation, andtherefore supremely powerful, do certain hidden changes take place in theseseven groups. These are the correspondences, in the mineral evolution, to theseven initiations of man.At these times there is an increased radiatory activity. This can be noted atthis time in the discovery of radio-active substance, as the incoming rayincreases its potency, decade by decade. A certain amount of radiation is basicand fundamental in any world cycle. But when the seventh ray comes in there isan intensification of that radiation, and new substances appear to come into newactivity. This intensification leaves the entire mineral kingdom, as a whole,more radioactive than before, until this increased radiation becomes in its turnbasic and fundamental. As the seventh ray passes cyclically out of [226]manifestation a certain measure of inertia settles down on the kingdom, thoughthat which is radiatory continues its activity. In this way the radiation of themineral world steadily increases as the cycles come and go, and there isnecessarily a paralleling effect upon the higher three kingdoms. People todayhave no idea what effect this radiation (due to the incoming ray) will have, notonly upon the surrounding mineral world but on the vegetable kingdom (which hasits roots in the mineral kingdom), and upon men and animals in lesser degree.The power of the incoming cosmic rays has called forth the more easilyrecognised radio-activity with which modern science is now concerned. It wasthree seventh ray disciples who “interpreted” these rays to man. I refer to theCuries and to Millikan. Being themselves on the seventh ray, they had thenecessary psychic equipment and responsiveness to enable them intuitively torecognise their own ray vibration in the mineral kingdom.The seventh ray is one of organised ritual, and in form building this quality isbasic and necessary. The processes found in the mineral kingdom are profoundlygeometrical. The first ray is that of dynamic will or power, and—speakingsymbolically—when perfected forms and organised vehicles and dynamic power arerelated and unified, then we shall have a full expression, at the point ofdeepest and densest concretion, of the mind of God in form, with a radiationwhich will be dynamically effective.Again speaking symbolically (and what else is possible when dealing with amechanism as yet so inadequate as the mind and brain of the average aspirant?),the mineral kingdom marks the point of unique condensation. This is producedunder the action of fire and by the pressure of the “divine idea”. Esotericallyspeaking, we have, in the mineral world, the divine [227] Plan hidden in thegeometry of a crystal, and God’s radiant beauty stored in the colour of aprecious stone. In miniature and at the lowest point of manifestation, we findthe divine concepts working out. The goal of the universal concept is seen whenthe jewel rays forth its beauty, and when radium sends forth its rays, bothdestructive and constructive. If you could really understand the history of acrystal, you would enter into the glory of God. If you could enter into theattractive and the repulsive consciousness of a piece of iron or lead, you wouldsee revealed the complete story of evolution. If you could study the hiddenprocesses which go on under the influence of fire, you would enter into thesecret of initiation. When the day comes when the history of the mineral kingdomcan be grasped by the illumined seer, he will then see the long road that thediamond has travelled, and—by analogy—the long road that all sons of Godtraverse, governed by the same laws and unfolding the same consciousness.The seventh ray, when manifesting on the seventh plane (as is now the case), ispeculiarly potent, and its effect upon the mineral kingdom is consequentlydynamically felt. If it is true that there is only one substance and one spirit,that “matter is spirit at the lowest point of its cyclic activity” and spirit ismatter at its highest, then the ray of ceremonial order or ritual is but anexpression of its polar opposite,—the first ray of will or power. It is theexpression of the same potency under another aspect. This means therefore that:1. The power or will of God expresses itself through the organised systematisedprocesses of the seventh ray. The geometrical faculty of the Universal Mindfinds its most material perfection on the physical or seventh plane, workingthrough the seventh ray. So the mineral kingdom came into being as this majorexpression. It holds in solution [228] all the forces and those chemicals andminerals which are needed by the forms in the other material kingdoms.2. The mineral kingdom is therefore the most concrete expression of the dualunity of power and order. It constitutes the “foundation” of the orderedphysical structure or the universe of our planet.3. The rhythmic ritualistic adaptability of the seventh ray, plus the dynamicwill of the power ray, are needed in conjunction for the full working out of thePlan, as it is found in the mind of God.This is why, in this present period of transition, the Lord of the seventh rayis taking over the control of affairs and the ordered working out of the Plan,so as eventually to restore stability to the planet and give the incomingAquarian influences a stable and extended field in which to work. This we shalllater elaborate when we take up the study of the zodiacal signs and theirrelation to the rays.We shall now touch upon the next two points,—condensation and its hidden secret,transmutation. From the standpoint of external matter, the mineral kingdom marksthe densest expression of the life of God in substance, and its outstanding,though oft unrealised, characteristic is imprisoned or unexpressed power.Speaking in symbols, a volcano in eruption is a mild expression of this power.From the standpoint of esoteric substance, the four ethers are far more denseand “substantial”. This modern science has also told us, positing thehypothetical ether. This fifth kingdom (counting occultly from the egoic kingdomdownwards) is a reflection of these four ethers, and the point of their densestconcretion. Just as they “substand” or form the basis of the manifested world,and are regarded as the “true form,” so the mineral kingdom is the fundamentalkingdom in the three worlds, under the Law of Correspondences. [229] It is, in amost peculiar sense, “precipitated etheric substance”, and is a condensation orexternalisation of the etheric planes. This solidification orprecipitation—resulting in the production of dense objective or solid matter—isthe tangible result of the interplay of the energies and qualities of the firstand seventh rays. Their united will and ordered rhythm have produced this Earthand the molten content of the planet, regarding the earth as the crust.In the turning of the great wheel, cycle after cycle, these two rays come intofunctioning activity, and in between their objective cycles the other raysdominate and participate in the great work. The result of this interplay ofpsychic potencies will manifest in the eventual transmutation of the earthsubstance, and its resolution back again into that of which it is the objectivecondensation. Again language fails to find the needed terms. They are as yetnon-existent. I mention this as an indication of the difficulty of our subject.Intangible etheric substance has been condensed into the dense tangibleobjective world. This—under the evolutionary plan—has to be again transmutedinto its original condition, plus the gain of ordered rhythm and the tendenciesand qualities wrought into the consciousness of its atoms and elements throughthe experience of externalisation. This resolution is noted by us as radiationand the radio-active substances. We are looking on at the transmutation process.The resolving agencies are fire, intense heat and pressure. These three agencieshave already succeeded in bringing about the divisions of the mineral kingdominto three parts: the baser metals, as they are called, the standard metals(such as silver and gold and platinum), and the semi-precious stones andcrystals. The precious jewels are a synthesis of all three,—one of the basicsyntheses of evolution. In this connection, some correspondences between the[230] mineral kingdom and the human evolutionary cycles might here be noted:1. The base metals physical plane. Dense Consciousness. The firstinitiation. 2. The standard metals astral plane. Self-consciousness. The second initiation. 3. The semi-precious stones mental plane. Radiantconsciousness. The third initiation. 4. The precious jewels egoicconsciousness and achievement. The fourth initiation.The correspondences of fire, heat and pressure in the evolution of the humanbeing are self-evident, and their work can be seen paralleling that in themineral kingdom.The mineral kingdom is governed astrologically by Taurus, and there is asymbolic relation between the “eye” in the head of the Bull, the third eye, thelight in the head, and the diamond. The consciousness of the Buddha has beencalled the “diamond-eye.”We have been technical, and much has been given which seems to have no bearingupon the psychological development of man. But to understand the rays and theirbearing on life as a whole, it is necessary that man should grasp the fact thathe is only a small fraction of that whole. Man has his roots in all the threekingdoms; all have contributed to his equipment; he is the macrocosm of thelower microcosm; he is the link which unites the three lower kingdoms to thethree higher. Let it ever be borne in mind that the sign of man’s spiritualunfoldment lies in his ability to include in his consciousness not only theso-called spiritual values and the power to react to soul contact, but also toinclude the material values, and to react divinely to the potencies which liehidden from him [231] in the custody of the other forms of divine life, found inthe three sub-human kingdoms.In the urgency of the present world situation, it might be well to ask: Whatneed is there to study the rays and kingdoms of nature? Of what profit is it tospeculate on matters of which it is as yet impossible for the average student toapprehend the truth? Such questions are intelligent and worth while and merit anintelligent reply. I shall make answer by asking another question: Whatindication has the would-be server that his mental equipment makes him of anyuse in this present world crisis?One of the first things that any teacher of the race has to do is to increasethe mental equipment of the would-be server. The work is oft-times handicappedby the devoted offering of the emotional aspirant. The Plan is ofttimes delayedin its fruition by the ill-timed and ill-judged efforts of the earnest followerof the Great Lord. Above all else the work is handicapped by the personalityreactions of the leaders of the groups dedicated to esotericism. All personalityreactions are, in the majority of cases, based upon emotion of some kind oranother. Personal ambition, the desire (sometimes unrecognised) to be thesupreme authority in a particular group, fear of interlopers and ofterminologies (expressing identical truths), and jealousy of other leaders, plusa sincere though foggy and deluded interpretation of truth, are a greatdetriment to the cause of the Hierarchy. And everywhere these things are to beseen! The seat of all this trouble is to be found in thedesire-feeling-emotional body, and in an undue attachment to externals andforms. These factors prevent that clear-seeing which leads to wise andcooperative action. If the mental equipment and the mental apprehension of truthcan be increased, then it may be possible for real work to be done, and then thegroups (that form the One Group) can go forward [232] into real usefulness. Tothis end it may be profitable to provide material whereby the mental bodies ofthe students can grow, and wherein they can find sustenance and the means todevelop. Few people can evolve from within themselves the thoughts and the ideaswhich should lead them on in the realisation of truth; and those of us thereforewho are responsible for the teaching of the race must perforce provide thatwhich is required. Also, in so doing we work for the coming generation ofenquirers, knowing full well that the advanced teaching of today, and the newideas which influence the pioneers of humanity, become the inspiration of thethinking public in the succeeding generation, and the theology, in due time, ofthat which follows them. The beliefs and knowledges of the esotericists today(of the real spiritual esotericists, not of the so-called esoteric groups) areresolved into the formulas of faith of their successors, and become eventuallyidentified with religious beliefs and organisations.Mental comprehension of the ray teaching, and the study of the rays in relationto evolving nature, are of mental importance and of spiritual import, but of nopractical value in the living of the daily life, except in so far as they serveto shift the polarisation of the aspirant off the emotional plane on to themental, and thereby produce alignment and stabilisation.We now come to a consideration of the rays and of the vegetable kingdom. It isdifficult for us to grasp the significance of the consciousness and the activityof the mineral kingdom, for it is so far removed from our own. It is hard for usreally to understand, with our seeing consciousness, the fact that, forinstance, our nails and teeth and bony structure have a consciousness and anintelligent awareness that is the same in kind, though differing in degree, asthat of the eye or of a sensory nerve. But so it is. As we approach the forms oflife which approximate the living tissue of our animal bodies, our [233]appreciation of resemblance and of identical possibilities increases step bystep. It is only by arguing from analogy that we grasp esoteric truth, and itmight bring us some illumination if we realised that there are higher forms oflife and consciousness in the cosmos who find it as difficult to throw theirconsciousness down into the animal forms of humanity as we would find it hard toproject ourselves into the consciousness of an iron ploughshare. But again, soit is.Let us now tabulate some of the available ideas and information.2. THE VEGETABLE KINGDOMInfluences The second Ray of Love-wisdom, working out in a vastly increasedsensibility. The fourth Ray of Harmony and Beauty, working out in the mineralharmonization of this kingdom throughout the entire planet. The sixth Ray ofDevotion or (as it has been expressed symbolically in The Ancient Wisdom) the“urge to consecrate the life to the Sun, the giver of that life,” or again, the“urge to turn the eye of the heart to the heart of the sun.” Results These workout in the second kingdom as magnetism, perfume, colour and growth towards thelight. These words I commend to you for your earnest study, for it is in thiskingdom that one first sees clearly the glory which lies ahead of humanity: a.Magnetic radiation. The blending of the mineral and vegetable goals. b. Theperfume of perfection. c. The glory of the human aura. The radiant augoeides. d.Aspiration which leads to final inspiraton. [234] Process Conformation, or thepower to “conform” to the pattern set in the heavens, and to produce below thatwhich is found above. This is done in this kingdom with greater pliability thanin the mineral kingdom, where the process of condensation goes blindly forward.Secret Transformation. Those hidden alchemical processes which enable thevegetable growths in this kingdom to draw their sustenance from the sun and.soil, and to “transform” it into form and colour. Purpose Magnetism. That innersource of beauty, loveliness and attractive power which lures to it the higherforms of life, leading the animal forms to consume it for food, and the thinkingentities to draw from it inspiration, comfort and satisfaction of a mental kind.Divisions Trees and shrubs. The flowering plants. The grasses and the lessergreen things which do not come under the other two categories. A group ofvegetable growths which are found under the general heading of sea growths.Objective agency Water. Subjective agency Touch. Quality Rajas or activity.It is not my intention to give in this treatise what the reader can discover inthe academic textbooks of our colleges. It is not my work to parallel theinformation found in the exoteric teachings and theologies of our modernsciences. I seek to indicate the synthesis which underlies the whole, and topoint out the continuity of consciousness which can be noted by the esotericist.In so doing the part is seen to be integrated in the [235] sum total, in amanner different to that which can be seen when considering the form. It is theworld of causes with which we are primarily concerned, and even when we considerand study that which we include under the heading of “results”, it is as theydemonstrate as initiated causes that we best arrive at their significance. It isas we grasp the radiatory potency of the mineral kingdom that we can begin toinvestigate the base of the evolutionary ladder and grasp the first steps takenby the life of God, through the medium of manifested forms. If, at the close ofthis writing, the student can grasp somewhat the meaning of those symbolicwords,—Radiation, Magnetism, Experiment, Transmutation and Realisation,—and canunderstand that they embody the purpose and goal of each of the five kingdoms innature with which we are basically concerned, then the emerging reality ofconsciousness will be seen, and the prevailing synthesis will be grasped.a. LIFE–RADIANCE–MAGNETISMWe are told in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali that “By mastery of the binding lifecomes radiance,” and in these words can be found the clue to the relationexisting between the mineral and the human kingdoms. In other words, by theconscious control of the static mineral nature, as it expresses itself in man,comes his eventual radiatory activity. Thus “the spark becomes the flame.”(Patanjali: III.40, The Light of the Soul .) It will be found that in the sutrasmuch effective correlation can be made, particularly when considering any of thevarious quintuples found in manifestation with such frequency. This book is abasic treatise for initiatory training. Take, as an illustration of this, thewords found in Book III.44, and note the illumination thrown upon theevolutionary cycle and on the symbolic development of the five kingdoms innature:[236] “One-pointed meditation upon the five forms which every element takesproduces mastery over every element. These five forms are the gross nature, theelemental form, the quality, the pervasiveness and the basic purpose.”You have, therefore, an analogy for consideration:1. The gross nature the mineral kingdom. 2. The elemental form the vegetablekingdom. 3. The quality the animal kingdom. 4. The pervasiveness the humankingdom. 5. The basic purpose the kingdom of souls.Note also the correlation of ideas which can be found as we study the words:“By one-pointed meditation upon the relationship existing between the body andthe akasha, ascension out of matter (the three worlds) and power to travel inspace is gained.” (The Light of the Soul , page 338.) Patanjali: III.42.Here it is apparent how valuable is the teaching of this sutra, when theconsciousness aspect is held carefully in mind, and how the relationships, on alarger scale than the simply human, become clear:1. The body mineral kingdom the dense prison of life. 2. The akasha vegetablekingdom the fluid conscious life. 3. Ascension out of matter animal kingdom theevolutionary goal of the relation between body and akasha. 4. Power to travel inspace human kingdom the goal of the human consciousness through the realisationof the above three.It is the inner relations with which I deal in this treatise, [237] and with theinner ray influences, which bring about the desired outer results. It is thegoal of the evolving consciousness which I seek to make clear. Science canhandle with skill and insight the evolution of form. I shall endeavour to laythe ground for that coming science (of which modern psychology is theexperimental beginning) which will deal as easily with the evolution ofconsciousness as modern science deals with the form expressions of life. Onlywhen that newer science has been brought to the point of development at whichmaterial science now stands will it be possible to consider the evolution oflife, through consciousness in form. I have here made a basic and syntheticstatement which needs grasping. Those whose consciousness is expanding out ofthe human to the egoic will follow my reasoning with a measure of facility.A very apposite question might here be asked: What determines the ray whichshould govern or predominantly influence any or all of the various kingdoms innature? It should be remembered that every kingdom, viewing it as a whole, is anentity, and (from its form side) the sum total of all forms constitutes thatentity’s body of manifestation. In the last analysis also, the aggregate ofself-initiated influences, or the magnetic radiation of that particular kingdom,is an expression of that entity’s basic quality or qualities,—the aura of thatentity’s personality. Two rays govern each kingdom in nature, except in the caseof the vegetable kingdom, where three rays indicate the nature of that kingdom’slife. Students will possibly find it helpful to consider this problem from theangle of analogy, and to realise that they (as well as every other human being)are governed or actuated by two rays, i.e., the personality ray and the egoicray. After the third initiation, the disciple has three rays active in him, forthe ray of the Monad begins then to make its presence felt. An analogouscondition is found in all the kingdoms in nature. Two rays are [238] dominant ineach kingdom, but in the vegetable kingdom three rays control, for that kingdomis more evolved (along its own peculiar lines) than any other. What might beregarded as the monadic ray of the Life of that kingdom is functioning. Thiswhole matter must not be viewed from the standpoint of human consciousness, andthe human standards of unfoldment and of awareness must not be regarded asholding prominent place in this evolution of divine life. This living entity hasa different objective to the Life which informs the fourth kingdom in nature.Nevertheless three basic logoic influences, three major breaths, or three rayvibrations account for this kingdom’s life-quality and appearance. This wholematter is too intricate for real comprehension, and the reader would do wellsimply to accept the statements I make, with reservations, and realise that whenhe himself is a member of the great company of initiates of the wisdom, thatwhich is at present inexplicable to him may be made clear, and when fitted intoits rightful place in the scheme of things will not seem so extraordinary orpeculiar.b. THE FIVE SECRETS OF THE KINGDOMS IN NATUREThere is a secret anent each of the five kingdoms in nature. These secretsconcern the relation of the human evolution to the whole, and they are revealedto the initiate at the five initiations. At each initiation one of the fivesecrets is explained to the initiate, and they are called by the following fivenames, which are an attempt on my part to interpret symbolically the ancientname or sign:1. The mineral kingdom The secret of the brilliance of the light. 2. Thevegetable kingdom The secret of the sacred perfume. 3. The animal kingdom Thesecret of the following scent. 4. The human kingdom The secret of the doublepath or of the double breath. 5. The kingdom of souls The secret of the goldenrose of light.[239] The symbolic forms in which these five secrets are hidden, and so conveyedto the intelligence of the initiate, are as follows:1. The mineral secret A diamond, blue white in colour. 2. The vegetable secret Acube of sandalwood in the heart of the lotus. 3. The animal secret A bunch ofcypress, over a funeral urn. 4. The human secret A twisted golden cord, withseven knots. 5. The egoic secret A closed lotus bud with seven blue rays.Be all this as it may, certain of the seven logoic influences are at this timedominant in the five kingdoms; in four cases, two rays control; in the case ofthe vegetable kingdom, three rays control. It must not be forgotten that theserays are related to each other, and in the great interfacing and interlocking ofthe planetary and the solar forces every kingdom comes under the influence ofevery ray, yet with certain rays always controlling and certain othersdominating cyclically. The rays determine the quality of the manifesting lifeand indicate the type of the appearance.In resuming our consideration of the three divisions of the vegetable kingdom itmight be stated that...Ray VI determines the type, family, appearance, strength, size and nature of thetrees upon our planet. Ray II is the beneficent influence, expressing itselfthrough the cereals and flowers. Ray IV is the life quality, expressing itselfthrough the grasses and the smaller forms of vegetable life,— those whichprovide the “green carpet whereon the angels dance”.An important symbolic happening has been consummated [240] at the close of thisPiscean Age, which is the period of the sixth ray influence. This has been theworld-wide devastation of the forests of the world. Everywhere they have beensacrificed to the needs of man. Thus have been brought under the influence offire, those vegetable forms of life which were ready for the initiation. Themajor agency in the development of this kingdom has been water, and this newdevelopment, this bringing together of fire and water in this kingdom, hasconstituted the subjective fact which brought the steam age into being. The vastforest fires, which form such a menace at this time in different parts of theworld, are also related to this “initiation by fire” of a kingdom hithertocontrolled and directed in its growth by the element of water.Similarly, the coming in of the seventh ray inaugurated a tremendous event inthe mineral kingdom. This I referred to in an earlier book. Through the effectof sound and fire, the mineral kingdom has also been initiated, and in the greatworld war, in the steel factories and the other factories where metal istransmuted into articles for the use of man, the world of minerals, and theentity which informs that world, are passing through a major initiation. Thiswas made possible by the personality ray of the entity, manifesting through thiskingdom, subjecting itself to the initiatory fire. This is of course expressedsymbolically,—the only way in which any aspect of this planetary truth can begrasped by man. It is an interesting, though quite unimportant fact, that at allthe initiations of the kingdoms in nature, the planetary Logos of a particularray always functions as the Initiator. This ray cyclically alters. In the majorinitiations at this time, for instance, in connection with humanity, not only isthe first Initiator, the Christ, officiating, not only is the Ancient of Days,the embodiment of our planetary Logos, participating (either actively or behind[241] the scenes), but behind Them both stands now the Lord of the fifth Ray ofKnowledge and Understanding.One point of interest might here be noted. It is known esoterically that thevegetable kingdom is the transmitter and the transformer of the vital pranicfluid to the other forms of life on our planet. That is its divine and uniquefunction. This pranic fluid, in its form of the astral light, is the reflectorof the divine akasha. The second plane therefore reflects itself in the astralplane. Those who seek to read the akashic records, or who endeavour to work uponthe astral plane with impunity, and there to study the reflection of events inthe astral light correctly, have perforce and without exception to be strictvegetarians. It is this ancient Atlantean lore which lies behind thevegetarian’s insistence upon the necessity for a vegetarian diet, and whichgives force and truth to this injunction. It is the failure to conform to thiswise rule which has brought about the misinterpretations of the astral andakashic records by many of the psychics of the present time, and has given riseto the wild and incorrect reading of past lives. Only those who have been forten years strict vegetarians can work thus in what might be called the “recordaspect of the astral light”. When they add to their purified astral and physicalbodies the light of reason and illumination of the focussed mind (which is veryrarely found), then they become accurate interpreters of astral phenomena. Theirlink with the vegetable kingdom is then very close and unbreakable, and thatlink or binding chain will lead them through the door to the scene of theirinvestigations. But unless the goal of a vegetarian diet is this field ofservice, the arguments for its following and for that form of diet are usuallyfutile and of no real moment. From the standpoint of the eternal verities, whata man eats or wears are seen in a connotation very different to that of theone-pointed fanatic. Let me again reiterate [242] that this whole problem of thetaking of life (whether in the vegetable or the animal kingdom) is a far biggerone than we know, and should be approached from an angle different (not only indegree but in kind) to that of the taking of life in the human family. The threeaspects of divinity meet in man, and with the destiny of a divine son of God noone must interfere. Where the two aspects of divinity are concerned, as in thesubhuman kingdoms, the attitude can be otherwise, and the emerging truth isdifferent to that which the little minds believe.The influence of the three rays, blended together in the vegetable kingdom,being also the three rays of even numbers, 2. 4. 6, has produced a fourfoldperfection in this kingdom which is unparalleled in any other. The rays areresponsible for this result, and their effect can be seen in the followinganalysis:Ray II The result of this influence, pouring cyclically through the kingdom, hasbeen to produce its magnetism, its attractiveness. Ray IV This ray of struggleand of conflict has as its objective the production of harmony between form andlife, and has brought about the synthesis and the harmony of colour in nature.As we say the words, “colour in nature”, automatically we think of the vegetablekingdom and its achievement of harmony in vegetation. Ray VI Growth towards thelight is the effect of this ray influence, plus the normal tendency of alllifeforms to evolve. It has brought the latent seeds of the vegetable kingdom,inherent within the soil, to the surface. It constitutes the energy ofexternalisation.The united effect of these three rays, working in unison, has been to bringforth the fourth result, the perfume of the flowers, as found in the higherunits of the vegetable kingdom. This perfume can be either deadly or vitalising,and can either [243] delight or repel. It attracts and constitutes part of thearoma of this kingdom which is sensed in the planetary aura, though unrecognisedas a whole by humanity. You isolate a perfume. Yet the perfume of an entirekingdom is a well recognised phenomenon to the initiate.Students would find it of interest to trace similar analogies in the otherkingdoms in nature, remembering however that this kingdom is esoterically aheadof the others, for there are three rays participating in its perfecting. Itmight be stated that three rays will ultimately affect each of the other threekingdoms.During the next subrace, ray two will begin to influence the mineral kingdom.In the next root race, ray five will commence to pour its power into the animalkingdom, gradually stimulating the instinctual mind of the animal until itvibrates to the ray of the intellect, of knowledge. This will bring about anorganising of the animal brain, and the transfer of the power of the solarplexus centre to the head centre, and consequently a shift in the animalpolarisation and an added activity of the brain in the head.Towards the close of this round, the monadic ray of the advanced units ofhumanity will be so powerful that there will be a marked pouring in of ray one,with its stimulation of the individual will. You will therefore have in thisunfoldment of the will aspect of mankind the following stages, which are ofpsychological importance.1. Instinct. 2. Emotional aspiration. 3. Intellect. 4. Mental one-pointedness.5. Egoic purpose. 6. Spiritual will. 7. Divine intent.These stages are latent in all of us, and are related to the seven principles ofman. They will express themselves in advanced [244] humanity as “aspects of thepsyche”, and therefore psychologically, during the later stages of humandevelopment. They should begin to be of greater interest to investigators and toeducators who should seek to develop them in the child and the adolescent. Theywork out today as marked stages in the development of all disciples andinitiates. They indicate place upon the Path. Hence their practical usefulness.In the kingdom of souls, ray four will complete the work of the next two rounds,but this period is so far distant that with it we need not concern ourselves.In the vegetable kingdom, the work of the second ray of Love-Wisdom is seen,symbolically, in one of its major consummations. Attractiveness, in the sense ofbeauty, of colour, of form, of distribution, and of perfume, is to be seen onevery hand, and had you but the eyes to vision the reality, the synthesis oflife would appear to you in all its glory. But just as the last of the fivesenses to make its presence felt in man, the sense of smell, is as yet butlittle understood, and its implications are not realised, whilst its relation tothe analytical and discriminative mind is not appreciated scientifically, so the“attractiveness” (esoterically speaking) of the vegetable kingdom remainsuncomprehended. It is the radiant garment of the planet, and is revealed by thesun; it is the achieved expression of the informing life of this kingdom innature, and is the effect of the manifestation of the three divine andfunctioning aspects of this “peculiar” son of divinity, as he works out hisdestiny in form and through matter.The entire problem of magnetism is closely connected with the problem of sex. Inthe occult study of the dissemination of the seed life and the germs of thevegetable kingdom, and in the understanding of the part played therein by thosemiraculously developed organisms,—the ants and bees—and later in theinvestigation of the work of the etheric builders, the elves [245] and fairies,by those with awakened vision will come a new light upon sex and upon thefunction it serves in the interrelation of lives and the creation of forms. Withthis aspect of this deeply esoteric truth I cannot here deal, for it is theeffect of activity in the solar lives of the solar system, and with these wecannot concern ourselves. It is not possible to handle the subject in such a wayas to make it of constructive value to the average reader. What is not ofimmediate esoteric value at this time of world urgency may well be relegated toa later time.c. THE PLANETS AND THE KINGDOMSIn the vegetable kingdom the influence of Venus is predominant, amazing as thismay seem to some occult students. Venus and Jupiter together powerfullyinfluence this world of forms.It might be of interest to note that all the planets have a close relation toall the kingdoms, but that this relation should not be confounded with theplanetary rays or with the fact that some of the planets are considered as“sacred planets” and some are not. I am here using the words “planetaryinfluence” in the same sense as the astrologer uses them, for he is not dealing,either, with the basic planetary rays. It might be stated therefore that theplanetary relations in this cycle are as follows:1. The mineral kingdom Pluto and Vulcan. 2. The vegetable kingdom Venus andJupiter. 3. The animal kingdom The Moon and Mars. 4. The human kingdom Mercuryand Saturn. 5. The kingdom of souls Neptune and Uranus. 6. Synthesising thesefive The Sun.There are other planetary influences to be felt, and hidden forces likewise playupon our planetary life, but these are the [246] major influences bringing aboutthe desired results in the kingdoms of nature under the Plan. It must beremembered that these are the cyclic influences dominant at this time, and thatthey change from cycle to cycle. For instance, a disciple who is upon the pathis strongly influenced by Mercury and by Saturn, but when he begins his trainingfor the first initiation he has to contend with the influences of Pluto andVulcan; the training for the second initiation brings him under Neptunianinfluences with Venus and Jupiter contending for control. The link with thevegetable kingdom is then strong, and hence the frequent recognition of “astralperfumes” which the disciple can note. Before the first initiation, the staticmineral world within him has been broken up.At the third initiation, the Moon and Mars struggle to assume ascendancy, andthere is his battle-ground. Hence at the great Transfiguration, the body is“transfigured” as the indication of triumph. At the fourth initiation, Mercuryand Saturn act as the great translators, and bring the disciple to the door ofrealisation. When the final initiation is taken, it is the activity of Uranusand the in-pouring force of Jupiter that bring about the reorganisation whichresults in the final emancipation. The vastness and complexity of the subjectthus become apparent.In the emergence of colour in the vegetable kingdom another vast influence isseen, and the problem of the ray influences becomes still more complicated. Inthe basic colour, green, we have the indication of the potency of Saturn.Esoterically speaking, the vegetable kingdom is upon an advanced stage of thepath of discipleship, and hence Saturn and Mars are active. The influence of thelatter planet is to be seen in the prevalence of the colours red, rose, yellowand orange in the flowers at this time.Again, readers would find it interesting to note mentally the relation of growthto the idealism of the sixth ray. They [247] could learn therefrom the part thatthe Ray of Devotion plays in bringing about the urge to evolve. It is growthtowards an ideal, or towards a divine prototype or archetype. Here is where thesecret of this kingdom appears. The secret is hidden in the word“transformation,” for the rays 2.4.6 are the great transformers. The clue to thesecret is to be found in the processes of assimilation and in the buildingforces that transmute the assimilated minerals, the absorbed moisture, the foodin the air, and the proffered offering of the insect kingdoms into themanifested bodies, the radiant colours, the magnetic auras, and the distilledperfumes of this kingdom. Much along this line has been the subject ofinvestigation by the modern scientist, but until he recognises the fact of rayinfluences, and the part they play in the producing of these factors, he willfail to discover the true secret of the transformations which he notes.It will appear, therefore, to the careful reader, that in the relation of therays to the kingdoms in nature, and in the similarity of the rays foundfunctioning in widely differing kingdoms, will be found their point of contactor door of entry, whereby they can contact each other.For instance, the human and the vegetable kingdoms find their point ofinfluential entry (using the words in the esoteric sense) through ray four,which influences the forms in both kingdoms. The relation between the vegetablekingdom and the kingdom of souls is found along the second ray. Ray two isbeginning to make its presence felt in the mineral kingdom, and hence man’s workwith, and facility in using materially, the forms in this kingdom. Perhaps Ishould say, misusing them. Ray five will before long, as we have noted, make itspower felt in the animal kingdom, and an ever closer relation will then be setup between men and animals.Again, the rays in incarnation at any time will establish relations [248]between the kingdoms, increasing the interplay of forces and the interchange ofenergies, and thus producing new effects, new forms of life, and new wonders inthe world of phenomena. Man is also apt to think that his ray influences (theray predominant in his own kingdom) must be of paramount importance and the mostpotent. This is not so at this time.A careful study and a true analysis of the effect and work of the rays inconnection with the animal kingdom is not possible. Yet it must be rememberedthat the roots of human psychology lie hidden in this expression of God.Humanity is an expression of two aspects of the soul,—the animal soul and thedivine soul,—and these two, blended and fused in man, constitute the human soul.It is this fact that is the cause of man’s special problems, and it is these twofactors which involve him in the long struggle which eventuates in theliberation of the divine soul, through the sublimation of the animal soul. Inthese words lie much food for thought. “The twain shall be one”. This work isbegun in the animal kingdom, and constitutes its “secret”, and hence the use ofthe word “transfusion” in this connection. Individualisation was the firstresult of this secret process. Its final consummating effect can be seen in thefive stages of the initiatory process, leading to eventual transfiguration andliberation. The entire work is, however, one great unfolding revelation of thesoul of God, and it is only when we divorce humanity from that process ofrevelation that we find the secrets, the problems, the difficulties and themysteries insoluble. A consciousness, an awareness and a sensitivity to anever-widening and more inclusive contact is gradually being developed, and thisis the consciousness of God, the awareness of the solar Logos, and thesensitivity of the cosmic Son of God.The form through which that Life expresses Itself, the sensitive [249] responseapparatus through which that Consciousness works, are of secondary importance,and are in the nature of an automatic mechanism. It is the mechanism,nevertheless, with which we have hitherto identified ourselves, and we haveforgotten that that mechanism is but an expression of an aspect ofconsciousness, and that it indicates, at any particular time, the point ofevolution of the informing entity. Let me reiterate: The two factors which areof major importance, during manifestation, are the evolving consciousness andthe manifesting life. When this is borne in mind, it will be noted how eachstage upon the way can be seen whole as a kingdom in nature. Each of thesekingdoms carries the consciousness aspect forward to a greater stage ofperfection, and demonstrates a greater sensitivity and responsiveness to outerand inner environing conditions, than does the preceding kingdom. Each manifestsa fuller revelation of the inner and hidden glory. When, however, a unit of lifeis immersed in form, and when the consciousness is identified (in time andspace) with any particular form, it is not possible for it to realise itsdivinity or to express it consciously. Its psychology is that of the partial andthe particular, and not that of the universal and the whole. The greater andcloser the identification with the form aspect, the greater is the lower unityand synthesis, but at the same time, the greater the darkness and, speakingsymbolically, the denser is the prison. Such is the consciousness in the loweror subhuman kingdoms in nature. The more the unit of life is identified with“the one who is conscious”, the greater again is the higher, yet different,unity and synthesis. Such also is the consciousness of the three higherkingdoms, the superhuman. The tragedy, the problem and the glory of man is thathe can identify himself with both aspects—the form and the life; and hispsychological state is such that during the period wherein he forms part of thehuman kingdom, his kingdom, [250] his consciousness fluctuates between thesepairs of opposites. He can identify himself with the subhuman forms, and this heinvariably does in the early stages. He can identify himself with the lifeaspect, and this he does in the final stages. In the midway stage of the averageman, he is torn violently between both, and is himself the battle-ground.With this consciousness, incident upon an awareness of the pairs of opposites,is connected the entire problem of pain and of suffering, as we today understandit. The animal suffers, but suffers entirely physically and sentiently. Mansuffers, but suffers physically, sentiently, and also mentally, and the mentalsuffering is due to the development in him of certain aspects of the lowermind-anticipation, memory, imagination, the power to visualise, remorse, and theinherent urge to reach out after divinity, which brings with it a sense of lossand of failure. The sufferings of God Himself (to which the scriptures of theworld so often mysteriously refer) are divorced from sentiency, and are mentaland intuitive. But on this mystery we need not enlarge. The sufferings ofhumanity are primarily personal; of God, they are pre-eminently impersonal andrelated to the whole. I have touched on this as I wanted you to get a picture ofthe synthesis of the unfoldment from the inchoate to the sentient, from thesentient to the mentally realised, and from the mentally realised to the“divinely appreciated,” as it is occultly termed. I give you pictures, but theyare pictures of a whole. Endeavour to think in wholes, and try not to fit everypoint of detail into the whole, but remember that what may appear to be acontradiction may be but a fragment of temporary detail for which you—as yet—seeno place or explanation.In the animal kingdom the first dim indication of sorrow and pain is seen,whilst in the higher and the domesticated animals these two educating processesare still more clearly indicated. [251] Man’s work with the animals is potent inresults, and will lead eventually to a re-opening of the door into the humankingdom. Some of the work already done by man has outstripped divine expectationand may warrant a hastening of the Plan.Let us now tabulate our points anent this kingdom and the rays, as we did withthe other two kingdoms.3. THE ANIMAL KINGDOMInfluences ....The third Ray of Active Intelligence or of Adaptability is potentin this kingdom and will express itself increasingly as time goes on, until ithas produced in the animal world that reaction to life and to environment whichcan best be described as “animal one-pointedness”. Then, at this point andcyclically, the sixth Ray of Devotion or Idealism can make its pressure felt asthe urge towards a goal, and thus produce a relation to man which makes of himthe desired goal. This is to be seen through the medium of the tamed, thetrained and the domestic animals.Results ....In the one case we find the third ray producing the emergence ofinstinct, which in its turn creates and uses that marvellous response apparatuswe call the nervous system, the brain, and the five senses, which lie behind andwhich are responsible for them as a whole. It should be noted that, wide as wemay regard the difference between man and the animals, there is really a muchcloser relation than that existing between the animal and the vegetable. In thecase of the sixth ray, we have the appearance of the power to be domesticatedand trained which is, in the last analysis, the power to love, to serve and toemerge from the herd into the [252] group. Ponder on the words of this lastparadoxical statement.Process.... This is called concretisation. In this kingdom we have for the firsttime a true organisation of the etheric body into what are called “the truenerves and the sensory centres” by the esotericists. Plants also have nerves,but they have in them nothing of the same intricacy of relation and of plexus aswe find in the human being and in the animal. Both kingdoms share the samegeneral grouping of nerves of force centres and channels, with a spinal columnand a brain. This organisation of a sensitive response apparatus constitutes, inreality, the densification of the subtle etheric body.Secret.... This is called transfusion, which is a very inadequate word toexpress the early blending in the animal of the psychological factors which leadto the process of individualisation. It is a process of lifegiving, ofintelligent integration and of psychological unfoldment to meet emergency.Purpose.... This is called experimentation. Here we come to a great mystery andone that is peculiar to our planet. In many esoteric books it has been statedand hinted that there has been a mistake, or serious error, on the part of GodHimself, of our planetary Logos, and that this mistake has involved our planet,and all that it contains, in the visible misery, chaos and suffering. Shall wesay that there has been no mistake, but simply a great experiment, of thesuccess or failure of which it is not yet possible to judge? The objective ofthe experiment might be stated as follows: It is the intent of the planetaryLogos to bring about a psychological [253] condition which can best be describedas one of “divine lucidity”. The work of the psyche, and the goal of the truepsychology is to see life clearly, as it is, and with all that is involved. Thisdoes not mean conditions and environment, but Life. This process was begun inthe animal kingdom and will be consummated in the human. These are described inthe Old Commentary as “the two eyes of Deity, both blind at first, but whichlater see, though the right eye sees more clearly than the left”. The first dimindication of this tendency towards lucidity is seen in the faculty of the plantto turn towards the sun. It is practically non-existent in the mineral kingdom.Divisions.... First, the higher animals and the domestic animals, such as thedog, the horse and the elephant.Secondly, the so-called wild animals, such as the lion, the tiger and othercarnivorous and dangerous wild beasts.Thirdly, the mass of lesser animals that seem to meet no particular need nor tofill any special purpose, such as the harmless yet multitudinous lives found inour forests, our jungles and the fields of our planet. Instances of these in theWest are the rabbits and other rodents. This is a wide and general specificationof no scientific import at all; but it covers adequately the karmic divisionsand the general conformation into which these groupings of lives fall in thiskingdom.Objective Agency ....Fire and water,— fierce desire and incipient mind. Theseare symbolised in the animal power to eat and drink.Subjective Agency.... Smell or scent,—the instinctual discovery of that which isneeded, from the activity of ranging forth for food, and the use of [254] thepower to scent that food, to the identification of the smell of a beloved masteror friend.Quality.... Tamas or inertia,— but in this case it is the tamasic nature of mindand not that of matter, as usually understood. The chitta or mind-stuff can beequally tamasic.The two problems which are of immediate concern to mankind in relation to theanimal kingdom are:The problem of human relations and responsibility.The problem of animal individualisation.A. HUMAN RELATIONS TO ANIMALSOnly a few hints can as yet be given, and those must be along the line ofinformation anent the rays at work in both kingdoms. The two problems,particularly the second one, are of vast intricacy, and would require manyvolumes to be properly elucidated. Right exegesis is not yet possible, nor couldman yet understand.The first point to be emphasized in connection with human responsibility inrelation to the animals is that the animal world embodies two divine aspects,two divine principles, and two major rays are concerned with their expression ormanifestation. These two aspects are found also in man, and it is along thesetwo lines, which man shares in unison with the animals, that man’sresponsibility and work lie, and through the use of these two aspects of divineenergy will he realise his task and carry it to completion. The same divineactivity and the same divine innate intelligence are found in the form aspect ofboth kingdoms. They are inherent in matter itself. But this third Ray of DivineIntelligence functions more potently and influences more powerfully in theanimal kingdom than in man. This is an item of information not hitherto givenout.[255] The second ray is of course present in its form-building aspect, as herdinstinct and as the basis of the sex relation among animal bodies. It is foundperforming a similar function among human beings, and along these two lines ofenergy will the points of contact be found and the opportunity to assumeresponsibility. Yet it should be noted that, in the last analysis, animals havemore to give men than men have to give animals, where these particular powersand functions are concerned. In the human family another divine aspect is foundfunctioning. which is that of the will, of directed purpose, of plannedobjective, and of intelligent design or plan. These qualities are inherent inman, and constitute an aspect of the divine mind not found actively present inthe animal, as a rule. However, as the animal kingdom comes increasingly underhuman influence and the steady trend towards domesticity makes itself felt, weshall see emerging a measure of purposive objective; and one means towards thisend is to be found in the turning of the animal’s love and attention towards hismaster. In this illustration some of the responsibility of man to the animalworld is expressed. The domestic animals have to be trained to participate inthe action of applied will. This, man seems as yet to interpret as the will ofthe animal to love his master, but it is something deeper and more fundamentalthan the satisfying of man’s love to be loved. The true and intelligent trainingof the wild animals, and their adaptation to the conditions of ordered living,are part of the divine process of integrating the Plan and of producing anordered and harmonious expression of the divine intent. It is through the powerof thought that man will eventually bridge the gap existing between the animalkingdom and man, and it must be done by man’s directed, controlled thought,controlling and directing the animal consciousness. It is not done through theevocation [256] of love, fear or pain. It is intended to be a purely mentalprocess and a unique mental stimulation.The relation of the animals to man has been purely physical in the long pastages. Animals preyed upon men in the days when animal-man was but little removedfrom them. It is oft forgotten that there was a stage in human development whenanimal-man and the existent forms of animal life lived in a much closer relationthan today. Then, only the fact of individualisation separated them. It was,however, an individualisation so little realised that the difference between themindless animal (so-called) and infant humanity was scarcely appreciable. Inthose distant aeons, much transpired which has been lost in the dark silence ofthe past. The animal world was then far more potent than the human, men werehelpless before the onslaughts of the animals, and the devastation wrought byanimals upon early animal-men in mid-Lemurian days was terrible and appalling.Little nomadic groups of human beings would be completely wiped out, age afterage, by the powerful animal life of the period, and though instinct taught theanimal-men to take certain precautions, it was an instinct but little removedfrom that found in their enemies. It was only as the millenia of years passedaway, and human intelligence and cunning began to assert themselves, thathumanity became more powerful than the animals and in its turn devastated theanimal kingdom. Up until two hundred years ago the toll of life exacted by theanimal world from the human, in the forests of the western continents, inAfrica, in the primeval lands of Australia and in the islands of the tropicseas, was incalculable. This is a fact often forgotten in the sentimentality ofa moment, but it lies at the root of man’s cruelty to animals. It is but theinevitable karma of the animal kingdom working out. The question must be viewedfrom a larger scale than has hitherto been the case, and its true historic [257]values must be better understood before man can intelligently decide whatconstitutes his problem of responsibility and how it should be met and solved.In Atlantean days the purely physical relation was tempered by an astral oremotional relation, and the time came when some of the animals were swept withinthe orbit of human life and were tamed and cared for, and when the first of thedomestic animals appeared. A new era began, wherein certain of the animalsevoked affection from certain humans, and a new influence was brought to playupon this third kingdom in nature. This started during a cycle when the secondray and the sixth ray were both functioning simultaneously, and wherein theirmajor and their lesser cycles coincided. This is a rare occurrence, and when ithappens the guardians of the race seize the opportunity to produce major resultsor to inaugurate new moves whereby the divine Plan may be more rapidlydeveloped. To offset the fear found in humanity as a whole (as far as the animalworld was concerned), the opportunity was offered by the guardians of the raceto bring men and animals into a closer relation, and because a cycle was presentin which love and devotion were pouring upon, into and through all forms, a gooddeal of the fear present was offset. Since that time the number of the domesticanimals has steadily increased. The relation between the two kingdoms is nowdual–physical and emotional.To this there has been added, during the past two hundred years, a thirdrelation, that of the mind. The mental power of humanity will, in the lastanalysis, be the controlling factor, and through its means the three subhumankingdoms will be brought under the control of man. This has been happening withgreat rapidity in the mineral kingdom and in the vegetable kingdom. It is notyet accomplished where the animal kingdom is concerned, but the process israpidly going forward [258] . Not much progress will be made during the incomingseventh ray cycle, though as law and order and rhythm are imposed upon theplanet, and as chaos gives place to organisation, we shall see those areas onthe planet wherein the animals still rule increasingly lessened, and certainspecies will die out unless they are preserved in sanctuaries.B. INDIVIDUALISATIONIt is of course apparent that the effect of the interrelation existing betweenanimals and men is to produce in the former that step forward which is calledindividualisation . This event is a consummation of the process of transfusion,and indicates the appearance of the three divine aspects in a unit of life inform. A son of God, a Lord of dedicated and directed Will, is born, and thethird divine principle of purposive energy is fused with the other two andbrings about an entire reorganisation within the animal form. As esotericistshave long pointed out, individualisation is a great planetary experiment, andwhen it was instituted it superseded the earlier method, employed upon the Moon,wherein the urge to reach out and on (called aspiration where man is concerned)was the method employed. This really means that, when the evolving life withinthe form had reached a certain stage of growth in sentiency and awareness, andthe inner urge was adequately strong, the life forced itself into contact withanother stream of divine expression, with another major ray manifestation. Thisunion of various activities caused a new being to emerge into manifestation.This is the basic truth lying behind the ideas put out at this time andclassified under the general term “emergent evolution.” It governs still in manydepartments of nature, and used to govern the appearance of human beings uponthe planet. The urge and the development are from within the [259] organismitself, and are the result of growth, of a reaching out and of an expansion.But the method usually employed at this time is in the nature of a great secondray experiment. This involves an activity from without, from above, from ahigher or from the divine side, if such a use of relatively meaningless wordscan avail to depict the process. The urge or push in this case does notoriginate from the lower two expressions or earlier fusions of divine energies.It is the higher aspect of divinity which takes the initiative and which,through a stimulation applied from without, causes a response from the life inform. Hence the process is really in the nature of an initiation.The animals which individualise are, in every case today, the domestic animals,such as the horse, the dog, the elephant and the cat. These four groups ofanimals are at this time in the “process of transfusion”, as it is occultlycalled, and one by one the life units are prepared and brought to the door ofthat peculiar initiatory process which we call—for lack of a betterterm—individualisation. They wait in that condition until the word goes forththat that door may be passed which will admit them to“...the triple way that leads to the dual road, by treading which they stand atlast before the golden door. This final door ushers them upon that Path which isthe one, alone and single, and disappears into the Light”.Old Commentary.The factors which determine individualisation are several in number, and some ofthem might be enumerated as follows:1. The response of the instinctive nature of the animal to the mental atmosphereof the human being, or beings, with which it is surrounded.2. The outgoing love and interest of the people to which [260] the animal isattached by the bonds of affection or of service.3. The ray impulses which are active at any time. These are, amongst others:a. The ray of the animal itself. Elephants are upon the first ray; dogs areexpressions of the second ray; the cat is a third ray life manifestation, andthe horse is sixth ray. Animals upon other rays are not yet ready forindividualisation.*b. The ray of the particular person or persons with whom the animal isassociated.c. The ray or rays of a particular periodic cycle.* See page 164 for a different enumeration of the rays. The apparentcontradiction may be due to the use of the word “ray” without indicating whethera major ray, one of the seven subrays of a major ray or a complementary ray isimplied. The Publishers.I could give you the techniques with which the guardians of the races andkingdoms work when seeking to bring about individualisation, but of what purposewould it be and what use would such information serve? Each ray affects theunits found upon it at such a crisis as individualisation in a manner differingfrom any other ray; each ray finds its point of prime contact through one orother of the centres in the etheric bodies of animals and men. It must beremembered in this connection that, in the animal, four centres are functioning,and three are present but latent in their effect and use. The process followedis that each ray works or pours its energy through one or other of the centresin the etheric body of that Entity Who informs an entire kingdom in nature, andthen through that particular centre galvanises the individualising unit into theneeded activity. Later, when the ray effects, psychologically speaking, arebetter understood, and the centres, with their seven ray vibrations, have beenmore deeply studied, it will be found that through a particular centre and alonga particular ray vibration, forms of life and centres of consciousness can becontacted and known. This [261] applies to all forms in all kingdoms, subhumanor superhuman. One of the first ways in which man is learning this truth isthrough the discovery of that vibration—emanating from a particular Master—whichproduces a reaction in himself, and which calls forth a response. Thus he isenabled to find out upon which ray his soul is found and to which ray group heshould be attracted. This is of importance to the aspirant, and should beconsidered more carefully than has hitherto been the case, for by it theaspirant determines the nature and the quality of his soul type, and of thecentre through which he (occultly speaking) goes out upon the Path. He discoverslikewise the group of forms and of lives with which he is linked, to which hemust render service, and by which he can be served.The relation of the rays to the centres in the average aspirant might beclassified as follows:1. Head centre Ray of Will or Power First Ray. 2. The Ajna centre Ray ofConcrete Knowledge Fifth Ray. 3. The Throat centre Ray of Active IntelligenceThird Ray. 4. The Heart centre Ray of Love-Wisdom Second Ray. 5. The Solarplexus Ray of Devotion Sixth Ray. 6. The Sacral centre Ray of Ceremonial MagicSeventh Ray. 7. Base of Spine Ray of Harmony Fourth Ray.These rays and their corresponding centres warrant most careful study. They arecomprehensive and revealing. Note, for instance, that at this time the seventhray governs and expresses itself through the sacral centre, that which controlsthe sex life and the building of forms of expression. Therefore it swings nowinto activity and pours through this particular centre in order to organise andproduce the appearance of those new forms through which all life in the newcycle (astrologically understood and periodically and cyclically understood) mayexpress itself. Thus it was necessary for the sex life to be controlled by thistype of energy [262] in order to bring about the needed changes, and hence alsoone of the great results of the influence of the incoming seventh ray has beenthe increase in the mental interest in sex. A study also of the ray influencesin this present historic period, and their relation to the rays, will reveal theaccuracy and suggestiveness of the above ray tabulation.The relation of man to the animals is, as we have seen, physical, emotional andincreasingly mental. Each race of men, in its turn, and working under the rayinfluences, produces definite effects upon the three subhuman kingdoms. Throughhumanity, when the great experiment of individualisation was initiated, theenergies or ray influences from the superhuman kingdoms were focussed and thegreat function of humanity began, which is the transmitting of the ray forcescyclically. Though the six-pointed star is, at this time, the symbol of thecreative work (viewing the work as a whole), the downward pointing triangle,balanced on an upward pointing triangle, will some day present a truer pictureof the creative and preserving function of the fourth kingdom.C. THE FIVE POINTS OF CONTACTThere are five points of contact whereby the material world can be occultly“raised” up into life and power, just as there are five centres always to befound in our planet, through which life and energy pour into the natural world.I refer here to certain centres which are active where the physical and materiallife of the planet are concerned. There are also, as I told you in my writinganent the development during the next three years, five centres through which anew and energising spiritual force is flowing, and these are the planetarycorrespondences to the five senses in man, both subjective and objective. But wefind the rays pouring through humanity as a whole, and through the five races of[263] men (our present race, the Aryan, being the third—two are yet to come).This particular aspect of ray energy is that which stimulates the consciousnessaspect, and it will raise and awaken the consciousness hidden in all materialforms, both in man and in the three subhuman kingdoms. These five points, withtheir five “elevating” influences, are as follows, omitting the two earlier andintangible races which are not strictly human at all, and beginning with thefirst of the five races which are human throughout:1. The Lemurian Race fifth ray The coming of the Sons of Fire. 2. The AtlanteanRace sixth ray The devotion of the Lords of Love. 3. The Aryan Race third rayThe activity of the Men of Mind. 4. The Coming Race fourth ray The vision of theUnits of Light. 5. The Final Race first ray The will of the Lords of Sacrifice.The two earlier races were governed by the second and seventh rays,respectively, and embody the activity of the form builder and the constructiveenergy of the magical organiser. The reader must bear in mind, as he studiesthese major ray cycles, that they cover inconceivably long periods of time, andproduce two effects which must be considered.First, the ray energies, five in number, play upon the human kingdom itself, andin the course of the ages raise man from the dead to life; they lift him out ofthe dark prison of matter into the light of day. These are the five life-givingforces that raise the human consciousness to heaven, and the form tounderstanding. I know no word to express the concept except the word“understanding,” and its true sense is seen when divided into its two componentparts.Secondly, these ray energies, working this time through [264] the human kingdom,raise the subhuman kingdoms in nature also (after much effort) to life andconscious understanding. Through the five points of spiritual contact, in eachof the three kingdoms, is life brought to nature itself. For this “the wholecreation groaneth and travaileth together in pain until now”. Herein is foundthe secret of the resurrection, viewing it in the planetary sense,— aresurrection enacted also individually by each achieving son of God. This is thegreat Masonic secret, and the central mystery of the sublime or third degree inMasonry. It is sometimes occultly referred to as “the relation of death to thefive life-giving energies seen working upon the third day of revelation” or,speaking still more symbolically:“In the chamber of death, the blue light of dawning day reveals the group ofworkers who seek to raise the dead. Naught avail their efforts until they blendthe five great forces of the Lord of Magic. When thus they work as one, in unitycomplete the work is done they fuse the life-giving force; the dead are raised,and the work of building can proceed. The temple can be glorified and the Wordbe uttered forth within a chamber of life-giving force and not of death. Throughdeath to life, from struggle in the dark to building in the light! Such is thePlan. Thus do we enter into life that is a death; pass onward through the doorwhose pillars twain stand there forever as a sign of strength and truth divine;thus do we enter quick within the tomb and die. Thus are we raised again upon aWord divine, upon a fivefold sign, and—springing forth—we live.”Then in relation to humanity, the Old Commentary says:“The Lords of the fifth great ray of mind have sent us on our way. The Lords ofthe sixth great ray forced us to suffer in the cause, yet love it too, andthrough our deep devotion learn. The Lords of the third great ray bring us,through mind, unto the funeral pyre, to the stage wherein we die, yet riseagain. In the third room, and on the third dark day, the Master disappears. Hedies; is lost to sight. But the five great [265] Lords unite their forces. Infellowship sublime, they work to raise the dead. Only thus can that Word bespoken which brings the dead to life. Such is the work of man for God, of Godfor man.”D. CYCLIC MANIFESTATIONSo the work proceeds. The rays stream forth in:1. A solar cycle, such as the present one, in which the second Ray ofLove-Wisdom is the major ray, and all the others are but subsidiary to it.2. A planetary cycle, such as those we have just considered in connection withthe races,—the five above enumerated and their five controlling rays.3. Cycles connected with the twelve signs of the zodiac.These are primarily two in number:a. Those which are connected with a complete zodiacal round, about 25,000 years.b. Those which are connected with each of the twelve signs, and which come inand out of manifestation approximately every 2,100 years.4. Those cycles when certain rays are in power for a period of racial evolution,such as the five major racial periods to which we have referred.5. The lesser cycling in and out of manifestation, as referred to earlier inthis treatise.6. Cycles of ray activity which are determined by their numerical figures.The first ray, for instance, governs all cycles such as those of one millionyears, one hundred thousand years, one thousand years, one hundred years and oneyear. The seventh ray controls such similar cycles as seven thousand years andseven million years. The interchange and interplay of these ray cycles is sointricate and so great that it would serve only [266] to confuse should Ifurther elaborate. Remember, however, that all of the seven rays are foreverfunctioning, and functioning simultaneously, but that cyclically and under thedirected plan of the Minds (who are embodied by the rays), certain of theseinfluences and forces are more dominant at one time than at another, and certainlines of activity and certain results of this activity are demonstrated underone ray influence more than under another. These influences pour through allforms in all kingdoms, producing specific effects, definite and different formsof life, peculiar types of realisation, and particular expressions ofconsciousness in form which are, for that period, the product of the united andconcerted plan of the building forces, working in complete harmony, buttemporarily under one or another of their number. They enter into constructiveactivity; they pass through that particular cycle; they then pass out, or die tothat activity, and are then “raised into heaven,” until such time as their cycleagain comes round. This process they constantly enact and re-enact, repeatingthe drama of birth, death and resurrection.In this ray activity will be found the true significance of the Law of Rebirth,and it lies behind the process of incarnation and of reincarnation. Upon this Imay not here dwell, beyond pointing out that men's ideas and teaching anentreincarnation are as yet childish and inaccurate. Much readjustment must bemade, and much re-arrangement of ideas is necessitated, before a trueunderstanding of this basic cyclic law will be possible.Cyclic appearance, therefore, governs the rays as well as the Kingdoms in natureand the forms contained therein. It determines the activity of God Himself.Races incarnate, disappear and reincarnate, and so do all lives in form.Reincarnation or cyclic activity lies behind all phenomenal activity andappearance. It is an aspect of the pulsating life [267] of Deity. It is thebreathing out and the breathing in of the process of divine existence andmanifestation. It is that which lies behind the science of chemical affinity, ofthe relation of the polar opposites, and of the marriage relation, whether thatof men and women or of the soul and its expression, the personality. It is thecause of the sex relation in the world, which works under the great Law ofAttraction and Repulsion. Perhaps as we are considering the work of one kingdomwith another and the relation between positive and negative groups of lives(such as that of the fourth kingdom in nature to the third), it might beapposite next to deal briefly with this subject of sex, which is to be so deeplyand widely considered, and more wisely understood, through the influence of theincoming seventh ray.I have little more to add to this teaching anent the animal kingdom and therays, for—as said before—it profits not. Man's work is to raise the dead tolife, to bring brotherhood into expression on the physical plane, and totransmit divine energy to a waiting world of forms. As the rays play their partwith humanity and bring man forth into manifestation as he is in essence andreality, his work with the animal kingdom and with the other kingdoms willproceed steadily and inevitably. Scarcely knowing how or why, humanity will playits part in the work of building. The creative work will proceed and the Planmaterialise. Man's work for the animal kingdom is to stimulate instinct untilindividualisation is possible. His work for the vegetable kingdom is to fosterthe perfume-producing faculty, and to adapt plant life to the myriad uses of manand of animals. Man's work with the mineral kingdom is to work alchemically andmagically. With that process of transmutation and of subsequent revelation Icannot here deal. [268]E. THE PROBLEM OF SEXI have stated that the incoming seventh ray plays through the planetary sacralcentre, and then through the sacral centre of every human being. Because ofthis, we can look for the anticipated developments in that human function whichwe designate the sex function. We shall see consequent changes in the attitudeof man towards this most difficult problem. In speaking on the subject of sex,and in outlining what it is possible to say at this time, I seek to be as simpleas I can, and to express my thoughts in such a way that something constructivemay eventuate, and a note may be struck which will sound forth clearly in thepresent welter of discordant sounds, of conflicting views, and of varying ideas.It is obvious that the matter is a difficult one to approach. So why is it sodifficult? In the last analysis, we shall find that the difficulty is based onthe prejudices in men's minds, and upon their inner assurance that theirparticular point of view is necessarily the right one because they themselveslive and act in accordance with it, and it suffices for them; it is based on thefact that sex is one of the fundamental primeval urges, one of the substantialinstincts, and is consequently the dominating factor in the animal side of man'snature; it is based upon the excessive intimacy of the subject,—an intimacywhich was transmuted into an indecent secret during the periods wherein the racesuccumbed to an excessive puritanism and prostituted a natural function into aprurient mystery. This intimacy relating to the subject of sex caused it to beregarded as an unmentionable episode, and as a topic to be shunned by decentpeople, instead of being regarded as an instinctual and natural process,—asinstinctual and as necessary as the functions of eating and drinking. It is afunction, however, which has not been reduced to rhythm in the [269] daily lifeand regarded as one to be followed and satisfied only when need arises and rightdemands. Herein lies a great distinction and a clue is offered to the problem.Again, the difficulty of the problem can be found in the widely diverseattitudes of men's minds to the subject. These attitudes range all the way froman ill-regulated promiscuity to a monogamy which has worked out into a cruelimposition and restraint upon women, and an unbridled license on the part ofmen. Attendant upon these difficulties, and growing out of these wrongattitudes, the legalities and the illegalities, the license and the restraints,have produced points of infection (if I may so call them) in our civilisation.Because of them, we find a lax morality which is based on bewilderment, “redlight” districts which are but an unhappy compromise with vicious tendencies andunsatisfied desires, divorce courts which devastate the life of the family andin time undermine the national life (of which each family unit should be awholesome part), and the steady growth of disease as the result of the prevalentpromiscuity and the many illicit relations. There is also a psychological factorto be found, of real importance. This fact is the militancy expressed by themany groups of people who are seeking to impose their own ideas and theirpeculiar solution of the problem upon their fellowmen.Behind all these results of an age-long wrong attitude to the sex function lietwo major evils, or rather two major effects of man's actions, mental andphysical. These are of dire significance. There is, first of all, thedevelopment within man's consciousness of those complexes, those psychoses andpsychological disruptions and inhibitions, which have so seriously underminedthe health and the serenity of hundreds and thousands of men. There is,secondly, the threatening of the very life of humanity itself, as it is embodiedin the family [270] unit and family life. On the one hand, you have promiscuityand over-indulgence in sex relations, which are resulting (and have alwaysresulted) in over-population and an over-production of human beings. On theother hand, you have an enforced sterility which—though in many ways the lesserof the two evils—is eventually dangerous. This sterility is rapidly on theincrease. It leads finally to physical conditions which are undesirable.Nevertheless, at this time, it is the lesser of the two evils. Two points mightincidentally be noted here. Out of the first of these evils, and as a result ofover-production, we have brought about an economic situation of such a drasticand serious nature that the very peace and stability of the world arethreatened; out of the second, we should have a gradual disappearance ofhumanity itself, if enforced sterility should become a universal practice. Thiswould lead to the consequent dominance of the animal world and an immenseincrease of animal life, and we should have a period of retrogression and not ofprogress.In dealing with this subject of sex I shall have to generalise, and theexceptions to the rules laid down and to the suggested classifications will, ofcourse, be many. I am dealing with the subject as a whole, and my topictherefore is the menace of the present attitude, the need for a fullerunderstanding, and the importance of a re-arrangement of men's ideas on thisvital matter. The attitude of the unthinking savage to the sex life, and theattitude of the mentally polarised and spiritually oriented initiate to the samesubject, may seem so widely dissimilar that on the surface there may appear nopoint of resemblance; yet basically both of these attitudes are nearer to eachother and to the reality than is that of the average man today. The one iscontrolled by the rhythm of his animal nature, and knows no more of the evilside and of the vile promiscuity of the civilised man than does the [271] animalin its wild state; the other lives his life in a controlled fashion, governingthrough the power of the mind, and animated by desire for the good of humanity.In between these two approaching extremes, we have the many points of view, themany dissimilar ideas, the many customs, the many types of relation (legitimateand illegitimate), the many animal and psychological reactions, the many formsof marriage, and the many perversions of a natural process which distinguishmodern man in all parts of the world. These again vary in the differentcivilisations and under the influence of the differing climatic conditions.It is therefore obvious—is it not?—that it is no part of my service to thereaders of this book to enter into a detailed analysis of the marriage customsof the ages, past and present. It is not my work to enlarge in detail upon themistakes, the evil consequences, the many types of perversion, and the sadisticcruelties which have grown out of man's misuse of the natural processes and ofhis mate, nor to elucidate his foolish misunderstanding of the Law of Attractionand Repulsion. It would serve no useful purpose if I put forth, in this briefdiscussion of an immense subject, any of the theories which men have formulatedin their search for a solution. Their name is legion. All have in them a measureof the truth. Most of them express the depths of man's ignorance, and they canbe studied at any time by any student who has the time to read, the intelligenceto see clearly and without prejudice, and the money to purchase the neededliterature.I cannot and I will not touch upon the medical and physiological aspect of vice,whether it be the vice of promiscuity or the vice of an unhappy marriage. I canbest serve you at this time by pointing out the laws which should govern thelife of man, particularly where sex is concerned, and by [272] indicating—as faras I can and dare—why and how the present peculiar and unique conditions havebeen brought about. I may also be able to make certain suggestions which, whenduly considered, may help to clear from the mind those false and illusory viewswhich prevent man from seeing truly, and I may thus help him to find the goldenthread of light which will lead him to his solution in due time.One thing I will say, sad though it may seem to you to be. There is no immediatesolution of the problem of sex with which we are at this time confronted. Forages men have misused and wrongly employed a God-given function; they haveprostituted their birthright, and through their laxity and license, and throughtheir lack of control, they have inaugurated an era of disease, both mental andphysical, of wrong attitudes and illusory relations which it will take severalcenturies to eradicate; they have also brought too rapidly into incarnationmyriads of human beings who were not yet ready for the experience of thisincarnation, and who needed longer interludes between births wherein toassimilate experience. Those souls who are unevolved come into incarnation withrapidity; but older souls need longer periods wherein to garner the fruits ofexperience. They are however open to the magnetic attractive power of those whoare alive on the physical plane, and it is these souls who can be broughtprematurely into incarnation. The process is under law, but the unevolvedprogress under group law as do the animals, whilst the more evolved aresusceptible to the pull of human units, and the evolved come into incarnationunder the Law of Service, and through the deliberate choice of their conscioussouls.I shall divide what I have to say into four parts, for the sake of clarity andrapid reference: [273]1. Definitions of sex, of virtue and of vice.2. Sex in the New Age.3. Some suggestions for the present moment.4. Sex and the life of discipleship.I deal not with history nor with the details of racial evolution. These arenecessarily all connected with the problem of sex, but are too vast in theirimplications for my present purposes. As I said before, I deal not with thephysiological aspects of sex, nor with the diseases incident upon the misuse ofthe function, nor shall I deal with the subject of sterility, except as itenters into our consideration of modern man. I cannot touch upon the quarrels ofthe various schools of thought, for I am not writing from any specific angle,such as that of religion or of morality or of partisanship. The whole questionis wider and bigger than any religious view or the moral affirmations of thelittle minds. What is morality in one country or in one specific relation can bequite the reverse in another. What is deemed legal in one part of the world isfound illegal in another. What constitutes a difficult problem under oneclimatic condition presents totally different possibilities under another.Polygamy, promiscuity and monogamy have been and are cyclically dominant indifferent parts of the world, down through the ages, and are to be foundfunctioning simultaneously on the earth today. Each has been, or is, in turnright, legal and suitable, or wrong, illegal and unsuitable. Each of these formsof interpreting the sex relation has been the subject of attack or defence, ofvirtuous horror or of specious argument; each has been the common custom and therightful method, according to the location, the tradition, training and attitudeof the men who practiced it. In one part of the world, one woman may have manyhusbands; in another, one husband is legally [274] entitled to four wives, if sohe choose, and in the harem and the kraal such conditions are always to befound. In the West, a man has legally one wife, but through his promiscuity andhis so-called “romantic” adventures, he really has as many as an Africanchieftain; and today, women are little better.I have enumerated the above conditions with no thought of criticism in my mind,but simply as a statement of fact, and in order to awaken in the average readera realisation of a world-wide condition which is probably quite different totheir ordinary surmise. I write not for the specialists, but for the averageintelligent student who needs a world-wide picture of existing conditions.It is divinely true that the trend of men's thoughts and desires is towards anestablished monogamy, but as yet this has never been universally achieved. Ifone faces this issue with courage and with truth, one will be forced to theconclusion that down the ages men have never been monogamists. Women have beenmore so in the past than men, but are perhaps less so now, as modern knowledgeis inculcating modern methods of protection from the risk and pain ofchildbirth. Up till now, the act of bearing children has been regarded asdeterrent and as a penalty for legal or illegal sex relations. Think of thehorror unfolded in those words! Women, practicing the ancient trade ofpromiscuity, have of course always existed, but I am referring here to women inthe home.Will you believe me if I tell you that the world situation today where sex isconcerned, is so critical and so serious that there is not a thinker to be foundwho can yet see the solution, or who can find—no matter how clear his brain orerudite his mind—the way out of the present impasse? The traditions of customsand of practices, with their inevitable consequences and long establishedtenure, serve to bewilder [275] the clearest minds. The physical results aloneof sexual intercourse, carried on within or without the legalised marriagerelation, have produced not only the world of every-day human life, but much ofthe disease, the insanity, the evil tendencies, and the perverted impulses whichtoday fill our hospitals, our homes for neurotics, our sanatoriums, our prisonsand our lunatic asylums.Our young people, especially the idealistic types and the clear-thinking boysand girls, find themselves faced with a situation which defies their bestefforts. They do not know what to think or what to believe. They look into, orform part of, homes which are sanctified by legal marriage, and find (on a largescale) nothing but unhappiness, legalised prostitution, ill-health, the seekingof illicit relations outside the home, neglected and unwanted children, thefriction produced by wrong mating, divorce, and no answer to their manyintelligent questions. They look then elsewhere, into the lives of those whohave avoided the responsibility of marriage, and find naught but discontent,frequently a secret and hidden sex life, ill-health as a result of thefrustration of the natural instincts, psychological conditions of the worstkind, sometimes illegitimate children, sexual perversions, and a growingtendency towards what is called homosexuality. They are overwhelmed by completebewilderment and the failure to find an answer to their questions. They ask theworldly-minded for a solution and for help, and get no clear reply, no soundphilosophy and no fundamental instruction. They may be offered sound commonsense, and the injunction to avoid excesses and those conditions which wouldimpair their health or lay on them the burden of straitened economic conditions.The moralities of the past may be pointed out to them, and they may be warned ofthe results which inevitably follow when the laws of nature are broken and the[276] physical body is prostituted to ill-regulated desire. They may have thevirtues of “straight living” eulogised to them, and even the fact that they aresons of God may be emphasized to them. All this is good and right and useful.But no true solution is offered, and no light is thrown upon their problem, andtheir confusion remains unrelieved. They may perhaps turn to the religiouslyminded people and seek out the orthodox churchman. They may be told to be good;the example of the saints may be cited to them; they may find themselves delugedin a flood of puritanical injunctions, in righteous platitudes, and withunsatisfying explanations, based often on personal prejudice and predilection.But seldom is a clear note sounded, and seldom is it possible to do more thanenunciate the great Mosaic law, “Thou shalt not...” To the bulk of the young andseeking enquirers of the present generation the fact that God says thus and so,or the Bible ordains this, that or the other, does not satisfy their longing toknow the reason why. The hope of an ultimate heaven, where self-discipline,self-control and sexual abstinence will receive a just reward, seems too faraway to offset the temptations of the outer environing world and the insistenturges arising within the man himself.That many do withstand the “temptations of the flesh” is indeed wonderfullytrue. That there are men and women everywhere who pass through life clean anduncontaminated is equally and wonderfully a fact. That there are advanced soulswhose life is divorced from the animal nature and whose minds control theirdaily acts is the glory of humanity. But many of them, living in another worldof thought and interest, are not tempted as are the more animally inclined ofthe sons of men. There are, again, of course, those who refrain from wrong doingbecause they fear the results, either today in the physical body or hereafter inthe other world of [277] penalty. But which of all these people, even the mostgood and saintly, can speak with real wisdom and understanding of this universalproblem? Which of them can see the way out for humanity at present? Which ofthem understands the reason for all the distress, sin and wickedness which havegrown up around the sex relation? Which of them really comprehends the truesignificance of the sex life, its place in the great scheme of things, and thereason for the relation between the sexes? Which of them can say with truevision what the next evolutionary step will be, whither we are going, and whatwill be the next development?1. Definitions of Sex, of Virtue and of ViceCosmically speaking, sex is a short word used to express the relation existing(during manifestation) between spirit and matter, and between life and form. Itis, in the last analysis, an expression of the Law of Attraction,—that basic lawwhich underlies the entire manifestation of life in form, and which is the causeof all phenomenal appearance. Humanly or physically speaking, sex is the wordused to denote the relation between men and women which results in thereproduction of the species. Speaking in terms of modern usage as it is foundamong the unthinking and the average, sex is a word which denotes the alluringsatisfaction of the animal impulses at any cost and with no rhythmic regulation.Sex is essentially an expression of duality, and of the separation of a unityinto two aspects or halves. These we can call spirit and matter, male andfemale, positive and negative; and they are in the nature of a stage upon theevolutionary ladder towards a final unity or homo-sexuality which has norelation to that perversion which is, today and inaccurately, called“homosexuality”. This latter manifestation is rampant at this time in a mentaland modern conception of the phenomenon, [278] but it is rare indeed to find aperson who truly combines within himself the two sexes, and is,— physiologicallyand mentally—entirely “self-satisfying, self-sustaining and self-propagating”.Down the ages, here and there, we find the true homo-sexual emerging as aguarantee of a distant racial and evolutionary achievement, when the world cyclewill have been run and the two separated halves will again be merged in theiressential unity. In the above phraseology I do not refer to any doctrine of twinsouls, or to any perversion of reality, as ordinarily understood today. I referto the divine Hermaphrodite, to the true androgynous man, and to the perfectedhuman being. But the word has been distorted from its true significance andapplies in nine cases out of ten (nay, in ninety-nine cases out of one hundred)to a type of mental perversion, to a distorted attitude of mind which resultsoften in physical practices and reactions which are—in their manifestation—soold that their very antiquity gives the lie to the idea that this attitude marksa step forward on the path of progress. It marks indeed a point ofretrogression, the swinging back into an ancient rhythm, and the resumption ofancient practices.These perversions are ever found when a civilisation is crumbling and the oldorder is changing into a new. Why should this be? It is due to the fact that thenewer impulses pouring into the old, and the impact of the new forces uponhumanity, awaken in man a desire for that which is, for him, a new and untriedfield of expression, and for that which is unusual and oft abnormal. Weak mindsthen succumb to the impulse, or strong experimenting souls fall victim to theirown lower natures, and investigate in unlawful directions. You have, then, underthese new energies, a definite progress forward into new and untried spiritualrealms, but at the [279] same time, you find an experimenting in the realm ofphysical desire which is not for humanity the line of progress.As the world of forms responds cyclically to the inflow of the higher energies,their effect is to stimulate all parts and aspects of the form life, and thisstimulation will produce results that are bad as well as good. Evil willtemporarily emerge as well as lasting righteousness. If the effect of the impactof these energies is to produce material reactions, and if man then lays theemphasis of his interest upon that which is material, then the form naturebecomes dominant, and not the divine. If energy is prostituted to material ends,such as the expression of physical plane sexual relations for purely commercialobjectives, then evil is the result. But it must be remembered that the samedivine energy, when working in the realm of brotherly love, for instance, wouldproduce naught but good. Let me illustrate my point in two ways, both of whichaccount for the present orgy of sexual expression and for the widespreadinterest in the subject.We live today in a period of the world's history wherein three events of majorimportance are taking place, mostly unrealised and unobserved by the majority ofpeople.The seventh Ray of Law and Order is coming into manifestation; we aretransitting into a new sign of the zodiac, and the “coming of Christ” isimminent. These three great happenings are the cause of much of the presentupheaval and chaos; at the same time they are responsible for the universalturning to spiritual realities which all true workers at this time recognise,and for the growth of understanding, of welfare movements and of the tendency tocooperation, of religious unity and of internationalism. Types of energy whichhave hitherto been latent are now becoming potent. The consequent world reactionis, in the initial stages, material in its manifestation; in its final stages,divine qualities [280] will manifest and change history and civilisation. Theinterest being shown today in the so-called cosmic rays indicates a scientificrecognition of the new incoming seventh ray energies. These rays, pouringthrough the sacral centre of the planetary etheric body, have necessarily aneffect upon the sacral centres of humanity, and hence the sex life of mankind istemporarily over-stimulated, and hence also the present over-emphasis upon sex.But hence also (and this must be remembered) the keen impetus now being mentallyexpressed which will eventually result in man's thinking through to a solutionof this problem of sex.The coming in of the Aquarian age also stimulates in man a spirit ofuniversality and a tendency towards fusion. This can be seen working out in thepresent trend towards synthesis in business, in religion and in politics. Itproduces an urge towards union, and among other unions, towards religiousunderstanding and tolerance. But these influences, playing upon the sensitivebodies of the undeveloped and the over-psychic, lead to a morbid tendencytowards unions, legitimate and illegitimate; they produce an extreme aptitude tosexual intercourse in many directions, and to relations and fusions which arenot along the intended or the evolutionary line, and which outrage oft the verylaws of nature itself. Energy is an impersonal thing, and is dual in itseffect,— the effect varying according to the type of substance upon which itplays.The incoming seventh ray expresses the power to organise, the ability tointegrate and to bring into synthetic relation the great pairs of opposites, andthus produce the new forms of spiritual manifestation. But it will also producethe new forms of what, from the standpoint of spirit, may be regarded asmaterial evil. It is the great impulse which will bring into the light of dayall that is to be found clothed [281] with matter, and will thus eventually leadto the revelation of spirit and of the hidden glory, when that which has beenrevealed of the material form has been purified and sanctified. This it was towhich Christ referred when He prophesied that, at the end of the age, the hiddenthings would be made plain, and secrets be shouted from the housetops.By means of this process of revelation, within the human family as well aselsewhere in nature, we shall have the development of the power of thought. Thiswill come about through the development of the faculty of discrimination, whichwill offer choices to man, and thus develop a truer sense of values. False andtrue standards will emerge in man's consciousness and those choices will be madewhich will lay the foundation of the new order, which will inaugurate the newrace, with its new laws and novel approaches, and so usher in the new religionof love and brotherhood, and that period wherein the group and group-good willbe the dominant note. Then separateness and hatreds will fade out and men willbe merged in a true unity.The third factor under consideration, the coming of the Christ as it is called,must also be noted. Everywhere we find the spirit of expectancy, and the demandfor a manifestation and a symbolic happening which we call by various names butwhich is usually referred to as the advent of Christ. This, as you know, may bean actual physical coming, as before in Palestine, or it may connote a definiteovershadowing of His disciples and lovers by the Great Lord of Life. Thisovershadowing will call forth a response from all those who are in any wayspiritually awakened. Or again, the coming may take the form of a tremendousinflow of the Christ principle, the Christ life and love, working out throughthe human family. Perhaps all three possibilities may be found simultaneously onour planet very shortly. It is [282] not for us to say. It is for us to beready, and for us to work at preparing the world for that significant series ofevents. The immediate future will show. The point I seek to make, however, isthat this inflow of the Christ spirit of love (whether it comes through a Personin bodily form or through His felt and realised Presence) will again be twofoldin its effect.This is a hard saying for the unthinking and the illogical. Both the good andthe evil man will be stimulated; both material desire and spiritual aspirationwill be awakened and fostered. Facts prove the truth of the saying that aheavily fertilised garden and a carefully tended and watered plot of ground willproduce its crop of weeds as well as flowers. Yet in this fact you have tworeactions to the same sun, the same water, the same fertilising agency and thesame care. The difference exists in the seeds found in the ground upon whichthese factors play. The inflow of love therefore will stimulate earthly love andearthly desire and animal lust; it will foster the urge to possess in thematerial sense, with all the evil consequent upon this attitude, and theresulting growth of sexual reactions, and the many expressions of anill-regulated mechanism, responding to an impersonal force. But it will alsoproduce the growth of brotherly love and foster the development and theexpression of group consciousness, of universal understanding; it will produce anew and powerful tendency to fusion, to at-one-ment and to synthesis. All thiswill be brought about through the medium of humanity and the Christ spirit.Steadily the love of Christ will be shed abroad in the earth, and its influencewill grow stronger during the coming centuries, until at the end of the Aquarianage, and through the work of the seventh ray (bringing the pairs of oppositesinto closer cooperation), we can look for the “raising of Lazarus from thedead,” and the [283] emergence of humanity out of the tomb of matter. The hiddendivinity will be revealed. Steadily all forms will be brought under theinfluence of the Christ spirit, and the consummation of love will be broughtabout.Owing to these three causes we have at this time a worldwide interest in sex,leading as a natural consequence to two things:First, to an outburst throughout the entire world, and primarily in our largecentres of population, of an increase in sexual relations, but distinguished atthis time by no corresponding increase in population. This is due to the modernunderstanding of birth control methods and secondly to the increased mentalfocussing or polarisation of the race, which leads to sterility or to areduction in the size of the families raised.Second, to a reorganisation of the racial ideas on marriage and on sexualrelations. This is due to the breakdown of our present economic situation, tothe widespread interest in medical hygiene (an interest hitherto confined to thespecialists), to the general recognition of the varied marriage customs of thenations in the East and in the West, which has led to a general questioning, andalso to the failure of the legal machine to safeguard the family unit and tointerpret human relations in a satisfactory manner.Out of this universal interest and discussion we shall work towards a solutionand an objective which exist as yet on purely abstract mental levels and in theworld of ideas. Even the foremost thinkers of the race sense only vaguely andnebulously what these hidden ideals may be.The question at issue is not primarily a religious one, except in so far associal relations are basically divine relations. It is fundamental in itsconnotation, and when it is solved we shall see the establishment of equalitybetween the sexes, the [284] removal of those barriers which at present existbetween men and women, and the safe-guarding of the family unit. This willinvolve therefore the protection of the child, so that he may be given thoseessentials to right physical growth and that true education which will lead toemotional unfoldment along sound lines, and a mental development which willenable him to serve his race, his time and his group to the best possibleadvantage. This has always been an ideal, but it has never yet beensatisfactorily accomplished. The solving of the sexual problem will release theminds of men from an inhibition and an undue concern, and so produce a mentalfreedom which will admit of the inflow of new ideas and concepts. We shalldiscover that vice and virtue have no real reference to ability and inability toconform to man-made laws, but to man's attitude to himself and to his socialrelation with God and his fellowmen. Virtue is the manifestation in man of thespirit of cooperation with his brothers, necessitating unselfishness,understanding and complete self-forgetfulness. Vice is the negation of thisattitude. These two words signify in reality simply perfection and imperfection,conformity to a divine standard of brotherhood or a failure to achieve thatstandard. Standards are shifting things and change with man's growth towardsdivinity. They vary also according to man's destiny as it is affected by histime and age, his nature and surroundings. They alter also according to thepoint of evolutionary development. The standard for attainment is not today whatit was one thousand years ago, nor a thousand years hence will it be what it istoday.Yet all periods of the world's history have not been as critical as today,for—apart from the great cyclic opportunity to which I have earlier referred—wehave in humanity itself a unique attainment. For the first time in racialhistory, we have the expression of a true human being, of man as he [285]essentially is. We have the personality, integrated and functioning as a unit,and we have the mind and the emotional nature fused and blended, on the one handwith the physical body, and on the other with the soul. Also, the shift ofemphasis is today away from the physical life to the mental life, and in anincreasing number of cases to the spiritual life. There is therefore little realcause for depression, if what I have here noted is true. There is today, on awide scale, a true “lifting up of the heart unto the Lord,” and a steady turningof the eyes towards the world of spiritual values. Hence the present upheaval.Apart from the coming in of the new age, apart therefore from the inflow of theChrist spirit, with its transforming power and regenerating force, and apartfrom the cyclic return of the seventh ray energies, we have mankind in acondition where the response to the deeper spiritual energies and to the newopportunities is, for the first time, adequate and synthetic. Hence theincreasing problem. Hence the great day of opportunity. Hence the wonder of thedawn which can be seen brightening in the east.I should like here to approach the problem of sex from another angle and pointout that it is a basic symbol. A symbol, as we well know, is an outward andvisible sign of an inward and spiritual reality. What is this inward reality?First of all, the reality of relationship. It is a relationship existing betweenthe basic pairs of opposites,—Father-Mother, spirit-matter; between positive andnegative; between life and form, and between the great dualities which—whenbrought together in the cosmic sense—produce the manifested son of God, thecosmic Christ, the conscious sentient universe. Of this relation the Gospelstory is a dramatic symbol, and the historical Christ is the guarantee of itstruth and reality. Christ guarantees for us the reality of the innersignificance [286] and the true spiritual basis of all that is and ever shallbe. Out of the relation of light and dark that which is invisible emerges intovisibility, and we can see and know. Christ, as the light of the world, revealedthat reality. Out of the darkness of time God spoke, and the Fatherhood of Deitywas revealed.The drama of creation and the story of revelation are depicted for us, if wecould but see truly and interpret our facts with spiritual exactitude, in therelation of the two sexes and in the fact of their intercourse with each other.When this relation is no longer purely physical but is a union of the twoseparated halves on all three planes,— physical, emotional and mental—then weshall see the solution of the sex problem and the restitution of the marriagerelation to its intended position in the Mind of God. Today it is the marriageof two physical bodies. Sometimes it is the marriage also of the emotionalnatures of the two people concerned. Rarely indeed is it a marriage of minds aswell. Sometimes it is the union of the physical body of one party, with thephysical body of the other party left cold and uninterested and uninvolved, butwith the emotional body attracted and participating. Sometimes the mental bodyis involved with the physical body, and the emotional nature left out. Seldom,very seldom, do we find the coordinated, cooperating fusion of all the threeparts of the personality concerned in both parties to the union. When this isindeed found, then you have a true union, a real marriage, and a blending of thetwo in one.It is here that some of the schools of esoteric teaching have gone sadly astray.The false idea has crept into their presentation of truth that marriage of thiskind is essential for spiritual liberation and that without it the soul remainsin prison. They teach that through the marriage act, at-one-ment with [287] thesoul is brought about, and that there is no spiritual deliverance without thismarriage. At-one-ment with the soul is an individual interior experience,resulting in an expansion of consciousness, so that the individual and specificbecomes at-one with the general and universal. Behind the erroneousinterpretation, however, lies truth.Where this true marriage and these ideal sexual relations on all three planesare found, the right conditions exist in which souls can be provided with theneeded forms in which to incarnate. Sons of God can find forms in which tomanifest on earth. According to the scope of the marriage contact (if so unusuala form of words can be used in this connection), so will be the type of humanbeing attracted into incarnation. Where the parents are purely physical andemotional, so will be the nature of the child. Thus is the general averagedetermined. Today we have a world of men which is rapidly reaching a high stageof development. We have therefore a dissatisfaction with the present views onmarriage, preparatory to the enunciation of certain hidden principles which willeventually govern the relations between the sexes, and provide, as aconsequence, the opportunity to men and women to furnish, through the creativeact, the needed bodies for disciples and initiates.Under the symbol of sex, you have also the reality of love itself expressingitself. Love in reality connotes a relation, but the word “love” (like the word“sex”) is used with little thought and with no attention to its true meaning.Basically, love and sex are one and the same thing, for both express the meaningof the Law of Attraction. Love is sex, and sex is love, for in those two wordsthe relation, the interplay and the union between God and His universe, betweenman and God, between a man and his own soul, and between men and women areequally depicted. The motive and the [288] relation are emphasized. But theimpelling result of that relation is creation and the manifestation of formthrough which divinity can express itself and come to be. Spirit and matter mettogether, and the manifested universe came into being. Love is ever productive,and the Law of Attraction is fruitful in results. Man and God came togetherunder the same great Law, and the Christ was born,—the guarantee of the divinityof humanity and the demonstration of the fact. Individual man and his soul arealso attempting to come together, and when that event is consummated the Christis born in the cave of the heart, and Christ is seen in the daily life withincreasing power. Man therefore dies daily in order that Christ may be seen inall His glory. Of all these wonders, sex is the symbol.Again, in man himself the great drama of sex is enacted, and twice over in hisbody, within his personality, the process of union and fusion takes place. Letme briefly refer here to these two symbolic happenings, for the use of esotericstudents, so that the great story of sex may be comprehended in its spiritualsense.Man, as you know, is the expression of energies. These energies galvanise thephysical man into activity through the medium of certain force centres in theetheric body. These, for our immediate purposes, can be divided into threecentres below the diaphragm and four above.These are:I. Below the diaphragm:1. The base of the spine.2. The sacral centre.3. The solar plexus.II. Above the diaphragm:1. The heart centre.2. The throat centre.3. The centre between the eyebrows.4. The head centre.[289] We know that two fusions have to take place and, in these two we have twoenactments of the symbolic sex process, and two symbolic events that externalisea spiritual happening and picture forth to man his spiritual goal and God'sgreat objective in the evolutionary process.First, the energies below the diaphragm have to be lifted up and blended withthose above the diaphragm. With the process and rules for so doing we cannothere deal, except in one case,—the raising of the sacral energy to the throatcentre, or the transmutation of the process of physical reproduction and ofphysical creation into that of the creativeness of the artist in some field ofcreative expression. Through the union of the energies of these two centres weshall come to that stage in our development wherein we shall produce thechildren of our skill and minds. Where, in other words, there is a true union ofthe higher and the lower energies, you will have the emergence of beauty inform, the enshrining of some aspect of truth in appropriate expression, and thusthe enriching of the world. Where there is this synthesis, the true creativeartist begins to function. The throat, the organ of the Word, expresses the lifeand manifests the glory and the reality behind. Such is the symbolism lyingbehind the teaching of the fusion of the lower energies with the higher, and ofthis, physical plane sex is a symbol. Mankind today is rapidly becoming morecreative, for the transfusion of the energies is going on under the newimpulses. As we develop the sense of purity in man, as the growth of the senseof responsibility is fostered, and as his love of beauty, of colour and of ideasproceeds, we shall have a rapid increase in the raising of the lower into unionwith the higher, and thereby the beautifying of the Temple of the Lord will betremendously accelerated.In the coming Aquarian age this will go rapidly forward. [290] The majority ofpeople today live below the diaphragm, and their energies are turned outwardinto the material world and prostituted to material ends. In the comingcenturies this will be corrected; their energies will be transmuted andpurified, and men will begin to live above the diaphragm. They will then expressthe potencies of the loving heart, of the creative throat, and of the divinelyordered will of the head. Of this relation between the lower and the higher,physical plane sex is the symbol.But in the head of man himself is also to be found a marvellous symbolichappening. In that living organism is enacted that drama whereby the purelyhuman being merges himself in divinity. The great final drama of the mysticalunion between God and man, and between the soul and the personality is thereenacted. According to the Eastern philosophy, there are in the head of man twogreat energy centres. One of them, the centre between the eyebrows, blends andfuses the five types of energy which are transmitted to it and blended withit,—the energy of the three centres below the diaphragm and of the throat andheart centres. The other, the head centre, is awakened through meditation,service and aspiration, and it is through this centre that the soul makes itscontact with the personality. This head centre is the symbol of the spirit orpositive masculine aspect, just as the centre between the eyebrows is the symbolof matter, of the negative feminine aspect. Connected with these force vorticesare two physical plane organs, the pituitary body and the pineal gland. Thefirst is negative and the second is positive. These two organs are the highercorrespondences of the male and female organs of physical reproduction. As thesoul becomes increasingly potent in the mental and emotional life of theaspirant, it pours in with greater power into the head centre. As the man workswith his personality, purifying it [291] and bending it to the service of thespiritual will, he automatically raises the energies of the centres in the bodyup to the centre between the eyebrows. Eventually the influence of each of thetwo centres increases and becomes wider and wider, until they make a contactwith each other's vibratory or magnetic field, and instantly the light flashesout. Father-spirit and mother-matter unite and are at-one and the Christ isborn. “Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God,” said theChrist. This is the second birth, and from that moment vision comes withincreasing power.This is again the great drama of sex, re-enacted in man. Thus in his personallife he three times knows the meaning of union, of sex:1. In the physical plane sex, or his relation to his opposite, the woman,resulting in the reproduction of the species.2. In the union of the lower energies with the higher, resulting in the creativework.3. In the union within the head of the energies of the personality with those ofthe soul, resulting in the birth of the Christ.Great is the glory of man and wonderful are the divine functions which heembodies. Through the passage of time, the race has been brought to the pointwhere man is beginning to raise the lower energies into the higher centres, andit is this transition which is causing much of the trouble in the world today.Many men everywhere are becoming politically, religiously, scientifically, orartistically creative, and the impact of their mental energy and of their plansand ideas is making itself felt competitively. Until the idea of brotherhooddominates the race, we shall see these powers prostituted to personal ends andambitions, and to consequent disaster, just as we have seen the power of sexprostituted [292] to personal satisfaction and selfishness and consequentdisaster. Some few, however, are raising their energies higher still andtranslating them into terms of the heavenly world. The Christ is being borntoday in many a human being, and increasingly will the sons of God appear intheir true nature to take over the guidance of humanity in the New Age.2. Sex in the New AgeProphecy is ever a dangerous thing, but a forecast, a drawing out of presentgeneral tendencies, is often possible.During the next two hundred years the old influences under which we have beenliving will gradually die out, and the new potencies will make their presencefelt. Three things we are told will characterise the coming Aquarian age, andthey will be made possible through the influence of the three planets governingthe three decanates of this sign. First, we shall have the activity of Saturn,producing a dividing of the ways and a proffering of opportunity to those whocan avail themselves of it. We shall have, therefore, a period of discipline anda cycle wherein choices will be made, and through these discriminating decisionshumanity will enter into its birthright. This influence is now being stronglyfelt.Then, later, we shall have, through the influence of Mercury in the seconddecanate, the pouring in of light, of mental and spiritual illumination, and atruer interpretation of the teaching of the Lodge of Messengers. The work of thefirst decanate will enable many to make those choices and efforts which willenable them to raise the lower energies into the higher centres, and to transferthe focus of their attention from below to above the diaphragm. The work of thesecond decanate will enable those who are thus ready to fuse the personality andthe soul, and thus, as I earlier [293] pointed out, the light will shine forthand Christ will be born within them.During the third decanate we shall see the rule of Brotherhood inaugurated, andVenus controlling by intelligent love; the group and not the individual will bethe important unit, and unselfishness and cooperation will steadily take theplace of separativeness and competition.In no department of life will these coming great changes show more potently thanin the attitude of man towards sex, and in the readjustment of the marriagerelationship. This new attitude will gradually come about as the slowlydeveloping science of psychology comes into its own. As man comes to understandhis own threefold nature, and as the nature of consciousness and the depth ofhis own subconscious life are more truly grasped, there will take place,gradually and automatically, a change in the attitude of men towards women andof women towards their destiny. This needed change will not be the result oflegal measures, or of decisions by the people's representatives to meet thedisasters of the hour; these changes will come slowly, as the result of theintelligent interest of the next three generations. The young people now cominginto incarnation, and those who will come during the next century, will provethemselves well equipped to handle this problem of sex, because they can seemore clearly than the older generation, and will think in wider and larger termsthan is common today. They will be more group-conscious and less individualisticand selfish; they will be more interested in new ideas than in the ancienttheologies, and will be freer from prejudice and less intolerant than are thebulk of the well-meaning people of today. Psychology is only just come into itsown, and only now is its function beginning to be understood; in one hundredyears time, however, it will be the dominating science; [294] and the newereducational systems, based on scientific psychology, will have completelysuperseded our modern methods. The emphasis in the future will be laid upon thedetermining of a man's life purpose. This will be brought about through anunderstanding of his ray, through an analysis of his equipment (and of this,vocational psychology is the faint first beginning), through a study of hishoroscope, and through giving him a sound grounding in mind control, as well astraining his memory to the impartation of information. The processes by which hecan integrate his personality and raise and purify his living qualities willreceive careful attention, and all to the end of making him group-conscious anduseful to his group. This is the factor of importance. Synthesis, physicalpurity, decentralisation and group good will be the keynotes of the teachingimparted. Emotional control and right-thinking will be inculcated, and wherethese are present a knowledge of spiritual realities will be automaticallyacquired and the life subordinated to the group purpose. Man's relations toothers will then be intelligently directed, and his relation to the other sexwill be guided not only by love and desire, but by an ordered intellectualappreciation of the true significance of marriage. The above applies to theintelligent, well-intentioned majority whose standards will have developed asthe decades pass, so that they will embody the dreams and ideals of the mostadvanced visionaries of today. The unthinking, the idle and the stupid willstill be found, but evolution proceeds apace and order is on its way.What laws will be enacted for the control of the people on this difficultsubject of sex I cannot say; what the marriage laws will be it is no part of mypurpose to foretell; how the legislatures of the nations will deal with theproblem remains to be seen. I am not interested in speculation.[295] But I can and I shall put down for you here the basic premises which willunderlie the best thought of the future on the subject of sex and marriage.These premises are three in number; when they are understood and grasped, andwhen they are integrated into the thought of the period, forming the basis ofall recognised standards and consistent living, then the details as to how andwhere and when will take care of themselves.1. The relation of the sexes and their approach to the marriage relation will beregarded as a part of the group life and as serving the group good; this willnot be the result of laws regulating marriage, but a result of education ingroup relations, service and the law of love, as understood practically and notjust sentimentally. Men and women will know themselves as cells in a vitalorganism, and their activities and outlook will be coloured by this realisation.It will be regarded as a fact in nature and as a product of past evolutionarycycles, and not be looked upon as a theory and a hope, as is the case today.What is best for the group, and what is needed to promote the efficiency of aunit in the group, will be the points considered. Men will increasingly live inthe world of thought and understanding, and not so much in the world ofill-regulated desire and of animal instinct; the love of men for women and ofwomen for men will be more truly present than is now the case, for it will notbe so purely emotional, and it will be based also on intelligence.As the creative urge is turned upwards from the sacral centre to the throat, manwill live less potently in his physical sexual urges, and more consistently inhis creative expression. His physical plane life will proceed along normallines, but it is necessary for men to realise that the manner in which man todaysatisfies his sexual nature is abnormal and unregulated, [296] and that we areon our way to a wise normality. The craving for selfish pleasure and for thesatisfaction of an animal urge, which is instinctually right when regulated anddevastatingly wrong when prostituted purely to enjoyment, will give place to amutual decision by both of the parties concerned. The decision will meet anatural need in a right and suitable and regulated manner. Today one party orother is usually sacrificed, either to an undue abstinence or to an unseemlyprofligacy.2. The second rule is based upon the point of evolution, and for its rightfulfillment necessitates the true integration of the personality. This rulemight be expressed as follows: True marriage and right sexual relation shouldinvolve the marriage of all three aspects of man's nature; there should be ameeting on all three levels of consciousness at once—the physical, the emotionaland the mental. A man and a woman, to be truly and happily married, must becomplements to each other in all the three departments of their nature, andthere should be a simultaneous union of all three. How seldom is this the case,and how rare it is to find! There is no need for me to elaborate in thisdirection, for this truth is obvious and has oft been voiced. Later, but not fora long while yet, we shall see marriages which will be based upon the point ofdevelopment of the integrated personality and only those will meet each other inthe sacred marriage ritual who have reached the same point in the work oftransmuting the lower into the higher centres; a marriage will be regarded asundesirable and the parties ill-mated where one is living the life of thepurified personality above the diaphragm, and the other the life of theintelligent animal below the diaphragm. Finally some few will choose their matesfrom amongst those in whom the Christ has been born again, and [297] who aregiving expression to the Christ life. But the time is not yet, except for therare and the few.3. The third governing principle will be the desire to provide good and fair andhealthy bodies for incoming egos. This is not possible today, under ourill-regulated system of co-habitation. The majority of the children who are bornnow have come accidentally into being or are not wanted. Some few, of course,are desired, but even in these cases, that desire is usually based on reasons ofheredity, property to be passed on, an old name to be perpetuated, anunfulfilled ambition to be satisfied; yet the day of ordained and desired birthsis drawing nearer, and when it comes it will make possible the more rapidincarnation of disciples and initiates. Right preparation will take place priorto any fulfillment of the sex urge, and souls will be attracted to their parentsby the urgency of those parents' desire, the purity of their motives and thepower of their preparatory work.When these three motives are carefully studied, and when men and women mouldtheir physical plane relationship to each other upon their groupresponsibilities, upon their union with each other on all three planessimultaneously, and upon the offering of opportunity for incoming souls, then weshall indeed see a restoration of the spiritual aspect of marriage. We shall seethe coming in of that era when goodwill will be the outstanding characteristic,and wherein selfish purpose and animal instinct will fade into the background.3. Some Suggestions for the Present CycleI have been occupied with indicating a situation which at present exists, and inpointing out an ideal one which lies ahead, but which is not as yet possible.This is valuable, but it leaves a gap in our thought which requires filling. Thequestion now arises which is capable of formulation in the [298] followingterms: Given the accuracy of my presentation of the present appallingconditions, given the possibility of an ultimate approximation to the presentedideal in a distant future, is it possible at this time to take steps which willeventually lead to the necessary adjustments in the department of sex? It mostcertainly is, and my answer takes the following form.When certain basic postulates, four in number, have been presented and keptbefore the mind of the public, they will finally lead to such an education ofpublic opinion that the needed activities will follow. But the first step is theeducation of the public, and their grasp of the four essential laws. Anycorrection of present conditions will come as a growth from within humanityitself, and not as the imposition of a ruling from without. The training of thepublic consciousness must therefore go steadily forward, and thus we shall laythe foundation for the later changes.I should like here to remind you that the coming three generations (in which Iinclude the present one of boys and girls) will bring into incarnation a groupof people who will be well equipped to lead humanity out of the present impasse.This fact warrants remembrance, and is often forgotten. There are always thoseat every epoch in human history who are able to solve the problems which arise,and who are sent in for that very purpose. This sex problem, in the lastanalysis, is a temporary one, little as you may think it today, and it grows outof a basic mistake,—out of the prostitution of man's God-given faculties toselfish physical ends, instead of their consecration to divine purposes. Man hasbeen swept and carried off his feet by his instinctual animal nature, and only aclear and clean mental understanding of the real nature of his problem will bestrong enough to carry him forward into the New Age and into the world of [299]right motive and right action. Man has to learn and deeply grasp the fact thatthe main purpose of sex is not the satisfaction of the appetites, but theproviding of physical bodies through which life may express itself. He has tounderstand the nature of the symbolism underlying the sexual relation, and byits means grasp the scope of the spiritual realities. The Law of Sex is the lawof those relations whereby life and form are brought together in order thatdivine purpose may be seen. This is a fundamental law of creation, and it istrue, whether one is dealing with the informing Life of a solar system, with thebirth of an animal, or with the appearance of a plant from a seed. “Sex” is theword we use to cover the relation which exists between that energy we call“life” and the aggregate of force units through which that energy expressesitself and builds a form. It covers the activity which takes place when thepairs of opposites are brought together, and by means of which they becomeat-one and produce a third reality. That third reality or result bears witnessto their relation, and another life in form is seen. You have always, therefore,relation, at-one-ment and birth. These three words deal with the truesignificance of sex.But man has prostituted the truth, and the real significance has been lost. Sexnow means the satisfaction of the male desire for sensuous pleasure, and theassuaging of a physical appetite through the prostitution of the feminine aspectto that desire and appetite. This relation leads to no result as intended, butto a momentary second of satisfaction, and all of it is confined to the animalnature and the physical plane. I am largely generalising and would remind youthat there are exceptions to all generalisations. I should also like to add thatno one must here think that I hold the masculine aspect as responsible for ourpresent problem when I say that man uses woman for his pleasure. How can I meanthis, when I [300] know that every human being is cyclically either a man or awoman; that the men of today have been women and the women have been men inprevious lives? There is no sex, as we understand it, where souls are concerned;it is only in the form life that sex exists. Only in the process ofdifferentiation for the purposes of experimentation does the incarnatingspiritual man occupy first a male body and then a feminine, thus rounding outthe negative and positive aspects of the form life. All the race is equallyguilty, and all must be equally active in the process of creating the correctconditions, and in bringing order out of the present chaos.Therefore, the first postulate which must be laid down, and to which the generalpublic must be educated, is that all souls incarnate and re-incarnate under theLaw of Rebirth. Hence each life is not only a recapitulation of life experience,but an assuming of ancient obligations, a recovery of old relations, anopportunity for the paying of old indebtedness, a chance to make restitution andprogress, an awakening of deep-seated qualities, the recognition of old friendsand enemies, the solution of revolting injustices, and the explanation of thatwhich conditions the man and makes him what he is. Such is the law which iscrying now for universal recognition, and which, when understood by thinkingpeople, will do much to solve the problems of sex and marriage.Why will this be so? Because when this law is admitted as a governingintellectual principle, all men will tread more carefully the path of life, andwill proceed with greater caution to fulfill their family and group obligations.They will know full well that “whatsoever a man soweth, that will he also reap,”and that he will reap it here and now, and not in some mystical and mythicalheaven or hell; he will have to make his adjustments in the life of every dayupon earth, which provides an adequate heaven and a more than adequate [301]hell. The spreading of this doctrine of rebirth, its scientific recognition andproving, is fast going forward, and during the next ten years it will be thesubject of much attention.The second basic postulate was enunciated for us by Christ when he told us to“love our neighbor as ourselves.” To this we have paid, as yet, but littleattention. We have loved ourselves and have sought to love those we like. But tolove universally and because our neighbor is a soul as we are, with a natureessentially perfect and an infinite destiny, this has always been regarded as abeautiful dream to be consummated in a future so distant, and in a heaven so faraway, that we may well forget it. Two thousand years have gone since thegreatest expression of God's love walked on earth and bade us love each other.Yet still we fight and hate and use our powers for selfish ends, our bodies andour appetites for material pleasures, and our efforts at living are, in themass, primarily directed towards personal selfishness. Have you ever consideredwhat the world would today be if man had listened to the Christ and had soughtto obey His command? We should have eliminated much disease (for the diseasesoriginating in the misuse of the sex function underlie a large percentage of ourphysical ills, and devastate our modern civilisation), we should have made warimpossible, we should have reduced crime to a minimum, and our modern life wouldbe an exemplification of a manifesting divinity. But this has not been the case,and hence our modern world conditions.But the new law must, and will, be enunciated. This law can be summed up in thewords: Let a man so live that his life is harmless. Then no evil to the groupcan grow out of his thoughts, his actions or his words. This is not negativeharmlessness, but of a difficult and positive activity. If the above practicalparaphrase of the words of Christ were universally promulgated and practicallyapplied, we should have [302] order growing out of chaos, group love supersedingpersonal selfishness, religious unity taking the place of fanatical intolerance,and regulated appetites instead of licence.The two laws I have proclaimed, and the two postulates I have above enunciated,sound like platitudes. But platitudes are the universal and recognised truths,and a truth is a scientific pronouncement. The moulding of the life by these tworecognitions (the Law of Rebirth and the Law of Love) would save humanity andrebuild our civilisation. They are probably too simple to evoke an interestedrecognition. But the power lying behind them is the power of divinity itself,and their recognition is simply a question of time, for evolution will force therecognition at some distant date. The forming of an earlier recognition lies inthe hands of the disciples and thinkers of the present age.The third basic law underlying the solution of our modern problems, includingthat of sex, grows normally out of the other two laws. It is the Law of GroupLife. Our group relations must be seen and acknowledged. Not only must a manfulfill in love his family and national obligations, but he must think in thewider terms of humanity itself, and so bring the Law of Brotherhood intoexpression. Brotherhood is a group quality. The young people who are now comingin will come into life equipped with a much deeper sense of the group, and withtheir group awareness much more fully developed than is now the case. They willsolve their problems, including the problem of sex, by asking themselves whensituations arise of a difficult nature: Will this action of mine tend to thegroup good? Will the group be hurt or suffer if I do thus and so? Will thisbenefit the group and produce group progress, group integration, and groupunity? Action which fails to measure up to the group requirements will thenautomatically be discarded. In the deciding of problems, the [303] individualand the unit will slowly learn to subordinate the personal good and the personalpleasure to group conditions and group requirements. You can see, therefore, howthe problem of sex will also yield to solution. An understanding of the Law ofRebirth, a good-will towards all men, working out as harmlessness, and a desirefor group goodwill will gradually become determining factors in the racialconsciousness, and our civilisation will adjust itself in time to these newconditions.The final postulate which I seek to emphasize is that the keeping of these threelaws will lead necessarily to an urgent desire to keep the law of the land inwhich a particular soul has incarnated. That these man-made laws are inadequateI well know, and it is needless to point this out. They may be, and are,temporary and insufficient to the need. They may fail in their scope and proveinadequate, but they do, in a measure, safeguard the little feeble ones, andwill be regarded therefore as binding upon those who are seeking to help therace. These laws are subject to change as the effect of the three great lawsmakes itself felt, but until they are wisely altered (and this takes time) theyact as a brake on license and on selfishness. They may also work hardship. Thisnone can deny. But the hardships they bring are not so evil in their nature norso lasting in their effects as would be the result of their removal and theconsequent inauguration of a cycle of law-less-ness. Therefore, the server ofthe race cooperates with the laws of the land in his daily life, working at thesame time for the removal of the injustices they may produce and for thebettering of the legal impositions upon mankind in his country.In the recognition of these four laws,—of Rebirth, of Love, of the group. and ofthe Land,—we shall see the salvation of the race. [304]4. Sex and DiscipleshipI want to write a word on the subject of sex in the life of the disciple. Thereis much confusion in the minds of aspirants on this matter, and the injunctionas to celibacy is assuming the position of a religious doctrine. We are oftentold by the well-meaning but illogical that if a man is a disciple he cannotmarry, and that there is no real spiritual attainment unless a man is celibate.This theory has its roots in two things:First, there has ever been a mistaken attitude in the East towards women.Secondly, in the West, from the time of Christ, there has been a tendencytowards the monastic and conventual conception of spiritual life. These twoattitudes embody two mistaken ideas, and lie at the root of muchmisunderstanding and at the heart of much evil. Man is no better than the woman,nor woman than the man. Yet many thousands regard women as embodying that whichis evil and that which is the basis of temptation. But God has from thebeginning ordained that men and women should meet each other's needs and act ascomplements to each other. God has not ordained that men should live herdedtogether, away from women, or women away from men; and both of these greatsystems have led to much sexual abuse and to much suffering.The belief that to be a disciple necessitates a celibate life and completeabstinence from all natural functions is neither correct nor desirable. This canbe proved by the recognition of two things:The first is that if divinity is indeed a reality and an expression ofomnipotence and omnipresence as well as omniscience, and if man is essentiallydivine, then there can be no condition possible wherein divinity cannot besupreme. There can be no sphere of human activity where man cannot [305] actdivinely and wherein all functions cannot be illumined by the light of purereason and divine intelligence. I deal not here with the specious and deviousargument that that which normally and by all right-minded people is regarded aswrong must be right because of man's inherent divinity. That can be but a looseexcuse for wrong-doing. I speak of sexual relations of the right kind, withinthe permit of the spiritual law as well as the law of the land.Secondly, a life that is not normally rounded out till all the functions of itsnature—animal, human and divine—(and man is all of these three in one body) areexercised, is frustrated, inhibited, and abnormal. That all cannot marry inthese days is true, but that fact does not negate the greater fact that man hasbeen created by God to marry. That all are not in a position where they cantoday live normal and full lives is equally a consequence of our presentabnormal economic conditions; but this in no way negates the fact that thecondition is abnormal. But that an enforced celibacy is an indication of a deepspirituality, and a necessary part of all esoteric and spiritual training, isequally false, abnormal and undesirable. There is no better training school fora disciple and an initiate than family life, with its enforced relations, itsscope for adjustments and adaptability, its demanded sacrifices and service, andits opportunities for the full expression of every part of man's nature. Thereis no greater service to be rendered to the race than the proffering of bodiesto incoming souls, and the giving of attention and educational facilities tothose souls within the home limits. But the whole condition and problem of thefamily life and of child-bearing have been distorted and misunderstood; and itwill be long before marriage and children assume their rightful place assacraments, and longer still before the pain and suffering consequent upon ourmistakes and on the misuse of the sexual [306] relation have disappeared, andthe beauty and consecration of marriage and of the manifestation of souls inform supersede the present wrong grouping of ideas.The disciple and aspirant upon the Path, and the Initiate upon his “LightedWay,” have no better training ground therefore than the marriage relation,rightly used and rightly understood. The bringing of the animal nature underrhythmic discipline, the elevation of the emotional and the instinctual naturesupon the altar of sacrifice, and the self-abnegation required in the life of thefamily are tremendous purificatory and developing potencies. The celibacyrequired is that of the higher nature to the demands of the lower, and therefusal of the spiritual man to be dominated by the personality and the demandsof the flesh. The attitude of an imposed celibacy upon the equipment of many adisciple has led to much prostitution and to many perversions of God-givenfunctions and faculties; and even where there has not been this distressingcondition, and where the life has been sane, consecrated and sound, there havefrequently been undue suffering and much mental distress and disciplining,before unruly thoughts and tendencies could be controlled.It is of course true that sometimes a man may be called to some particular lifewherein he is faced with the problem of celibacy, and is forced to abstain fromall physical relations and to live a strictly celibate life, in order todemonstrate to himself that he can control the animal and instinctual side ofhis nature. But this condition is frequently the result of excess and licence ina previous life, which necessitates stringent measures and abnormal conditionsin order to offset and rectify past errors and give the lower nature time toreadjust itself. But again it is no indication of spiritual development, ratherthe reverse. Forget not that here I am dealing with the special case ofself-applied celibacy, and not with the present [307] world-wide conditionwherein, through economic and other reasons, men and women are forced to livewithout a natural and full life expression.The sex problem must, in the last analysis, be solved in the home and undernormal conditions, and it is the advanced people of the world and the disciplesof all degrees who must thus solve it."},{"pageContent":"SECTION 2 - CHAPTER III ... THE RAYS AND MANINTRODUCTORY REMARKS[311] I HAVE now dealt with one of the basic problems confronting the race atthis time. I interpolated my comments on the subject of sex at that particularpoint because it made a fitting conclusion to our study of the rays inconnection with the animal kingdom.Man is a living entity, a conscious son of God (a soul) occupying an animalbody. Here lies the point. He is therefore in the nature of a link, and a farfrom missing link. He unifies in himself the results of the evolutionary processas it has been carried on during the past ages, and he brings into contact withthat evolutionary result a new factor, that of an individual self-sustaining,self-knowing aspect. It is the presence of this factor and of this aspect whichdifferentiates man from the animal. It is this aspect which produces in humanitya consciousness of immortality, a self-awareness and a self-centredness whichmake man truly to appear in the image of God. It is this innate and hidden powerwhich gives man the capacity to suffer which no animal possesses, but which alsoconfers on him the ability to reap the benefits of this experience in the realmof the intellect. This same capacity, in embryo, works out in the animal kingdomin the realm of the instincts. It is this peculiar property of humanity [312]which confers upon it the power to sense ideals, to register beauty, to reactsensuously to music, and to enjoy colour and harmony. It is this divinesomething which makes of mankind the prodigal son, torn between desire for theworldly life, for possessions and experience, and the attractive power of thatcentre, or home, from which he has come.Man stands midway between heaven and earth, with his feet deep in the mud ofmaterial life and his head in heaven. In the majority of cases his eyes areclosed, and he sees not the beauty of the heavenly vision, or they are open butfixed upon the mud and slime with which his feet are covered. But when his openeyes are lifted for a brief moment, and see the world of reality and ofspiritual values, then the torn and distracted life of the aspirant begins.Humanity is the custodian of the hidden mystery, and the difficulty consists inthe fact that that which man conceals from the world is also hidden fromhimself. He knows not the wonder of that which he preserves and nourishes.Humanity is the treasure-house of God (this is the great Masonic secret), foronly in the human kingdom, as esotericists have long pointed out, are the threedivine qualities found in their full flower and together . In man, God theFather has hidden the secret of life; in man, God the Son has secreted thetreasures of wisdom and of love; in man, God the Holy Spirit has implanted themystery of manifestation. Humanity, and humanity alone, can reveal the nature ofthe Godhead and of eternal life. To man is given the privilege of revealing thenature of the divine consciousness, and of portraying before the eyes of theassembled sons of God (at the final conclave before the dissolution) what haslain hidden in the Mind of God. Hence the injunction before us today (in thewords of the great Christian teacher) to possess in ourselves “the mind ofChrist.” This mind must dwell in us and reveal itself [313] in the human race inever greater fullness. To man is given the task of raising matter up intoheaven, and of glorifying rightly the form side of life through his consciousmanifestation of divine powers.To portray adequately the wonder and the destiny of the human kingdom liesbeyond my powers or the power of any human pen, no matter how great a man’srealisation may be, or his response to the beauty of God’s world. Divinity mustbe lived, expressed and manifested, to be understood. God must be loved, knownand revealed within the human heart and brain, in order to be intellectuallygrasped.The hierarchy of mystics, knowers and lovers of God, are manifesting thisrevealed truth in the world of the mental plane and of the emotional planetoday. But the hour has now come when the manifestation of this reality can, forthe first time and in truth, manifest itself on the physical plane in anorganised group form, instead of through the instrumentality of the few inspiredsons of God who have, in past ages, incarnated as the guarantee of the futurepossibilities. The Hierarchy of Angels and of Saints, of Masters, Rishis andInitiates, can now begin to organise itself in material form on earth, becausetoday the group idea is rapidly gaining ground, and the nature of humanity isbeing better understood. The Church of Christ, hitherto invisible and militant,can now be seen slowly materialising and becoming the Church visible andtriumphant.This is the coming glory of the Aquarian Age; this is the next revelation of theevolutionary cycle, and such is the task of the immediate future. The true dramaof this triple relationship (of which physical sex, as we have seen, is but thesymbol) will be enacted on a large scale in the life of the modern aspirantduring the next fifty years. We shall see what is called symbolically “the birthof the Christ,” or the [314] second birth, taking place in many lives, producingon earth a large group of the spiritually new-born. They will be those who havebrought together, consciously and within themselves, the two aspects of soul andbody, and thus have consummated the “mystical marriage”. The aggregate of theseindividual happenings will produce a group activity of an analogous kind, and weshall see the emergence on the physical plane of “the body of the Christ,” andthe appearance of the manifested Hierarchy. This is what is happening today, andall that we see going on around us in the world is but the pangs and the travailwhich precede this glorious birthing.We are now in the process of this consummation. Hence the difficulty and agonyevidenced in the life of every true disciple who—embodying in himselfsymbolically the two aspects of father-mother, spirit-matter, and havingnurtured the Christ child through a period of gestation—is now giving birth tothe Christ, within the animal stable and in the manger of the world. In the sumtotal of the general accomplishment will the entire group achieve and the Christagain appear on earth, incarnated this time in the many and not in the onepersonality. Yet each member of the group is a Christ in manifestation, and alltogether present the Christ to the world, and constitute a channel for theChrist force and life.It is indeed and in truth from glory to glory that we go. The past glory ofindividualisation must fade away in that of initiation. The glory of the slowlyemerging self-consciousness must be lost to sight in the wonder of the groupconsciousness of the race, and this the foremost thinkers and workers today mostardently desire. The glory that can be seen faintly shining in humanity, and thedim light which flickers within the human form, must give place to the radiancewhich is the glory of the developed son of God. Only [315] a little effort isneeded, and the demonstration of a steady staying power, to enable those who arenow on the physical plane of experience to evidence the radiant light, and toestablish upon the earth a great station of light which will illumine the wholeof human thought. Always there have been isolated light bearers, down the ages.Now the group light bearer will shortly be seen. Then shall we see the rest ofthe human family (who respond not yet to the Christ impulse) having theirprogress facilitated towards the path of probation. The work will still be slow,and much yet remains to be done; but if all the aspirants of the world and allthe disciples at work in the world today will submerge their personal interestsin the task immediately ahead, we shall have what I might pictorially call theopening of a great station of light on earth, and the founding of a power housewhich will greatly hasten the evolution and elevation of humanity, and theunfoldment of the human consciousness.There has been for long in esoteric circles much idle and oft foolish talk anentthe ray upon which a man may be found. People are as ignorantly excited overbeing told which is their ray as they are over the portrayal of their pastincarnations. The “new teaching on the rays” vies with astrology in itsinterest. Like the Athenians, men are always searching for the novel and theunusual, forgetting that every new truth and every new presentation of an oldtruth carries with it the onus of increased responsibility.However, it is interesting to trace parallels, and it is becoming obvious to thecareful student that the emergence of the teaching on the rays has happened at atime when the scientist is announcing the fact that there is naught to be seenand known save energy, and that all forms are composed of energy units and arein themselves expressions of force. [316] A ray is but a name for a particularforce or type of energy, with the emphasis upon the quality which that forceexhibits and not upon the form aspect which it creates. This is a truedefinition of a ray.THE RAYS AND THE RACESWe have been told in the past teaching of the Ageless Wisdom that a human beingis a triple aspect of energy, and that he is essentially a trinity, as is theDeity. We speak of him technically as Monad-ego-personality. We define him asspirit-soul-body. I should like to point out here that in studying the humanfamily as a unit and as a whole, it also will be discovered to be essentially aMonad, with seven egoic groups, within which all souls (in incarnation and outof incarnation) find their place, and with forty-nine corresponding racial formsthrough which the seven groups of souls cyclically express themselves. All soulswork out their destiny in all races, but certain types predominate in certainracial forms. Where, then, is to be found any reason for racial predilections orantipathies? In the realisation of the truth that we all, at some time,experience incarnation in all racial forms will come the knowledge that there isonly unity. The subject may be clarified if we tabulate the teaching and the rayrelationship to the races as follows:Ray Full Expression Major influence Ray I. Will. In the 7th rootrace. 1st and7th subraces. 1st ray souls. Perfection of Plan. Ray II. Love-Wisdom In the 6throotrace. 2nd and 6th subraces. 2nd ray souls. Perfected Intuition. Ray III.Intelligence. In the 5th rootrace. 3rd and 5th subraces. 3rd ray souls. Aryanrace. Perfected Intellect. Ray IV. Harmony. In the 4th rootrace. 4th and 6thsubraces. 4th ray souls. Atlantean race. Perfected astralism. Perfected emotion.Ray V. knowledge. In the 3rd rootrace. 5th and 3rd subraces. 5th ray souls.Lemurian. Perfected physical. Ray VI. Devotion. In the 2nd rootrace. 6th and 2ndsubraces. 6th ray souls. Ray VII. Ceremonial In the 1st rootrace. 7th and 1stsubraces. Magic. 7th ray souls.[317] Remember that this tabulation refers to the major ray cycles, and rememberfurther that in every rootrace you have a continuous mingling and interminglingof the rays with what might be called the “constant” or dominating ray, whichappears and re-appears with greater frequency and potency than do the otherrays. There is therefore a close correspondence between certain rays and certainraces, with their subraces, and these are coloured by these predominant rayinfluences. It is interesting also to interpret these ray influences (as I haveexpressed them) in terms of their quality leading to their objective, asfollows:The first Ray of Will leads from latent purpose in the first race to thefulfilled evolutionary Plan in the seventh race.The second Ray of Love-Wisdom leads from love or divine desire in the secondrace to full intuitional understanding in the sixth race.The third Ray of Active-Intelligence leads from the latent mental awareness ofLemurian man in the third race to the intellectual achievement of the Aryanrace, the fifth race.The fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict leads from the period of thatterrific balancing of forces in Atlantis (the [318] fourth race) to thesanctified and free devotion of one-pointedness in the next or sixth race, withtwo lines of energy consummating in it. It marks the point of achievement of theMonads of Love, Who arrive at the expression of Love-Wisdom. The final racemarks the point of achievement for the Monads of Will, just as the present Aryanrace marks, and will mark, the achievement of the Monads of Intelligence. Thiswarrants thought. It is a relative achievement, for this is the fourth round,but there is necessarily a “high-water mark,” if I might so call it, for eachround.In the above four races you have the great period of the balancing of the forcesfor our humanity. The effect of the other three rays upon the Lemurian race andthe two earlier and formless races need not here be considered by us. The natureof the consciousness of the forms found in those races, and the pressure exertedin them by the Entity Who informs the human family as a whole , are too abstrusefor the average reader. He is mainly concerned with the races here enumerated,which summarise for him past and future achievement.Consequently, in dealing with the human family, we must endeavour to think inlarger terms than those of the individual man as we know him. We must look uponhumanity itself as an integrated entity, as a being, as a Life in a form. Inthis unified form Life every human being is a cell, and the seven racesconstitute the seven major centres, with the polarisation shifting ever into thehigher centres, and the lower centres fading away into quiescence, until thetime comes when all of the seven will be coordinated and energised, at the endof the age. We might here make the following suggestions (note this word) as tothe relation between the races and the centres in the body of humanity: [319]Races Centre Expression 7th and final rootrace The head centre Will. Plan. 6throotrace. The next The centre between the eyebrows Intuitive integration. 5throotrace. The present The throat centre Creative power. Occult. 4th and pastrootrace The solar plexus centre Psychic sensitivity. Mystic. 3rd and firsthuman race The sacral centre Physical appearance. Generation. 2nd and ethericrace The heart or vital centre Life forces coordinated. 1st race The base ofspine The Will to be, to exist.It is with only the last four evolving races that we shall concern ourselves(the first four dealt with in the above tabulation), for the first three racesare too far off for any one under the degree of initiate to grasp their mode ofdevelopment, their type of consciousness, and their procedure towards theirgoal. The point I seek to emphasize is the necessity of seeing the picturewhole, and not in terms of individual man.It may here be helpful if we note down our tabulation of certain points anentthe human kingdom, as we did in connection with the three subhuman kingdoms.THE HUMAN KINGDOMInfluences:Two rays of divine energy are peculiarly active in bringing this kingdom intomanifestation. These are: [320]1. The fourth Ray of Harmony, beauty and unity, attained through conflict.2. The fifth Ray of Concrete Knowledge, or the power to know.The fourth ray is the ray par excellence which governs humanity. There is anumerical relation to be noted here, for the fourth creative Hierarchy of humanmonads, the fourth ray, in this fourth round, on the fourth globe, the Earth,are extremely active. It is their close interrelation and interplay which isresponsible for the emergence into prominence of humanity. In other rounds,humanity has not been the dominant evolution or the most important. In thisround it is. In the next round, the dominant evolution will be that of souls onthe astral level, and the deva kingdom. Humanity now walks in the light of day,symbolically speaking, on Earth, and these two rays were responsible for theprocess of initiating the human evolution in this major cycle. Our objective isthe harmonising of the higher and the lower aspects, or principles, both in theindividual and in the whole. This involves conflict and struggle, but produceseventually beauty, creative power in art, and synthesis. This result would nothave been possible had it not been for the potent work of the fifth Ray ofConcrete Knowledge which—in conjunction with the fourth ray—produced thatreflection of divinity we call a man .The human entity is a curious synthesis, on the subjective side of his nature,producing a fusion of life, of power, of harmonious intent and of mentalactivity. The following should be noted, for it is of profound psychologicalinterest and import:Rays I, IV and V predominate in the life of humanity and govern with increasingpower man’s mental life and determine his mental body. Rays II and VI governpotently his emotional life and determine the type of his astral body. Rays IIIand VII govern the vital physical life and the physical body.[321] Here you have, if you note carefully, a summation of the rays which governand differentiate the life of the personality forms, and therefore bring inother factors which psychologists will have to consider as time goes on. Youwill see therefore that:1. The human soul or ego is found on one or other of the seven rays, in one orother of the seven ray groups.2. The mind nature and mental body are governed by the Rays of Purpose, ofHarmony or Synthesis, and of Knowledge.3. The emotional nature and form are governed by the Rays of Love, Wisdom and ofidealistic Devotion.4. The vital life and physical body are governed by the Rays of Intelligence inmatter and of Organising Power.But in the midst of this complexity of rays and forces, the third and fifth rayshold paramount place, and govern the major cycles of the individual. He iscontrolled not only by his own ray cycles (determined by his egoic ray) and bythe lesser cycles of the personality, but he comes also under the influence ofthe major and minor cycles in the ray life of humanity as a whole.Results:Through the active work of the two rays above discussed, we find the fourth rayproducing eventually in man the appearance of the intuition . The fifth ray isresponsible for the development in him of the intellect . Here again we findappearing in man his great gift of synthesis and his prerogative [322] ofunification, for—as earlier said—he blends in himself the qualities of threekingdoms in nature, including the one before and the one after his own.1. The kingdom of souls Intuition. 2. The human kingdom Intellect. 3. The animalkingdom Instinct.Hence his problem, and hence his glory. We might also say that through the unionof the positive intuition and the negative instinct the intellect is born, forman repeats in himself the great creative process as enacted in the universe.This is the inner creative side of consciousness, just as we have the outercreative side in the creation of forms.Process:In the human family, owing to the presence within the human physical form of athinking entity, called by us the Soul, the procedure followed in order toproduce conscious control is that of adaptation. All forms in the three lowersubhuman kingdoms are also subjected to the process of adaptation, but that is agroup adaptation to environment, whereas in humanity we have the adaptation ofthe individual to his environment. The person who works consciously andintelligently at adapting himself to that situation and those conditions inwhich he finds himself is relatively rare. Conscious adapting of oneself tocircumstances is the result of evolutionary development. The stages by which manarrives at this capacity may be enumerated as follows:1. That unconscious adaptation to his environment of the man who is primarily anunintelligent animal. Low grade savages are in this class, and many purelyagricultural peasants who have not been subjected to modern education. The manat this stage is little better than an animal and is governed entirely byinstinct. [323]2. An unconscious adaptation to environment carried on by the man who isbeginning to evidence some faint flickers of mental perception. This is partlyinstinctual and is based on a growing self-love. There is more of the “I”consciousness in him, and rather less of group instinctual awareness. You findthis growing self-realisation in the low grade slum dwellers, for instance, andin the petty criminal who is instinctual enough and bright enough to live by hiswits and to show quickness in reactions and deftness manually. It is the stageof animal cunning.3. A conscious and purely selfish adapting of oneself to the environment. Inthese cases, the man is definitely aware of his motives; they are consciouslythought out and recognised, and the man makes “the best of his circumstances”.He forces himself to live as far as possible harmoniously in his surroundings.In this there is really good motive, but principally the man is governed by adesire for comfort—physical, emotional and mental—to such a degree that he willdiscipline himself into such a condition that he fits wherever he may be and canget on with anyone.4. From this stage on the differentiations become so numerous that they aredifficult to follow, being mixtures of pure selfishness (developed often to thenth degree), of a growing recognition of the group, of an awakening realisationof the right of other people to a similar degree of comfort and harmony, and ofa steady effort to adapt conditions of character and personality life, so thatthe purely selfish interests do no real damage to others, until we arrive at...5. The average really good man who is struggling to adapt himself to hissurroundings, to his group relations and responsibilities in such a way thatsome measure of love [324] can be seen. I refer not here to that instinctuallove for family and children and herd which men share in common with the animalsand which often breaks down when the loved individuals assert themselves. Thetie is not strong enough to hold, and the motive is too selfish to resist thepull. I refer to that motivated love which recognises the rights of others andconsciously strives to adapt itself to those recognised rights whilsttenaciously holding on to the rights of the personality.6. Then we have the work of adaptation as carried on by the aspirants of theworld who are theoretically convinced of their group relation, of its paramountimportance, and of the need of every personality to develop its powers to thefullest capacity in order to bring real value to the group and to serveadequately the group need. In true esotericism, there is no such motive as“killing the personality”, or of disciplining it to such an extent that itbecomes a dead poor thing. The true motive is to train the threefold lowernature, the integrated personality, to the highest demonstration of its powers,latent or developing, in order that those powers may be brought to the helpingof the group need, and the personality of the aspirant may be integrated intothe group. Thereby the group life is enriched, the group potency is increased,and the group consciousness is enhanced.What is therefore to be seen going on in the life of the true aspirant today(his developing recognition of group responsibility) can also be seen going onin groups, in organisations and nations. Hence the many experiments. A processis going forward whereby these groups, large or small, are being subjected to ahousecleaning, to a discarding of the rubbish of old and worn-out ideas, and toa period of disciplining and training [325] which must precede all real grouplife. When this process is over, we shall have these groups approaching eachother in a new and real spirit of cooperation, of religious fusion, and in aninternational attitude which will be new indeed. Then they will have somethingof a surer and greater value to offer to the whole. Within all these groupswhich are struggling towards this newer realisation and integration, and whichexpress what we might call “the sixth stage of adaptation,”, are those who arealready at the seventh stage.7. Here we have complete unselfish adaptation to the group need and purpose.Those who have reached this point in their evolution are decentralised asregards their own personality life. The focus of their mental attention is inthe soul and in the world of souls. Their attention is not directed towards thepersonality at all, except in so far as is needed to force it to adhere to groupor soul purpose. These servers who are expressions of soul radiance andattractive power are knowers of the Plan, and in every organisation theyconstitute the new and slowly growing group of World Servers. In their handslies the salvation of the world.8. The final group in this scale of adaptation is that of the higher initiates,the perfected Elder Brethren and Great Companions. They are perfectly adapted toTheir personalities, to each other and to world conditions; but as a group Theyare learning how to adapt the forces of nature, the energies of the rays and thepotencies of the zodiacal signs to the world need and the world demand in apractical manner and at any particular time. It is here that the work of thedisciples of the world, and of the higher types of aspirants, proves helpful[326] as a field of experiment, and it is in the new group of World Servers thatthe process of adaptation goes on.I have endeavoured to outline these stages of the process of adaptation in termsof consciousness, viewing the subject therefore philosophically andpsychologically. It should be remembered that this process, as it goes on inconsciousness, produces (surely and inevitably) corresponding changes inmechanism and structure, and in sense perception through the apparatus of thebody. On these changes I lay no emphasis in this treatise, for they arebeautifully dealt with by modern science, which is steadily forging ahead in theright direction. I lay the emphasis upon consciousness as the pre-disposingfactor, and on the developed sense of awareness which produces an inner demandfor improved equipment. The improving of equipment as a result of the demand ofconsciousness is the secret of the evolutionary impulse, down the ages. Thisinner demand in man awakens the centres, and the awakening of the centresdetermines the response of the endocrine system, governs the nervous system inits threefold capacity, and also the blood stream. Thus the outer form ormechanism is ever an indication of the point of evolution of the innersubjective and spiritual man.The Secret:This is called, in esotericism, “the secret of translation”. I might bring thegeneral concept underlying those words down to the intelligence of the averagestudent by telling him that when a man really understands the elevating power ofthe aspiration, he can begin to work with the secret of translation. Studentsmust lose sight of the foolish and erroneous idea that aspiration is really anemotional attitude. It is not. It is a scientific process, governing evolutionitself. [327] When given free scope and duly followed, it is the mode parexcellence whereby the matter aspect, or the whole personality, is “raised upinto heaven”. The effect of continued aspiration, when followed by right action,is to bring about three things:1. A stimulation of the higher atoms of the three bodies.2. The discarding, as a result of this stimulation, of those atomic substanceswhich (when present) occultly hold the aspirant down to earth.3. The increasing of the magnetic attractive power of the higher atoms, whichdraw to themselves atoms of high vibration to take the place of those of lowvibration. One point I should like to make here, in order to correct an almostuniversal wrong mental attitude. Right atoms of high vibration are attractedinto a man’s body or bodies by the power of the united attraction of the atomsalready present, and not primarily by the will of the soul, except in so far asthat will acts upon the high grade atoms already present and responsive.Aspiration is an activity of an occult and scientific nature, and is instinctualin substance itself. This point needs emphasis when instructing groups.It is an interesting side-light thrown upon the phenomena of aspiration that thepower to levitate the body, which is so oft today the subject of psychicinterest and research, is dependent upon having produced a peculiar alignment ofthe personality through aspiration and an act of the will. It presupposes in thethree bodies a certain percentage of atoms of the adequate vibrations andlightness.This secret of translation is the underlying cause of the caste system, andcaste is a symbol of translation. In the last analysis, souls pass from caste tocaste as they “translate” [328] their bodies. The clue to the translation is tobe found in the fact that no act of translation ever involves one body alone,and no “passing on and up” into another dimension, into another state ofconsciousness and another “caste,” ever takes place unless an alignment has beenproduced between (for instance):a. The physical body and the emotional body.b. These two and the mental body.c. These three and the soul.d. These four and the group of World Servers.In these four alignments we have the esoteric parallels of which the outer castesystem is the prostituted symbol. Ponder on this, for the caste system isuniversal in the world. It is when the third alignment has been trulyaccomplished and when the light of the fourth constituent to the relationshipdominates the inherent light of the other three, that the objective of man’sevolution is reached. This brings us to the point next to be considered.Purpose:This purpose is the Transfiguration. This is the esoteric goal set beforehumanity. This was the tremendous event which was enacted before humanity by thegreatest of all the sons of God in His Own Body, Whom I and all true disciplesregard as the Master of all the Masters, the Christ. What shall I say about thisculminating event for which the entire personality of man waits? This thirdgreat initiation marks a crisis in the initiatory work, and produces a furthersynthesis experienced in the life of the spiritual man. Up to the thirdinitiation, man has been occupied with the process of fusing soul and body intoone unity. After the third initiation (and owing to an event which takes place)man is [329] oriented towards, and becomes occupied with, a further fusion inconsciousness, that of spirit-soul-body. I speak of a fusion in consciousness.The unity is ever there, and man in evolution is really becoming aware of thatwhich already exists.Divisions:These are five in number from the standpoint of this treatise on esotericism.They can here be only briefly indicated, as elucidation of them would involvetoo much.1. The racial divisions . These can be considered in two ways:a. From the standpoint of modern esoteric science.b. From the standpoint of The Secret Doctrine, with its septenary divisions ofmankind and its forty-nine subdivisions.2. The division of humanity into seven main ray types , which might beenumerated as follows:a. The power type full of will and governing capacity. b. The love type full oflove and fusing power. c. The active type full of action, and manipulatingenergy. d. The artistic type full of the sense of beauty and creativeaspiration. e. The scientific type full of the idea of cause and results. Themathematical type. f. The devotee type full of idealism. g. The business typefull of organising power. given to ritualistic ceremony.3. The twelve astrological groups . These we shall consider in dealing with TheRays and the Zodiac , and so shall not touch upon them here.4. The division of human beings into three esoteric groups :a. Those unawakened to the “I” consciousness.These are called esotericaliy “the darkened sparks.” [330]b. Those awakened to the condition of individuality.These are called “the flickering lights.”c. Those awakened to the knowledge of the soul.These are called “the radiant sons of light.”5. The division of humanity into three types of aspirants :a. Those watched from a distance by the guiding Hierarchy.b. Those awakened by and attracted to the Hierarchy.c. Those who, from the angle of the personality, belong to the world of forces,but are awakened souls whose consciousness is being integrated into, that of theHierarchy. These are the new group of World Servers.To these three last groups the Hierarchy Itself may well be added.The table as a whole shows the main divisions into which esoteric psychologydivides humanity, and if you study it with care you will note how all-inclusiveit is. I commend it to modern psychologists for study.Objective Agency:In the case of the human being, in whom the senses (slowly developed in thelower kingdoms) are already functioning, the outer agency whereby he grows isthe world of experience, the tangible physical plane world. There he dwells inthe flesh, and it is for him an adequate field of unfoldment; in the process ofdeveloping group consciousness he finds that multiplicity of contacts which isneeded to awaken his response to his environment. This environment itself ispart of the life and expression of Deity, and through its means he arrives at aknowledge of some aspects of God’s manifestation. Using the five senses, andworking with earth, air, fire [331] and water, he thereby gathers to himself allthat is available for his use, and works in, and with, and through the outerworld of daily living.Subjective Agency:Here we find the mind being employed as an organ of sense, as a synthetic orcommon sense, and as an instrument of discovery by means of which a man unfoldsthe truly human consciousness. Through the use of the mind, he learns to protecthimself, to guard his interests, and to preserve his identity. Through the useof the mind, he begins to discriminate and to cultivate slowly a sense of valueswhich enables him eventually to lay the emphasis upon the ideal and thespiritual, and not upon the material and the physical.Quality:This quality is the development of sattva or rhythm within the human kingdom.This is really harmonious response to vibration, and leads to the integration ofthe unit in the whole and to the production of that “understanding” which willenable the man to eliminate all barriers in his consciousness, and to render(simply and naturally) a rhythmic and complete response to all conditions andstates of awareness. Let it ever be remembered that the secret of the quality ofhumanity (if I may use so cumbrous a phrase) is the power to identify the humanconsciousness with all other forms of consciousness and of awareness, with allforms of unconscious and instinctual response, and with all forms of thesuperconscious or divine sense of being. This can ultimately be done at will.We must now begin what really constitutes an outline of the new psychology Thiswill work out to its fulfillment [332] and true usefulness in the Aquarian age.It will then become the basic and fundamental science of that age, just aselectrical science (the electricity of matter) is the basic achievement of thePiscean age. What we are really going to consider are the influences which makea man what he is, and which determine the quality of his appearance. Thisappearance must be studied in terms of the entire integrated personality, andnot just from the outer and objective physical condition. The influences whichdetermine him are his own personal and soul rays which play upon him and affecthis consciousness, finding entrance into his form equipment through the energyunits of which that form is made. Other determining influences are also thesolar, cosmic and environing factors which likewise play upon him.It might here be asked: What are the differences between the influences whichare ray influences and those which are of an astrological nature, such as therising sign, or the governing planets?The energies which astrologically affect a human being are those which play uponhim as a result of the apparent progress of the sun through the heavens, eitheronce every twenty-five thousand years or once every twelve months. Those thatconstitute the ray forces do not come from the twelve constellations of thezodiac, but emanate primarily from a world of being and of consciousness whichlies behind our solar system, and which themselves come from the sevenconstellations which form the body of manifestation of the One About Whom NaughtMay Be Said. Our solar system is one of these seven constellations. This is theworld of Deity Itself, and of it a man can know nothing until he has passedthrough the major initiations. When we come later to study the zodiac and itsrelation to the rays we shall work this out more [333] carefully and so make theidea clearer. It is with the ray influences that we are dealing here, and notwith the zodiacal.One of the first things we need to grasp, as we study man and the rays, is thelarge number of these ray influences which play upon him, and which form him,and “enliven” him, and make him the complexity he is. It would be wise for us toenumerate them one by one and consider them for a while. There is no real reasonfor bewilderment in this connection. As time progresses and the rays are morewidely studied, man’s relation to them will be subjected to careful analysis,and there will then be possible a wide checking up of information and of facts.There will later come a tabulation and an understanding of the ray forces. Thiswill lead to a science of psychology of a more sure and accurate nature, insteadof the speculative science it now is. At present modern psychology concernsitself with the more apparent aspects of incarnated man and with a discussion ofcertain speculative subjective possibilities.It might therefore be noted that the following rays and influences must beconsidered in the case of every individual man, for they make him what he is anddetermine his problem:1. The ray of the solar system itself.2. The ray of the planetary Logos of our planet.3. The ray of the human kingdom itself.4. Our particular racial ray, the ray that determines the Aryan race.5. The rays that govern any particular cycle.6. The national ray, or that ray influence which is peculiarly influencing aparticular nation.7. The ray of the soul, or ego.8. The ray of the personality.9. The rays governing: [334]a. The mental body.b. The emotional or astral body.c. The physical body.There are other rays, but the above are the most powerful and have the greaterconditioning power. Let us briefly consider them:1. THE RAY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEMIt must be remembered that the dominating ray, the outstanding influence in oursolar system, is the great cosmic second Ray of Love-Wisdom, a dual ray,—thatis, a ray combining two great cosmic principles and energies. It is the raywhich governs the “personality” of our solar Logos, if such an expression may beused, and (because it is dual) it indicates both His personality and soul rays,which in Him are now so balanced and blended that, from the angle of humanity,they constitute the major ray, the one ray. This major ray determines both Hisquality and His purpose.Every unit of life and every form in manifestation is governed by this secondray. Basically speaking, the energy of love, expressed with wisdom, is the lineof least resistance for the manifested lives in our solar system. This rayqualifies the life of all the planets, and the attractive magnetic love of Godpours through His created universe; it emerges in the consciousness anddetermines the objective of all evolving forms. Each human being, as a whole,therefore, lives in a universe and on a planet which is constantly the objectiveof God’s love and desire, and which constantly (as a result of this love) isitself attracted and attractive. For this we do not make adequate allowance.Teachers, parents and educators would do well to recognise the potency of thisray force, and trust to the Law to make all things good. [335]2. THE RAY OF THE PLANET–EARTH.Each of the seven sacred planets (of which our Earth is not one) is anexpression of one of the seven ray influences. These seven planets might beenumerated as follows, and the rays working through them are accurately given.The student however must remember three things:1. That every planet is the incarnation of a Life, of an Entity or Being.2. That every planet, like a human being, is the expression of two rayforces,—the personality and the egoic.3. That two rays are therefore in esoteric conflict in each planet.I but indicate one of the rays, and I do not tell you whether it is the egoic orpersonality ray of the particular planetary Logos. Too much accuracy and toodetailed information is not at this time good for humanity, which is yet tooselfish to be entrusted with it.THE PLANETS AND RAYSSacred Ray Non-Sacred Ray 1. Vulcan 1st ray. 1. Mars 6th ray. 2. Mercury 4thray. 2. Earth 3rd ray. 3. Venus 5th ray. 3. Pluto 1st ray. 4. Jupiter 2nd ray.4. The Moon veiling a hidden planet. 4th ray. 5. Saturn 3rd ray. 5. The Sunveiling a hidden planet. 2nd ray. 6. Neptune 6th ray. 7. Uranus 7th ray.I deal here with the major ray cycles and not with the minor cycles. Two rays,you will note, are apparently not expressing themselves through the non-sacredplanets; the seventh and the fifth. There are only five non-sacred planets. Butthe reason which makes a planet sacred or not is one of the secrets of a certainmajor initiation, and I may not further [336] elucidate here. Suffice it to saythat the sacred planets are seven in number, making a totality of twelveplanetary manifestations. It will be obvious to the observant reader also thatcertain sacred planets and certain non-sacred planets have a close relation witheach other through the rays which influence them. These are:Ray I Vulcan Pluto. Ray II Jupiter The Sun. Ray III Saturn The Earth. Ray IVMercury The Moon. Ray VI Neptune Mars.These relationships will provide a somewhat new field of investigation forastrologers.You will note therefore how peculiarly this Earth on which we live is suited tothe development of the incarnating sons of God. Man comes forth, as do all liveswithin the radius of influence of a solar system, upon the inspiration of love,expressed in wisdom. Love is not a sentiment. Love is the great principle ofattraction, of desire, of magnetic pull, and (within our solar system) thatprinciple demonstrates as the attraction and the interplay between the pairs ofopposites. This interplay provides every needed grade or type of unfoldment forconsciousness. Conscious response is first made to the most potent and to thedensest kind of attraction in matter, that of the mineral kingdom. Dense as itis, and heavy as is that type of vibration, it is nevertheless an expression ofembryonic love. Response again comes, with greater facility and more trueawareness and sensitivity, in the next kingdom, and the consciousness of thevegetable world emerges. But this too is love. It responds more freely andreacts to a far wider range of contacts in the animal kingdom, and the basicinstinctual desires emerge and can be recognised. They, in due time, become themotivation of the [337] life, yet still it is only the love of God which ismanifested. It is love between conscious life and conscious form; it is lovebetween the pairs of opposites, leading to an eventual synthesis or marriage; itis relationship between the basic dualities; it is not sentiment but a fact in agreat natural process. Always there is the emerging glory and radiance of agrowing love, until we come to the human kingdom wherein love enters anotherplane. Then responsiveness and sensitivity and human sentimental reactiondevelop into a rudimentary mind. The consciousness of loving and being loved, ofattracting and of being attracted, enters through the door of the intelligenceand expands into the human state of awareness. Pleasure and pain become definitefactors in unfoldment, and the long agony of humanity commences. Love then isseen in its naked selfishness, but also its potential glory can be sensed. Loveor attractive desire then attracts to itself that which it feels it needs, butlater, that is changed into what it thinks it should have, and this, in time, istransmuted into that which it knows is the divine non-material heritage of a sonof God. Ponder on these last few words, for in the true understanding of love asfeeling, love as thinking, and love as aspiration will come a clarification ofman’s problem and his liberation from the thralldom of the lower loves into theliberty of love itself, and into the freedom of the one who possesses allthings, and yet desires nothing for the separated self.The magnetic pull of that which is desired is modified on our planet by thepersonality ray of our particular planetary Logos. This is the Ray of ActiveIntelligence, and of selective Adaptability. Just as every cell and atom in thehuman body is modified and conditioned by the egoic ray and the ray of each ofthe inner bodies, so every cell and atom in the body of the planetary Logos isconditioned and modified [338] by His outstanding ray influence, in this case,His personality ray. In this conditioning influence is found a clue to thedistress and agony and pain in the world today. The planetary Logos of our Earthis primarily conditioned by a cosmic ray, to be sure, but not by His egoic ray.Perhaps in this condition may be found the reason (or one of the reasons) whyour Earth is not one of the seven sacred planets. On this I need not enlarge,but it was necessary to call attention to this great determining factor, thethird ray, which is the personality ray of our planetary Logos.This ray brings in the factor of discrimination through mental activity, andthis, in its turn, balances the so-called love nature, and it is in truth thecause of our evolutionary growth. The life in forms passes throughdiscriminative and selective activity from one experience to another in an everwidening scale of contacts. It is this Ray of Intelligent Activity whichdominates man at this time. Human beings are largely centred in theirpersonalities; they are “egocentric,” in the terminology of the psychologist,which recognises the integrating principle of the ego (in many cases) but doesnot yet recognise the overshadowing ego or soul, except under such a vague termas “the superconscious”. We have therefore a humanity engrossed by a tremendousactivity and demonstrating everywhere a vital discriminating and intellectualinterest in all types of phenomena. This tendency to be active will go onincreasing and intensifying until the Aryan race will merge into the comingmajor root-race, for which we have as yet no name, though we recognise that inthat race the intellect will serve the intuition. Human activity is now regardedas having reached an incredible speed and intensity of vibration, yet from theangle of the world Knowers it is only just beginning to express itself, and isrelatively feeble as yet. The growth of the tendency to vital speed can [339] benoted if history is studied, and the pace at which man now lives, and thecomplexity and the many dynamic interests of his life, may be compared withthose of the average man two hundred years ago. The last twenty-five years ofman’s history have shown a tremendous speeding up as compared with conditionsfifty years ago.The reason for this increase of intelligent activity and rapidity of responseand contact is to be found in the subjective fact that humanity is with greatspeed integrating the three aspects of human nature into a unity, calledpersonality. Men are steadily becoming personalities, and unifying into oneexpression their physical, emotional and mental aspects; hence they are moreable to respond to the ray of the integrated personality of the One in Whom theylive, and move, and have their being.Speaking therefore in terms of man’s life problem, we might state that it isaffected potently by the two major influences which beat upon the human kingdom,the cosmic ray of the solar system, the Ray of Love-Wisdom, and the cosmic rayof the planet, which is the personality ray of the planetary Logos, the Ray ofActive Intelligence or Adaptability. Man might be defined as a unit of consciouslife, swept into tangible expression through the discriminating love of God.Through his life experiences he is presented with innumerable choices whichgradually shift from the realm of the tangible into that of the intangible. Ashe attracts, or is attracted by, the life of his environment, he becomesincreasingly conscious of a series of shifting values, until he reaches thatpoint in his development when the pull or the magnetic attraction of thesubjective world and the intangible mental and spiritual realities are morepotent than the factors which have hitherto enticed him on. His sense of valuesis no longer determined by: [340]1. The satisfaction of his instinctual animal nature.2. The desires of a more emotional and sentimental kindwhich his astral body demands.3. The pull and pleasures of the mind nature, and of intellectual appetites.He becomes potently attracted by his soul, and this produces a tremendousrevolution in his entire life, regarding the word “revolution” in its truesense, as a complete turning around. This revolution is happening now, on such auniversal scale in the lives of individuals in the world, that it is one of themain factors producing the present potency of experimental ideas in the world ofmodern times. The attractive power of the soul grows steadily, and the pull ofthe personality weakens as steadily. All this has been brought about by theprocess of experiment, leading to experience; by experience, leading to a wiseruse of the powers of the personality; by a growing appreciation of a truer worldof values and of reality, and by an effort on man’s part to identify himselfwith the world of spiritual values and not with a world of material values. Theworld of meaning and of causes becomes gradually the world in which he findshappiness, and his selection of his major interests and the use to which hedecides to put his time and powers are finally conditioned by the truerspiritual values. He then is on the path of illumination. I have sought toexpress the effects of these two major ray influences in terms of mysticism andof philosophy, but in very truth all that I have here said could be expressedscientifically and in terms of scientific formulas, if man were mentallyequipped to appreciate them. But this is not yet possible. All these rayvibrations, no matter which they may be, can eventually be reduced to formulasand to symbols.[341] Reaction to environment, sensitive response to the ray influences whichgovern and express themselves through the forms which compose man’s environment,a growing power to discriminate between energies and forces, a slowly developingsense of values (which sense is the one which eventually dispels illusion andglamour and reveals reality), and a shift of the discriminating interest awayfrom the worlds of tangible experience, of emotional life and of mentalinterest,— all this expresses the effect of the interplay between the two raysof the solar system and of the planet. These, intermingling, pour through andaffect mankind.One of the most difficult things with which the Masters are today confronted isto prove to man that the old and recognised values and the tangible world ofphenomena (emotional and physical) must be relegated to their right place in thebackground of man’s consciousness, and that the intangible realities, and theworld of ideas and causes must be, for him, in the immediate future, the maincentre of attention. When man grasps this and lives by this knowledge, then theglamour which now holds the world will disappear. If you ponder on this you willrecognise how the great crisis of 1914-1918 did much useful work in smashing theglamourous material security in which men were living, and in destroying much oftheir instinctual and sensuous selfishness. The group is beginning to berecognised as of major importance, and the welfare of the individual isimportant just in so far as the unit is an integral part of the group. This willnot eventually destroy initiative and individuality. It is only in our initialexperiments, and through our inexpertness in the use of the discriminatingfaculty, that we are, as yet, making such sad mistakes. This process ofdestroying the world illusion has been going on on a large scale ever since; inevery country, through the various experiments which are going forward [342] ,the glamour is breaking down and the truer values of group welfare, of groupintegration, and of group progress are emerging. The sense of insecurity whichis such a distressing aspect of the present upheaval is due simply to thisdestruction of the old sense of values, to that dispelling of glamour whichreveals at present an unfamiliar landscape, and to the fear and instabilitywhich man feels when he comes up against the world “Dweller on the Threshold.”This has to be broken up and destroyed, for it blocks the way to the new worldof values. The great thought form which man’s greed and materiality have built,down the ages, is being steadily demolished, and mankind is on the verge of aliberation which will take him on to the Path of Discipleship. I refer not hereto the final liberation, but to that liberation which comes from a free choice,wisely used and applied to the good of the whole, and conditioned by love. Notethat I say, “wisely used.” Wisdom, actuated and motivated by love, andintelligently applied to world problems, is much needed today and is not yet tobe found, except among the few illumined souls in every nation,—in every nation,I say, without exception. Many more must love with wisdom and appreciate thegroup aspiration before we shall see the next reality to be known and to emergeout of the darkness which we are now in the process of dispelling.3. THE RAY OF THE FOURTH KINGDOMWe now touch briefly upon an obscure and difficult subject, and one that willappeal primarily to those types who work with the Law of Correspondences.Esotericists must remember that every kingdom in nature constitutes a totalityof lives. Every atom in every form in nature is a life, and these lives form thecells of a Being’s body or vehicle of manifestation. There is a Being embodiedin every kingdom [343] in nature. Just as the myriads of atomic lives in thehuman body constitute a man’s body of expression and form his appearance, so itis with the greater Life informing the fourth kingdom in nature. Thisappearance—as are all appearances—is qualified by some particular ray type, andis determined also by the vital principle or spirit aspect. Thus every form iscomposed of innumerable lives, which have in them a preponderance of some rayquality. This is an occult platitude. These qualified lives produce a phenomenalappearance, and thus constitute a unity, through the influence of theintegrating principle, which is never absent.The ray which governs the sum total of the human kingdom is the fourth Ray ofHarmony through Conflict. It might be symbolically stated that the egoic ray ofthe Life which informs the human family is this fourth ray, and that thepersonality ray is the fifth ray of knowledge through discrimination,—the Ray,as it is called, of Concrete Knowledge or Science. Harmony through conflict, andthe power to achieve knowledge through discriminating choice—these are the tworays or major influences which sweep through humanity as a whole, and drive itforward towards its divine destiny. They are the predisposing factors upon whicha man may count and infallibly depend. They are the guarantee of attainment, butalso of turmoil and temporary duality. Harmony, expressing itself in beauty andcreative power, is gained through battle, through stress and strain. Knowledge,expressing itself eventually through wisdom, is attained only through the agonyof successively presented choices. These, submitted to the discriminatingintelligence during the process of the life experience, produce at last thesense of true values, the vision of the ideal, and the capacity to distinguishreality behind the intervening glamour.Students of esotericism will, of course, bear in mind that [344] the fourth rayhas a natural relation to the fourth kingdom in nature, which is in turn thelowest manifestation of the fourth creative Hierarchy. This unification of thethree major results of the activity of a great Life might be enumerated thus:1. The ray power or life which tends ever towards harmony and an eventualbeauty, the fourth ray.2. The creative hierarchy of human monads, who (little as they may realise it)have already attained wisdom and are veritably at this time the divine sons ofGod.3. The fourth kingdom in nature which is the result of the evolutionary activityof the above, who are in their turn impelled to this activity by the fourth ray.This is essentially the true apostolic succession, for it provides a triple lineof directed energy. This produces the human manifestation on the fourth globe ofour Earth chain, and in this fourth round is responsible for the tremendouscrisis with which our present humanity is confronted. The conflict aspect of theprocess is at its height, nay, has passed its height, from the angle of physicalplane expression. This situation and this triple influence, producing themanifestation of the sons of God, is summed up for us in the terse words of theOld Commentary –terse,when we remember that they express the long agony ofhumanity’s test, and the opening to man of the door into the fifth kingdom ofspiritual being. They include therefore, in their meaning, his goal andobjective and the process whereby he attains:“The Holy Four descend from out the heavenly places and venture forth towardsthe sphere of Earth. From the fourth great plane they thus control the battle.“The Lord of Harmony, Who sits on high, pours all His life and force throughoutthe field of conflict. He sees the end from the beginning nor stays His handthough deep [345] and full the pain and agony. Peace must be the goal. Beautymust be achieved. He cannot then arrest the life and stop its flow.“The Middle Four , rested now from the earlier campaign, gird on their armourand hide themselves behind the outer form. They leave the fourth great sphere ofharmony and pass on to the plane of mind. There they fortify the temple of theLord, illumine it with light and glory, and then they turn their eyes towardsthe Earth.“The Lower Four take form between the lives that are not human and the threegroups of lives which dwell beneath the threshold. They seek to link and blend,to bridge and fuse. Mankind now lives. The higher and the middle four meet inthe lower four upon the fourth great globe.“The battle now proceeds. When the three groups of manifested fours can see eachother in the light, and later blend their forces, the goal will be achieved.“In the fourth globe of action and in the major cycle of the fourth expressionwill this fusion be completed. The lower four, merged in the middle four, willleave the triple world of conflict, and find their dwelling place, whilst in theform, within the fourth sphere whence came forth the higher governing four. Thuswill the government be established; the glory seen; the rule of the hierarchydemonstrated.“In the fourth race (the Atlantean—A.A.B.) the conflict was begun, andconsciousness was born. In the fifth race (the Aryan—A.A.B.) the crisis of thebattle will be seen, and then the lower four and the middle four will begin tounite their forces. In the sixth race, the dust of battle dies away. The lowerfour, the middle four and the higher four will chant in unison the glory oftheir Lord, the beauty of the love of God, the wonder of the brotherhood of man.This is their paean”.Esoterically speaking (and not speaking symbolically, for there is a distinctionbetween these two forms which students would do well to note), when the lines offorces are adjusted and there is free interplay of energies and a straightaligned channel between the various aspects of divinity, then there isachievement and beauty. This is the theme of the [346] above symbolical andancient formulation of truth, which is in the nature of a symbolical prophecy.The same idea has been expressed in a still more ancient and terse statementwhich has to be understood and reduced to a mantric formula when the fourthinitiation is taken:“When the forces of the four, three times repeated, become the four, then theLife of . . . . . . reveals Itself in beauty”.It is interesting to note that the numerical value of the word “four” is thesame in detail as that of the word “force”, if you eliminate the number five.For humanity, it is the fifth energy which leads to the battlefield, the energyof the discriminating mind, and when that has been in due time used, controlledand transmuted, “only the four remains and force has gone”. Note the detail ofthe numbering:F O R C E 6 6 9 3 5 29 11. Number of adept, using energy. F O U R 6 6 3 9 24 6.The creator, unifying the subjective and the objective.It is apparent that force in the first group ends in separativeness, for five isthe number of the mind and of man. Number nine, the number of initiation, ishidden midway in force, but the climaxing figures indicate activity andseparation. In the second group of figures, activity precedes the nine ofinitiation, and that nine is the culmination. But five is left out. Man is nolonger really human or separative. He is the perfected four of the lower threeand the soul. Putting the truth quite simply, let it be borne in mind thatmankind, the fourth kingdom, which is an expression of the fourth creativehierarchy of human monads, is swept by the instinct or impulse towards harmony,and is thus primarily under the influence of the fourth ray. This harmony isachieved [347] through the use of the energy of the fifth ray of knowledge. Thenthrough gained and applied knowledge, the result is beauty and the power tocreate. Then the ray of the fifth Lord will be withdrawn from the major cyclegoverning humanity, and wisdom and intuitional buddhic response willcharacterise humanity. There is a close interplay in this major cycle, as far asmankind is concerned, between the two ray Lords of Harmony and of Knowledge. Itis again in this numerical relation of four and five that the number nineemerges, which is the number of initiation. An adept of the fifth initiation isone who has achieved complete harmony through right knowledge. This takes placeat the fourth initiation and is demonstrated or proven at the fifth.A close study of the tabulations of the rays affecting humanity will have madeit clear that they are so many and so diverse that the complexity of the subjectis very great. There are numerous influences which tend to make man what he is,and of many of them little is as yet known. In the early stages of hisdevelopment, it is well-nigh impossible for any one (except an initiate) to dealwith the various phases or even to recognise the indications of humanity’sreactions to these rays. But as mankind evolves, and as the form aspect becomesincreasingly a better and finer response apparatus and a more plastic sensitivereflector of the inner man, definition and analysis become easier. Types emergewith greater clarity in their delineations, and the ray qualities begin todominate. The impress of the controlling rays can be more clearly noted and thepoint in evolution can be more accurately realised.We have now to consider the rays which dominate the races of mankind. Theaverage reader would be wise to take the position that for him, at least, theinformation hitherto [348] given, and that which concerns the racial, nationaland cyclic rays, provide an interesting hypothesis which can be intelligentlyaccepted until disproven. This knowledge must necessarily remain hypotheticalfor several life periods, where the average student is concerned. When, however,we come to the consideration of the final three points of this section of ourtreatise, it may be possible to check the information, to correlate the raytypes, and to discover (by a study of the potencies involved) their emergingcharacteristics and ray forces.By the proving therefore of the human detail, we lay the ground for theacceptance of the cosmic, solar and planetary knowledge. What is proven true onthe small scale opens the door for the understanding of that which exists on alarger scale. “Man, know thyself” is a potent key to the knowledge of Deity andto the workings of divinity4. THE RACIAL RAYSThe reader needs to remember that three rays are occultly quiescent and fourrays are in varying degrees of activity. Let us recapitulate for a moment sothat this thought may be clearly anchored in our minds:Rays one, four and six are at this time out of manifestation, though ray sixbegan to decline in influence only three hundred years ago, and its potency,though greatly weakened, can still be felt.Rays two, three, five and seven are still potent. The following statement maygive some idea of the relative “values” of these ray influences.Ray three has been the longest in incarnation, but in 1875 it occultly“completed its outgoing, and began to curve upon itself, and thus return”. It istherefore just beginning to wane. When this event occurs in connection with anytype [349] of energy, the effect produced is always of a crystallising natureand is apt to produce “set forms which warrant prompt destruction”. This causesmental conditions of a set and static nature. The inference is therefore clearthat in the later stages of this ray’s activity we have the demonstration ofthose dogmatic, sectarian and theological attitudes, for instance, which markthe decline and consequent uselessness of the various schools of thought whichhave in their time embodied man’s ideas and sufficed for his helping during theperiod of their growth.Ray two has a rapidly recurring cycle. This is due to its excessive potency.Being the major ray of our solar system (of which all the other rays are butaspects), it might be said that this ray is really never out of incarnation.There are nevertheless constant cycles of waxing and waning potency, produced bythe interplay of the rays which produce what is called in the ancient archives“the intrusion of one or another of the seven Brothers Who block the door fromwhence the force emerges”, and “the disappearance of that radiant Brother Whopasses on His way and leaves behind an open door through which another Brothercan pass upon His mission preordained.” The symbolism is clear. The cycles ofthe second ray are dynamic and recur in a regular rhythm at this time and duringthe twenty-five thousand years of a zodiacal cycle in sequences of five hundredyears. Therefore in 1825 the potency of this ray began to decline as the peak ofits two hundred fifty years emergence was reached. It was the gradual withdrawalof this ray which led to that growth of separativeness in the world whichproduced the European wars and the great World War. This ray will continuedeclining for another one hundred forty years. This does not necessarily meanthe growth of physical violence and the prevalence of war. Humanity is now somuch more responsive [350] to ray influences that the watching Hierarchy(through egoic stimulation and the sensitivity of certain nations to the innerguidance) can offset the more obvious major effects. This will give aninteresting side light upon the vast importance of these cyclic happenings.Ray five is the latest of the rays to come into activity and is only in processof “coming forth to power.” It is steadily increasing in potency, and the resultof its influence will be to guide humanity into increasing knowledge. Its energybeats upon the minds of men at this time and produces that stimulation whichlies behind all the scientific approach to truth in all departments of humanthought. Being also the ray which governs the personality aspect of the fourthkingdom in nature, and being one of the rays determining or conditioning ourAryan race, its present potency is excessive. This is a point to be rememberedwith care, for it accounts for much that we can see happening in the world ofthought.Ray seven is also in manifestation, and has been since the year 1675. This weshall consider in more detail when we take up our fifth point: The Rays inCyclic Manifestation.The interplay, therefore, and the beauty of the blended energies are at thistime great, for so many rays are either manifesting simultaneously or are justpassing out and are therefore not entirely negligible; or are hovering near athand ready to pass into the stage of revelation and so continue their cyclicwork. Only one ray is today really out of manifestation altogether andfunctioning entirely behind the scenes, and that is the first ray. Wherehumanity is concerned, the first ray makes its presence felt, and its potencydominates, when the stage of accepted discipleship is reached. It increases inpower as progress on the Path is gained. Thus there is beginning to be gatheredon the subjective side of life a steadily growing group of those who canfunction under [351] the influence of this first ray. When enough of the sons ofmen can thus function, their united responsiveness will constitute a channelthrough which this first ray can come into manifestation. This is one of themain activities and objectives of the Hierarchy, and in the right understandingof the result of the responsiveness of humanity to the ray influences shall wearrive at the recognition of a law in nature hitherto undiscovered. Thisparticular law is connected with the department of the Governor of the world,the Manu.It might be of interest here to note that ray six governs the Path of Probationand nourishes the fires of idealism in the aspirant.Ray two governs the Path of Discipleship and transmutes knowledge into wisdom,feeding likewise the Christ life in each disciple.Ray one governs the Path of Initiation, producing detachment from form, thedestruction of all that hinders, and fostering that dynamic will in the initiatewhich will enable him to take the needed steps towards the Initiator.It should here be noted that the rays divide themselves into two groups, i.e.:1. The Rays of Aspect Rays 1. 2. 3. The major rays. 2. The Rays of AttributeRays 4. 5. 6. 7. The minor rays.The distinction between these two groups has been well summed up in somesentences from the Old Commentary:“The seven brothers are all the children of the same Father, but the elder threepartake of the Father’s nature. The younger four resemble the Mother. The threeelder sons go forth into the universe of stars, and there they represent theFather. The younger four go forth into the universe of stars and show the natureof the one the Father loved.”The rays of aspect have longer cycles than the rays of attribute, and theirmeasure is occultly slow, cumulative in [352] effect, and—as the ages passaway—their momentum steadily increases. The rays of attribute have briefercycles, and produce a steady heart-beat and a regular rhythm in the solarsystem. The three rays of aspect might be regarded as embodying the will andpurpose of the incarnating Logos. The rays of attribute can equally be regardedas embodying the quality and character of the incarnating Logos. Symbolicallyspeaking, the three major rays are the expression (during manifestation) of theegoic aspect of the solar Logos, whilst the four rays of attribute embody Hispersonality aspect. Nevertheless it must be remembered that the seven togetherare the manifestation in form of what God is, and the measure of the divineintention. Students should bear these points in mind as they study the rays andtheir cyclic influence on mankind. If they will remember that when a major rayis in manifestation, then the divine intent, the universal purpose and Plan willbe seen emerging with greater clarity, they will expect and look for greathappenings in the racial development. If a minor ray is demonstrating, we shallhave the growth of psychic sensitivity, and the emergence of a form life whichwill express the divine nature more potently than the divine Plan.This truth can be applied also to the development of the individual, and willgovern and determine his evolutionary growth either from the angle of purpose orfrom the angle of quality. Lives that are given to the unfolding of purpose willbe of a different timbre and nature than those which are given to thedevelopment of character and quality. This is a psychological point of realmoment.The statement made above is one of the most significant and important yetcommunicated in this treatise, and well merits careful consideration. The trueimport is of course most difficult to grasp, but the general meaning can berecognized [353] and appreciated by the searching student. The rays of aspectproduce primarily the unfolding of the Plan. The rays of attribute produce theunfolding of the qualities of Deity. This is true of the solar Logos and of ahuman being, of the planetary Deity and of humanity as a whole.The application of this truth can be clearly seen in connection with the Aryanrace and the two rays which govern and control its destiny. The third Ray ofIntelligent Activity or Adaptability governs the entire career of the race, andthrough this dominance we can see working out the plan of God, which is thedefinite fusion of spirit and matter, through the evolution of the soul of man.The result of this fusion may be briefly summed up in the following threestatements:1. A widespread interest in, leading finally to a recognition of, the soul as aresult of this fusion and blending.2. The appreciation of the divinity of substance, and the recognition of thefact that matter is the outer garment of God. This will characterise theintellectual achievement of the Aryan race.3. The plan of God that humanity should control matter on the physical planereaches a high point of perfection in the Aryan race. Of this, man’s control ofthe electrical forces of the physical plane is an outstanding instance.These three important developments indicate the activity of the third ray duringthe period of time wherein the Aryan race emerges from the general racialbackground, develops itself as the generations pass away, and then fades outagain as do all the races. By this process the souls which have profited by theexperience during racial manifestation pass on into another and higher race, thesixth root race, in this case. These are the major results. There are many minorones which tend to perfect the divine purpose for the race. That [354] purposeaims only at a relative perfection and not at the ultimate consummation. Theracial perfection which will be reached as a result of the activity of the thirdand fifth rays will be seen as only partial from the angle of vision of theseventh root race, for instance, but it will be far ahead of that achievedduring the Atlantean or fourth root race, which was under the dominant influenceof the second and sixth rays. The flower of any race, and those who guaranteeits achievement, are to be seen in the Masters, Initiates and Disciples Who,during any race, reach the goal which Their souls have set. The reader mustremember that the goal of adeptship is a steadily shifting one, and that theadepts of the Aryan race will be higher in development, and of a moreintellectual order, than those who reached that stage during the Atlantean race.Therefore the requirements for treading the path of discipleship in the presentrace are steadily increasing in difficulty as the centuries slip away. At thesame time, the assets brought by the aspirant to the task of achievingdiscipleship likewise steadily evolve, and the equipment is as steadily arrivingat a greater adequacy, thus measuring up to the opportunity offered. Such books,therefore, as The Outer Court and The Path of Discipleship by Annie Besant statethe requirements for the path of probation, and not for the path ofdiscipleship. A Treatise on White Magic gives the needed data for those whotread, at this time, the path of discipleship. In these three books are to befound the requirements for the two stages of the path of conscious unfoldment.Curiously enough, in Lemurian days the first ray was active. This was because ofa special dispensation or effort on the part of the planetary Hierarchy. Withthe aid of the seventh ray the needed work went forward. At the time of theindividualisation of humanity, a third ray, the fifth, was called intooperation, and thus with the united effort of the [355] first, the seventh andthe fifth rays, the great fusion between the higher and the lower aspects ofmankind was made. It is interesting to note that the secondary ray influence inthe Aryan race at this time is the fifth, thus linking up the Aryan and theLemurian civilisations. Both were and are intensely material civilisations, butthe Lemurian was material because the whole attention of the Hierarchy wasturned to the development of physical man, whilst today the attention is notturned to the physical unfoldment of man, but to an effort to enable man tocontrol the physical forces of the planet. One rather striking instance of thesimilarity of the ray forces should be here noted. In Lemurian times, the yogaof the age which produced the required at-one-ing or unification (preceding thetaking of the initiation of the time) was hatha yoga, the yoga of the physicalbody. This gave to the initiate the needed physical control—a control which hastoday been so perfected in the race that it is now automatic and has slippedbelow the threshold of consciousness. In the great cyclic recapitulations whichgo on ceaselessly we see today in our Aryan race a tremendous emphasis beinggiven to physical perfection, to sport, to athletics, to dancing and to physicalculture. It is the cyclic effect of the same ray forces, playing upon humanityagain. The initiatory goal is today a mental at-one-ing. Nevertheless, thephysical reaction to the ray forces produces a higher form of hatha yoga orphysical coordination. These points will be further elucidated.The secondary influence which is leading the Aryan race forward is that of thefifth Ray of Concrete Knowledge or Science. This ray, as we have seen, was oneof the rays which brought about individualisation millions of years ago, and solaunched mankind upon the path of return. Again it comes into power, and thoughit has had many cycles of activity since Lemurian days, none of them have beenof such unobstructed [356] dominance as the present. Hence the tremendouspotency of individuals at this time; hence the difficulty, but also theopportunity. This is a ray of quality, and its effect is to stimulate theacquisition of knowledge and the growth of the human intellect, which is aninstrument of exceeding sensitivity, producing increased awareness of God.It might be said that in Lemurian times the effect of this ray was to stimulatethe instinctual nature. This gave awareness of the form nature of Deity. DuringAtlantean days, through the influence of the second ray, the instinct began tomerge into the intellect, and that aspect of man’s nature was developed which iscalled (in theosophical books) kama-manas. This phrase simply means a blend ofdesire-feeling-lower-mind,—a curious synthesis which characterises average mantoday, and leads to his complicated problem. This development gave man anothertype of awareness. He became conscious of the sentient universe; he becamesensitive to the love of God, and registered an innate reaction to the heart ofGod. Today, under the fifth ray influence, the intellect is rapidly awakening;instinct is falling below the threshold of consciousness; kama-manas is nolonger the outstanding characteristic of the disciples of the world. Theintellect (concrete and abstract, lower and higher) is steadily unfolding, andas it unfolds, the will, purpose and plan of the Deity begin to take shape inmen’s minds. The secondary effects of this development are the power toorganise, and to work individually with definite purpose. This is demonstratedtoday by individuals in all departments of human activity. They evince capacityto sense the Plan of God and to cooperate; they see the broad general outlinesof the divine purpose, and comprehend as never before the great evolutionaryplan. Men are building now towards the future because they have glimpsed thepast and touched the vision.[357] Later, we shall have a transition period again, analogous to that periodwherein kama-manas was developed, and we shall then have the entire raceexpressing a developed synthesis of intellect-intuition, preparatory to thatadvanced stage which will come at the close of the next root race, the sixth.This takes us to a period ten million years hence, when the intellect will havein its turn slipped below the threshold of consciousness, as did the instinct.It will then work automatically as does man’s instinctual nature, and the racewill be intuitive. This will really mean that the fifth kingdom in nature willbe manifesting on earth, and that the kingdom of God (as the Christian calls it)will have arrived. This will constitute an event of an importance equal to thatof the advent of the fourth kingdom, when men made their appearance on earth.This next great race will be governed by the second and fourth rays, thusdemonstrating a relation between the fourth root race, the Atlantean, and thesixth root race. In terms of consciousness, this can be expressed as a relationbetween an astral-emotional development and an intuitional-buddhic development.The final race will be governed by the first, the seventh and the second rays.I think I have given you as much on this abstruse subject as can be grasped. Thetabulation of the rays governing the races might be stated, therefore, asfollows:Lemurian Race Rays 1. 7. 5. Atlantean Race Rays 2. 6. Aryan Race Rays 3. 5.Sixth Race Rays 2. 4. Seventh Race Rays 1. 7. 2.5. THE RAYS IN CYCLIC MANIFESTATIONWe come now to a consideration of the forces which are prevailing at the presenttime and hence have a supreme interest in connection with what I now have tosay. It might [358] first be stated that the main problem of today is broughtabout by the fact that two rays of great potency are functioning simultaneously.As yet their effects are so equally balanced that a situation is brought aboutwhich is described in the ancient archives in the following terms: “A time ofrending, when the mountains, which have sheltered, fall from their high places,and the voices of men are lost in the crash and thunder of the fall”. Suchperiods come only at rare and long intervals, and each time they come apeculiarly significant period of divine activity is ushered in; old things passentirely away, yet the ancient landmarks are restored. The seventh Ray ofCeremonial Order or Ritual is coming into manifestation. The sixth Ray ofIdealism or of Abstract Visioning is slowly passing out. The seventh ray willbring into expression that which was visioned and that which constituted theideals of the preceding cycle of sixth ray activity. One ray prepares the wayfor another ray, and the reason for the manifestation of one ray or another isdependent upon the Plan and divine Purpose. It is not often that two rays followeach other in a regular numerical sequence, such as is now happening. When thisdoes happen, there eventuates a rapid following of effect upon cause, and thistoday can provide the basis for an assured hope.a. THE OUTGOING SIXTH RAYThe sixth ray influence served to attract men’s minds towards an ideal, such asthat of individual sacrifice or service, and the mystical vision was the highwater mark of the period; the numerous guiding mystics of the Occident and theOrient have appeared. The seventh ray influence will in time produce themagician, but in this age the magician will be predominantly in the class ofwhite magic (not as in Atlantean days, when the predominance was on the side ofselfish [359] or black magic). The white magician works with the forces ofnature and swings them back into control of advanced humanity. This can alreadybe seen working out through the activity of the scientists which the latter endof the last century and this twentieth century have produced. That much of theirmagical work has been turned into selfish channels by the tendency of thismaterialistic age, and that many of their wise and true discoveries in the realmof energy are today adapted to ends which serve man’s hatred or love of self, isequally true. But this in no way militates against the wonder of theirachievements. When the motive is transmuted from pure scientific interest tolove of the divine revelation, and when service to the race is the determiningforce, then we shall see the true white magic. Hence therefore the need to turnthe mystic into the occultist, and to train the modern aspirant in right motive,mind control and brotherly love, all of which must and will express themselvesthrough harmlessness. The most potent force in the world today is harmlessness.I speak not of non-resistance, but of that positive attitude of mind whichthinks no evil. He who thinks no evil and harms naught is a citizen of God’sworld.The following relations between the sixth and seventh rays should be heldclearly in mind, and students should grasp the relation of the immediate past tothe immediate future, and see in this relation the working out of God’s Plan andthe coming salvation of the race:a. The sixth ray fostered the vision.The seventh ray will materialise that which was visioned.b. The sixth ray produced the mystic as its culminating type of aspirant.The seventh ray will develop the magician who works in the field of white magic.[360]c. The sixth ray, as part of the evolutionary plan, led to separations, tonationalism, and to sectarianism, due to the selective nature of the mind andits tendency to divide and separate.The seventh ray will lead to fusion and synthesis, for its energy is of the typewhich blends spirit and matter.d. The sixth ray activity led to the formation of bands of disciples, working ingroups but not in close relation, and subject to internal dissension, based onpersonality reactions.The seventh ray will train and send forth groups of initiates, working in closeunison with the Plan and with each other.e. The sixth ray brought the sense of duality to a humanity which regardeditself as a physical unity. Of this attitude the academic materialisticpsychologists are the exponents.The seventh ray will inaugurate the sense of a higher unity; first, that of theintegrated personality for the masses, and secondly, that of the fusion of souland body for the world aspirants.f. The sixth ray differentiates that aspect of the universal electrical energywhich we know as modern electricity, produced to serve man’s material needs.The seventh ray period will familiarise man with that type of electricalphenomena which produce the coordination of all forms.g. The sixth ray influence produced the emergence in men’s minds of thefollowing knowledges:1. Knowledge of physical plane light and electricity. [361]2. Among the esotericists and spiritualists of the world, knowledge of theexistence of the astral light.3. An interest in illumination, both physical and mental.4. Astro-physics and the newer astronomical discoveries.The seventh ray will change the theories of the advanced thinkers of the raceinto the facts of the future educational systems. Education and the growth ofthe understanding of illumination in all fields will eventually be regarded assynonymous ideals.h. The sixth ray taught the meaning of sacrifice, and of this teaching thecrucifixion was the outstanding emblem, to the initiates. Philanthropy was theexpression of the same teaching, to advanced humanity. The nebulous ideal ofsimply “being kind” is the same motivation, applied to the unthinking masses.The seventh ray will bring to the consciousness of the coming initiates theconcept of group service and sacrifice. This will inaugurate the age of the“divine service”. The vision of the giving of the individual in sacrifice andservice, within the group and to the group ideal, will be the goal of the massesof advanced thinkers in the New Age, whilst for the rest of humanity,brotherhood will be the keynote of their endeavour. These words have a widerconnotation and significance than the thinkers of today can know and understand.i. The sixth ray promoted the growth of the spirit of individualism. Groupsexist, but they are groups of individuals gathered around an individual.The seventh ray will foster the group spirit, and the rhythm of the group, theobjectives of the group, and the ritual-working of the group will be the basicphenomena. [362]j. The sixth ray influence conveyed to men the ability to recognise thehistorical Christ, and to evolve the structure of the Christian faith, colouredby a vision of a great Son of Love, but qualified by an excessive militancy andseparativeness, based on a narrow idealism.The seventh ray will convey to man the power to recognise the cosmic Christ, andto produce that future scientific religion of Light which will enable man tofulfill the command of the historical Christ to permit his light to shine forth.k. The sixth ray produced the great idealistic religions with their vision andtheir necessary narrowness,—a narrowness that is needed to safeguard infantsouls.The seventh ray will release the developed souls from the nursery stage andinaugurate that scientific understanding of the divine purpose which will fosterthe coming religious synthesis.l. The effect of the sixth ray influence has been to foster the separativeinstincts,—dogmatic religion, scientific factual accuracy, schools of thoughtwith their doctrinal barriers and exclusiveness, and the cult of patriotism.The seventh ray will prepare the way for the recognition of the wider issueswhich will materialise as the new world religion which will emphasise unity butbar out uniformity; it will prepare for that scientific technique which willdemonstrate the universal light that every form veils and hides, and for thatinternationalism which will express itself as practical brotherhood and as peaceand goodwill between the peoples.I could continue emphasizing these relations, but I have enumerated enough toshow the beauty of the preparation [363] made by the sixth great Lord ofIdealism for the work of the seventh Lord of Ceremonial.b. THE INCOMING SEVENTH RAYIt might be wise here to elucidate somewhat the idea underlying ceremonial andritual. There is so much revolt at this time against ceremonial, and so manygood and well-meaning people regard themselves as having outgrown andtranscended ritual. They pride themselves on having attained that so-called“liberation”, forgetting that it is only the sense of individuality that permitthis attitude, and that no group work is ever possible without some form ofritual. The refusal therefore to participate in uniformity of action is no signof a liberated soul.The Great White Brotherhood has its rituals, but they are rituals which have fortheir objective the inauguration and the assistance of various aspects of thePlan, and of the varying cyclic activities of that Plan. Where these ritualsexist, but where the meaning (inherently present) remains hidden and unrealised,there must as a consequence be demonstrated a spirit of deadness, ofuselessness, and of weariness of interest over forms and ceremonies. But whereit is demonstrated that ritual and organised ceremonies are but the evidence ofa custody of forces and energies, then the idea is constructive in its workingout, cooperation with the Plan becomes possible, and the aim of all the divineservice begins to demonstrate. All service is governed by ritual.The coming in of the seventh ray will lead to this desired consummation, and themystics who are training themselves in the technique of occult motive and in themethods of the trained magician will increasingly find themselves cooperatingintelligently with the Plan, and participating in those basic rituals which aredistinguished by their power to: [364]a. Harness the forces of the planet to the service of the race.b. Send forth those energies which will produce in some one or other of thekingdoms of nature effects of a desirable and beneficent aspect.c. Call in and re-distribute the energies which are present in all the forms inthe various subhuman kingdoms.d. Heal through a scientific method of bringing together soul and body.e. Produce illumination through right understanding of the energy of Light.f. Evolve that coming ritual which will eventually reveal the true significanceof water , which will revolutionise its uses and open to man the free passage tothe astral plane. This plane is that of the emotional-desire nature, and itssymbol is water. The coming Aquarian Age will reveal to man (and hence alsofacilitate the work of the seventh ray) that that plane is his natural home atthis state of development. The masses today are entirely, but unconsciously,polarised on that plane. They must become consciously aware of their activity.Man is on the verge of becoming normally awake on the astral plane, and it willbe through scientific rituals that this new development will be brought about.The sixth ray influence produced the appearance of the modern science ofpsychology, and that science has been its consummating glory. The seventh rayinfluence will carry forward that infant science to maturity. Belief in the soulhas become widespread during the sixth ray period. Knowledge of the soul will bethe result of the incoming ray activity, plus the aid contributed by theenergies released during the incoming Aquarian Age.The new and esoteric psychology will be steadily developed. It will be apparenttherefore that A Treatise on White Magic [365] has a definitely seventh rayimport, and this Treatise on the Seven Rays has also been sent forth in aneffort to clarify the incoming spiritual influences. One of the first lessonsthat humanity will learn under the potent influence of the seventh ray is thatthe soul controls its instrument, the personality, through ritual, or throughthe imposition of a regular rhythm, for rhythm is what really designates aritual. When aspirants to discipleship impose a rhythm on their lives they callit a discipline, and they feel happy about it. What groups do who are gatheredtogether for the performance of any ritual or ceremony whatsoever (Churchritual, the Masonic work, the drill of the army or navy, business organisations,the proper functioning of a home, of a hospital, or of an entertainment, etc.)is of an analogous nature, for it imposes on the participants a simultaneousperformance, an identical undertaking, or a ritual. No one on this earth canevade ritual or ceremonial, for the rising and the setting of the sun imposes aritual, the cyclic passing of the years, the potent movements of the greatcentres of population, the coming and the going of trains, of ocean liners andof mails, and the regular broadcasting of the radio organisations,—all of theseimpose a rhythm upon humanity, whether this is recognised or not. Of theserhythms the present great experiments in national standardisation andregimentation are also an expression, as they demonstrate through the masses inany nation.There is no evading the process of ceremonial living. It is unconsciouslyrecognised, blindly followed, and constitutes the great discipline of therhythmic breathing of life itself. The Deity works with ritual and is subjectedto the ceremonials of the universe. The seven rays come into activity and passout again under the rhythmic and ritualistic impulse of the divine Life. Thus isthe temple of the Lord built by the [366] ceremonial of the Builders. Everykingdom in nature is subjected to ritualistic experience and to the ceremonialsof cyclic expression. These only the initiate can comprehend. Every ant hill andevery beehive is equally impelled by instinctive rituals and by rhythmicimpulses. The new science of psychology could well be described as the scienceof the rituals and rhythms of the body, of the emotional nature and of themental processes, or of those ceremonials (inherent, innate, or imposed by theself, by circumstances and by environment) which affect the mechanism throughwhich the soul functions.It is interesting to note how the sixth ray, which produced in human beings thesense of separativeness and of pronounced individualism, has prepared the wayfor the organising power of the seventh ray. It is almost as if (to speaksymbolically) the executives who were to undertake the reorganising of the worldin preparation for the New Age were trained and prepared for their task by theinfluence now going out. Today a process of house-cleaning is going forward inpractically every great nation, preparatory to the coming revelation, and theexecutives and dictators who are sponsoring this realignment and readjustmentare the experts whom the genius of each nation has brought forth to deal withthe unique problems with which it is beset. They are predominantly seventh rayexecutives, whose task it is to reorganise the world as a whole upon the newerlines. They are in the nature of material efficiency experts who have been sentin to deal with internal affairs and to institute that activity which willeliminate those factors which prevent the nation concerned from functioning as awhole, as a unit, integrated and coherent. It is from the lack of internalharmony and synthesis that those internal difficulties and disorders emergewhich (if of long continuance) prevent a nation having [367] aught to contributeto the world of nations and lead to that nation’s being so intensely disorderedthat the wrong people come into power and the wrong aspects of truth becomeemphasized. A disordered inharmonious national unit is a menace to the comity ofnations, and therefore the separative house-cleanings and rearrangements must goforward before the Federation of Nations can be an accomplished fact.The new era is however upon its way, and nothing can prevent that which thestars decree and which the Hierarchy of guiding Minds consequently foresee. Thenew executives who will succeed the present dictators and powers will take overthe control towards the year 1955, and they will be seventh ray aspirants anddisciples in the majority of cases; their capacity towards integration andtowards fusion along right lines will then rapidly bring about the neededinternational understanding.The question emerges in your mind as to whether such a prophecy will indeed befulfilled; and if unfulfilled, will not that fact militate against much that Ihave said and prove me unreliable? Let me answer this question by pointing outthat those of us who foresee that which may and ought to be are neverthelesswell aware that though the fulfillment of the prophecy is inevitable, yet thetime factor may not work out as indicated. This will be because the distressedhuman mechanisms of those to whom the work is given will fail to react eithercorrectly or at the right time. These incoming seventh ray aspirants anddisciples may make mistakes and may perform their undertakings in such a mannerthat delay may eventuate. They are permitted to have the general outline oftheir task committed to them by their own souls, working under the inspirationof those great and liberated souls we call the Masters of the Wisdom, but thereis no coercion under the Plan and no forced and dictated service. [368] Much ofthe success in the coming momentous years is dependent upon the work done by allwho may be affiliated (even slightly) with the New Group of World Servers. Ifpublic opinion is educated in the new ideals, the momentum of that growing tidewill greatly facilitate the work of these seventh ray executives, and in somecases will constitute for them the line of least resistance. Failure, therefore,will rest upon the shoulders of the world aspirants and disciples, and will notindicate inaccurate prophecy or misinterpreted astrological conditions. In anycase, the prophesied end is inevitable, but the time of that end rests in thehands of awakened humanity. The margin of difference will also be only betweenone hundred and three hundred years. The impulse towards synthesis is now toostrong to be long delayed.Under this seventh ray influence the Masonic Fraternity will come into a new andpronounced spiritual activity and begin to approximate its true function and tofulfill its long-seen destiny. One point it might be of interest here to note.During the period of the activity of the sixth ray the Fraternity fell into acrystallised and sectarian attitude, along with the many other grouped circles.It fell also into the snare of materialism, and the outer form has for centuriesbeen of more importance in the eyes of Masons than the inner spiritual meaning.The symbols and the system of allegories have been emphasized, whilst that whichthey were intended to convey and to reveal to the initiated has been quiteforgotten. Also, the trend of the attention of a lodge of Masons, and the mainemphasis, has been potently placed on the function and place of the W.M., andnot upon the inner significance of the work upon the floor of the Temple. Thelodge has not been regarded as an integrated functioning entity. This must andwill be changed, and the potency and the effectiveness of the lodge work andceremonial will be demonstrated. [369] It will be seen that in the regularity ofthe rituals and the sanctified formality of the ordained ceremonials lies thetrue meaning of the work and the use of the Word . The coming era of group workand power and of organised synthetic ritualistic activity will profoundly affectMasonry, as the importance of a central dominating figure passes out with thesixth ray influence and the true spiritual work and function of the lodge itselfis understood.The prime cosmic function of the seventh ray is to perform the magical work ofblending spirit and matter in order to produce the manifested form through whichthe life will reveal the glory of God. Students would be well advised to pausehere and re-read the section of this treatise in which I dealt with the seventhray Lord, with His names, and with His purpose. When this has been done, it willbe apparent that one of the results of the intensified new influence will be therecognition, by science, of certain effects and characteristics of the workbeing accomplished. This can already be seen in the work done by scientists inconnection with the mineral world. As we have seen in an earlier part of thisbook the mineral kingdom is governed by the seventh ray, and to the potency ofthis incoming ray can be attributed the discovery of the radio-activity ofmatter. The seventh ray expresses itself in the mineral kingdom through theproduction of radiation, and we shall find that increasingly these radiations(many of which still remain to be discovered) will be noted, their effectsunderstood and their potencies grasped. One point remains as yet unrealised byscience, and that is that these radiations are cyclic in their appearance; underthe influence of the seventh ray it has been possible for man to discover andwork with radium. Radium has always been present, but not always active in sucha manner that we were able to detect it. It is under the influence of theincoming [370] seventh ray that its appearance has been made possible, and it isthrough this same influence that we shall discover new cosmic rays. They too arealways present in our universe, but they use the substance of the incoming rayenergy as the path along which they can travel to our planet and thus berevealed. It is many thousands of years since what are now studied as the CosmicRays (discovered by Millikan) played definitely upon our planet, and at thattime the fifth ray was not active as it now is. Therefore scientific knowledgeof their activity was not possible.Other cosmic rays will play upon our earth as this seventh ray activity becomesincreasingly active, and the result of their influence will be to facilitate theemergence of the new racial types, and above all else, to destroy the veil orweb which separates the world of the seen and tangible from the world of theunseen and the intangible, the astral world. Just as there is a veil called “theetheric web” dividing off the various force centres in the human body, andprotecting the head centres from the astral world, so there is a separating webbetween the world of physical life and the astral world. This will be destroyed,slowly and certainly, by the play of the cosmic rays upon our planet. Theetheric web which is found between the centres in the spine, and which is foundat the top of the head (protecting the head centre) is destroyed in man’smechanism by the activity of certain forces found in that mysterious fire whichwe call the kundalini fire. The cosmic rays of which the modern scientist isaware constitute aspects of the planetary kundalini, and their effect will bethe same in the body of the planetary Logos, the Earth, as it is in the humanbody; the etheric web between the physical and astral planes is in process ofdestruction, and it is of this event which the sensitives of the world and thespiritualists prophesy as an imminent happening.[371] Much of profound interest is on its way as a result of this seventh rayactivity. For one thing, though the animal kingdom reacts but little to thistype of influence, yet there are going to be very definite results within thesoul of the animal form. The door of individualisation or of entrance into thehuman kingdom has been closed since Atlantean times, but under the new influenceit will be partially opened; it will be set ajar, so that a few animals willrespond to soul stimulation and discover that their rightful place is on thehuman side of the dividing door. Part of the reorganisation which will go on asa result of the seventh ray activity will concern the relation of humanity tothe animal kingdom and the establishing of better and of closer relations. Thiswill lead men to take advantage of another effect of the seventh ray, which isits power to refine the matter out of which the forms are built. The animal bodyof man has received much scientific attention during the past one hundred years,and medicine and surgery have reached great heights of achievement. Theframework of man, his body, and its internal systems (with their diverserituals) are now understood as never before, and this has been the result of theincoming ray force with its power to apply knowledge to the magical work. Whenthis knowledge is applied intensively to the animal world much new andinteresting data will be discovered; when the differences between the physicalbodies of the animals and those of humanity have been more closely investigatedthere will appear a new and very fruitful field of study. These differences arelargely in the realm of the nervous systems; not enough attention has been paidfor instance to the fact that the brain of the animal is really in the region ofthe solar plexus, whilst the human brain, the controlling agent, is in the head,and works through the medium of the spinal column. When scientists know exactlywhy the animal [372] does not use the brain in the head as does man, they willarrive at a fuller knowledge of the law governing cycles.There is much that could be said, but little of it would, as yet, becomprehended. Until the incoming ray force and all that attends its entry hasproduced the adequate changes in the nervous system, it will not be possible formore to be made clear. Brain cells, hitherto dormant in even the most advancedthinkers, must be brought into functioning activity and with this consummated,then more teaching and further elucidation will be possible,—but not till then.Some time must yet elapse before the present human mechanisms are adapted to theregistration of that which is new and as yet unknown.Three final points I wish to touch upon. As you may have noted from some of ourearlier tabulations, there is a definite relation between the first kingdom innature, the mineral kingdom, and the final kingdom, the solar kingdom, theseventh and last to appear in manifestation upon our planet. There is amysterious unity of response existing between the lowest kingdom in the scale ofnature and the highest, between that which expresses the densest manifestationof the divine life and that which embodies its final and glorious consummation.This response is fostered by the play of the seventh ray, which produces thoseinitial reactions to organised movement and ritual which, at the close of ourgreat world period, will demonstrate the response of our entire solar system tothe same basic seventh ray influence. What can now be seen in the organisationof a crystal, a jewel and a diamond, with their beauty of form and line andcolour, their radiance and geometrical perfection, will appear likewise throughthe medium of the universe as a whole. The Grand Geometrician of the universeworks through this [373] seventh ray, and thus sets His seal upon all form life,particularly in the mineral world. This the Masonic Fraternity has always known,and this concept it has perpetuated symbolically in the great world cathedrals,which embody the glory of the mineral world and are the sign of the work of theMaster Builder of the universe.When the great work is consummated we shall see the Temple of God, the solarsystem, organised objectively and subjectively; its courts and holy places willthen be accessible to the sons of men, who will work then without limitation,and will have free access to all parts of the building. Through the magic of theWord which will then have been recovered, all doors will fly open, and theconsciousness of man will respond to every divine manifestation. More of this Imay not here say, but the work of the Craft is symbolic of the ritualisticorganisation of the universe. Of this the mineral kingdom (with which the workis done, and through which the geometrical plan expresses itself) is at the sametime the symbol and the undertaking, the beginning and also the concreteexpression of divine purpose.Secondly, I referred earlier to the work of the seventh ray in connection withthe phenomena of electricity, through which the solar system is coordinated andvitalised. There is an aspect of electrical phenomena which produces cohesion,just as there is an aspect which produces light. This has not yet beenrecognised. It is stated in The Secret Doctrine of H.P.B., and in A Treatise onCosmic Fire , that the electricity of the solar system is threefold: there isfire by friction, solar fire, and electric fire—the fire of body, of soul and ofspirit. Fire by friction is coming to be somewhat understood by the scientistsof the world, and we are harnessing to our needs the fire which heats, whichgives light, and which produces motion. This is in the physical sense of thewords. One of [374] the imminent discoveries will be the integrating power ofelectricity as it produces the cohesion within all forms and sustains all formlife during the cycle of manifested existence. It produces also the comingtogether of atoms and of the organisms within forms, so constructing that whichis needed to express the life principle. Men today are investigating suchmatters as electro-therapeutics and studying the theory of the electrical natureof the human being. They are working rapidly towards this coming discovery, andmuch will be revealed along these lines during the next fifty years. Theprinciple of coordination about which men talk has reference, in the lastanalysis, to this concept, and the scientific basis of all meditation work isreally to be found in this basic truth. The bringing in of force and theoffering of a channel are all mystical ways of expressing a natural phenomenonas yet little understood, but which will eventually give the clue to the secondaspect of electricity. This will be released in fuller measure during theAquarian age, through the agency of the seventh ray. One of its earliest effectswill be the increase of the understanding of brotherhood and its reallyscientific basis.I referred to the fact that man must before long function as freely on theastral plane and through the astral consciousness as he now does on the physicalplane. We are today laying the emphasis upon the vital aspect of man; the natureof the life principle is under discussion, and the need for “vital” actioneverywhere emphasized. We talk of the necessity of increasing human vitality andthe vitality of animals and plants; the quality of the vitality-producingfactors—food, sun and the coloured rays so widely used now—is creeping slowlyinto all medical thought, whilst even the advertisers of the tinned goods of ourmodern civilisation lay the emphasis upon the quota of vitamins. This,esoterically [375] speaking, is due to the shift of human consciousness on toetheric levels. Paralleling the growth of modern knowledge as to the “soul asintellect”, we find a growth of understanding as to “the soul as life”, thoughit remains as yet the great and apparently insoluble mystery.There are two happenings of close and imminent occurrence. Today the bulk ofhuman beings are polarised on the lower levels of the astral plane, but areconscious in the physical body. This distinction must be studied. Soon, manywill be conscious in the vital body and beginning to be conscious on the higherlevels of the astral plane, and some few upon the mental plane. But largenumbers of people today are ready to be fully conscious in the astral body andpolarised either on the mental plane entirely or centred in the soul. Thisproduces the wonder and the difficulty of the present time.Through the scientific ritual of meditation (for that is what it really is) thisrefocussing can be brought more rapidly about. Through the scientific culture ofthe ritual of service it can be still further developed. The ritual of the solarsystem is the result of the meditation of God and the act of divine service,carried on throughout the entire period of manifestation. The subordination ofthe lower life to the ritual of service is literally the tuning-in of theindividual to the rhythm of the life, heart and mind of God Himself. From thattuning-in, automatically a spiritual development follows.c. THE FUNCTIONING RAY LAWSThere are certain great laws, connected with the seven rays, that are effectivein determining the lines of demarcation, the cleavages which produce separationand the differentiations of the manifested life of God into... [376]1. The septenary constitution of the solar system.2. The ten schemes which indicate solar achievement.3. The inner constitution, or so-called “chains”, which distinguish eachplanetary existence.4. The planetary constitution of our Earth into the various kingdoms of nature.5. The basic distinctions between the kingdoms; these produce the types,groupings, families, branches, empires and nations.These Laws of Cleavage are too difficult for general comprehension. They governform life, and are the result of the united working, or rather the simultaneousmanifestation, of the three laws dealt with in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire . Theseare:1. The Law of Synthesis, determining the future, certifying the goal, andconcerned with the life or spirit aspect.2. The Law of Attraction, determining the present, and governing the immediatecondition of the planetary types. It is concerned with the consciousness or thesoul aspect.3. The Law of Economy. This law determines the past, conditions the planetaryconsciousness, and concerns itself with the form or matter aspect.When these three function together, during this particular cycle and in ourparticular race, they produce a fusion of forces which imposes a certain rhythm,a definite materialisation of energies, and a specific type of civilisationwhich functions under what we (esoterically) call the Laws of Cleavage. It isthe mind which separates and divides; it is mental activity (divine andsuperhuman, as well as human) which produces the many differentiations. Thisprocess of divisioning comes to its climax during this world period in the Aryan[377] race, the fifth race. We are today governed by the Law of Cleavages,—adivine law and one of fruitful objective. This must not be forgotten.The activity of the three divine aspects, in relation to the human family in thefirst nebulous race (of which science knows nothing), produced what we call theLaw of Immersion. It caused that growing diversification of matter, clothing thelife, which ultimately produced the early manifestation of the incarnating sonsof God. It is not a physical incarnation in the sense that we understand thatterm.In the next race, of which again man knows little, the fusion of the threedivine energies produced a second law. It should be remembered that a law is butthe effect of the continued intelligent activity of the Life aspect as it worksin conjunction with matter. This second law is called (by those of us who dealwith law and energy) the Law of Capitulation, because the momentum set up by thedesire of the sons of God to incarnate proved too strong for the opposing forcesof matter. Nothing then could stop the coming into tangible existence of theincarnating spirits. Matter capitulated to spirit, the divine desire and thedivine will set their signature upon the rapidly assembling forms. It must beborne in mind that these laws are called by names which indicate their relationto humanity. When active in the other kingdoms of nature their influence isdifferent, and they are called by other nomenclatures.In the next race, the Lemurian, the triple activity of the divine essentialattributes demonstrated as the Law of Materialisation, or (as it is sometimescalled) the Law of Hidden Radiance. This law concerns the Light which is in man,and the covering of that Light, in time and space, in order to produce itsintensification and its consequent and subsequent [378] radiation, so that,through humanity, light may eventually reach all forms of divine expression.Through man’s achievement, and through the conquest of darkness by light, thelight of consciousness in all forms must be brought to a condition of a “shiningglory which will irradiate the planet, and shine forth into the world of planetsas a testimony to the glory of...”The fourth law controlling human destiny is known by the curious name of the Lawof the Tides. It concerns the life of desire and of sensory perception and offeeling. It is closely concerned with the development of awareness, and is anaspect of the Law of Cycles which controls solar evolution. It is a basic humanlaw, protective and developing. It controls the cyclic or “tidal” life of allsouls who are carried by the great river of life—on the crest of desire—intoincarnation, and is one of the laws with which the aspirant must work, early inhis training. Until he can function as a soul, independent of the cyclic turmoilof terrestrial life, and free from the control of the tides of his emotionalexistence, he cannot take initiation. It was the inability to do this whichbrought on Earth the great Atlantean floods which brought that ancientcivilisation to an end.We come now to a consideration of the Law of Cleavages, for our race iscontrolled by the great heresy of separativeness. Through these cleavages(symbolically speaking) the fires of destruction may emerge and end ourcivilisation, as the Atlantean civilisation was ended, unless the conscious sonsof God can build those bridges and develop that understanding which will offsetthis law, thus bringing into functioning activity the law which governs thecoming race. The work that the disciples of the world must seek to do isanalogous to that which they as individuals have to do in their [379] ownprivate development: build the antahkarana, which will bridge the gap betweenthe human consciousness and the spiritual, and make the race eventually asintuitional as it is, today, intellectual.The law of the coming race is most difficult to express in understandable terms.I can find no better name for it—so as to express adequately its functionaleffect—than the words, the Law of Loving Understanding. This is a quiteinadequate and sentimental phrase for a scientific expression of a great comingevolutionary development in the human consciousness. But until that developmentis an accomplished fact, we have no means whereby to express the truesignificance of the underlying idea. The above must suffice.Let us now enumerate these laws in sequence, so as to gain a better idea oftheir relation and interrelationship:1. The Law of Immersion first race. 2. The Law of Capitulation second race. 3.The Law of Materialisation Lemurian race. The Law of Hidden Radiance. 4. The Lawof the Tides Atlantean race. 5. The Law of Cleavages Aryan race. 6. The Law ofLoving Understanding next race.By a right understanding of these laws we can gain an insight into the presentworld situation as far as the nations are concerned, and can grasp moreintelligently the ray influence which, in conjunction with these laws, hasbrought about the various typical national units.6. THE NATIONS AND THE RAYSIn connection, therefore, with our discussion of the rays which govern andinfluence the leading nations of the world, the student should bear in mind thefact that all are today governed primarily by the Law of Cleavages, but thatadvanced [380] groups in each nation are beginning to respond to the Law ofUnderstanding,—a law which will eventually emphasize the eternal brotherhood ofman and the identity of all souls with the Oversoul, in the racialconsciousness, as well as the oneness of the Life which pours through,permeates, animates and integrates the entire solar system. This Life functionstherefore in and through all the planetary schemes, with their kingdoms offorms, and with all that can be included (throughout our solar universe) underthe phrase “form life”. That phrase itself contains three great and basic ideas:the ideas of life, of matter and of evolution.The functioning of the Law of Loving Understanding will be much facilitated andspeeded up during the Aquarian age, and it will eventuate later in thedevelopment of the international spirit, in the recognition of one world faithin God and in humanity as the major expression of divinity in this world period,and in the transfer of the human consciousness from the world of material thingsto that of the more purely psychic, leading in time to the spiritual. It shouldbe remembered that (for advanced humanity) time sequence of the recognition ofthese expansions of consciousness is as follows:1. The world of psychical living. This requires the recognition, by the brainconsciousness of the aspirant, of the need for mental and spiritual control as afirst step.2. The world of mental unfoldment and control.3. The world of the soul or ego.When these three recognitions are stabilised in the aspirant, then there comesthe recognition by the disciple of...4. The control of the physical plane life by the soul.5. The interpretative faculty of the illumined mind. [381]6. The functioning and utilisation of the psychic powers, and their place andpart in the field of intelligent service.7. An inspired creative life on the physical plane.But in the development of the racial consciousness, the process does not followthe above stages and sequence. This is owing to the stimulation and consequentsensitising of the form aspect through the increased radiation and potency ofthe dynamic New Group of World Servers, whose ranks are filled by those who havepassed, or are passing, through the stages of aspirant and disciple, thuslearning to serve. Psychic unfoldment in the masses parallels the spiritualunfoldment of advanced humanity. This can be seen going on today on a largescale everywhere, and it accounts for the tremendous growth of thespiritualistic movement, and for the enormous increase in the lower psychicpowers. Old Atlantean magic and the lower psychism are upon us again in thegreat turning of the wheel of life, but this time good may eventuate, if theworld disciples and spiritually focussed people measure up to their opportunity.Today there are many hundreds (and in America, many thousands) coming under theinfluence of this Law of Loving Understanding. Many in every nation areresponding to the broader synthetic brotherly note, but the masses as yetunderstand nothing of this. They must be led in right ways gradually, by thesteady development in right understanding by their own nationals. Bear this inmind, all of you who work for world peace and right relations, for harmony andfor synthesis.a. THE MAJOR NATIONS AND THEIR RAYSAll of the great nations are controlled by two rays, just as is the human being.With the smaller nations we shall not [382] concern ourselves. All nations arecontrolled by a personality ray (if so we can call it), which is dominant andpotent and the main controlling factor at this time, and by a soul ray which issensed only by the disciples and aspirants of any nation. This soul ray must beevoked into an increased functioning activity by the New Group of World Servers,for this is one of their main objectives and tasks. This must never be lost tosight. Much could be written about the historical influence of the rays duringthe past two thousand years, and of the way in which great events have beeninfluenced or brought about by the periodic ray influence. But for this I haveneither the time nor the inclination. Interesting as it is, and indicative ofthe present national trends and problems, all that I can now do is to point outthe rays governing each nation, and leave you to study and note their effect atyour leisure, and to comprehend their relation to the present condition of theworld. One thing I would point out, and that is that those rays which govern aparticular nation, and which are at this time in incarnation, are very potent,either materially or egoically, whilst some of the problems may be due to thefact that certain rays, governing certain nations, are at this time out ofincarnation.Nation Personality Ray Egoic Ray Motto India 4th ray of art 1st ray ofgovernment. “I hide the Light.” China 3rd ray of intellect 1st ray ofgovernment. “I indicate the Way.” Germany 1st ray of power 4th ray of art.. “Ipreserve.” France 3rd ray of intellect 5th ray of knowledge. “I release theLight.” Great Britain 1st ray of power or government 2nd ray of love. “I serve.”Italy 4th ray of art 6th ray of idealism. “I carve the Paths.” U.S.A 6th ray ofidealism 2nd ray of love. “I light the Way.” Russia 6th ray of idealism 7th rayof magic and order “I link two Ways.” Austria 5th ray of knowledge 4th ray ofart “I serve the Lighted Way.” Spain 7th ray of order 6th ray of idealism “Idisperse the clouds.” Brazil 2nd ray of love 4th ray of art. “I hide the seed.”[383] A close analysis of the above will indicate certain lines of racialunderstanding. There is a natural rapport indicated between the modern andpresent personality rays of Germany and Great Britain, and yet a relationshipcan be seen between France and Great Britain through their esoteric nationalmottoes and also between the two symbols which are esoterically theirs. Thesymbol for France is the fleur de lys , which she adopted centuries ago underdivine guidance, which symbol stands for the three divine aspects inmanifestation. The emphasis is upon the third aspect, producing intelligentmanifestation. The symbol of Great Britain, under the same divine apportioning,is the three feathers, carried as the arms of the Prince of Wales. Thescintillating and brilliant French intellect, with its scientific bent, isaccounted for by the interplay of the third Ray of Active Intelligence with thefifth Ray of Scientific Understanding. Hence their amazing contribution to theknowledge and thought of the world, and their brilliant and colourful history.Be it remembered also that the glory of the empire which was France is but theguarantee of a glory of divine revelation which lies ahead in the future, butwhich will never be theirs till they cease living in the wonder of their pastand go forth into the [384] future to demonstrate the fact of illumination,which is the goal of all mental effort. When the intellect of the French isturned towards the discovery and the elucidation of the things of the spirit,then they will carry revelation to the world. When their egoic ray dominates thethird ray, and when the separative action of the fifth ray is transmuted intothe revealing function of this ray, then France will enter into a period of newglory. Her empire will then be of the mind, and her glory of the soul.It is obvious that the governing faculty is strongly the outstandingcharacteristic of Great Britain. England is an exponent of the art of control,and her function has been, as you may realise, to produce the first tentativegrouping of federated nations, and to demonstrate the possibility of suchgrouping. The United States of America are doing a somewhat similar thing, andare fusing the nationals of many nations into one federated state with manysubsidiary states, instead of subsidiary nations. These two powers function inthis way and with this wide objective in order to give to the planet,eventually, a system of groupings within one national border or one empire, andyet with an international boundary which will be symbolic of the coming new agetechnique in government. The second Ray of Love or Attraction governs,egoically, the British Empire, and there is a relation between this fact and thefact that the sign Gemini governs both the United States and London. The fluid,mercurial, intuitional mind is closely allied with the divine aspect of love andunderstanding, producing attraction and interpretation.It is interesting to note that the fourth Ray of Harmony or Art, which willbegin before long to come into power again in its major aspect, is to be foundprominent in the destinies of India, Germany, Italy, Austria and Brazil, and itis for this that there is so much preparatory turmoil in the [385] threeEuropean countries. The sixth ray is potent in Russia, the United States, Italyand Spain. It is the fanatical adherence to an ideal which is responsible alsofor the potent changes in these four countries; in Germany and Italy, as we haveseen, the harmonising power of the fourth ray is also seen. Hence we have in allthese countries a process of breaking down, and of destruction of old forms,prior to an adequate responsiveness to the influence of the incoming ray. Itshould be remembered that as with individuals, so with nations,—the reaction toan increasing influence of the egoic ray is ever accompanied by a breaking downperiod, but this demonstration of destruction is but temporary and preparatory.India hides the light, and that light, when released upon the world and revealedto humanity, will bring about harmony in the form aspect, for things will beclearly seen as they are and freed from glamour and illusion; this harmonisinglight is sorely needed in India itself, and when it has been manifested it willbring about the right functioning of the first Ray of Power or Government. Thewill of the people will be seen in the light. It is in this connection thatGreat Britain emerges into renewed activity, for her personality ray and India’segoic ray are the same. Many British people are subjectively linked with India,by past incarnations and association, and the quarrel between Great Britain andIndia is largely a family affair in the deeper sense of the term, and hence itsbitterness—the bitterness of an elder brother who sees the younger usurping hisprerogatives. Today many British administrators are finding their way back totheir own home land, little as they may realise it, there to work out that whichthey initiated in other lives and bodies. As you may know, there is a close linkbetween the fourth and the second rays, and this again emerges in therelationship between [386] England and India, and a destiny is there which mustbe jointly worked out.The static stabilising tendency of Germany showing, for instance, in her futileeffort to preserve a purity of race now impossible, is due to her first raypersonality, whilst her fourth ray egoic force is responsible for her effort tostandardise and harmonise all the elements within her borders, to the exclusion,however, of the Hebrew race. With the problem of the Jew I will deal later.Germany cannot help herself, for though the first ray is not in manifestation aswe understand the term, yet the bulk of the egos now in power in Germany are onthe first subray of the seven different rays, and hence they are from onedominant angle the transmitters of first ray force. A hint is here given. It isfor this reason therefore that Great Britain can contact the German race andhandle the German psychology more understandingly than can Russia, Italy orFrance. They share similar qualities, and one of the services therefore thatEngland can render at this time is to come to the aid of world peace, and solive up to the motto, “I serve,” by acting as a mediator.A careful analysis of the idealism of Russia and of the United States may revealno resemblances in the goal of their idealism, for the Russian is driven by hisseventh ray soul towards the imposition of an enforced ceremonial of orderedrhythms, leading to an idealised order and community of interests. Because ofthis, and because of the enforced magical work, some forces are present andactive in Russia which need most careful handling by the Brotherhood of Light;they are not exactly on the white side, as it is called, but are concerned withthe magic of form, whereas pure white magic concerns only the soul or subjectiveaspect. The black forces, so called, are nowhere rampant in Russia any more thanelsewhere in the world, but the Russian reaction and attitude to [387] enforcedrule and order has in it more of the magical seventh ray influence than is thecase in other countries, such as Germany, which also enforces a standardisedorder and rule of life.You will note that of the major nations only Brazil, Great Britain and theUnited States of America are definitely under the influence of the second ray.An interesting fact emerges as we consider this grouping. Great Britain is thecustodian of the wisdom aspect of the second ray force for the Aryan race, socalled. The United States fulfills the same office for the sixth or comingsubrace, which is the germ race for the future sixth great race, whilst Brazilwill function as the leading division of the great sixth race. These three racesembody the attractive cohesive aspect of the second ray, and will demonstrate itthrough wisdom and wise government, based on idealism and love. The UnitedStates will therefore represent a fusion of races, with the Anglo-Saxon elementdominating. Brazil will later represent the best of that which the Latin raceshave eventually to give. This presented fusion will be considered from the angleof the ray types and the basic unfolding principles, and not from the angle ofculture and civilisation.Great Britain therefore represents the aspect of mind which expresses itself inintelligent government, based eventually on just loving understanding. This, Isay, is the ideal before her, but not the fulfilled achievement. The UnitedStates represents the intuitive faculty, expressing itself as illumination andthe power to fuse and blend. Brazil (or rather what that country will then becalled, for the time of this expression lies thousands of years ahead) willrepresent a linking interpreting civilisation, based on the unfoldment of theabstract consciousness, which is a blend of the intellect and the intuition, andwhich reveals the wisdom aspect of love in its [388] beauty. But the period ofthe development of this great civilisation lies too far ahead to makespeculation possible.It is too dangerous for me, in these days of upset and of difficulty, to expressmyself more definitely as to the future lines of unfoldment. The destiny andfuture functioning of the nations lie hid in the present activity. The readersof this treatise are, in the majority of cases, far too nationalistic in theirviewpoint, and too deeply engrossed with the prime importance of their ownnation and of its supreme significance, for me to be able to do more thangeneralise and to indicate the major lines of progress. The role of the prophetis too dangerous, for destiny lies in the hands of the peoples, and no one knowsexactly what way they will take to reach their goal. The inevitability of thatgoal is assured, as is the ultimate achieving of it, but the incidents of travelcannot be revealed, but lie hid in the racial karma. The time has not yet comewhen the majority of the people of any race can see the picture as a whole andbe permitted to know the part their particular nation must play in the historyof nations. Every nation, without exception (and this is a platitude which it isseldom fruitful to repeat), has its peculiar virtues and vices. These aredependent upon:1. The point in evolution.2. The measure of the control of the personality ray.3. The emerging control of the egoic ray.4. The polarisation of the nation.It is useful to bear in mind, when considering the nations that some arenegative and feminine and some positive and masculine. India, France, the UnitedStates of America, Russia and Brazil are all feminine, and constitute thenurturing mother aspect. They are feminine in their psychology,—intuitive,mystical, sensitive, alluring, beautiful, fond of display [389] and colour, andwith the faults of the feminine aspect, such as the laying of too much emphasisupon the material aspect of life, upon pageantry, upon possessions, and uponmoney as a symbol of that which connotes the form side. They mother and nurturecivilisation and ideas.China, Germany, Great Britain and Italy are masculine and positive; they aremental, political, governing, standardising, group-conscious, occult,aggressive, full of grandeur, interested in law and in laying the emphasis uponrace and empire. But they are more inclusive and think in wider terms than thefeminine aspects of divine manifestation. The reader would find it useful toconsult an earlier tabulation which I gave (see Pages 382-383), and consider thehigher and lower expressions of the rays, noting how they work out in relationto the rays personal and egoic of the different nations. Take for instance theemergence into manifestation of the egoic ray of the German nation. Its lowerexpression is that of architectural construction, and can be seen at this timemaking its presence felt in the new and modern style in building. Its higherexpression is not yet to be noted, but Germany some day will give out to theworld a sound form of hierarchical government. It is interesting to note thatthe higher expression of the egoic ray of France (the fifth) is already beingevidenced. The scientific interest shown in psychism and psychology is areaction to that ray of influence, and though it is as yet only indicated, theguarantee of the future is contained therein. The sixth ray influence governingthe personality or form aspect of the United States of America is abundantlyevidenced in its diversified religions and in the national aptitude foridealistic organisation; the second ray, the egoic ray, is also making itspresence felt, and we have the consequent interest shown in the phenomena andtruth of the reality of initiation.[390] The analysis of the ray characteristics given earlier can be applied tothe nations and countries of the world also, and it will therefore be seen howthe many septenates of nature, having their roots in the primary septenate ofrays, can be dealt with under the Law of Correspondences with amazinglyinteresting results.Intuitional relations and the major intellectual cleavages are based on thegoverning ray influences. Spain, Austria and France, being governed by theseventh, fifth and third rays, have a close interrelation, and this worked outmost interestingly in the Middle Ages when the destinies of these three nationsseemed closely to interlink. The newly forming country of the United States islikewise esoterically and intimately associated, in its form aspect, withBrazil, Russia and Italy, and hence the early influx of Russians and Italiansinto America, and hence also the pull of the South American countries upon theAmerican consciousness and the growth of the ideal of Pan-America.These relations are all on the form side and emerge out of the personality rays.Many such relations will appear if the countries and their rays are subjected toa careful scrutiny. The ray of attraction or inclusiveness (Ray II), the ray ofelectrical phenomena (Ray III), and the fifth ray of intellect are potentiallyvery active at this time, as they are all in incarnation, and the incomingseventh ray is slowly and surely—in spite of appearances—imposing order andhierarchical control upon the planet. It must be remembered that all naturalprocesses are rightly slow in their tempo, or the effects would be toodestructive. The effect of these influences is felt in the following sequentialorder:1. The sensing of an ideal.2. The formulation of a theory. [391]3. The growth of public opinion.4. The imposition of a growing “pattern” upon the evolving life.5. The production of a form based upon that pattern.6. The stabilised functioning of the life within the form.It must be remembered that each ray embodies an idea which can be sensed as anideal. The rays in time produce the world patterns which mould the planetaryforms, and thus produce the inner potency of the evolutionary processes. Thispattern-forming tendency is being recognised today by modern psychology inconnection with the individual human being, and his emotional and thoughtpatterns are being delineated and charted. As with the microcosm, so with themacrocosm. Every ray produces three major patterns which are imposed upon thematter aspect, whether it be that of a man, a nation or a planet. These threepatterns are:1. The emotional pattern. This embodies the aspiration of the man, the nation orthe planetary life, and is the sum total of the desire tendency.2. The mental pattern. This emerges later in time and governs the thoughtprocesses of the man, the nation and the planet. It eventually becomes thecontrolling factor of the personality or form life. The emotional and mentalpatterns are the negative and positive aspect of the personality ray.3. The soul pattern. This is the predisposing goal, the ring-pass-not or destinywhich the immortal principle, the solar angel, succeeds eventually and muchlater in time in imposing upon the form life. This soul pattern finallysupersedes and obliterates the two earlier pattern-producing processes.I have here again indicated fruitful lines of study through [392] which thereader may arrive at some intelligent comprehension of what is transpiring inthe life of the nations in the world today.If, for instance, the fifth ray of the solar angels, the ray of mind, which isthe egoic ray of the French nation, can make its potency felt through the stressand toil of the present world condition, then to France may be given theultimate glory of proving to the world the fact of the soul and thedemonstration of the technique of egoic control. The soul pattern may betranslated by the genius of the French intellect into terms which humanity canunderstand and the true soul psychology may come into being. Again, the geniusof Germany has often in the past manifested along the line of its fourth raysoul, and through that soul pattern has been given to the world much of theoutstanding music and philosophies. When this is again manifested, and the soulpattern is more strongly impressed upon the German consciousness, we shall beginto comprehend the significance of the superman. Germany has caught a vision ofthis ideal. It is as yet misinterpreting it, but Germany can give us the patternof the superman, and this is its ultimate destiny.If England’s ideal of justice (which is the pattern of its personality ray) canbe transformed and transmuted by her egoic ray of love into just and intelligentworld service, she may give to the world the pattern of that true governmentwhich is the genius or the latent soul quality of the British. If the idealismof the United States of America, which is today its personality expression andevidenced by the loudly enunciated idea of the biggest and the best, can beillumined by the law of love, then the pattern which underlies the structure ofthe States may be seen in lines of light, and we shall have the pattern forfuture racial light in contradistinction to the many separative national lines.Thus the underlying [393] patterns for all the nations can be seen and workedout by the intelligent reader. It could be noted also that the emotional patternof the United States at this time is expressed in terms of sentiment and ofpersonal desire. It is capable of being translated in terms of true benevolence.The mental pattern for the States is to be seen as mass information through theschools, the radio and the newspapers. Later this can be transmuted intointuitive perception. The soul pattern in the States today works out through theacquisitiveness of the nation and its love of possessions which it attracts toitself through the misuse of the law of love. The eventual expression of thiswill be the changing of the attitude which loves the material into that whichloves the real, and the acquisition of the things of the spirit instead of thoseof the form.b. THE JEWISH PROBLEMIn connection with the nations and the rays I want now to indicate to youcertain fundamental conditions which partially account for the (so-called)Jewish problem,—a problem which has existed for centuries, and which is, at thistime, causing the deepest possible concern to many, including members of theplanetary Hierarchy. If this problem can be solved, it will be one of the potentfactors in the restoration of world understanding and harmony. It cannot besolved without the cooperation of the men of good will throughout the world.There is little that I can say anent this matter that can be checked and proved,for the clue to the problem is to be found back in the very night of time and,literally, when the sun was in the constellation Gemini. At that time the twopillars were set up which, as all Masons know, are two great landmarks inMasonry. Hence the Jewish colouring of all the Masonic work, though it is notJewish [394] in the sense that that word conveys today. Who, therefore, if thefacts are of such ancient import, shall say that I speak with accuracy, orestablish the right or wrong nature of my conclusions? I but present the factsas I know them from my access to records more ancient than any known to man.The personality ray, the material form ray of the Jewish people, is the thirdray. Their egoic ray is the first. Their astrological sign is Capricorn, withVirgo rising. Mercury and Virgo play a prominent part in their destiny. Theseclues should suffice to give to the advanced student and astrologer thosesalient points which will give him light upon their strange history. Because ofthis third ray influence, you have the tendency of the Jew to manipulate forcesand energies, and to “pull strings” in order to bring about desired ends. As arace, they are natural law makers, and hence their tendency to dominate andgovern, because their egoic ray is the first. Hence also the constant appearanceof the goat in their history, and their teaching about the virgin mother whoshould give birth to the Messiah.In every grouping,—whether in heaven or on earth—there is always evidenced atendency by some units in the group to revolt, to rebel and to show some form ofinitiative different to that of the other units in the same grouping. When oursolar universe came into being, we are told in the allegorical language of theancient scriptures, there “was war in Heaven”; “the sun and his seven brothers”did not function with true unanimity; hence (and herein lies a hint) our Earthis not one of the seven sacred planets. There is, as we know, the ancient legendof the lost Pleiade, and there are many such stories. Again, in the councilchamber of the Most High, there has not always been peace and understanding, butat times, war and disruption; this is made abundantly clear by several of thestories in the Old Testament. Symbolically [395] speaking, some of the sons ofGod fell from their high estate, led, at one time, by “Lucifer, Son of theMorning”. This “fall of the angels” was a tremendous event in the history of ourplanet, but was nevertheless only a passing and interesting phenomenon in thehistory of the solar system, and a trifling incident in the affairs of the sevenconstellations, of which our solar system is but one. Pause and consider thisstatement for a moment, and so readjust your sense of values. The standard ofhappenings varies in importance according to the angle of vision, and what (fromthe angle of our Earth’s unfoldment in consciousness) may be a factor of primeimportance and of determining value may (from the angle of the universe) be oftrifling moment. The affairs of an individual are, to him, of momentous import;to humanity, as a whole, they are of small concern. It all depends upon whichunit holds the centre of the stage in the drama of life, and around whichcentral factor the happenings, trivial or important, pursue their cyclic way.Within the radius of power and life which is the expression of the fourthkingdom in nature, the human, there was to be found a correspondence to that“assumption of independence” and to that “breaking away” which characterised themajor grouping. Back in later Lemurian times, a group of men of highdevelopment, from the point of view of that time, and numbered among the thendisciples of the world, took issue with the planetary Hierarchy, and broke awayfrom the “law of the initiates”. It was a time wherein the emphasis of theteaching was upon the material side of life, and where the focus of attentionwas upon the physical nature and its control. The Old Commentary expresses whathappened in the following terms, and as you read the measured cadences of thatancient script, it would be wise to try and realise that the phrases arereferring to that group of [396] disciples who were the early founders of thepresent Jewish race:“The law went forth from the inner group which guided the destinies of men:Detach yourselves. Withdraw within yourselves the power to hold and gain andget. The sons of God, who train themselves to leave the world of men and enterinto light, they ever travel free. They hold not what they have. Releaseyourselves, and enter through the gates of peace.“Some of the sons of God, waiting outside those gates, ready to enter when theWord went forth to roll the gates aside, were laden with the treasure of theearth. They brought their gifts as offerings to the Lord of life, who needed nottheir gifts. They sought to enter through those gates, not with a selfish end inview, but to present the garnered treasures of the world, and thus shew theirlove.“Again the Word went forth: Leave all behind and pass beyond the portal, ladenwith naught of earth. They waited and discussed. The rest of those who wereprepared entered into light and passed between the pillars of the gate; theyleft behind the loads they brought and entered free, and were accepted, carryingnaught.“Because they travelled as a group, and as a group progressed and grasped, thegroup responded to the divine command and halted. There they waited, standingbefore the portal of the Path, grasping the garnered treasures of a thousandcycles. Naught did they wish to leave behind. They had laboured for the richeswhich they held. They loved their God, and Him they sought to dower with thefullest measure of the riches they had gained. They loved not discipline.“Again the Word went forth: Drop on the ground all that you hold, and enterfree.“But three revolted from that stern command. The rest obeyed. They passed withinthe gates, leaving the three outside. Many were raised unto the heights of joy.The three remained without the gates, holding their treasure firm.”In this ancient writing, older than any of the written scriptures of the world,is to be found the secret of the Masonic story and of the slaying of the Masterby the three most [397] closely associated with Him in His death and burial.Masons will all recognise the three to whom I here refer. These three were thefounders of the modern Jewish race. They were three advanced disciples whoresented the command to enter, free and untrammelled, the place where light isto be found. They sought to hold that which they had gathered and to dedicate itto the service of God. Their unrecognised motive was love of riches and a desireto hold safe their gains. Ancient tradition, as taught by the teachers of thepast, tells us that...“They turned their faces towards the gates of earth. Their friends went on.....They stayed behind..... The Masters met in conclave and decided what should bethe fate of those who, having reached the Gates of Light, loved the possessionsof the world more than they loved the service of the light. Again the Word wentforth to the revolting three, who waited still without the gates:“‘Hold what you have and gather more, but know no peace. Garner the fruits ofmind, and seek your power in wide possessions, but have no sure abiding place.“‘Within yourselves, because you are disciples of the Lord, you shall have noshare in peace, no sure and certain knowledge of success, nor power to hold yourgains.“‘Always shall there be the knowledge dim of Him Who watches over all. Alwaysthe urge to gather and amass. Never the time to hold and to enjoy. Pass ontherefore until the time shall come, and again you stand before the Gates ofLight, this time with empty hands. Then enter, free, accepted by the Servants ofthe Lord, and know, forever, peace.’”The ancient legend tells us that the three went forth in sorrow and revolt,laden with their treasures, and thus the history of the wandering Jew began. Itis significant to remember that one of the greatest sons of God Who has workedon earth, and Who epitomised in Himself the way and the achievement, Jesus ofNazareth, was a Jew. He reversed all the earlier conditions. He possessednothing at [398] all. He was the first of our humanity to achieve, and was adirect descendant of the eldest of the original three disciples who revoltedfrom the drama of detachment . The Jew embodies in himself the world prodigalson. He is the symbol of the disciple who has not yet learned the lesson of ajust sense of values. He has been the victim of the Law of Light and of hisinability to comply with that Law. He sinned wilfully and with his eyes wideopen to results. Hence he knows the law as no other race knows it, for he iseternally its victim. He has enunciated the law from its negative angle; the Lawof Moses today rules most of the world, and yet fails to bring into life justiceand true legality.The other group of disciples, the representatives (in their day and age) of therace, passed through the ancient portals of initiation and took the first greatstep. They came back with a latent and dim recollection of the episode whichseparated them from three of their co-disciples. On their return to life onearth, they spoke of this event. This was their error; the long antagonismstarted, which persists until today. Those particular disciples have themselvespassed through their long pilgrimage and have entered into eternal peace, butthe results of their early betrayal of the hidden events of initiation stillpersist.Curiously enough, this ancient race, founded by the three who loved that whichthey had to offer more than that which they longed to take, were the originatorsof the Masonic tradition. Their history (and incidentally the history ofhumanity) is embodied in that dramatic ritual. The reward for theirsincerity,—for they revolted in utter sincerity, believing they knew best—wasthe permission to enact each year, on the return of the day when they might haveentered into light, the story of the search for light. Because they had been so[399] nearly resurrected from the death of earth into the life of light, thegreat tradition of the mysteries was started by them. They chose death and slewthat which “had lived and which could have claimed reward”, and which could havespoken the word of power which would have caused the gates of resurrection toopen wide.We are told that these three swore an everlasting vow to stand together andnever to desert each other. This vow down the ages they have kept; it hasconsequently produced that racial separativeness and community of interestswhich arouses the antagonism of other races.Down the ages, the Jew has been wandering, producing much of beauty in theworld, and giving to humanity many of its greatest men, but he has (at the sametime) been hated and persecuted, betrayed and hounded. He embodies, in himself,symbolically, the history of humanity. The ancient tendency of the Jews to graspand hold, and also to preserve their racial and national integrity, are theiroutstanding characteristics. They cannot be absorbed, and yet so ancient is therace that nevertheless today no nation in the world but has its roots in thatgroup which—in old Lemuria—had advanced so far that all its foremost peoplestood upon the path of discipleship. There are no racial strains in the Westernworld which are not offshoots of this oldest select people, with the exceptionof the Finns, Lapps and those nations which show definite mongoloid strains. Butthe admixture of what is now called Jewish blood is not found to the sameextent, and the modern Jew is as much a by-product as is the Anglo-Saxon race,only, through an imposed selective tendency and racial segregation, he haspreserved intact more of the original characteristics.It is the realisation of this common origin which has led [400] theBritish-Israelites into their travesty of the truth, and caused them to traceour modern Western history to the Jews of the Dispersion. It is a far moreancient relation than that, and dates back into a period that antedates thehistory of the Jews as it is related for us in the Old Testament. The originalthree disciples and their family groups were the ancestors of three major racialgroupings, which can be generalised as follows:1. The Semitic race or races of Biblical and modern times; the Arabs, theAfghans, the Moors and the offshoots and affiliations of those peoples,including the modern Egyptians. These are all descended from the eldest of thethree disciples.2. The Latin peoples and their various branches throughout the world, and alsothe Celtic races wherever found. These are descended from the second of thethree disciples.3. The Teutons, the Scandinavians, and the Anglo-Saxons, who are the descendantsof the third of the three disciples.The above is a broad generalisation. The period covered is so vast, and theramifications down the ages are so numerous, that it is not possible for me todo more than give a general idea. Gradually the descendants of two of thesethree disciples have accepted the legends which were promulgated in Atlanteantimes, and have ranged themselves on the side of those who are antagonistic tothe Jew, as he is today; they have lost all sense of their common origin. Thereis no pure race in the world today, for intermarriage, illicit relations andpromiscuity during the past few million years have been so numerous that thereexists no pure strain. Climate and environment [401] are fundamentally greaterdetermining factors than any forced segregation, except that which comes througha constant racial intermarriage. Of this latter factor, only the Hebrew todayhas preserved any measure of racial integrity.When humanity awakens to the fact of its common origin, and when the three greatmajor strains in our modern civilisation are recognised, then we shall see theold hatred of the Jew die out, and he will fuse and blend with the rest ofmankind. Even the oriental races, who are the remnants of the great Atlanteancivilisation, have in them traces of intermarriage with the ancestors of themodern Jews and other racial types, but they have not mixed well, and havetherefore preserved their characteristics more successfully than have the groupsof our Western men.If you ponder upon the above, and if you study the Masonic tradition with care,much will become clarified in your mind. Ethnologists may disagree, but theycannot disprove what I have said, for the origins of the present racial worldsituation lie so far back in the history of mankind that they cannot even provetheir own contentions. All they are capable of considering is the history of thepast one hundred thousand years, and their work lies with effects of that pastand not with originating causes.7. THE RAY OF THE EGOIn starting our study of the ray of the Ego or Soul, certain major premisesmight be briefly stated and incorporated into a series of propositions, fourteenin number. They are as follows:1. The egos of all human beings are to be found upon one or another of the sevenrays. [402]2. All egos found upon the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh raysmust eventually, after the third initiation, blend with the three major rays, ormonadic rays.3. The monadic ray of every ego is one of the three rays of aspect, and the sonsof men are either monads of power, monads of love, or monads of intelligence.4. For our specific purposes, we shall confine our attention to the seven groupsof souls found upon one or other of the seven rays or streams of divine energy.5. For the major part of our racial and life experience we are governedsequentially, and later simultaneously by:a. The physical body, which is dominated by the ray governing the sum total ofthe atoms of that body.b. The emotional desire nature, which is to be found influenced and controlledby the ray which colours the totality of astral atoms.c. The mind body or mental nature, and the calibre and quality of the raydetermining its atomic value.d. Later, on the physical plane, the soul ray begins to work in and with the sumtotal of the three bodies, which constitute—when aligned and functioning inunison—the personality. The effect of that general integration is actively toproduce an incarnation and incarnations wherein the personality ray emergesclearly, and the three bodies or selves constitute the three aspects or rays ofthe lower personal self.6. When the personality ray becomes pronounced and dominant, and the three bodyrays are subordinated to it, then the great fight takes place between the egoicray or soul and the personality ray. The differentiation becomes clearly marked,and the sense of duality becomes more definitely established. The experiencesdetailed in the Bhagavad Gita become the experiences [403] of the path ofdiscipleship; Arjuna stands “at the midway point” on the field of Kurukshetra,between the two opposing forces, and, owing to the smoke of the battle, findshimself unable to see clearly.7. Eventually, the soul ray or influence becomes the dominating factor, and therays of the lower bodies become the sub-rays of this controlling ray. This lastsentence is of basic importance, for it indicates the true relation of thepersonality to the ego or soul. The disciple who understands this relation andconforms to it is ready to tread the path of initiation.8. Each of the seven groups of souls is responsive to one of the seven types offorce, and all of them are responsive to the ray of the planetary Logos of ourplanet, which is the third Ray of Active Intelligence. All are therefore upon asub-ray of this ray, but it must never be forgotten that the planetary Logos isalso upon a ray, which is a sub-ray of the second Ray of Love-Wisdom. Thereforewe have: [404][Image00003.jpg]It should be remembered that our planetary Logos functioning through the planetEarth is not considered as producing one of the seven sacred planets.9. The work of each individual aspirant is therefore to arrive at anunderstanding of:a. His egoic ray.b. His personality ray.c. The ray governing his mind.d. That governing his astral body.e. The ray influencing his physical body.When he has achieved this fivefold knowledge, he has fulfilled the Delphicinjunction: “Know thyself.” and can consequently take Initiation.10. Every human being is also governed by certain group rays: [405]a. Those of the fourth kingdom in nature. This will have different effects,according to the ray of the personality or soul. The fourth kingdom has:1). The fourth ray as its egoic ray.2). The fifth ray as its personality ray.b. The racial rays, at this time, are the third and fifth, for our Aryan race,and this powerfully affects every human being.c. The cyclic ray.d. The national ray.All of these control the personality life of each man. The egoic ray of theindividual, plus the egoic ray of the fourth kingdom, gradually negate the raysgoverning the personality as the man nears the path of probation anddiscipleship.11. Man therefore is an aggregate of forces which dominate him serially andtogether; these colour his nature, produce his quality, and determine his“appearance”, using this word in its occult sense of exteriorisation . For ageshe is wielded by one or other of these forces, and is simply what they make him.As he arrives at a clearer understanding, and can begin to discriminate, hedefinitely chooses which of them shall dominate, until he eventually becomescontrolled by the Soul ray, with all the other rays subordinated to that ray andused by him at will.12. In studying the egoic ray of man we have to grasp:a. The process followed. ................. externalisation.b. The secret to be found. ............... manifestation.c. The purpose to be known. ........... realisation.We have also to understand the dominant ray influences of the kingdom of souls,the fifth kingdom. These are:1). Ray five........working through the personality. [406]2). Ray two........working through the intuition.13. The Personality ray finds its major field of activity and expression in thephysical body. It determines its life trend and purpose, its appearance andoccupation. It is selective of quality, when influenced by the egoic ray.The Egoic Ray has direct and specific action upon the astral body. Hence thebattlefield of the life is ever on the plane of illusions as the soul seeks todispel the ancient glamour, the aspirant is enabled to walk in the light.The Monadic Ray influences the mental body, after integration of the personalityhas been brought about. It causes the mind nature to achieve that clear visionwhich finds its consummation at the fourth initiation, and releases the man fromthe limitations of form. There is an analogy to this triplicity and aninteresting symbolic relation in the three Initiators.a. The first Initiator........................the soul of man.This controls gradually the personality.b. The second Initiator...................the Christ.Releasing the love nature.c. The final Initiator....................... the Planetary Logos.Illumining the mind.14. The egoic or soul ray begins to make its presence actively felt, via theastral body, as soon as alignment has been achieved. The process is as follows:a. It plays on the astral body externally.b. It stimulates it internally to greater size, colour and quality.c. It brings it and all parts of the physical life into activity and undercontrol.All the above propositions could be summed up in the statement that thepersonality ray induces a separative attitude and causes a detachment from thegroup of souls of [407] which the personality is an externalisation, and aconstituent attachment to the form side of manifestation. The egoic ray inducesgroup consciousness and detachment from external forms, causing attachment tothe life side of manifestation and to the subjective whole. The monadic ray hasan effect which can be understood only after man has taken the third initiation.We might divide what we have to say in the next section of our treatise, whichdeals with the egoic ray, into the four following parts:I.

The animal kingdom is to the human body what the dense physical body is tothe seven principles.2. The animal kingdom is the mother aspect, prior to the overshadowing of theHoly Ghost.3. The animal kingdom is the field of individualisation.4. Since Atlantean days the animal kingdom has been occupied with thedevelopment of karma.5. Domestic animals constitute the heart centre in the life of the Entity Whoensouls the animal kingdom.6. The animal kingdom does not react strongly to the 7th ray.7. The human kingdom does, but the 7th ray will have three effects in relationto the two kingdoms and their interplay:a. It will refine the animal bodies.b. It will bring about a closer relation between men and animals.c. It will cause a great destruction of the present animal forms.RAY METHODS OF ACTIVITYThese are twenty-one in number, making in their synthesis the twenty-two methodswhich are the expression of the great Law of Attraction.I.

Then from that point of sentient Life, let the Soul realise theconsciousness of God.

Let the point vibrating become the point quiescent, andall lines gather into One. Let the Soul realise the One in Many, and let theword go forth in perfect understanding: ‘I am the Worker and the Work, The Onethat Is :’”FOURTH RAY“Let the outer glory pass away and the beauty of the inner Light reveal the One.Let dissonance give place to harmony, and from the centre of the hidden Lightlet the soul speak, let the word roll forth: ‘Beauty and glory veil Me not. Istand revealed. I Am !’”FIFTH RAY“Let the three forms of energy electric pass upward to the Place of Power. Letthe forces of the head and heart and all the nether aspects blend. Then let theSoul look out upon the inner world of light divine. Let the word triumphant goforth: ‘I mastered energy for I am energy itself. The Master and the masteredare but One.’”SIXTH RAY“Let all desire cease. Let aspiration end. The search is over. Let the Soulrealise that it has reached the goal, and from that gateway to eternal Life andcosmic Peace let the word sound: ‘I am the seeker and the sought. I rest.’”SEVENTH RAY“Let the builders cease their work. The Temple is completed. Let the Soul enterinto its heritage and from the Holy Place command all work to end. Then in thesilence subsequent let him chant forth the word: ‘The creative work is over. I,the Creator, Am. Naught else remains but Me .’” [418]REFERENCES TO THE SECRET DOCTRINERay I . . . .

It might generally be stated that the three rays of aspect find theirmain expression in relation to mankind through the medium of the threeperiodical vehicles:Ray I Power Life Ideas The Monad. Ray II Love-Wisdom Consciousness Ideals TheSoul. Ray III Active Intelligence Appearance Idols The Personality.[422] They find their secondary expression in the three bodies which form thepersonality of man:Ray I Power Ideas Mental Body Purpose. Life. Ray II Love Ideals Astral BodyQuality. Ray III Intelligence Idols Physical Body Form.The rays of attribute, though expressing themselves equally on all the planes,and through the periodical vehicles and the three aspects of the personality,find their main expression through one or other of the four kingdoms in nature.Ray IV Harmony through Conflict 4th kingdom Human.The Balance. Ray V ConcreteKnowledge 3rd kingdom Animal. Ray VI Devotion 2nd kingdom Vegetable.

Results The evolutionary results are radiation and potency, astatic potency, underlying the rest of the natural scheme. Process Condensation.Secret Transmutation. A Treatise on Cosmic Fir e defines this as follows:“Transmutation is the passage across from one state of being to another throughthe agency of fire.” Purpose To demonstrate the radio-activity of life.Divisions Base metals, standard metals, precious stones. Objective Agency Fire.Fire is the initiating factor in this kingdom. Subjective Agency Sound. QualityExtreme density. Inertia. Brilliance.THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM [424]Influences The second Ray of Love-Wisdom, working out in a vastly increasedsensibility. The fourth Ray of Harmony and Beauty, working out in the generalharmonisation of this kingdom throughout the entire planet. The sixth Ray ofDevotion or (as it has been expressed symbolically in The Ancient Wisdom ) the“urge to consecrate the life to the Sun, the giver of that life,” or again, the“urge to turn the eye of the heart to the heart of the sun.” Results These workout in the second kingdom as magnetism, perfume, colour and growth towards thelight. These words I commend to you for your earnest study, for it is in thiskingdom that one first sees clearly the glory which lies ahead of humanity. a.Magnetic radiation. The blending of the mineral and vegetable goals. b. Theperfume of perfection. c. The glory of the human aura. The radiant augoeides. d.Aspiration which leads to final inspiration. Process Conformation, or the powerto “conform” to the pattern set in the heavens, and to produce below that whichis found above. This is done in this kingdom with greater pliability than in themineral kingdom, where the process of condensation goes blindly forward. SecretTransformation, those hidden alchemical processes which enable the vegetablegrowths in this kingdom to draw their sustenance from the sun and soil and“transform” it into form and colour. Purpose Magnetism. That inner source ofbeauty, loveliness, and attractive power which lures to it the higher forms toconsume it for food, and the thinking entities to draw from it inspiration,comfort and satisfaction of a mental kind. Divisions Trees and shrubs. Theflowering plants. The grasses and lesser green things which do not come underthe other two categories. A group of vegetable growths which are found under thegeneral heading of “sea growths”. Objective Agency Water. Subjective AgencyTouch. Quality Rajas or activity.MEDITATION AND THE KINGDOMS[425] “One-pointed meditation upon the five forms which every element takesproduces mastery over every element. These five forms are the gross nature, theelemental form, the quality, the pervasiveness and the basic purpose.”You have, therefore, an analogy for consideration:1. The gross nature the mineral kingdom. 2. The elemental form the vegetablekingdom. 3. The quality the animal kingdom. 4. The pervasiveness the humankingdom. 5. The basic purpose the kingdom of souls.All of this is from the standpoint of consciousness.ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP1. The body mineral kingdom the dense prison of life 2. The akasha vegetablekingdom the fluid conscious life 3. Ascension out of matter animal kingdom theevolutionary goal of the relation between body and akasha 4. Power to travel inspace human kingdom the goal of the human consciousness through the realisationof the above three.THE ANIMAL KINGDOMInfluences ...The third Ray of Active Intelligence or of Adaptability is potentin this kingdom and will express itself increasingly as time goes on, until ithas produced in the animal world that reaction to life and to environment whichcan best be described as “animal one-pointedness”. Then, at this point andcyclically, the sixth Ray of Devotion or Idealism can make its pressure felt asthe urge towards a goal, and thus [426] produce a relation to man which makes ofhim the desired goal. This is to be seen through the medium of the tamed, thetrained and the domestic animals.Results ....In the one case we find the third ray producing the emergence ofinstinct, which in its turn creates and uses that marvellous response apparatuswe call the nervous system, the brain, and the five senses, which lie behind andwhich are responsible for them as a whole. It should be noted that, wide as wemay regard the difference between man and the animals, there is really a muchcloser relation than that existing between the animal and the vegetable. In thecase of the sixth ray, we have the appearance of the power to be domesticatedand trained which is, in the last analysis, the power to love, to serve and toemerge from the herd into the group. Ponder on the words of this lastparadoxical statement.Process.... This is called concretisation. In this kingdom we have for the firsttime a true organisation of the etheric body into what are called “the truenerves and the sensory centres” by the esotericists. Plants also have nerves,but they have in them nothing of the same intricacy of relation and of plexus aswe find in the human being and in the animal. Both kingdoms share the samegeneral grouping of nerves of force centres and channels, with a spinal columnand a brain. This organisation of a sensitive response apparatus constitutes, inreality, the densification of the subtle etheric body.Secret.... This is called transfusion, which is a very inadequate word toexpress the early blending in the animal of the psychological [427] factorswhich lead to the process of individualisation. It is a process of lifegiving,of intelligent integration and of psychological unfoldment to meet emergency.Purpose.... This is called experimentation. Here we come to a great mystery andone that is peculiar to our planet. In many esoteric books it has been statedand hinted that there has been a mistake, or serious error, on the part of GodHimself, of our planetary Logos, and that this mistake has involved our planet,and all that it contains, in the visible misery, chaos and suffering. Shall wesay that there has been no mistake, but simply a great experiment, of thesuccess or failure of which it is not yet possible to judge? The objective ofthe experiment might be stated as follows: It is the intent of the planetaryLogos to bring about a psychological condition which can best be described asone of “divine lucidity”. The work of the psyche, and the goal of the truepsychology is to see life clearly, as it is, and with all that is involved. Thisdoes not mean conditions and environment, but Life. This process was begun inthe animal kingdom and will be consummated in the human. These are described inthe Old Commentary as “the two eyes of Deity, both blind at first, but whichlater see, though the right eye sees more clearly than the left”. The first dimindication of this tendency towards lucidity is seen in the faculty of the plantto turn towards the sun. It is practically non-existent in the mineral kingdom.Divisions.... First, the higher animals and the domestic animals, such as thedog, the horse and the elephant.Secondly, the so-called wild animals, such as the lion, the tiger and othercarnivorous and dangerous wild beasts.Thirdly, the mass of lesser animals that seem to meet no particular need nor tofill any special purpose, such as the harmless yet multitudinous lives found inour forests, our jungles and the fields of our planet. Instances of these in theWest are the rabbits and other rodents. This is a wide and general specificationof no scientific import at all; but it covers adequately the karmic divisionsand the general conformation into which these groupings of lives fall in thiskingdom.Objective Agency.... Fire and water,— fierce desire and incipient mind. Theseare symbolised in the animal power to eat and drink.Subjective Agency.... Smell or scent,—the instinctual discovery of that which isneeded, from the activity of ranging forth for food, and the use of the power toscent that food, to the identification of the smell of a beloved master orfriend.Quality.... Tamas or inertia,— but in this case it is the tamasic nature of mindand not that of matter, as usually understood. The chitta or mind-stuff can beequally tamasic.THE RELATION OF THE RAYS TO THE CENTRES1. Head Centre Ray of Will or Power. First Ray. 2. The Ajna Centre Ray ofConcrete Knowledge. Fifth Ray 3.

[430]THE RAYS AND THE PLANETSEach of the seven sacred planets (of which our Earth is not one) is anexpression of one of the seven ray influences. The student however must rememberthree things:1. That every planet is the incarnation of a Life, or an Entity or Being.2. That every planet, like a human being, is the expression of two rayforces,—the personality and the egoic.3. That two rays are therefore in esoteric conflict in each planet.THE RAYS AND THE NATIONSNation Personality Ray Egoic Ray Motto India 4th ray of Art 1st ray of “I hidethe Light.” Government China 3rd ray of Intellect 1st ray of “I indicate theWay.” Government Germany 1st ray of Power 4th ray of Art “I preserve.” France3rd ray of Intellect 5th ray of “I release the Light.” Knowledge Great Britain1st ray of Power, 2nd ray of Love “I serve.” of Government Italy 4th ray of Art6th ray of “I carve the Paths” Idealism U.
