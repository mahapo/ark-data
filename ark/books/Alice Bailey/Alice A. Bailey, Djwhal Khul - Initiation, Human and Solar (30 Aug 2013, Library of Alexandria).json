To those who do notbelieve that such a goal is possible this book is offered for what it may beworth as a formulation of an interesting hypothesis. To those who anticipatesuch a consummation of all their endeavours, this book is tendered in the hopethat it may prove an inspiration and a help.Among occidental thinkers at this time there is a wide diversity of view uponthis momentous subject. There are those who think that it is not of sufficientimmediate importance to engross their attention, and that if the average manadheres to the path of duty and high-minded attention to the business in hand,he will duly arrive at his destination. This is undoubtedly true, yet ascapacity for increased service, and the development of powers to be used in thehelping of the race are the reward of the man who is willing to make theincreased effort and to pay the price which initiation demands, perhaps thisbook may spur some on to attainment who might otherwise have drifted slowlytowards their goal. They will then become givers, and not the recipients ofhelp.There are those again who consider that the teaching hitherto given out invarious books concerning initiation, vii is erroneous. Initiation has been madeout to be fairly easy of attainment, and to call for no such rectitude ofcharacter as might have been anticipated. The following chapters may serve toshow that the criticism is not unmerited. Initiation is profoundly difficult ofattainment, and calls for a strenuous discipline of the entire lower nature, anda life of self-effacing and self-abnegating devotion. At the same time, it mustbe remembered that the earlier teaching is right in essence, though belittled ininterpretation.Again, there are some who are interested, yet who feel the possibilitiesinvolved are too far advanced for them. and that they need not occupy themselveswith them at this stage of their evolution. This book seeks to make it apparentthat here and now the average man may begin to build that character and to laythose foundations of knowledge which are necessary before even the Path ofDiscipleship can be trodden. Due preparation may now be made, and men and womeneverywhere may—if they choose—fit themselves for the condition of discipleshipand tread the Probationary Path.Hundreds in the East and in the West are pressing onwards towards this goal. andin the unity of the one ideal, in their common aspiration and endeavour, theywill meet before the one Portal. They will then recognise themselves asbrothers, severed by tongue and apparent diversity of belief, hut fundamentallyholding to the same one truth and serving the same God.Alice A. Bailey.New York 1922."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER I INTRODUCTORY REMARKSBefore entering upon the subject matter of the following articles on Initiation,on the Paths that open before the perfected man, and on the Occult Hierarchy,certain statements may be made which seem essential for the judicious study andcomprehension of the ideas submitted.It is to be recognised that throughout this volume facts are alleged anddefinite statements made which are not susceptible of immediate proof by thereader. Lest it be inferred that the writer arrogates to herself any credit orpersonal authority for the knowledge implied she emphatically disavows all suchclaims or representations. She cannot do otherwise than present these statementsas matters of fact. Nevertheless, she would urge those who find somewhat ofmerit in these pages that they he not estranged by any appearance of dogmatismin the presentation. Nor should the inadequacy of the personality of the writeract as a deterrent to the open-minded consideration of the message to which hername happens to be appended. In spiritual issues, names, personalities, and thevoice of external authority, hold small place. That alone is a safe guide whichholds its warranty from inner recognition and inner direction. It is not,therefore, material whether the reader receive the message of these pages as aspiritual appeal in an idealistic setting, a presentation of alleged facts, or atheory evolved by one student and presented for the consideration of fellowstudents. To each it is offered for whatever of inner response it may evoke, forwhatever of inspiration and of light it may bring.In these days of the shattering of the old form and the building of the new,adaptability is needed. We must avert the danger of crystallisation throughpliability and expansion. The \"old order changeth,\" but primarily it is a changeof dimension and of aspect, and not of material or of foundation. Thefundamentals have always been true. To each generation is given the part ofconserving the essential features of the old and beloved form, but also ofwisely expanding and enriching it. Each cycle must add the gain of furtherresearch and scientific endeavour, and subtract that which is worn out and of novalue. Each age must build in the product and triumphs of its period, andabstract the accretions of the past that would dim and blur the outline. Aboveall, to each generation is given the joy of demonstrating the strength of theold foundations, and the opportunity to build upon these foundations a structurethat will meet the needs of the inner evolving life.The ideas that are elaborated here find their corroboration in certain factsthat are stated in the occult literature now extant. These facts are three innumber, and are as follows:—(a) In the creation of the sun and the seven sacred planets composing our solarsystem, our Logos employed matter that was already impregnated with particularqualities. Mrs. Besant in her book, \"Avataras,\" (which some of us think the mostvaluable of all her writings, because one of the most suggestive), makes thestatement that \"our solar system is builded out of matter already existing, outof matter already gifted with certain properties …\" (page 48) . This matter,therefore, we deduce, held latent certain faculties that were forced todemonstrate in a peculiar way, under the law of Cause and Effect, as does allelse in the universe.(b) All manifestation is of a septenary nature, and the Central Light which wecall Deity, the one Ray of Divinity, manifests first as a Triplicity, and thenas a Septenary. The One God shines forth as God the Father, God the Son, and Godthe Holy Spirit, and these three are again reflected through the Seven Spiritsbefore the Throne, or the seven Planetary Logoi. The students of occultism ofnon-Christian origin may call these Beings the One Ray, demonstrating throughthe three major Rays and the four minor, making a divine Septenary. TheSynthetic Ray which blends them all is the great Love-Wisdom Ray, for verily andindeed \"God is Love.\" This Ray is the indigo Ray, and is the blending Ray. It isthe one which will, at the end of the greater cycle, absorb the others in theachievement of synthetic perfection. It is the manifestation of the secondaspect of Logoic life. It is this aspect, that of the Form-Builder, that makesthis solar system of ours the most concrete of the three major systems. The Loveor Wisdom aspect demonstrates through the building of the form, for \"God isLove,\" and in that God of Love we \"live and move and have our being,\" and willto the end of aeonian manifestation.(c) The seven planes of Divine Manifestation, or the seven major planes of oursystem, are but the seven subplanes of the lowest cosmic plane. The seven Raysof which we hear so much, and which hold so much of interest and of mystery, arelikewise but the seven sub-rays of one cosmic Ray. The twelve creativeHierarchies are themselves but subsidiary branches of one cosmic Hierarchy. Theyform but one chord in the cosmic symphony. When that sevenfold cosmic chord, ofwhich we form so humble a part, reverberates in synthetic perfection, then, andonly then, will come comprehension of the words in the Book of Job: \"The morningstars sang together.\" Dissonance yet sounds forth, and discord arises from manysystems, but in the progression of the aeons an ordered harmony will eventuate,and the day will dawn when (if we dare speak of eternities in the terms of time)the sound of the perfected universe will resound to the uttermost bounds of thefurthest constellation. Then will be known the mystery of \"the marriage song ofthe heavens.\"The reader is also asked to remember and weigh certain ideas prior to taking upthe study of Initiation. Due to the extreme complexity of the matter it is anutter impossibility for us to do more than get a general idea of the scheme;hence the futility of dogmatism. We can do no more than sense a fraction of somewonderful whole, utterly beyond the reach of our consciousness,—a whole that thehighest Angel or Perfected Being is but beginning to realise. When we recognisethe fact that the average man is as yet fully conscious only on the physicalplane, nearly conscious on the emotional plane, and only developing theconsciousness of the mental plane, it is obvious that his comprehension ofcosmic data can be but rudimentary. When we recognise the further fact, that tohe conscious on a plane and to have control on that plane are two very differentconditions, it becomes apparent how remote is the possibility of ourapproximating more than the general trend of the cosmic scheme.We must recognise also that danger lies in dogma and in the hide-bound facts oftextbooks, and that safety lies in flexibility, and in a shifting angle ofvision. A tact, for instance, looked at from the standpoint of humanity (usingthe word \"fact\" in the scientific sense as that which has been demonstrated pastall doubt and question) may not be a fact from the standpoint of a Master. ToHim it may be but part of a greater fact, only a fraction of the whole. SinceHis vision is fourth and fifth dimensional, His realisation of the place of timein eternity must be more accurate than ours. He sees things from abovedownwards, and as one to whom time is not.An inexplicable principle of mutation exists in the Mind of the Logos, or theDeity of our solar system, and governs all His actions. We see but the everchanging forms, and catch glimpses of the steadily evolving life within thoseforms, but as yet have no clue to the principle which works through the shiftingkaleidoscope of solar systems, rays, hierarchies, planets, planes, schemes,rounds, races, and sub-races. They interweave, interlock, and interpenetrateeach other, and utter bewilderment is ours as the wonderful pattern they formunfolds before us. We know that somewhere in that scheme we, the humanhierarchy, have our place. All, therefore, that we can do is to seize upon anydata that seems to affect our own welfare, and concerns our own evolution, andfrom the study of the human being in the three worlds seek to understandsomewhat the macrocosm. We know not how the one can become the three, the threebecome the seven, and so proceed to inconceivable differentiation. To humanvision this interweaving of the system forms an unimaginable complexity, the keyto which seems not to be forthcoming. Seen from the angle of a Master we knowthat all proceeds in ordered sequence. Seen from the angle of divine vision thewhole will move in harmonious unison, producing a form geometrically accurate.Browning had hold of a part of this truth when he wrote:\"All's change, but permanence as well\"… and continued:\"Truth inside, and outside, truth also; and between each, falsehood that ischange, as truth is permanence.\"\"Truth successively takes shape, one grade above its last presentment…\"We must remember also that beyond a certain point it is not safe nor wise tocarry the communication of the facts of the solar system. Much must remainesoteric and veiled. The risks of too much knowledge are far greater than themenace of too little. With knowledge comes responsibility and power,—two thingsfor which the race is not yet ready. Therefore, all we can do is to study andcorrelate with what wisdom and discretion may be ours, using the knowledge thatmay come for the good of those we seek to help, and recognising that in the wiseuse of knowledge comes increased capacity to receive the hidden wisdom. Coupledalso with the wise adaptation of knowledge to the surrounding need must grow thecapacity for discreet reservation, and the use of the discriminating faculty.When we can wisely use, discreetly withhold, and soundly discriminate, we givethe surest guarantee to the watching Teachers of the race that we are ready fora fresh revelation.We must resign ourselves to the fact that the only way in which we can find theclue to the mystery of the rays, systems, and hierarchies, lies in the study ofthe law of correspondences or analogy. It is the one thread by which we can findour way through the labyrinth, and the one ray of light that shines through thedarkness of the surrounding ignorance. H. P. Blavatsky, in \"The SecretDoctrine,\" has told us so, but as yet very little has been done by students toavail themselves of that clue. In the study of this Law we need to remember thatthe correspondence lies in its essence, and not in the exoteric working out ofdetail as we think we see it from our present standpoint. The factor of timeleads us astray for one thing; we err when we attempt to fix stated times orlimits; all in evolution progresses through merging, with a constant process ofoverlapping and mingling. Only broad generalities and a recognition offundamental points of analogy are possible to the average student. The moment heattempts to reduce to chart form and to tabulate in detail, he enters realmswhere he is bound to err, and staggers through a fog that will ultimatelyoverwhelm him.Nevertheless, in the scientific study of this law of analogy will come a gradualgrowth of knowledge, and in the slow accumulation of facts will gradually bebuilt up an ever-expanding form, that will embody much of the truth. The studentwill then awake to the realization that after all the study and toil he has atleast a wide general conception of the Logoic thoughtform into which he can fitthe details as he acquires them through many incarnations. This brings us to thelast point to be considered before entering upon the subject proper, which is:That the development of the human being is but the passing from one state ofconsciousness to another. It is a succession of expansions, a growth of thatfaculty of awareness that constitutes the predominant characteristic of theindwelling Thinker. It is the progressing from consciousness polarised in thepersonality, lower self, or body, to that polarised in the higher self, ego, orsoul, thence to a polarisation in the Monad, or Spirit, till the consciousnesseventually is Divine. As the human being develops, the faculty of awarenessextends first of all beyond the circumscribing walls that confine it within thelower kingdoms of nature (the mineral, vegetable and animal) to the three worldsof the evolving personality, to the planet whereon he plays his part, to thesystem wherein that planet revolves, until it finally escapes from the solarsystem itself and becomes universal."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER II INITIATION DEFINEDThe question anent initiation is one that is coming more and more before thepublic. Before many centuries pass the old mysteries will be restored, and aninner body will exist in the Church—the Church of the period, of which thenucleus is already forming—wherein the first initiation will become exoteric, inthis sense only, that the taking of the first initiation will, before so verylong, be the most sacred ceremony of the Church, performed exoterically as oneof the mysteries given at stated periods, attended by those concerned. It willalso hold a similar place in the ritual of the Masons. At this ceremony thoseready for the first initiation will be publicly admitted to the Lodge by one ofits members, authorised to do so by the great Hierophant Himself.Four words defined .When we speak of Initiation, of wisdom, of knowledge, or of the probationaryPath, what do we mean? We use the words so glibly, without due consideration ofthe meaning involved. Take, for instance, the word first mentioned. Many are thedefinitions, and many are the explanations to be found as to its scope, thepreparatory steps, the work to be done between initiations, and its result andeffects. One thing before all else is apparent to the most superficial student,and that is, that the magnitude of the subject is such that in order to dealwith it adequately one should be able to write from the viewpoint of aninitiate; when this is not the case, anything that is said may be reasonable,logical, interesting, or suggestive, but not conclusive.The word Initiation comes from two Latin words, in , into; and ire , to go;therefore, the making of a beginning , or the entrance into something. Itposits, in its widest sense, in the case we are studying, an entrance into thespiritual life, or into a fresh stage in that life. It is the first step, andthe succeeding steps, upon the Path of Holiness. Literally, therefore, a man whohas taken the first initiation is one who has taken the first step into thespiritual kingdom, having passed out of the definitely human kingdom into thesuperhuman. Just as he passed out of the animal kingdom into the human atindividualisation, so he has entered upon the life of the spirit, and for thefirst time has the right to be called a \"spiritual man\" in the technicalsignificance of the word. He is entering upon the fifth or final stage in ourpresent fivefold evolution. Having groped his way through the Hall of Ignoranceduring many ages, and having gone to school in the Hall of Learning, he is nowentering into the university, or the Hall of Wisdom. When he has passed throughthat school he will graduate with his degree as a Master of Compassion.It might be of benefit to us also if we studied first the difference or theconnection between Knowledge , Understanding , and Wisdom . Though in ordinaryparlance they are frequently interchanged, as used technically they aredissimilar.Knowledge is the product of the Hall of Learning. It might be termed thesumtotal of human discovery and experience, that which can be recognised by thefive senses, and be correlated, diagnosed, and defined by the use of the humanintellect. It is that about which we feel mental certitude, or that which we canascertain by the use of experiment. It is the compendium of the arts andsciences. It concerns all that deals with the building and developing of theform side of things. Therefore it concerns the material side of evolution,matter in the solar systems, in the planet, in the three worlds of humanevolution, and in the bodies of men.Wisdom is the product of the Hall of Wisdom. It has to do with the developmentof the life within the form, with the progress of the spirit through thoseever-changing vehicles, and with the expansions of consciousness that succeedeach other from life to life. It deals with the life side of evolution. Since itdeals with the essence of things and not with the things themselves, it is theintuitive apprehension of truth apart from the reasoning faculty, and the innateperception that can distinguish between the false and the true, between the realand the unreal. It is more than that, for it is also the growing capacity of theThinker to enter increasingly into the mind of the Logos, to realise the trueinwardness of the great pageant of the universe, to vision the objective, and toharmonise more and more with the higher measure. For our present purpose (whichis to study somewhat the Path of Holiness and its various stages) it may bedescribed as the realisation of the \"Kingdom of God within,\" and theapprehension of the \"Kingdom of God without\" in the solar system. Perhaps itmight be expressed as the gradual blending of the paths of the mystic and theoccultist,—the rearing of the temple of wisdom upon the foundation of knowledge.Wisdom is the science of the spirit, just as knowledge is the science of matter.Knowledge is separative and objective, whilst wisdom is synthetic andsubjective. Knowledge divides; wisdom unites. Knowledge differentiates whilstwisdom blends. What, then, is meant by the understanding?The understanding may be defined as the faculty of the Thinker in Time toappropriate knowledge as the foundation for wisdom, that which enables him toadapt the things of form to the life of the spirit, and to take the flashes ofinspiration that come to him from the Hall of Wisdom and link them to the factsof the Hall of Learning. Perhaps the whole idea might be expressed in this way:Wisdom concerns the one Self, knowledge deals with the not-self, whilst theunderstanding is the point of view of the Ego, or Thinker, or his relationbetween them.In the Hall of Ignorance the form controls, and the material side of things hasthe predominance. Man is there polarised in the personality or lower self. Inthe Hall of Learning the higher self, or Ego, strives to dominate that formuntil gradually a point of equilibrium is reached where the man is controlledentirely by neither. Later the Ego controls more and more, until in the Hall ofWisdom it dominates in the three lower worlds, and in increasing degree theinherent divinity assumes the mastery.Aspects of initiation .Initiation, or the process of undergoing an expansion of consciousness, is partof the normal process of evolutionary development, viewed on a large scale, andnot from the standpoint of the individual. When viewed from the individualstandpoint it has come to be narrowed down to the moment wherein the evolvingunit definitely apprehends that (by dint of his own effort, aided by the adviceand suggestions of the watching Teachers of the race) he has reached a pointwherein a certain range of knowledge of a subjective nature, from the physicalplane point of view, is his. It is in the nature of that experience wherein apupil in a school realises suddenly that he has mastered a lesson, and that therationale of a subject, and the method of procedure, are his to useintelligently. These moments of intelligent apprehension follow the evolvingMonad throughout his long pilgrimage. What has been misinterpreted somewhat atthis stage of comprehension is the fact that at various periods the emphasis islaid on different grades of expansion, and always the Hierarchy endeavours tobring the race to the point where its units will have some idea of the next stepto be taken.Each initiation marks the passing of the pupil in the Hall of Wisdom into ahigher class, marks the clearer shining forth of the inner fire and thetransition from one point of polarisation to another, entails the realisation ofan increasing unity with all that lives and the essential oneness of the selfwith all selves. It results in a horizon that continuously enlarges until itincludes the sphere of creation; it is a growing capacity to see and hear on allthe planes. It is an increased consciousness of God's plans for the world, andan increased ability to enter into those plans and to further them. It is theeffort in the abstract mind to pass an examination. It is the honour class inthe Master's school, and is within the attainment of those souls whose karmapermits and whose efforts suffice to fulfil the aim.Initiation leads to the mount whence vision can be had, a vision of the eternalNow, wherein past, present, and future exist as one; a vision of the pageant ofthe races with the golden thread of pedigree carried through the many types; avision of the golden sphere that holds in unison all the many evolutions of oursystem, deva, human, animal, vegetable, mineral, and elemental, and throughwhich the 1 pulsating life can be clearly seen beating in regular rhythm; avision of the Logoic thoughtform on the archetypal plane, a vision that growsfrom initiation to initiation until it embraces all the solar system.Initiation leads to the stream that, once entered, sweeps a man onward until itcarries him to the feet of the Lord of the World, to the feet of his Father inHeaven, to the feet of the three-fold Logos.Initiation leads to the cave within whose circumscribing walls the pairs ofopposites are known, and the secret of good and evil is revealed. It leads tothe Cross and to that utter sacrifice which must transpire before perfectliberation is attained, and the initiate stands free of all earth's fetters,held by naught in the three worlds. It leads through the Hall of Wisdom, andputs into a man's hands the key to all information, systemic and cosmic, ingraduated sequence. It reveals the hidden mystery that lies at the heart of thesolar system. It leads from one state of consciousness to another. As each stateis entered the horizon enlarges, the vista extends, and the comprehensionincludes more and more, until the expansion reaches a point where the selfembraces all selves, including all that is \"moving and unmoving,\" as phrased byan ancient Scripture.Initiation involves ceremony. It is this aspect that has been emphasised in theminds of men, perhaps a little to the exclusion of the true significance.Primarily it involves the capacity to see, hear, and comprehend, and tosynthesise and correlate knowledge. It does not necessarily involve thedevelopment of the psychic faculties, but it does entail the inner comprehensionthat sees the value underlying the form, and recognises the purpose of pervadingcircumstances. It is the capacity that senses the lesson to he learnt from anygiven occurrence and event, and that by means of these comprehensions andrecognitions effects an hourly, weekly, yearly growth and expansion. Thisprocess of gradual expansion—the result of the definite effort and strenuousright thinking and living of the aspirant himself and not of some occult teacherperforming an occult rite—leads to what one might term a crisis .At this crisis, which necessitates the aid of a Master, a definite act ofinitiation is performed, which (acting on a particular centre) produces a resulton some one body. It keys the atoms to a certain pitch, and enables a new rateof rhythm to be attained.This ceremony of initiation marks a point of attainment. It does not bring aboutattainment, as is so often the misconception. It simply marks the recognition bythe watching Teachers of the race of a definite point in evolution reached bythe pupil, and gives two things:—1. An expansion of consciousness that admits the personality into the wisdomattained by the Ego, and in the higher initiations into the consciousness of theMonad.2. A brief period of enlightenment wherein the initiate sees that portion of thePath that lies ahead to be trodden, and wherein he shares consciously in thegreat plan of evolution.After initiation, the work to be done consists largely in making that expansionof consciousness part of the equipment for the practical use of the personality,and in mastering that portion of the path that has yet to be traversed.The place and effect of initiation .The ceremony of initiation takes place on the three higher sub-planes of themental plane, and on the three higher planes, according to the initiation. Thefive-pointed star, at the initiations on the mental plane, flashes out above thehead of the initiate. This concerns the first initiations which are undergone inthe causal vehicle. It has been said that the first two initiations take placeupon the astral plane. but this is incorrect, and the statement has given riseto a misunderstanding. They are felt profoundly in connection with the astraland physical bodies and the lower mental, and affect their control. The chiefeffect being felt in those bodies the initiate may interpret them as havingtaken place on the planes concerned, as the vividness of the effect and thestimulation of the first two initiations work out largely in the astral body.But it must ever be remembered that the major initiations are taken in thecausal body or—dissociated from that body—on the buddhic plane or atmic plane.At the final two initiations which set a man free from the three worlds, andenable him to function in the body of vitality of the Logos and wield thatforce, the initiate becomes the five-pointed star and it descends upon him,merges in him, and he is seen at its very centre. This descent is brought aboutby the action of the Initiator, wielding the Rod of Power, and puts a man intouch with the centre in the Body of the Planetary Logos of which he is a part,and this consciously. The two initiations called the sixth and seventh takeplace on the buddhic and atmic planes; the five-pointed star \"blazes forth fromwithin Itself,\" as the esoteric phrase has it, and becomes the seven-pointedstar; it descends upon the man and he enters within the flame.Again, the four initiations, prior to that of the adept, mark respectively theattainment of certain proportions of atomic matter in the bodies—for instance,at the first initiation one-fourth atomic matter, at the second one-half atomicmatter, at the third three-quarters atomic matter, and so on to the completion.Since buddhi is the unifying principle (or the welder of all), at the fifthinitiation the adept lets the lower vehicles go, and stands in his buddhicsheath. He creates thence his body of manifestation.Each initiation gives more control on the rays, if one may so express it,although this does not adequately convey the idea. Words so often mislead. Atthe fifth initiation, when the adept stands Master in the three worlds, Hecontrols more or less (according to His line of development) the five rays thatare specially manifesting at the time He takes the initiation. At the sixthinitiation, if He takes the higher degree, He gains power on another ray, and atthe seventh initiation He wields power on all the rays. The sixth initiationmarks the point of attainment of the Christ, and brings the synthetic ray of thesystem under His control. We need to remember that initiation gives the initiatepower on the rays , and not power over the rays , for this marks a very definitedifference. Every initiate has, of course, for his primary or spiritual ray oneof the three major rays, and the ray of his Monad is the one on which he atlength gains power. The love ray, or the synthetic ray of the system, is thefinal one achieved.Those who pass away from the earth after the fifth initiation, or those who donot become Masters in physical incarnation, take their subsequent initiationselsewhere in the system. All are in the Logoic Consciousness. One great fact tobe borne in mind is, that the initiations of the planet or of the solar systemare but the preparatory initiations of admission into the greater Lodge onSirius. We have the symbolism held for us fairly well in Masonry, and incombining the Masonic method with what we are told of the steps on the Path ofHoliness we get an approximate picture. Let us enlarge somewhat:—The first four initiations of the solar system correspond to the four\"initiations of the Threshold,\" prior to the first cosmic initiation. The fifthinitiation corresponds to the first cosmic initiation, that of \"enteredapprentice\" in Masonry; and makes a Master an \"entered apprentice\" of the Lodgeon Sirius. The sixth initiation is analogous to the second degree in Masonry,whilst the seventh initiation makes the Adept a Master Mason of the Brotherhoodon Sirius.A Master, therefore, is one who has taken the seventh planetary initiation, thefifth solar initiation, and the first Sirian or cosmic initiation.At-one-ment, the result of initiation .A point that we need to grasp is that each successive initiation brings about amore complete unification of the personality and the Ego, and on higher levelsstill, with the Monad. The whole evolution of the human spirit is a progressiveat-one-ment. In the at-one-ment between the Ego and the personality lies hid themystery of the Christian doctrine of the Atonement. One unification takes placeat the moment of individualisation, when man becomes a conscious rationalentity, in contradistinction to the animals. As evolution proceeds successiveat-one-ments occur.At-one-ment on all levels—emotional, intuitional, spiritual and Divine—consistsin conscious, continuous functioning. In all cases it is preceded by a burning,through the medium of the inner fire, and by the destruction, through sacrifice,of all that separates. The approach to unity is through destruction of thelower, and of all that forms a barrier. Take, in illustration, the web thatseparates the etheric body and the emotional. When that web has been burned awayby the inner fire the communication between the bodies of the personalitybecomes continuous and complete, and the three lower vehicles function as one.You have a somewhat analogous situation on the higher levels, though theparallel cannot be pushed to detail. The intuition corresponds to the emotional,and the four higher levels of the mental plane to the etheric. In thedestruction of the causal body at the time of the fourth initiation (calledsymbolically \"the Crucifixion\") you have a process analogous to the burning ofthe web that leads to the unification of the bodies of the personality. Thedisintegration that is a part of the arhat initiation leads to unity between theEgo and the Monad, expressing itself in the Triad. It is the perfectat-one-ment.The whole process is therefore for the purpose of making man consciously one:—First: With himself, and those in incarnation with him.Second: With his higher Self, and thus with all selves.Third: With his Spirit, or \"Father in Heaven,\" and thus with all Monads.Fourth: With the Logos, the Three in One and the One in Three.Man becomes a conscious human being through the instrumentality of the Lords ofthe Flame, through Their enduring sacrifice.Man becomes a conscious Ego, with the consciousness of the higher Self, at thethird initiation, through the instrumentality of the Masters and of the Christ,and through Their sacrifice in taking physical incarnation for the helping ofthe world.Man unites with the Monad at the fifth initiation, through the instrumentalityof the Lord of the World, the Solitary Watcher, the Great Sacrifice.Man becomes one with the Logos through the instrumentality of One about Whomnaught may be said ."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER III THE WORK OF THE HIERARCHYThough the subject of the occult Hierarchy of the planet is of such a profoundlymomentous interest to the average man, yet its real significance will never beunderstood until men realise three things in connection with it. First, that theentire Hierarchy of spiritual beings represents a synthesis of forces or ofenergies, which forces or energies are consciously manipulated for thefurtherance of planetary evolution. This will become more apparent as weproceed. Secondly, that these forces, demonstrating in our planetary schemethrough those great Personalities Who compose the Hierarchy, link it and allthat it contains with the greater Hierarchy which we call Solar. Our Hierarchyis a miniature replica of the greater synthesis of those selfconscious Entitieswho manipulate, control, and demonstrate through the sun and the seven sacredplanets, as well as the other planets, greater and smaller, of which our solarsystem is composed. Thirdly, that this Hierarchy of forces has four pre-eminentlines of work:To develop selfconsciousness in all beings .The Hierarchy seeks to provide fit conditions for the development ofselfconsciousness in all beings. This it produces primarily in man through itsinitial work of blending the higher three aspects of spirit with the lower four;through the example it sets of service, sacrifice, and renunciation, and throughthe constant streams of light (occultly understood) which emanate from it. TheHierarchy might be considered as the aggregate on our planet of the forces ofthe fifth kingdom in nature. This kingdom is entered through the fulldevelopment and control of the fifth principle of mind, and its transmutationinto wisdom, which is literally the intelligence applied to all states throughthe full conscious utilisation of the faculty of discriminative love.To develop consciousness in the three lower kingdoms .As is well known, the five kingdoms of nature on the evolutionary arc might bedefined as follows:—the mineral kingdom, the vegetable kingdom, the animalkingdom, the human kingdom, and the spiritual kingdom. All these kingdoms embodysome type of consciousness, and it is the work of the Hierarchy to develop thesetypes to perfection through the adjustment of karma, through the agency offorce, and through the providing of right conditions. Some idea of the work maybe gained if we briefly summarize the different aspects of consciousness to bedeveloped in the various kingdoms.In the mineral kingdom the work of the Hierarchy is directed toward thedevelopment of the discriminative and selective activity. One characteristic ofall matter is activity of some kind, and the moment that activity is directedtowards the building of forms, even of the most elemental kind, the faculty ofdiscrimination will demonstrate. This is recognised by scientists everywhere,and in this recognition they are approximating the findings of the DivineWisdom.In the vegetable kingdom , to this faculty of discrimination is added that ofresponse to sensation, and the rudimentary condition of the second aspect ofdivinity is to be seen, just as in the mineral kingdom a similar rudimentaryreflection of the third aspect of activity is making itself felt.In the animal kingdom this rudimentary activity and feeling are increased, andsymptoms (if it might be so inadequately expressed) are to be found of the firstaspect, or embryonic will and purpose; we may call it hereditary instinct, butit works out in fact as purpose in nature.It has been wisely stated by H. P. Blavatsky that man is the macrocosm for thethree lower kingdoms, for in him these three lines of development aresynthesised and come to their full fruition. He is verily and indeedintelligence, actively and wonderfully manifested; He is incipient love andwisdom, even though as yet they may be but the goal of his endeavour; and he hasthat embryonic, dynamic, initiating will which will come to a fuller developmentafter he has entered into the fifth kingdom.In the fifth kingdom, the consciousness to be developed is that of the group,and this shows itself in the full flowering of the love-wisdom faculty. Man butrepeats on a higher turn of the spiral, the work of the three lower kingdoms,for in the human kingdom he shows forth the third aspect of active intelligence.In the fifth kingdom, which is entered at the first initiation, and which coversall the period of time wherein a man takes the first five initiations, and thatwherein he works as a Master, as part of the Hierarchy, the love-wisdom, orsecond aspect, comes to its consummation. At the sixth and seventh initiationsthe first, or will, aspect shines forth, and from being a Master of Compassionand a Lord of Love the adept becomes something more. He enters into a stillhigher consciousness than that of the group, and becomes God-conscious. Thegreat will or purpose of the Logos becomes his.The fostering of the various attributes of divinity, the tending of the seed ofselfconsciousness in all beings, is the work of those Entities who haveachieved, Who have entered into the fifth kingdom and Who have there made Theirgreat decision, and that inconceivable renunciation which leads Them to staywithin the planetary scheme, and thus co-operate with the plans of the PlanetaryLogos on the physical plane.To transmit the will of the Planetary Logos .They act as the transmitter to men and devas or angels, of the will of thePlanetary Logos, and through Him of the Solar Logos. Each planetary scheme, oursamongst the others, is a centre in the body Logoic, and is expressing some formof energy or force. Each centre expresses its particular type of force,demonstrated in a triple manner, producing thus universally the three aspects inmanifestation. One of the great realisations which come to those who enter intothe fifth kingdom is that of the particular type of force which our ownPlanetary Logos embodies. The wise student will ponder on this statement, for itholds the clue to much that may be seen in the world today. The secret ofsynthesis has been lost, and only when men again get back the knowledge whichwas theirs in earlier cycles (having been mercifully withdrawn in Atlanteandays) of the type of energy which our scheme should be demonstrating, will theworld problems adjust themselves, and the world rhythm be stabilised. Thiscannot be as yet, for this knowledge is of a dangerous kind, and at present therace as a whole is not group conscious, and therefore cannot be trusted to work,think, plan, and act for the group. Man is as yet too selfish, but there is nocause for discouragement in this fact; group consciousness is already somewhatmore than a vision, whilst brotherhood, and the recognition of its obligations,is beginning to permeate the consciousness of men everywhere. This is the workof the Hierarchy of Light,—to demonstrate to men the true meaning ofbrotherhood, and to foster in them response to that ideal which is latent in oneand all.To set an example to humanity .The fourth thing that men need to know and to realise as a basic fact is thatthis Hierarchy is composed of those Who have triumphed over matter, and Who haveachieved the goal by the very self-same steps that individuals tread today.These spiritual personalities, these adepts and Masters, have wrestled andfought for victory and mastery upon the physical plane, and struggled with themiasmas, the fogs, the dangers, the troubles, the sorrows and pains of everydayliving. They have trodden every step of the path of suffering, have undergoneevery experience, have surmounted every difficulty, and have won out. TheseElder Brothers of the race have one and all undergone the crucifixion of thepersonal self, and know that utter renunciation of all which is the lot of everyaspirant at this time. There is no phase of agony, no rending sacrifice, no ViaDolorosa that They have not in Their time trodden, and herein lies Their rightto serve, and the strength of the method of Their appeal. Knowing thequintessence of pain, knowing the depth of sin and of suffering, Their methodscan be exquisitely measured to the individual need; yet at the same time Theirrealisation of the liberation to be achieved through pain, penalty, andsuffering, and Their apprehension of the freedom that comes through thesacrifice of the form by the medium of the purificatory fires, suffices to giveThem a firm hand, an ability to persist even when the form may seem to haveundergone a sufficiency of suffering, and a love that triumphs over allsetbacks, for it is founded on patience and experience. These Elder Brothers ofhumanity are characterised by a love which endures, and which acts ever for thegood of the group; by a knowledge which has been gained through a millennia oflives, in which They have worked Their way from the bottom of life and ofevolution well nigh to the top; by an experience which is based on time itselfand a multiplicity of personality reactions and interactions; by a courage whichis the result of that experience, and which, having itself been produced by agesof endeavour, failure, and renewed endeavour, and having in the long run led totriumph, can now be placed at the service of the race; by a purpose which isenlightened and intelligent, and which is co-operative, adjusting itself to thegroup and hierarchical plan and thus fitting in with the purpose of thePlanetary Logos; and finally They are distinguished by a knowledge of the powerof sound . This final fact is the basis of that aphorism which states that alltrue occultists are distinguished by the characteristics of knowledge, dynamicwill, courage, and silence. \"To know, to will, to dare, and to be silent.\"Knowing the plan so well, and having clear, illuminated vision, They can bendTheir will unflinchingly and unswervingly to the great work of creation by thepower of sound. This leads to Their silence where the average man would speak,and Their speaking where the average man is silent.When men have grasped the four facts here enumerated, and they are establishedas acknowledged truths in the consciousness of the race, then may we look for areturn of that cycle of peace and rest and righteousness which is foretold inall the Scriptures of the world. The Sun of Righteousness will then arise withhealing in His wings, and the peace which passeth understanding will reign inthe hearts of men.In dealing with this matter of the work of the occult Hierarchy, in a book forthe general public, much must be left unsaid. The average man is interested andhis curiosity is aroused by reference to these Personalities, but men are notyet ready for more than the most general information. For those who, fromcuriosity, pass on to desire and seek to know the truth as it is, more will beforthcoming, when they themselves have done the necessary work and study.Investigation is desired, and the attitude of mind which it is hoped this bookwill arouse might be summed up in the following words:—These statements soundinteresting and perchance they are true. The religions of all nations, theChristian included, give indications that seem to substantiate these ideas. Letus therefore accept these ideas as a working hypothesis as to the consummationof the evolutionary process in man and his work upon the attainment ofperfection. Let us therefore seek for the truth as a fact in our ownconsciousness. Every religious faith holds out the promise that those who seekwith earnestness shall find that which they are seeking; let us, therefore,seek. If by our search we find that all these statements are but visionarydreams, and profit not at all, leading us only into darkness, time willnevertheless not have been lost, for we shall have ascertained where not tolook. If by our search, on the other hand, corroboration comes little by little,and the light shines ever more clearly, let us persist until that day dawns whenthe light which shineth in darkness will have illuminated the heart and brain,and the seeker will awaken to the realisation that the whole trend of evolutionhas been to bring him this expansion of consciousness and this illumination, andthat the attainment of the initiatory process, and the entrance into the fifthkingdom is no wild chimera or phantasm, but an established fact in theconsciousness. This each man must ascertain for himself. Those who know maystate a fact to be thus and so, but the dictum of another person and theenunciation of a theory do not aid beyond giving to the seeker confirmatoryindication. Each soul has to ascertain for himself, and must find out withinhimself, remembering ever that the kingdom of God is within, and that only thosefacts which are realised within the individual consciousness as truths are ofany real value. In the meantime, that which many know, and have ascertainedwithin themselves to be truths of an incontrovertible nature for them, may herebe stated; to the intelligent reader will then arise the opportunity and theresponsibility of ascertaining for himself their falsity or truth."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IV THE FOUNDING OF THE HIERARCHYIts appearance on the planet .It is not sought, in this book, to deal with the steps which led to the foundingof the Hierarchy on the planet, nor to consider the conditions preceding theadvent of those great Beings. This can be studied in other occult books in theoccident, and in the sacred Scriptures of the East. Suffice it for our purposeto say that in the middle of the Lemurian epoch, approximately eighteen millionyears ago, occurred a great event which signified, among other things, thefollowing developments:—The Planetary Logos of our earth scheme, one of theSeven Spirits before the throne, took physical incarnation, and, under the formof Sanat Kumara, the Ancient of Days, and the Lord of the World, came down tothis dense physical planet and has remained with us ever since. Owing to theextreme purity of His nature, and the fact that He is (from the humanstandpoint) relatively sinless, and hence incapable of response to aught on thedense physical plane, He was unable to take a dense physical body such as ours,and has to function in His etheric body. He is the greatest of all the Avatars,or Coming Ones, for He is a direct reflection of that great Entity who lives,and breathes, and functions through all the evolutions on this planet, holdingall within His aura or magnetic sphere of influence. In Him we live and move andhave our being, and none of us can pass beyond the radius of His aura. He is theGreat Sacrifice, Who left the glory of the high places and for the sake of theevolving sons of men took upon Himself a physical form and was made in thelikeness of man. He is the Silent Watcher, as far as our immediate humanity isconcerned, although literally the Planetary Logos Himself, on the higher planeof consciousness whereon He functions, is the true Silent Watcher where theplanetary scheme is concerned. Perhaps it might be stated thus:—That the Lord ofthe World, the One Initiator, holds the same place in connection with thePlanetary Logos as the physical manifestation of a Master holds to that Master'sMonad on the monadic plane. In both cases the intermediate state ofconsciousness has been superseded, that of the Ego or higher self, and thatwhich we see and know is the direct self-created manifestation of pure spirititself. Hence the sacrifice. It must here be borne in mind that in the case ofSanat Kumara there is a tremendous difference in degree, for His point inevolution is as far in advance of that of an adept as that adept's is in advanceof animal man. This will be somewhat elaborated in the next section of oursubject.With the Ancient of Days came a group of other highly evolved Entities, whorepresent His own individual karmic group and those Beings who are the outcomeof the triple nature of the Planetary Logos. If one might so express it Theyembody the forces emanating from the head, heart, and throat centres, and Theycame in with Sanat Kumara to form focal points of planetary force for thehelping of the great plan for the self-conscious unfoldment of all life. Theirplaces have gradually been filled by the sons of men as they qualify, thoughthis includes very few, until lately, from our immediate earth humanity. Thosewho are now the inner group around the Lord of the World have been primarilyrecruited from the ranks of those who were initiates on the moon chain (thecycle of evolution preceding ours) or who have come in on certain streams ofsolar energy, astrologically determined, from other planetary schemes, yet thosewho have triumphed in our own humanity are rapidly increasing in number, andhold all the minor offices beneath the central esoteric group of Six, who, withthe Lord of the World, form the heart of hierarchial effort.The immediate effect .The result of Their advent, millions of years ago, was stupendous, and itseffects are still being felt. Those effects might be enumerated as follows:—ThePlanetary Logos on His own plane was enabled to take a more direct method inproducing the results He desired for working out His plan. As is well known, theplanetary scheme, with its dense globe and inner subtler globes, is to thePlanetary Logos what the physical body and its subtler bodies are to man. Hencein illustration it might he said that the coming into incarnation of SanatKumara was analogous to the firm grip of self-conscious control that the Ego ofa human being takes upon his vehicles when the necessary stage in evolution hasbeen achieved. It has been said that in the head of every man are seven centresof force, which are linked to the other centres in the body, and through whichthe force of the Ego is spread and circulated, this working out the plan. SanatKumara, with the six other Kumaras, holds a similar position. These centralseven are as the seven head centres to the body corporate. They are thedirecting agents and the transmitters of the energy, force, purpose, and will ofthe Planetary Logos on His own plane. This planetary head centre works directlythrough the heart and throat centres, and thereby controls all the remainingcentres. This is by way of illustration, and an attempt to show the relation ofthe Hierarchy to its planetary source, and also the close analogy between themethod of functioning of a Planetary Logos and of man, the microcosm.The third kingdom of nature, the animal kingdom, had reached a relatively highstate of evolution, and animal man was in possession of the earth; he was abeing with a powerful physical body, a co-ordinated astral body, or body ofsensation and feeling, and a rudimentary germ of mind which might some day forma nucleus of a mental body. Left to himself for long aeons animal man would haveeventually progressed out of the animal kingdom into the human, and would havebecome a self-conscious, functioning, rational entity, but how slow the processwould have been may he evidenced by the study of the bushmen of South Africa,the Veddhas of Ceylon, and the hairy Ainus.The decision of the Planetary Logos to take a physical vehicle produced anextraordinary stimulation in the evolutionary process, and by His incarnation,and the methods of force distribution He employed, He brought about in a briefcycle of time what would otherwise have been inconceivably slow. The germ ofmind in animal man was stimulated. The fourfold lower man, a. The physical bodyin its dual capacity, etheric and dense, b. Vitality, life force, or prana, c.The astral or emotional body, d. The incipient germ of mind. was co-ordinatedand stimulated, and became a fit receptacle for the coming in of theself-conscious entities, those spiritual triads (the reflection of spiritualwill, intuition, or wisdom, and higher mind) who had for long ages been waitingfor just such a fitting. The fourth, or human kingdom, came thus into being, andthe self-conscious, or rational unit, man, began his career.Another result of the advent of the Hierarchy was a similar, though lessrecognised development in all the kingdoms of nature. In the mineral kingdom,for instance, certain of the minerals or elements received an added stimulation,and became radioactive, and a mysterious chemical change took place in thevegetable kingdom. This facilitated the bridging process between the vegetableand animal kingdoms, just as the radio-activity of minerals is the method ofbridging the gulf between the mineral and vegetable kingdoms. In due course oftime scientists will recognise that every kingdom in nature is linked andentered when the units of that kingdom become radioactive. But it is notnecessary for us to digress along these lines. A hint suffices for those whohave eyes to see, and the intuition to comprehend the meaning conveyed by termswhich are handicapped by having a purely material connotation.In Lemurian days, after the great descent of the spiritual Existences to theearth, the work They planned to do was systematised. Offices were apportioned,and the processes of evolution in all the departments of nature were broughtunder the conscious wise guidance of this initial Brotherhood. This Hierarchy ofBrothers of Light still exists, and the work goes steadily on. They are all inphysical existence, either in dense physical bodies, such as many of the Mastersemploy, or in etheric bodies, such as the more exalted helpers and the Lord ofthe World occupy. It is of value for men to remember that They are in physicalexistence, and to bear in mind that They exist upon this planet with us,controlling its destinies, guiding its affairs, and leading all its evolutionson to an ultimate perfection.The central home of this Hierarchy is at Shamballa, a centre in the Gobi desert,called in the ancient books the \"White Island.\" It exists in etheric matter, andwhen the race of men on earth have developed etheric vision its location will berecognised and its reality admitted. The development of this vision is rapidlycoming to pass, as may be seen from the newspapers and the current literature ofthe day, but the location of Shamballa will be one of the latest etheric sacredspots to be revealed as it exists in the matter of the second ether. Several ofthe Masters in physical bodies dwell in the Himalaya mountains, in a secludedspot called Shigatse, far from the ways of men, but the greater number arescattered all over the world, dwelling in different places in the variousnations, unrecognised and unknown, yet forming each in His own place a focalpoint for the energy of the Lord of the World, and proving to His environment adistributor of the love and wisdom of the Deity.The opening of the Door of Initiation .It is not possible to touch upon the history of the Hierarchy during the longages of its work, beyond mentioning certain outstanding events of the past, andpointing out certain eventualities. For ages after its immediate founding, thework was slow and discouraging. Thousands of years came and went, and races ofmen appeared and disappeared from the earth before it was possible to delegateeven the work done by initiates of the first degree to the evolving sons of men.But in the middle of the fourth root-race, the Atlantean, an event occurredwhich necessitated a change, or innovation in the Hierarchical method. Certainof its members were called away to higher work elsewhere in the solar system,and this brought in, through necessity, a number of highly evolved units of thehuman family. In order to enable others to take Their place, the lesser membersof the Hierarchy were all moved up a step, leaving vacancies among the minorposts. Therefore three things were decided upon in the Council Chamber of theLord of the World.1. To close the door through which animal men passed into the human kingdom,permitting for a time no more Monads on the higher plane to appropriate bodies.This restricted the number of the fourth, or human kingdom, to its thenlimitation.2. To open another door, and permit members of the human family who were willingto undergo the necessary discipline and to make the required stupendous effort,to enter the fifth or spiritual kingdom. In this way the ranks of the Hierarchycould be filled by the members of earth's humanity who qualified. This door iscalled the Portal of Initiation, and still remains open upon the same terms aslaid down by the Lord of the World in Atlantean days. These terms will be statedin the last chapter of this book. The door between the human and animal kingdomswill again be opened during the next great cycle, or \"round\" as it is called insome books, but as this is several million years away from us at this time, weare not concerned with it.3. It was also decided to make the line of demarcation between the two forces ofmatter and spirit clearly defined; the inherent duality of all manifestation wasemphasised, with the aim in view of teaching men how to liberate themselves fromthe limitations of the fourth, or human kingdom, and thus pass on into thefifth, or spiritual. The problem of good or evil, light or darkness, right orwrong, was enunciated solely for the benefit of humanity, and to enable men tocast off the fetters which imprisoned spirit, and thus achieve spiritualfreedom. This problem exists not in the kingdoms below man, nor for those whotranscend the human. Man has to learn through experience and pain the fact ofthe duality of all existence. Having thus learnt, he chooses that which concernsthe fully conscious spirit aspect of divinity, and learns to centre himself inthat aspect. Having thus achieved liberation he finds indeed that all is one,that spirit and matter are a unity, naught existing save that which is to befound within the consciousness of the Planetary Logos, and—in widercircles—within the consciousness of the Solar Logos.The Hierarchy thus took advantage of the discriminative faculty of mind, whichis the distinctive quality of humanity, to enable him, through the balancing ofthe pairs of opposites, to reach his goal, and to find his way back to thesource from whence he came.This decision led to that great struggle which distinguished the Atlanteancivilisation, and which culminated in the destruction called the flood, referredto in all the Scriptures of the world. The forces of light, and the forces ofdarkness, were arrayed against each other, and this for the helping of humanity.The struggle still persists, and the World War through which we have just passedwas a recrudescence of it. On every side in that World War two groups were to befound, those who fought for an ideal as they saw it, for the highest that theyknew, and those who fought for material and selfish advantage. In the struggleof these influential idealists or materialists many were swept in who foughtblindly and ignorantly, being thus overwhelmed with racial karma and disaster.These three decisions of the Hierarchy are having, and will have a profoundeffect upon humanity, but the result desired is being achieved, and a rapidhastening of the evolutionary process, and a profoundly important effect uponthe mind aspect in man, can already be seen.It might here be well to point out that, working as members of that Hierarchyare a great number of beings called angels by the Christian, and devas by theoriental. Many of them have passed through the human stage long ages ago, andwork now in the ranks of the great evolution parallel to the human, and which iscalled the deva evolution. This evolution comprises among other factors, thebuilders of the objective planet and the forces which produce, through thosebuilders, every form familiar and unfamiliar. The devas who co-operate with theHierarchical effort, concern themselves, therefore, with the form aspect, whilstthe other members of the Hierarchy are occupied with the development ofconsciousness within the form."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER V THE THREE DEPARTMENTS OF THE HIERARCHYWe have already dealt with the subject of the founding of the Hierarchy uponearth, and we saw how it came to be, touching likewise upon certain crises whichhave occurred, and which still affect events in the present time. In dealingwith the work and aims of the personnel of the Hierarchy, it will not bepossible to state what those aims have been, nor to consider in detail who theactive personalities have been during the past millennia of years since theHierarchy came into existence.Many great Beings from planetary and solar sources, and once or twice fromcosmic sources, have at times lent Their aid and dwelt briefly upon our planet.By the energy which flowed through Them, and by Their profound wisdom andexperience, They stimulated earth's evolutions and brought the purposes of thePlanetary Logos so much the nearer to completion. Then They passed on, and Theirplaces were taken by those among the members of the Hierarchy Who were willingto undergo a specific training and expansion of consciousness. In turn theseadepts and Masters had Their places filled by initiates, and thus constantly hasthere been opportunity for disciples and highly evolved men and women to passinto the ranks of the Hierarchy, and thus constantly has there been acirculation of new life and blood, and the coming in of those who belong to aparticular period or age.Some of the great names during the later periods are known to history, such asShri Sankaracharya, Vyasa, Mahommet, Jesus of Nazareth, and Krishna, down tothose lesser initiates, Paul of Tarsus, Luther, and certain of the outstandinglights in European history. Always have these men and women been agents for thecarrying out of race purpose, for the bringing about of group conditions, andfor the furthering of the evolution of humanity. Sometimes they have appeared asbeneficent forces, bringing peace and contentment with them. More often havethey come as agents of destruction, breaking up the old forms of religion and ofgovernment in order that the life within the rapidly crystallising form might beset free and build for itself a newer and a better vehicle.Much that is stated here is already well known, and has already been given outin the different occult books. Yet in the wise and careful enunciation ofcollected facts, and their correlation with that which may be new to somestudents, comes an eventual synthetic grasp of the great plan, and a wiseuniform realisation as to the work of that great group of liberated souls who,in utter self-abnegation, stand silently behind the world panorama. Through thepower of their will, the strength of their meditations, the wisdom of theirplans, and the scientific knowledge of energy which is theirs, they direct thoseforce currents, and control those form-building agencies which produce all thatis seen and unseen, movable and immovable in the sphere of creation within thethree worlds. This, coupled to their vast experience, is what fits them to bethe agents for the distribution of the energy of the Planetary Logos.As has already been stated, at the head of affairs, controlling each unit anddirecting all evolution, stands the KING, the Lord of the World, Sanat Kumara,the Youth of Endless Summers, and the Fountainhead of the Will, (showing forthas Love) of the Planetary Logos. Co-operating with Him as His advisers are threePersonalities called the Pratyeka Buddhas, or the Buddhas of Activity. Thesefour are the embodiment of active intelligent loving will. They are the fullflowering of the intelligence, having achieved in an earlier solar system thatwhich man is now striving to perfect. In earlier cycles in this system Theybegan to demonstrate intelligent love, and from the standpoint of the averagehuman being They are perfect love and perfect intelligence, though from thestandpoint of that Existence Who embraces even our planetary scheme in His bodyof manifestation, that love aspect is as yet but in process of developing, andthe will is only embryonic. Another solar system will see the will aspect cometo fruition, as love will mature in this.Standing around the Lord of the World, but withdrawn and esoteric, are threemore Kumaras, Who make the seven of planetary manifestation. Their work is to usnecessarily obscure. The three exoteric Buddhas, or Kumaras, are the sumtotal ofactivity or planetary energy, and the three esoteric Kumaras embody types ofenergy which as yet are not in full demonstration upon our planet. Each of thesesix Kumaras is a reflection of, and the distributing agent for, the energy andforce of one of the six other Planetary Logoi, the remaining six spirits beforethe Throne. Sanat Kumara alone, in this scheme, is self-sustaining andself-sufficient, being the physical incarnation of one of the Planetary Logoi,which one it is not permissible to state, as this fact is one of the secrets ofinitiation. Through each of Them passes the life force of one of the six rays,and in considering Them one might sum up Their work and position as follows:—1. They each embody one of the six types of energy, with the Lord of the Worldas the synthesiser and the embodier of the perfect seventh type, our planetarytype.2. They are each distinguished by one of the six colours, with the Lord of theWorld showing forth the full planetary colour, these six being subsidiary.3. Their work is therefore concerned, not only with force distribution, but withthe passing into our scheme from other planetary schemes, of Egos seeking earthexperience.4. Each of Them is in direct communication with one or another of the sacredplanets.5. According to astrological conditions, and according to the turning of theplanetary wheel of life, so one or another of these Kumaras will be active. Thethree Buddhas of Activity change from time to time, and become in turn exotericor esoteric as the case may be. Only the King persists steadily and watchfullyin active physical incarnation.Besides these main presiding Personalities in the Council Chamber at Shamballa,there is a group of four Beings Who are the representatives upon the planet ofthe four Maharajas, or the four Lords of Karma in the solar system, who arespecifically concerned with the evolution at the present time of the humankingdom. These four are connected with:—1. The distribution of karma, or human destiny, as it affects individuals, andthrough the individuals, the groups.2. The care and tabulation of the akashic records. They are concerned with theHalls of Records, or with the \"keeping of the book,\" as it is called in theChristian Bible; They are known in the Christian world as the recording angels.3. The participation in solar councils. They alone have the right during theworld cycle to pass beyond the periphery of the planetary scheme, andparticipate in the councils of the Solar Logos. Thus They are literallyplanetary mediators, representing our Planetary Logos and all that concerns Himin the greater scheme of which He is but a part.Co-operating with these karmic Lords are the large groups of initiates and devaswho occupy themselves with the right adjustment of:—a. World karma, b. Racial karma, c. National karma, d. Group karma, e.Individual karma, and who are responsible to the Planetary Logos for the correctmanipulation of those forces and building agencies which bring in the right Egoson the different rays at the correct times and seasons.With all these groups we have little concern, for they are contacted only byinitiates of the third initiation, and by those of even more exalted rank.The remaining personnel of the Hierarchy is divided into three main and foursubsidiary groups, each of these groups, as will be seen by reference to theappended chart, being presided over by one of Those Whom we call the three GreatLords.The work of the Manu .The Manu presides over group one. He is called Vaivasvata Manu, and is the Manuof the fifth root-race. He is the ideal man or thinker, and sets the type forour Aryan race, having presided over its destinies since its inception nearlyone hundred thousand years ago. Other Manus have come and gone and His placewill be, in the relatively near future, taken by someone else. He will then passon to other work of a more exalted kind. The Manu, or the prototype of thefourth root-race, works in close co-operation with Him, and has His centre ofinfluence in China. He is the second Manu that the fourth root-race has had,having taken the place of the earlier Manu at the time of the final stages ofAtlantean destruction. He has remained to foster the development of the racetype, and to bring about its final disappearance. The periods of office of allthe Manus overlap, but there remains no representative of the third root-raceupon the globe at this time. Vaivasvata Manu has His dwelling place in theHimalaya mountains. and has gathered around Him at Shigatse some of thoseimmediately connected with Aryan affairs in India, Europe and America, and thosewho will later be concerned with the coming sixth root-race. The plans areprepared for ages ahead, centres of energy are formed thousands of years beforethey will be required, and in the wise fore-knowledge of these Divine Mennothing is left to sudden eventuation, but all moves in ordered cycles and underrule and law, though within karmic limitations.The work of the Manu is largely concerned with government, with planetarypolitics, and with the founding, direction, and dissolution of racial types andforms. To Him is committed the will and purpose of the Planetary Logos. He knowswhat is the immediate objective for this cycle of evolution over which He has topreside, and His work concerns itself with making that will an accomplishedfact. He works in closer co-operation with the building devas than does HisBrother, the Christ, for to Him is given the work of setting the race type, ofsegregating the groups out of which races will develop, of manipulating theforces which move the earth's crust, of raising and lowering continents, ofdirecting the minds of statesmen everywhere so that racial government willproceed as desired, and conditions be brought about which will produce thoseneeded for the fostering of any particular type. Such a work can now be seendemonstrating in North America and Australia.The energy which flows through Him emanates from the head centre of thePlanetary Logos, passing to Him through the brain of Sanat Kumara, Who focalisesall the planetary energy within Himself. He works by the means of a dynamicmeditation, conducted within the head centre, and produces His results throughHis perfect realisation of that which has to be accomplished, through a power tovisualise that which must be done to bring about accomplishment, and through acapacity to transmit creative and destructive energy to those who are Hisassistants. And all this is brought about through the power of the enunciatedsound.The work of the World Teacher, the Christ .Group two has the World Teacher for its presiding Head. He is that Great BeingWhom the Christian calls the Christ; He is known also in the Orient as theBodhisattva, and as the Lord Maitreya, and is the One looked for by the devoutMohammedan, under the name of the Iman Madhi. He it is Who has presided over thedestinies of life since about 600 B.C. and He it is Who has come out among menbefore, and Who is again looked for. He is the great Lord of Love and ofCompassion, just as his predecessor, the Buddha, was the Lord of Wisdom.Through Him flows the energy of the second aspect, reaching Him direct from theheart centre of the Planetary Logos via the heart of Sanat Kumara. He works bymeans of a meditation centred within the heart. He is the World Teacher, theMaster of the Masters, and the Instructor of the Angels, and to Him is committedthe guidance of the spiritual destinies of men, and the development of therealisation within each human being that he is a child of God and a son of theMost High.Just as the Manu is occupied with the providing of the type and forms throughwhich consciousness can evolve and gather experience, thus making existence inits deepest sense possible, so the World Teacher directs that indwellingconsciousness in its life or spirit aspect, seeking to energise it within theform so that, in due course of time, that form can be discarded and theliberated spirit return whence it came. Ever since He left the earth, as relatedwith approximate accuracy in the Bible story (though with much error in detail)has He stayed with the sons of men; never has He really gone, but only inappearance, and in a physical body He can be found by those who know the way,dwelling in the Himalayas, and working in close co-operation with His two greatBrothers, the Manu and the Mahachohan. Daily He pours out His blessing on theworld, and daily He stands under the great pine in His garden at the sunset hourwith hands uplifted in blessing over all those who truly and earnestly seek toaspire. To Him all seekers are known, and, though they may remain unaware ofHim, the light which He pours forth stimulates their desire, fosters the sparkof struggling life and spurs on the aspirant until the momentous day dawns whenthey stand face to face with the One Who by being \"lifted up\" (occultlyunderstood) is drawing all men unto Himself as the Initiator of the sacredmysteries.The work of the Lord of Civilisation, the Mahachohan .Group three has as its Head the Mahachohan. His rule over the group persists fora longer period than that of His two Brothers, and He may hold office for theterm of several root-races. He is the sumtotal of the intelligence aspect. Thepresent Mahachohan is not the original one Who held the office at the foundingof the Hierarchy in Lemurian days—it was then held by one of the Kumaras, orLords of the Flame, Who came into incarnation with Sanat Kumara—but He took holdof His position during the second sub-race of the Atlantean root-race. He hadachieved adeptship on the moon-chain, and it was through His instrumentalitythat a large number of the present more advanced human beings came intoincarnation in the middle of the Atlantean root-race. Karmic affiliation withHim was one of the predisposing causes, thus making this eventuality possible.His work concerns itself with the fostering and strengthening of that relationbetween spirit and matter, life and form, the self and the not-self, whichresults in what we call civilisation. He manipulates the forces of nature, andis largely the emanating source of electrical energy as we know it. Being thereflection of the third, or creative aspect, energy from the Planetary Logosflows to Him from the throat centre, and He it is Who in many ways makes thework of His Brothers possible. Their plans and desires are submitted to Him, andthrough Him pass the instructions to a large number of the deva agents.Thus you have Will, Love, and Intelligence represented in these three greatLords; you have the self, the not-self, and the relation between synthesised inthe unity of manifestation; you have racial government, religion andcivilisation forming a coherent whole, and you have physical manifestation, thelove or desire aspect, and the mind of the Planetary Logos working out intoobjectivity. The closest co-operation and unity exists between these threePersonalities, and every move and plan and event exists in Their unitedforeknowledge. They are in daily touch with the Lord of the World at Shamballa,and the entire guidance of affairs rests in Their hands, and in those of theManu of the fourth root-race. The World Teacher holds office in connection withboth the fourth and fifth root-races.Each of these departmental heads directs a number of subsidiary offices, and thedepartment of the Mahachohan is divided into five divisions, so as to take inthe four lesser aspects of Hierarchical rule.Under the Manu work the regents of the different world divisions, such as, forinstance, the Master Jupiter, the oldest of the Masters now working in physicalbodies for humanity, Who is the regent for India, and the Master Rakoczi, Who isthe regent for Europe and America. It must be remembered here that though theMaster R., for instance, belongs to the seventh ray, and thus comes under thedepartment of energy of the Mahachohan, yet in Hierarchical work He may and doeshold office temporarily under the Manu. These regents hold in Their hands thereins of government for continents and nations, thus guiding, even if unknown,their destinies; They impress and inspire statesmen and rulers; They pour forthmental energy on governing groups, thus bringing about the desired resultswherever co-operation and receptive intuition can be found amongst the thinkers.The World Teacher presides over the destiny of the great religions through themedium of a group of Masters and initiates Who direct the activities of thesedifferent schools of thought. In illustration:—The Master Jesus, the inspirerand director of the Christian Churches every where, though an adept on the sixthray under the department of the Mahachohan, works at present under the Christfor the welfare of Christianity; other Masters hold similar posts in relation tothe great oriental faiths, and the various occidental schools of thought.In the department of the Mahachohan a large number of Masters, in fivefolddivision, work in connection with the deva evolution, and with the intelligenceaspect in man. Their divisions follow those of the four minor rays ofattribute:—1. The ray of harmony or beauty.2. The ray of concrete science or knowledge.3. The ray of devotion or abstract idealism.4. The ray of ceremonial law or magic, just as the three departmental headsrepresent the three major rays of:I. Will or power.II. Love or wisdom.III. Active intelligence, or adaptability.The four rays or attributes of mind, with the third ray of intelligence, assynthesised by the Mahachohan, make up the sumtotal of the fifth principle ofmind or manas.Solar and Planetary Hierarchies [Image00002.jpg] Key to Diagram of Solar andPlanetary Hierarchies [Image00003.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VI THE LODGE OF MASTERSThe divisions .We have considered somewhat the highest offices in the ranks of the Hierarchy ofour planet. Now we will deal with what we might call the two divisions intowhich the remaining members are divided. They form literally two Lodges withinthe greater body:—a. The —— Lodge, comprised of initiates above the fifth initiation, and a groupof devas or angels. b. The Blue Lodge, comprised of all initiates of the third,fourth, and fifth initiations.Below these come a large group of initiates of the first and second initiations,and then the disciples of every grade. The disciples are considered asaffiliated with the Lodge, but not as literally members of it. Finally comethose who are on probation, and who hope through strenuous effort to achieveaffiliation.From another point of view we can consider the Lodge members as existing inseven groups, each group representing one type of the sevenfold planetary energyemanating from the Planetary Logos. The triple division has first been given, asever in evolution you have the major three (manifesting through the threedepartments) and then the seven, these seven showing again as a tripledifferentiation and a septenary. Students must bear in mind that all that isherein imparted concerns the work of the Hierarchy in connection with the fourthor human kingdom, and refers especially to those Masters Who work in connectionwith humanity. Were the deva evolution being dealt with, the entire tabulationand division would have to differ from this.Again, there are certain aspects of hierarchical work affecting, for instance,the animal kingdom; this work calls into activity beings and workers and adeptstotally distinct from the servers of the fourth or human kingdom. Thereforestudents should carefully remember that all these details are relative, and thatthe work and personnel of the Hierarchy are infinitely greater and moreimportant than may appear upon a superficial reading of these pages. Certainlywe are dealing with what might be considered Its primary work, for in theservice of the human kingdom we are concerned with the manifestation of thethree aspects of divinity, but the other departments are interdependent and thework progresses as a synthetic whole.The workers, or adepts, concerned with the evolution of the human family,comprise sixty-three, if the three great Lords are counted in making the ninetimes seven necessary for the work. Of these forty-nine work exoterically, if itmight be so expressed, and fourteen esoterically, being more concerned with thesubjective manifestation. Not many of Their names are known to the public, norwould it be wise in many cases to reveal Who They are, where They dwell, andwhat is Their particular sphere of activity. A very small minority, throughgroup karma and a willingness thus to sacrifice Themselves, have come before thepublic eye during the past one hundred years, and therefore concerning these,certain information may be given out. Quite a number of people in the worldtoday are aware of Their existence independently of any particular school ofthought, and the realisation that Those Whom they thus know personally areworkers in a great and unified scheme of endeavour may encourage these realknowers to testify to their knowledge, and thus establish past all controversythe reality of Their work. Certain schools of occultism and of theosophicalendeavour have claimed to be the sole repository of Their teaching, and the soleoutlet for Their efforts, thereby limiting that which They do, and formulatingpremises which time and circumstance will fail to substantiate. They work mostassuredly through such groups of thinkers, and throw much of Their force intothe work of such organisations, yet, nevertheless, They have Their disciples andTheir followers everywhere, and work through many bodies and many aspects ofteaching. Throughout the world, disciples of these Masters have come intoincarnation at this time with the sole intent of participating in the activitiesand occupations and truth dissemination of the various churches, sciences, andphilosophies, and thus producing within the organisation itself an expansion, awidening, and a disintegration where necessary, which might otherwise beimpossible. It might be wise for occult students everywhere to recognise thesefacts, and to cultivate the ability to recognise the hierarchical vibration asit demonstrates through the medium of disciples in the most unlikely places andgroups.One point should here be stated in connection with the work of the Mastersthrough Their disciples, and it is this. All the various schools of thoughtwhich are fostered by the energy of the Lodge are, in every case, founded by adisciple, or several disciples, and upon these disciples, and not upon theMaster, lies responsibility for results and the consequent karma. The method ofprocedure is somewhat as follows:—The Master reveals to a disciple the objectivein view for an immediate little cycle, and suggests to him that such and such adevelopment would be desirable. It is the work of the disciple to ascertain thebest method for bringing about the desired results, and to formulate the planswhereby a certain percentage of success will be possible. Then he launches hisscheme, founds his society or organisation, and disseminates the necessaryteaching. Upon him rests the responsibility for choosing the right co-workers,for handing on the work to those best fitted, and for clothing the teaching in apresentable garb. All that the Master does is to look on with interest andsympathy at the endeavour, as long as it holds its initial high ideal andproceeds with pure altruism upon its way. The Master is not to blame should thedisciple show lack of discrimination in the choice of co-workers, or evidence aninability to represent the truth. If he does well, and the work proceeds asdesired, the Master will continue to pour His blessing upon the attempt. If hefails, or his successors turn from the original impulse, thus disseminatingerror of any kind, in His love and in His sympathy the Master will withdraw thatblessing, withhold His energy, and thus cease from stimulating that which hadbetter die. Forms may come and go, and the interest of the Master and Hisblessing pour through this or that channel; the work may proceed through onemedium or another, but always the life force persists, shattering the form whereit is inadequate, or utilising it when it suffices for the immediate need.Certain Masters and Their Work .Under the first great group of which the Manu is the Head, can be found twoMasters, the Master Jupiter, and the Master Morya. Both of them have taken morethan the fifth initiation, and the Master Jupiter, Who is also the Regent ofIndia, is looked up to by all the Lodge of Masters as the oldest among Them. Hedwells in the Nilgherry Hills in Southern India, and is not one of the MastersWho usually takes pupils, for He numbers amongst His disciples initiates of highdegree and quite a number of Masters. In His hands are the reins of governmentfor India, including a large part of the Northern frontier, and to Him iscommitted the arduous task of eventually guiding India out of her present chaosand unrest, and of welding her diverse peoples into an ultimate synthesis. TheMaster Morya, Who is one of the best known of the Eastern adepts, and Whonumbers amongst His pupils a large number of Europeans and Americans, is aRajput Prince, and for many decades held an authoritative position in Indianaffairs.He works in close co-operation with the Manu, and will Himself eventually holdoffice as the Manu of the sixth root-race. He dwells, as does His Brother, theMaster K. H., at Shigatse in the Himalayas, and is a well-known figure to theinhabitants of that far-away village. He is a man of tall and commandingpresence, dark hair and beard and dark eyes, and might be considered stern wereit not for the expression that lies in His eyes. He and His Brother, the MasterK. H., work almost as a unit, and have done so for many centuries and will, oninto the future, for the Master K. H. is in line for the office of World Teacherwhen the present holder of that office vacates it for higher work, and the sixthroot-race comes into being. The houses in which They both dwell are closetogether, and much of Their time is spent in the closest association. As theMaster M. is upon the first Ray, that of Will or Power, His work largelyconcerns itself with the carrying out of the plans of the present Manu. He actsas the Inspirer of the statesmen of the world, He manipulates forces, throughthe Mahachohan, that will bring about the conditions desired for the furtheringof racial evolution. On the physical plane those great national executives whohave far vision and the international ideal are influenced by Him, and with Himco-operate certain of the great devas of the mental plane, and three greatgroups of angels work with Him on mental levels, in connection with the lesserdevas who vitalise thoughtforms, and thus keep alive the thoughtforms of theGuides of the race for the benefit of the whole of humanity.The Master M. has a large body of pupils under His instruction, and works inconnection with many organisations of an esoteric and occult kind, as well asthrough the politicians and statesmen of the world.The Master Koot Humi, Who is also very well known in the occident, and has manypupils everywhere, is of Kashmiri origin, though the family originally came fromIndia. He is also an initiate of high degree, and is upon the second, or theLove-Wisdom Ray. He is a man of noble presence, and tall, though of ratherslighter build than the Master M. He is of fair complexion, with golden-brownhair and beard, and eyes of a wonderful deep blue, through which seem to pourthe love and the wisdom of the ages. He has had a wide experience and education,having been originally educated at one of the British universities, and speaksEnglish fluently. His reading is wide and extensive, and all the current booksand literature in various languages find their way to His study in theHimalayas. He concerns Himself largely with the vitalising of certain of thegreat philosophies, and interests Himself in a number of philanthropic agencies.To Him is given the work very largely of stimulating the love manifestationwhich is latent in the hearts of all men, and of awakening in the consciousnessof the race the perception of the great fundamental fact of brotherhood.At this particular time the Master M., the Master K. H. and the Master Jesus areinteresting Themselves closely with the work of unifying, as far as may be,eastern and western thought, so that the great religions of the East, with thelater development of the Christian faith in all its many branches, may mutuallybenefit each other. Thus eventually it is hoped one great universal Church maycome into being.The Master Jesus, Who is the focal point of the energy that flows through thevarious Christian churches, is at present living in a Syrian body, and dwells ina certain part of the Holy Land. He travels much and passes considerable time invarious parts of Europe. He works specially with masses more than withindividuals, though He has gathered around Him quite a numerous body of pupils.He is upon the sixth Ray of Devotion, or Abstract Idealism, and His pupils arefrequently distinguished by that fanaticism and devotion which manifested inearlier Christian times amongst the martyrs. He Himself is rather a martialfigure, a disciplinarian, and a man of iron rule and will. He is tall and sparewith rather a long thin face, black hair, pale complexion and piercing blueeyes. His work at this time is exceedingly responsible, for to Him is given theproblem of steering the thought of the occident out of its present state ofunrest into the peaceful waters of certitude and knowledge, and of preparing theway in Europe and America for the eventual coming of the World Teacher. He iswell known in the Bible history, coming before us first as Joshua the Son ofNun, appearing again in the time of Ezra as Jeshua, taking the third initiation,as related in the book of Zechariah, as Joshua, and in the Gospel story He isknown for two great sacrifices, that in which He handed over His body for theuse of the Christ, and for the great renunciation which is the characteristic ofthe fourth initiation. As Appollonius of Tyana, He took the fifth initiation andbecame a Master of the Wisdom. From that time on He has stayed and worked withthe Christian Church, fostering the germ of true spiritual life which is to befound amongst members of all sects and divisions, and neutralising as far aspossible the mistakes and errors of the churchmen and the theologians. He isdistinctively the Great Leader, the General, and the wise Executive, and inChurch matters He co-operates closely with the Christ, thus saving Him much andacting as His intermediary wherever possible. No one so wisely knows as He theproblems of the West, no one is so closely in touch with the people who standfor all that is best in Christian teachings, and no one is so well aware of theneed of the present moment. Certain great prelates of the Anglican and CatholicChurches are wise agents of His.The Master Djwhal Khul, or the Master D. K. as He is frequently called, isanother adept on the second Ray of Love-Wisdom. He is the latest of the adeptstaking initiation, having taken the fifth initiation in 1875, and is thereforeoccupying the same body in which He took the initiation, most of the otherMasters having taken the fifth initiation whilst occupying earlier vehicles. Hisbody is not a young one, and He is a Tibetan. He is very devoted to the MasterK. H. and occupies a little house not far distant from the larger one of theMaster, and from His willingness to serve and to do anything that has to bedone, He has been called \"the Messenger of the Masters.\" He is profoundlylearned, and knows more about the rays and planetary Hierarchies of the solarsystem than anyone else in the ranks of the Masters. He works with those whoheal, and co-operates unknown and unseen with the seekers after truth in theworld's great laboratories, with all who definitely aim at the healing andsolacing of the world, and with the great philanthropic world movements such asthe Red Cross. He occupies Himself with various pupils of different Masters whocan profit by His instruction, and within the last ten years has relieved boththe Master M. and the Master K. H. of a good deal of Their teaching work, takingover from Them for certain stated times some of Their pupils and disciples. Heworks largely, too, with certain groups of the devas of the ethers, who are thehealing devas, and who thus collaborate with Him in the work of healing some ofthe physical ills of humanity. He it was Who dictated a large part of thatmomentous book The Secret Doctrine, and Who showed to H. P. Blavatsky many ofthe pictures, and gave her much of the data that is to be found in that book.The Master Who concerns Himself especially with the future development of racialaffairs in Europe, and with the mental outgrowth in America and Australia, isthe Master Rakoczi. He is a Hungarian, and has a home in the Carpathianmountains, and was at one time a well-known figure at the Hungarian Court.Reference to Him can be found in old historical books, and He was particularlybefore the public eye when he was the Comte de St. Germain, and earlier stillwhen he was both Roger Bacon and later, Francis Bacon. It is interesting to notethat as the Master R. takes hold, on the inner planes, of affairs in Europe, Hisname as Francis Bacon is coming before the public eye in the Bacon-Shakespearecontroversy. He is rather a small, spare man, with pointed black beard, andsmooth black hair, and does not take as many pupils as do the Masters previouslymentioned. He is at present handling the majority of the third ray pupils in theoccident in conjunction with the Master Hilarion. The Master R. is upon theseventh Ray, that of Ceremonial Magic or Order, and He works largely throughesoteric ritual and ceremonial, being vitally interested in the effects,hitherto unrecognised, of the ceremonial of the Freemasons, of the variousfraternities and of the Churches everywhere. He is called in the Lodge, usually,\"the Count,\" and in America and Europe acts practically as the general managerfor the carrying out of the plans of the executive council of the Lodge. Certainof the Masters form around the three great Lords an inner group, and meet incouncil with great frequency.On the fifth Ray of Concrete Knowledge or Science, we find the Master Hilarion,who, in an earlier incarnation was Paul of Tarsus. He is occupying a Cretanbody, but spends a large part of His time in Egypt. He it was Who gave out tothe world that occult treatise \"Light on the Path,\" and His work is particularlyinteresting to the general public at this crisis, for He works with those whoare developing the intuition, and controls and transmutes the great movementsthat tend to strip the veil from the unseen. His is the energy which, throughHis disciples, is stimulating the Psychical Research groups everywhere, and Heit was Who initiated, through various pupils of His, the Spiritualisticmovement. He has under observation all those who are psychics of the higherorder, and assists in developing their powers for the good of the group, and inconnection with certain of the devas of the astral plane He works to open up tothe seekers after truth that subjective world which lies behind the grosslymaterial.Little can be given out anent the two English Masters. Neither of them takespupils in the same sense that the Master K. H. or the Master M. take pupils. Oneof Them, who resides in Great Britain, has in hand the definite guidance of theAnglo-Saxon race, and He works upon the plans for its future development andevolution. He is behind the Labour movement throughout the world, transmutingand directing, and the present rising tide of democracy has His directing handupon it. Out of the democratic unrest, out of the present turmoil and chaos,will arise the future world condition which will have for its keynoteco-operation and not competition, distribution, and not centralisation.One other Master may here be briefly mentioned, the Master Serapis, frequentlycalled the Egyptian. He is the Master upon the fourth ray, and the great artmovements of the world, the evolution of music, and that of painting and drama,receive from Him an energising impulse. At present He is giving most of His timeand attention to the work of the deva, or angel evolution, until their agencyhelps to make possible the great revelation in the world of music and paintingwhich lies immediately ahead. More about Him cannot be given out, nor can Hisdwelling place be revealed.The Master P. works under the Master R. in North America. He it is Who has hadmuch to do esoterically with the various mental sciences, such as ChristianScience, and New Thought, both of which are efforts put forth by the Lodge in anendeavour to teach men the reality of that which is not seen, and the power ofthe mind to create. This Master occupies an Irish body, is on the fourth ray,and the place of His residence may not be revealed. Much of the work of theMaster Serapis was taken over by Him when the latter turned His attention to thedeva evolution.The present work .Certain facts concerning these Masters, and Their work in the present and in thefuture, may be in place here. First, the work of training Their pupils anddisciples to fit them to be of use in two great events, one, the coming of theWorld Teacher towards the middle or close of this present century, and theother, the training of them to be of use in the founding of the new sixthsub-race and in the reconstruction of the present world conditions. This beingthe fifth sub-race of the fifth root-race, the pressure of the work on the fiverays of mind which are controlled by the Mahachohan, is very great. The Mastersare carrying an over heavy burden, and much of Their work of teaching discipleshas been delegated to initiates and advanced disciples, and certain of theMasters on the first and second rays have temporarily taken over pupils in theMahachohan's department.Secondly, the preparation of the world on a large scale for the coming of theWorld Teacher, and the taking of the necessary steps before They Themselves comeout among men, as many of Them surely will towards the close of this century. Aspecial group is forming amongst Them now Who are definitely preparingThemselves for this work. The Master M., the Master K. H. and the Master Jesuswill be specially concerned with the movement towards the last quarter of thiscentury. Other Masters will participate also, but these three are the ones withWhose names and offices people should familiarise themselves, wherever possible.Two other Masters, specially concerned with the seventh or ceremonial ray, Whoseparticular work it is to supervise the development of certain activities withinthe next fifteen years, work under the Master R. Very definitely may theassurance be given here, that prior to the coming of the Christ, adjustmentswill be made so that at the head of all great organisations will be found eithera Master, or an initiate who has taken the third initiation. At the head ofcertain of the great occult groups, of the Freemasons of the world, and of thevarious great divisions of the Church, and resident in many of the great nationswill be found initiates or Masters. This work of the Masters is proceeding now,and all Their efforts are being bent towards bringing it to a successfulconsummation. Everywhere They are gathering in those who in any way show atendency to respond to high vibration, seeking to force their vibration and tofit them so that they may be of use at the time of the coming of the Christ.Great is the day of opportunity, for when that time comes, through thestupendous strength of the vibration then brought to bear upon the sons of men,it will be possible for those who now do the necessary work to take a great stepforward, and to pass through the portal of initiation."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VII THE PROBATIONARY PATHPreparation for Initiation .The Probationary Path precedes the Path of Initiation or Holiness, and marksthat period in the life of a man when he definitely sets himself on the side ofthe forces of evolution, and works at the building of his own character. Hetakes himself in hand, cultivates the qualities that are lacking in hisdisposition, and seeks with diligence to bring his personality under control. Heis building the causal body with deliberate intent, filling any gaps that mayexist, and seeking to make it a fit receptacle for the Christ principle. Theanalogy between the prenatal period in the history of the human being and thatof the development of the indwelling spirit is curiously interesting. We mightlook at it in this way:—1. The moment of conception, corresponding to that of individualisation.2. Nine months’ gestation, corresponding to the wheel of life.3. The first initiation, corresponding to the birth hour.The Probationary Path corresponds to the latter period of gestation, to thebuilding in the heart of the babe in Christ. At the first initiation this babestarts on the pilgrimage of the Path. The first initiation stands simply forcommencement. A certain structure of right living, thinking, and conduct hasbeen built up. That form we call character. It has now to he vivified andindwelt. Thackeray has well described this process of building, in the words sooften quoted:—\"Sow a thought and reap an action; sow an action and reap a habit; sow a habitand reap character; sow character and reap destiny.\"The immortal destiny of each and all of us is to attain the consciousness of thehigher self, and subsequently that of the Divine Spirit. When the form is ready,when Solomon's temple has been built in the quarry of the personal life, thenthe Christ-life enters, and the glory of the Lord overshadows His temple. Theform becomes vibrant. Therein lies the difference between theory and making thattheory part of oneself. One can have a perfect image or picture, but it lackslife. The life can be modelled on the divine as far as may be; it may be anexcellent copy but lacks the indwelling Christ principle. The germ has beenthere, but it has lain dormant. Now it is fostered and brought to the birth andthe first initiation is attained.Whilst the man is on the Probationary Path he is taught principally to knowhimself, to ascertain his weaknesses and to correct them. He is taught to workas an invisible helper at first and for several lives is generally kept at thiskind of work. Later, as he makes progress, he may be moved to more selectedwork. He is taught the rudiments of the Divine Wisdom and is entered into thefinal grades in the Hall of Learning. He is known to a Master, and is in thecare (for definite teaching) of one of the disciples of that Master, or, if ofrare promise, of an initiate.Classes are held by initiates of the first and second degrees, for accepteddisciples and those on probation, between the hours of ten and five every nightin all parts of the world, so that the continuity of the teaching is complete.They gather in the Hall of Learning and the method is much the same as in thebig Universities,—classes at certain hours, experimental work, examinations, anda gradual moving up and onward as the tests are passed. A number of the Egos onthe Probationary Path are in the department that is analogous to the HighSchool; others have matriculated and are in the University itself. Graduationresults when initiation is taken and the initiate passes into the Hall ofWisdom.Advanced Egos and the spiritually inclined, who are not yet on the ProbationaryPath, attend instructions from disciples, and on occasions large classes areconducted for their benefit by initiates. Their work is more rudimentary, thoughoccult from a worldly standpoint, and they learn under supervision to beinvisible helpers. The invisible helpers are usually recruited from amongst theadvanced Egos. The very advanced, and those on the Probationary Path and nearinginitiation, work more frequently in what might be termed departmental work,forming a group of assistants to the Members of the Hierarchy.Methods of teaching .Three departments of instruction watch over three parts of man's development.First: Instruction is given tending to the disciplining of the life, the growthof character, the development of the microcosm along cosmic lines. The man istaught the meaning of himself; he comes to know himself as a complex, completeunit, a replica in miniature of the outer world. In learning the laws of his ownbeing, comes comprehension of the Self, and a realisation of the basic laws ofthe system.Secondly: Instruction is given as to the macrocosm, the amplification of hisintellectual grip of the working of the cosmos. Information as to the kingdomsof nature, teaching as to the laws of those kingdoms, and instruction as to theworking of those laws in all kingdoms and on all planes is given him. Heacquires a deep fund of general knowledge, and when he reaches his own peripheryhe is met by those who lead him on to encyclopaedic knowledge. When he hasattained the goal, he may not know every single thing that there is to be knownin all the three worlds, but the way to know, the sources of knowledge and thereservoirs of information are in his hand. A Master can at any time find outanything on any possible subject without the slightest difficulty.Thirdly: Instruction is given in what might be termed synthesis . Thisinformation is only possible as the intuitional vehicle co-ordinates. It isreally the occult apprehension of the law of gravitation or attraction, (thebasic law of this, the second solar system) with all its corollaries. Thedisciple learns the meaning of occult cohesion, and of that internal unity whichholds the system as a homogeneous unit. The major part of this instruction isusually given after the third initiation, but a beginning is made early in thetraining.Masters and disciples .Disciples and advanced Egos on the Probationary Path receive instruction at thisparticular time for two special purposes:—(a) To test out their fitness for special work lying in the future, the type ofthat work being known only to the Guides of the race. They are tested foraptitude in community living with a view to drafting the suitable ones into thecolony of the sixth sub-race. They are tested for various lines of work, manyincomprehensible to us now, but which will become ordinary methods ofdevelopment as time progresses. The Masters also test for those in whom theintuition has reached a point of development that indicates a beginning of theco-ordination of the buddhic vehicle, or—to be exact—has reached a point wheremolecules of the seventh sub-plane of the buddhic plane can be discerned in theaura of the Ego. When this is so They can go ahead with confidence in the workof instruction, knowing that certain imparted facts will be understood.(b) Instruction is being given at this time to a special group of people whohave come into incarnation at this critical period of the world's history. Theyhave come in, all at the same time, throughout the world, to do the work oflinking up the two planes, the physical and astral, via the etheric .This sentence is for serious consideration, for it covers the work that a numberof the newer generation have come to do. In this linking up of the two planespeople are required who are polarised in their mental bodies (or, if notpolarised there, are nevertheless well rounded out and balanced) and cantherefore work safely and with intelligence in this type of work. Itnecessitates primarily people in whose vehicles can be found a certainproportion of atomic sub-plane matter, so that direct communication can beeffected between the higher and the lower via the atomic cross-section of thecausal body. This is not easy to explain clearly, but a consideration of thediagram in \"A Study in Consciousness,\" by Mrs. Besant, page 27, may be helpfulin explaining some matters that are apt to puzzle.We must recognise two things in pondering the subject of the Masters and Theirdisciples. First, that in the Hierarchy nothing is lost through failure torecognise the law of economy. Every expenditure of force on the part of a Masteror Teacher is subjected to wise foresight and discrimination. just as we do notput university professors to teach the beginners, so the Masters Themselves worknot individually with men until they have attained a certain stage of evolutionand are ready to profit by Their instruction.Secondly, we must remember that each of us is recognised by the brilliance ofhis light. This is an occult fact. The finer the grade of matter built into ourbodies, the more brilliantly will shine forth the indwelling light. Light isvibration, and through the measurement of vibration is fixed the grading of thescholars. Hence nothing can prevent a man's progress forward if he but attendsto the purification of his vehicles. The light within will shine forth with evergreater clarity, as the refining process goes on, until—when atomic matterpredominates—great will be the glory of that inner man. We are all graded,therefore, if it may be so expressed, according to the magnitude of the light,according to the rate of vibration, according to the purity of the tone and theclarity of the colour. Who our Teacher is depends therefore upon our grading.Similarity of vibration holds the secret. We are frequently told that when thedemand is forceful enough the Teacher will appear. When we build in the rightvibrations and attune ourselves to the right key, nothing can prevent ourfinding the Master.Groups of Egos are formed:—1. According to their ray.2. According to their sub-ray.3. According to their rate of vibration.They are also grouped for purposes of classification:1. As Egos, according to the egoic ray.2. As personalities, according to the sub-ray which is governing thepersonality.All are graded and charted. The Masters have Their Halls of Records, with asystem of tabulation incomprehensible to us owing to its magnitude and itsnecessary intricacies, wherein these charts are kept. They are under the care ofa Chohan of a Ray, each ray having its own collection of charts. These charts,being in many sections (dealing with incarnate, discarnate, and perfected Egos),are again all under the care of subordinate guardians. The Lipika Lords, withTheir vast band of helpers are the most frequent users of these charts. Manydiscarnate egos awaiting incarnation or having just left the earth, sacrificetheir time in heaven to assist in this work. These Halls of Records are mostlyon the lowest levels of the mental plane and the highest of the astral, as theycan be there most fully utilised and are most easily accessible.Initiates receive instruction directly from the Masters or from some of thegreat devas or angels. These teachings are usually imparted at night in smallclasses, or individually (should the occasion warrant it) in the Master'sprivate study. The above applies to initiates in incarnation or on the innerplanes. If on causal levels, they receive instruction at any time deemedadvisable direct from the Master to the Ego on causal levels.Disciples are taught in groups in the Master's ashram, or classroom, at night,if in incarnation. Apart from these regular gatherings, in order to receivedirect teaching from the Master, a disciple (for some specific reason) may becalled to the Master's study for a private interview. This occurs when a Masterwishes to see a disciple for commendation, warning, or to decide if initiationis desirable. The major part of a disciple's tuition is left in the hands ofsome initiate or more advanced disciple, who watches over his younger brother,and is responsible to the Master for his progress, handing in regular reports.Karma is largely the arbiter of this relation.Just at present, owing to the great need in the world, a slightly differentpolicy is being pursued. An intensified training is being given to somedisciples by some Masters who have not hitherto taken pupils. The press of workon the Masters Who do take disciples being so great, They have delegated some ofTheir most promising pupils to some other Masters, drafting them into smallgroups for a brief period. The experiment is being tried of intensifying theteaching, and of subjecting disciples, not initiates, to the frequent strongvibration of a Master. It involves risk, but, if the experiment provessuccessful, will tend to the greater assisting of the race."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIII DISCIPLESHIPA disciple described .A disciple is one who above all else, is pledged to do three things:—a. To serve humanity. b. To co-operate with the plan of the Great Ones as hesees it and as best he may. c. To develop the powers of the Ego, to expand hisconsciousness until he can function on the three planes in the three worlds, andin the causal body, and to follow the guidance of the higher self and not thedictates of his three-fold lower manifestation.A disciple is one who is beginning to comprehend group work, and to change hiscentre of activity from himself (as the pivot around which everything revolves)to the group centre.A disciple is one who realises simultaneously the relative insignificance ofeach unit of consciousness, and also its vast importance. His sense ofproportion is adjusted, and he sees things as they are; he sees people as theyare; he sees himself as he inherently is and seeks then to become that which heis.A disciple realises the life or force side of nature, and to him the form makesno appeal. He works with force and through force; he recognises himself as aforce centre within a greater force centre, and his is the responsibility ofdirecting the energy which may pour through him into channels through which thegroup can be benefited.The disciple knows himself to be—to a greater or less degree—an outpost of theMaster's consciousness, viewing the Master in a two-fold sense:—a. As his own egoic consciousness. b. As the centre of his group; the forceanimating the units of the group and binding them into a homogeneous whole.A disciple is one who is transferring his consciousness out of the personal intothe impersonal, and during the transition stage much of difficulty and ofsuffering is necessarily endured. These difficulties arise from various causes:—a. The disciple's lower self, which rebels at being transmuted. b. A man'simmediate group, friends, or family, who rebel at his growing impersonality.They do not like to be acknowledged as one with him on the life side, and yetseparate from him where desires and interests lie. Yet the law holds good, andonly in the essential life of the soul can true unity be cognised. In thediscovery as to what is form lies much of sorrow for the disciple, but the roadleads to perfect union eventually.The disciple is one who realises his responsibility to all units who come underhis influence,—a responsibility of co-operating with the plan of evolution as itexists for them, and thus to expand their consciousness and teach them thedifference between the real and the unreal, between life and form. This he doesmost easily by a demonstration in his own life as to his goal, his object, andhis centre of consciousness.The work to be done .The disciple, therefore, has several things at which to aim:—A sensitive response to the Master's vibration.A practical purity of life; a purity not merely theoretical.A freedom from care. Here bear in mind that care is based on the personal, andis the result of lack of dispassion and a too ready response to the vibrationsof the lower worlds.Accomplishment of duty. This point involves the dispassionate discharge of allobligations and due attention to karmic debts. Special emphasis should be laid,for all disciples, on the value of dispassion. Lack of discrimination is not sooften a hindrance to disciples these days, owing to the development of the mind,but lack of dispassion frequently is. This means the attainment of that state ofconsciousness where balance is seen, and neither pleasure nor pain dominates,for they are superseded by joy and bliss. We may well ponder on this, for muchstriving after dispassion is necessary.He has also to study the Kama-manasic body (desire-mind body) . This is of veryreal interest, for it is, in many ways, the most important body in the solarsystem, where the human being in the three worlds is concerned. In the nextsystem the mental vehicle of the self-conscious units will hold an analogousplace, as the physical did in the previous solar system.He has also to work scientifically, if it may be so expressed, at the buildingof the physical body. He must so strive that he will produce in each incarnationa body which will serve better as a vehicle for force. Hence there is nothingimpractical in giving information anent initiation, as some may think. There isno moment of the day that that goal may not be visioned, and the work ofpreparation carried on. One of the greatest instruments for practicaldevelopment lying in the hands of small and great, is the instrument of SPEECH.He who guards his words, and who only speaks with altruistic purpose, in orderto carry the energy of Love through the medium of the tongue, is one who ismastering rapidly the initial steps to be taken in preparation for initiation.Speech is the most occult manifestation in existence; it is the means ofcreation and the vehicle for force. In the reservation of words, esotericallyunderstood, lies the conservation of force; in the utilisation of words, justlychosen and spoken, lies the distribution of the love force of the solarsystem,—that force which preserves, strengthens, and stimulates. Only he whoknows somewhat of these two aspects of speech can be trusted to stand before theInitiator and to carry out from that Presence certain sounds and secretsimparted to him under the pledge of silence.The disciple must learn to be silent in the face of that which is evil. He mustlearn to be silent before the sufferings of the world, wasting no time in idleplaints and sorrowful demonstration, but lifting up the burden of the world;working, and wasting no energy in talk. Yet withal he should speak whereencouragement is needed, using the tongue for constructive ends; expressing thelove force of the world, as it may flow through him, where it will serve best toease a load or lift a burden, remembering that as the race progresses, the loveelement between the sexes and its expression will be translated to a higherplane. Then, through the spoken word, and not through the physical planeexpression as now, will come the realisation of that true love which unitesthose who are one in service and in aspiration. Then love between the units ofthe human family will take the form of the utilisation of speech for the purposeof creating on all planes, and the energy which now, in the majority, findsexpression through the lower or generating centres will be translated to thethroat centre. This is as yet but a distant ideal, but even now some can visionthat ideal, and seek—through united service, loving co-operation, and oneness inaspiration, thought, and endeavour,—to give shape and form to it, even thoughinadequately.Group relationships .The path of the disciple is a thorny one; briars beset his every step, anddifficulties meet him at every turn. Yet in the treading of the path, in theovercoming of the difficulties, and in a single-hearted adherence to the good ofthe group, with a proportionate attention to the individuals and theirevolutionary development, comes at length fruition, and the attainment of thegoal. A SERVER of the race stands forth. He is a server because he has no endsof his own to serve, and from his lower sheaths goes out no vibration which canbeguile him from his chosen path. He serves, because he knows what is in man,and because for many lives he has worked with individuals and with groups,gradually expanding the range of his endeavour until he has gathered around himthose units of consciousness whom he can energise, and use, and through whom hecan work out the plans of his superiors. Such is the goal, but the intermediatestages are fraught with difficulty for all who stand on the verge ofself-discovery, and of becoming the Path itself.Some practical advice might be of value here:—Study with care the first three books of the Bhagavad Gita. The problem ofArjuna is the problem of all disciples, and the solution is eternally the same.Stand ready and watch the heart. In the transferring of the fire from the solarplexus to the heart centre comes much pain. It is not easy to love as do theGreat Ones, with a pure love which requires nothing back; with an impersonallove that rejoices where there is response, but looks not for it, and lovessteadily, quietly, and deeply through all apparent divergences, knowing thatwhen each has found his own way home, he will find that home to be the place ofat-one-ment.Be prepared for loneliness. It is the law. As a man dissociates himself from allthat concerns his physical, astral and mental bodies, and centres himself in theEgo, it produces a temporary separation. This must be endured and passed,leading to a closer link at a later period with all associated with the disciplethrough the karma of past lives, through group work, and through the activity ofthe disciple (carried on almost unconsciously at first) in gathering togetherthose through whom later he will work.Cultivate happiness, knowing that depression, an over-morbid investigation ofmotive, and undue sensitiveness to the criticism of others leads to a conditionwherein a disciple is almost useless. Happiness is based on confidence in theGod within, a just appreciation of time, and a forgetfulness of self. Take allthe glad things which may come as trusts to be used to spread joy, and rebel notat happiness and pleasure in service, thinking it an indication that all is notwell. Suffering comes as the lower self rebels. Control that lower self,eliminate desire, and all is joy.Have patience. Endurance is one of the characteristics of the Ego. The Egopersists , knowing itself immortal. The personality becomes discouraged, knowingthat time is short.To the disciple naught occurs but what is in the plan, and where the motive andsole aspiration of the heart are towards the carrying out of the Master's willand the serving of the race, that which eventuates has in it the seeds of thenext enterprise, and embodies the environment of the next step forward. Hereinlies much of clarification, and herein may be found that on which the disciplemay rest when the vision is clouded, the vibration lower than perhaps it shouldbe, and the judgment fogged by the miasmas arising from circumstances on thephysical plane. With many, much arises in the astral body that is based on oldvibration and has no foundation in fact, and the battleground is so to controlthe astral situation that out of present anxieties and worries may growconfidence and peace, and out of violent action and interaction there may beelaborated tranquility.It is possible to reach a point where naught that occurs can ruffle the innercalm; where the peace that passeth understanding is known and experienced,because the consciousness is centred in the Ego, who is peace itself, being thecircle of the buddhic life; where poise itself is known and felt, andequilibrium reigns because the centre of the life is in the Ego, who is—inessence—balance; where calm rules unruffled and unshaken, because the divineKnower holds the reins of government, and permits no disturbance from the lowerself; where bliss itself is reached that is based, not on circumstances in thethree worlds, but on that inner realisation of existence apart from thenot-self, an existence that persists when time and space and all that iscontained therein, are not; that is known when all the illusions of the lowerplanes are experienced, passed through, transmuted and transcended; that endureswhen the little world of human endeavour has dissipated and gone, being seen asnaught; and that is based on the knowledge that I AM THAT.Such an attitude and experience is for all those who persist in their highendeavour, who count all things but naught if they may but achieve the goal, andwho steer a steady course through circumstances, keeping the eyes fixed upon thevision ahead, the ears attentive to the Voice of the God within, that sounds inthe silence of the heart; the feet firmly placed on the path that leads to thePortal of Initiation; the hands held out in assistance to the world, and thewhole life subordinated to the call of service. Then all that comes is for thebest—sickness, opportunity, success, and disappointment, the gibes andmachinations of enemies, the lack of comprehension on the part of those welove—all is but to be used, and all exists but to be transmuted. Continuity ofvision, of aspiration, and of the inner touch, is seen to be of more importancethan them all. That continuity is the thing to be aimed at, in spite of, and notbecause of circumstances.As the aspirant progresses he not only balances the pairs of opposites, but ishaving the secret of his brother's heart revealed to him. He becomes anacknowledged force in the world and is recognised as one who can be dependedupon to serve. Men turn to him for assistance and help along his recognisedline, and he begins to sound forth his note so as to be heard in deva and humanranks. This he does—at this stage—through the pen in literature, through thespoken word in lecturing and teaching, through music, painting and art. Hereaches the hearts of men in some way or another, and becomes a helper andserver of his race. Two more characteristics of this stage might here bementioned:—The aspirant has an appreciation of the occult value of money in service. Heseeks nothing for himself, save that which may equip him for the work to bedone, and he looks upon money and that which money can purchase as somethingwhich is to be used for others and as a means to bring about the fruition of theMaster's plans as he senses those plans. The occult significance of money islittle appreciated, yet one of the greatest tests as to the position of a manupon the Probationary Path is that which concerns his attitude to and hishandling of that which all men seek in order to gratify desire. Only he whodesires naught for himself can be a recipient of financial bounty, and adispenser of the riches of the universe. In other cases where riches increasethey bring with them naught but sorrow and distress, discontent, and misuse.At this stage also the aspirant's life becomes an instrument of destruction inthe occult sense of the term. Wherever he goes the force which flows through himfrom the higher planes and his own inner God produces at times peculiar resultsupon his environment. It acts as a stimulator of both the good and the evil. Thelunar Pitris, or little lives which form the bodies of his brother and his ownbody, are likewise stimulated, their activity is increased and their powergreatly aggravated. This fact is used by Those Who work on the inner side tobring about certain desired ends. This it is also which often causes thetemporary downfall of advanced souls. They cannot stand the force pouring intothem, or upon them, and through the temporary over-stimulation of their centresand vehicles they go to pieces. This can be seen working out in groups as wellas in individuals. But, inversely, if the lunar Lords, or lives of the lowerself, have been earlier subjugated and brought under control, then the effect ofthe force and energy contacted is to stimulate the response of the physicalbrain consciousness and the head centres to egoic contact.Then the otherwise destructive force becomes a factor for good and a helpfulstimulation, and can be used by Those Who know how, to lead men on to furtherillumination.All these steps have to work out on all the three lower planes, and in the threebodies, and this they do according to the particular ray and sub-ray. In thisfashion is the work of the disciple carried forward, and his testing andtraining carried out. Thus is he brought—through right direction of energy andwise manipulation of force currents—to the Portal of Initiation, and hegraduates from the Hall of Learning into the Hall of Wisdom, that Hall whereinhe gradually becomes \"aware\" of forces and powers latent in his own Ego andegoic group, wherein the force of the egoic group is his for the using, for hecan now be trusted to wield it only for the helping of humanity, andwherein—after the fourth initiation—he becomes a sharer in, and can be trustedwith, some part of the energy of the Planetary Logos, and thus be enabled tocarry forward the plans of that Logos for evolution.It would be well to remember that disciples on the first ray understanddiscipleship largely in terms of energy, or force, or activity, whilst discipleson the second ray understand it more in terms of consciousness or initiation.Hence the divergence of expressions in ordinary use, and the lack ofcomprehension among thinkers. It might prove useful to express the idea ofdiscipleship in terms of the different rays—meaning by this, discipleship as itmanifests on the physical plane in service:1st Ray Force Energy Action The Occultist. 2nd Ray Consciousness ExpansionInitiation The true Psychic 3rd Ray Adaptation Development Evolution TheMagician. 4th Ray Vibration Response Expression The Artist. 5th Ray MentationKnowledge Science The Scientist. 6th Ray Devotion Abstraction Idealism TheDevotee. 7th Ray Incantation Magic Ritual The Ritualist.Remember carefully that we are here dealing with disciples. Later on as theyprogress, the various lines approximate and merge. All have been at one timemagicians, for all have passed upon the third ray. The problem now is concernedwith the mystic and the occultist, and their eventual synthesis. A careful studyof the foregoing will lead to the realisation that the difficulties betweenthinkers, and between disciples of all groups, consist in their identifyingthemselves with some form, and in their inability to understand the differentpoints of view of others. As time elapses, and they are brought into closerrelationship with the two Masters with whom they are concerned (their own innerGod and their personal Master), the inability to cooperate and to merge theirinterests in the good of the group will pass away, and community of endeavour,similarity of object, and mutual co-operation will take the place of what is nowso much seen, divergence. We might well ponder on this, for it holds the key tomuch that is puzzling and, to many, distressing."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IX THE PATH OF INITIATIONAfter a longer or shorter period of time the disciple stands at the Portal ofInitiation. We must remember that as one approaches this portal and draws nearerto the Master it is, as says \"Light on the Path,\" with the feet bathed in theblood of the heart. Each step up is ever through the sacrifice of all that theheart holds dear on one plane or another, and always must this sacrifice bevoluntary. He who treads the Probationary Path and the Path of Holiness is hewho has counted the cost, whose sense of values has been readjusted, and whotherefore judges not as judges the man of the world. He is the man who isattempting to take the \"kingdom by violence,\" and in the attempt is prepared forthe consequent suffering. He is the man who counts all things but loss if he maybut win the goal, and who, in the struggle for the mastery of the lower self bythe higher, is willing to sacrifice even unto death.The first two initiations .At the first initiation, the control of the Ego over the physical body must havereached a high degree of attainment. \"The sins of the flesh,\" as the Christianphraseology has it, must be dominated; gluttony, drink, and licentiousness mustno longer hold sway. The physical elemental will no longer find its demandobeyed; the control must be complete and the lure departed. A general attitudeof obedience to the Ego must have been achieved, and the willingness to obeymust be very strong. The channel between the higher and the lower is widened,and the obedience of the flesh practically automatic.That all initiates measure not up to this standard may be ascribed to severalthings, but the note they sound should be on the side of righteousness; therecognition of their own shortcomings which they will evidence will be sincereand public, and their struggle to conform to the highest standard will be known,even though perfection may not be achieved. Initiates may, and do, fall, andthereby incur the working of the law in punishment. They may, and do, by thisfall injure the group, and thereby incur the karma of readjustment, having toexpiate the injury through later prolonged service, wherein the group membersthemselves, even though unconsciously, apply the law; their progress will beseriously hindered, much time being lost in which they must work out the karmawith the injured units. The very fact that a man is an initiate, and thereforethe medium for force of a greatly increased kind, makes his lapses from thestraight path to have more powerful effects than is the case with a lessadvanced man; his retribution and punishment will be equally greater. Inevitablyhe must pay the price before he is allowed to proceed further upon the Way. Asfor the group he injures, what should their attitude be? A recognition of thegravity of the error, a wise acceptance of the facts in the case, a refrainingfrom unbrotherly criticism, and a pouring out of love upon the sinningbrother:—all this, coupled with such action as will make clear to the onlookinggeneral public that such sins and infringements of the law are not condoned. Tothis must be added an attitude of mind within the group concerned which willlead them (whilst taking firm action) to help the mistaken brother to see hiserror, to work out the retributive karma, and then to reinstate him in theirregard and respect when due amends have been made.All people do not develop exactly along the same or parallel lines, andtherefore no hard or fast rules can be laid down as to the exact procedure ateach initiation, or as to just what centres are to be vivified, or what visionis to be accorded. So much depends upon the ray of the disciple, or hisdevelopment in any particular direction (people do not usually develop evenly),upon his individual karma, and also upon the exigencies of any special period.This much can be suggested, however: At the first initiation, that of the birthof the Christ, the heart centre is the one usually vivified, with the aim inview of the more effective controlling of the astral vehicle, and the renderingof greater service to humanity. After this initiation the initiate is taughtprincipally the facts of the astral plane; he has to stabilise his emotionalvehicle and learn to work on the astral plane with the same facility and ease ashe does on the physical plane; he is brought in contact with the astral devas;he learns to control the astral elementals; he must function with facility onthe lower sub-planes, and the value and quality of his work on the physicalplane becomes of increased worth. He passes, at this initiation, out of the Hallof Learning into the Hall of Wisdom. At this time, emphasis is consistently laidon his astral development, although his mental equipment grows steadily.Many lives may intervene between the first initiation and the second. A longperiod of many incarnations may elapse before the control of the astral body isperfected, and the initiate is ready for the next step. The analogy is kept inan interesting way in the New Testament in the life of the initiate Jesus. Manyyears elapsed between the Birth and the Baptism, but the remaining three stepswere taken in three years. Once the second initiation is taken the progress willbe rapid, the third and fourth following probably in the same life, or thesucceeding.The second initiation forms the crisis in the control of the astral body. Justas, at the first initiation, the control of the dense physical has beendemonstrated, so here the control of the astral is similarly demonstrated. Thesacrifice and death of desire has been the goal of endeavour. Desire itself hasbeen dominated by the Ego, and only that is longed for which is for the good ofthe whole, and in the line of the will of the Ego, and of the Master. The astralelemental is controlled, the emotional body becomes pure and limpid, and thelower nature is rapidly dying. At this time the Ego grips afresh the two lowervehicles and bends them to his will. The aspiration and longing to serve, love,and progress become so strong that rapid development is usually to be seen. Thisaccounts for the fact that this initiation and the third, frequently (though notinvariably) follow each other in one single life. At this period of the world'shistory such stimulus has been given to evolution that aspiring souls—sensingthe dire and crying need of humanity—are sacrificing all in order to meet thatneed.Again, we must not make the mistake of thinking that all this follows in thesame invariable consecutive steps and stages. Much is done in simultaneousunison, for the labour to control is slow and hard, but in the interim betweenthe first three initiations some definite point in the evolution of each of thethree lower vehicles has to be attained and held, before the further expansionof the channel can be safely permitted. Many of us are working on all the threebodies now, as we tread the Probationary Path.At this initiation, should the ordinary course be followed, (which again is notat all certain) the throat centre is vivified. This causes a capacity to turn toaccount in the Master's service, and for the helping of man, the attainments ofthe lower mind. It imparts the ability to give forth and utter that which ishelpful, possibly in the spoken word, but surely in service of some kind. Avision is accorded of the world's need, and a further portion of the plan shown.The work, then, to be done prior to the taking of the third initiation, is thecomplete submerging of the personal point of view in the need of the whole. Itentails the complete domination of the concrete mind by the Ego.The succeeding two initiations .After the second initiation the teaching shifts up a plane. The initiate learnsto control his mental vehicle; he develops the capacity to manipulate thoughtmatter, and learns the laws of creative thought building. He functions freely onthe four lower sub-planes of the mental plane, and before the third initiationhe must,—consciously or unconsciously,—be complete master of the four lowersub-planes in the three. planes of the three worlds. His knowledge of themicrocosm becomes profound, and he has mastered theoretically and practically,in great measure, the laws of his own nature, hence his ability experimentallyto be master on the four lower sub-planes of the physical, astral, and mentalplanes. The last fact is of interest. The control of the three higher sub-planesis not yet complete, and here is one of the explanations as to the failures andmistakes of initiates. Their mastery of matter in the three higher sub-planes isnot yet perfect; these yet remain to be dominated.At the third initiation, termed sometimes the Transfiguration, the entirepersonality is flooded with light from above. It is only after this initiationthat the Monad is definitely guiding the Ego, pouring His divine life ever moreinto the prepared and cleansed channel, just as in the third, or Moon Chain, theEgo individualised the personality through direct contact, a method different tothe individualisation as shown in this fourth chain. The law of correspondences,if applied here, might prove very revealing, and might demonstrate aninteresting analogy between the methods of individualising in the variouschains, and the expansions of consciousness that occur at the differentinitiations.Again, a vision is accorded of what lies ahead; the initiate is in a position atall times to recognise the other members of the Great White Lodge, and hispsychic faculties are stimulated by the vivification of the head centres. It isnot necessary nor advisable to develop the synthetic faculties, or clairaudienceand clairvoyance, until after this initiation. The aim of all development is theawakening of the spiritual intuition; when this has been done, when the physicalbody is pure, the astral stable and steady, and the mental body controlled, thenthe initiate can safely wield and wisely use the psychic faculties for thehelping of the race. Not only can he use these faculties, but he is able now tocreate and vivify thoughtforms that are clear and well-defined, pulsating withthe spirit of service and not controlled by lower mind or desire. Thesethoughtforms will not he (as is the case with those created by the mass of men)disjointed, unconnected, and uncorrelated, but will attain a fair measure ofsynthesis. Hard and ceaseless must the work be before this can be done, but whenthe desire nature has been stabilised and purified, then the control of themind-body comes more easily. Hence the path of the devotee is easier in someways than that of the intellectual man, for he has learnt the measures ofpurified desire, and progresses by the requisite stages.The personality has now reached a point where its vibrations are of a very highorder, the matter in all three bodies relatively pure, and its apprehension ofthe work to be done in the microcosm, and the share to be taken in the work ofthe macrocosm is very advanced. It is apparent, therefore, why it is only at thethird initiation that the great Hierophant, the Lord of the World, Himselfofficiates. It is the first at which He contacts the initiate. Earlier it wouldnot be possible. For the first two initiations the Hierophant is the Christ, theWorld-Teacher, the Firstborn among many brethren, one of the earliest of ourhumanity to take initiation. Browning brings out this thought most beautifullyin the words found in his poem \"Saul\":—………It shall be A face like my face that receives thee; a Man like to me, Thoushalt love and be loved by, forever; A Hand like this hand Shall throw open thegates of new life to thee! See the Christ stand!But when the initiate has made still further progress, and has taken twoinitiations, a change comes. The Lord of the World, the Ancient of Days, theineffable Ruler Himself administers the third initiation. Why has this becomepossible? Because now the fully consecrated physical body can safely bear thevibrations of the two other bodies when they return to its shelter from thePresence of the KING; because now the purified astral and controlled mental cansafely stand before that KING. When purified and controlled they stand and forthe first time consciously vibrate to the Ray of the Monad, then with preparedbodies can the ability to see and hear on all the planes be granted andachieved, and the faculty of reading and comprehending the records be safelyemployed, for with fuller knowledge comes added power. The heart is nowsufficiently pure and loving, and the intellect sufficiently stable to stand thestrain of knowing .Before the fourth initiation can be taken, the work of training is intensified,and the hastening and accumulation of knowledge has to be unbelievably rapid.The initiate has frequent access to the library of occult books, and after thisinitiation he can contact not only the Master with Whom he is linked and withWhom he has worked consciously for a long time, but he can contact and assist(in measure) the Chohans, the Bodhisattva, and the Manu.He has also to grasp the laws of the three lower planes intellectually, andlikewise wield them for the aiding of the scheme of evolution. He studies thecosmic plans and has to master the charts; he becomes versed in occulttechnicalities and develops fourth dimensional vision, if he has not alreadydone so. He learns to direct the activities of the building devas, and at thesame time, he works continually at the development of his spiritual nature. Hebegins rapidly to co-ordinate the buddhic vehicle, and in its co-ordination hedevelops the power of synthesis, at first in small measure, and gradually infuller detail.By the time the fourth initiation is taken the initiate has mastered perfectlythe fifth sub-plane, and is therefore adept,—to use a technical phrase,—on thefive lower subplanes of the physical, astral, and mental planes, and is well onthe way to master the sixth. His buddhic vehicle can function on the two lowersub-planes of the buddhic plane.The life of the man who takes the fourth initiation, or the Crucifixion, isusually one of great sacrifice and suffering. It is the life of the man whomakes the Great Renunciation, and even exoterically it is seen to be strenuous,hard, and painful. He has laid all, even his perfected personality, upon thealtar of sacrifice, and stands bereft of all. All is renounced, friends, money,reputation, character, standing in the world, family, and even life itself.The final initiations .After the fourth initiation not much remains to be done. The domination of thesixth sub-plane goes forward with rapidity, and the matter of the highersub-planes of the buddhic is co-ordinated. The initiate is admitted into closerfellowship in the Lodge, and his contact with the devas is more complete. He israpidly exhausting the resources of the Hall of Wisdom, and is mastering themost intricate plans and charts. He becomes adept in the significance of colourand sound, can wield the law in the three worlds, and can contact his Monad withmore freedom than the majority of the human race can contact their Egos. He isin charge, also, of large work, teaching many pupils, aiding in many schemes,and is gathering under him those who are to assist him in future times. Thisrefers only to those who stay to help humanity on this globe; we will deal laterwith some of the lines of work that stretch before the Adept if He passes awayfrom earth service.After the fifth initiation the man is perfected as far as this scheme goes,though he may, if he will, take two further initiations.To achieve the sixth initiation the Adept has to take a very intensive course inplanetary occultism. A Master wields the law in the three worlds, whilst aChohan of the sixth initiation wields the law in the chain on all levels; aChohan of the seventh initiation wields the law in the solar system.It will be apparent that, should he search these subjects with application, thestudent will find much that concerns him personally, even though the ceremonyitself may be far ahead. By the study of the process and the purpose he maybecome aware of the great fundamental fact that the method of initiation is themethod of:—a. Force realisation. b. Force application. c. Force utilisation.The initiate of every degree, from the humble initiate of the first degree,making for the first time his contact with a certain type of specialised force,up to the emancipated buddha of the seventh degree, is dealing with energy ofsome kind or other. The stages of development of the aspirant might be expressedas follows:—1. He has to become aware, through discrimination, of the energy or force of hisown lower self.2. He has to impose upon that energetic rhythm one that is higher, until thatlower rhythm is superseded by the higher, and the old method of expressingenergy dies out entirely.3. He then is permitted, by gradually expanding realisations, to contactand—under guidance—to employ certain forms of group energy, until the time comeswhen he is in a position scientifically to wield planetary force. The length oftime taken over his final stage is entirely dependent upon the progress he makesin the service of his race and in the development of those powers of the soulwhich are the natural sequence of spiritual unfoldment.The application of the Rod of Initiation at the first two initiations by theBodhisattva enables the initiate to control and utilise the force of the lowerself, the true sanctified energy of the personality in service; at the thirdinitiation the application of the Rod by the One Initiator makes available in avastly more extensive manner the force of the higher self or Ego, and bringsinto play on the physical plane the entire energy stored up during numerousincarnations in the causal vehicle. At the fourth initiation the energy of hisegoic group becomes his to use for the good of planetary evolution, and at thefifth initiation the force or energy of the planet (esoterically understood, andnot merely the force or energy of the material globe) is at his disposal. Duringthese five initiations those two great beings, the Bodhisattva first, and thenthe One Initiator, the Lord of the World, Sanat Kumara, are the administratorsor hierophants. After these ceremonies, should the initiate choose to take thetwo final initiations which it is possible to take in this solar system, a stillhigher type of energy in expression of the One Self comes into play, and canonly be hinted at. At the seventh initiation that One of Whom Sanat Kumara isthe manifestation, the Logos of our scheme on His own plane, becomes theHierophant. At the sixth initiation the expression of this Existence on anintermediate plane, a Being Who must at present remain nameless, wields the Rodand administers the oath and secret. In these three expressions of hierarchicalgovernment—Sanat Kumara on the periphery of the three worlds, the Nameless Oneon the confines of the high planes of human evolution, and the planetary Spirithimself at the final stage—we have the three great manifestations of thePlanetary Logos Himself. Through the Planetary Logos at the final greatinitiation flows the power of the Solar Logos, and He it is Who reveals to theinitiate that the Absolute is consciousness in its fullest expression, though atthe stage of human existence the Absolute must be regarded as unconsciousness.Each of the great initiations is but the synthesis of the smaller ones, and onlyas man seeks ever to expand his consciousness in the affairs of daily life canhe expect to achieve those later stages which are but culminations of the manyearlier. Students must get rid of the idea that if they are \"very good andaltruistic\" suddenly some day they will stand before the Great Lord. They areputting effect before cause. Goodness and altruism grow out of realisation andservice, and holiness of character is the outcome of those expansions ofconsciousness which a man brings about within himself through strenuous effortand endeavour. Therefore it is here and now that man can prepare himself forinitiation, and this he does, not by dwelling upon the ceremonial aspect, as somany do in excited anticipation, but by working systematically and enduringly atthe steady development of the mental body, by the strenuous and arduous processof controlling the astral body so that it becomes responsive to threevibrations:—a. That from the Ego. b. That from the Master. c. Those from his brotherseverywhere around him. He becomes sensitive to the voice of his higher self,thus working off karma under the intelligent guidance of his own Ego. He becomesconscious, via the Ego, of the vibration emanating from his Master; he learns tofeel it ever more and more, and to respond to it ever more fully; finally, hebecomes increasingly sensitive to the joys and pains and sorrows of those hedaily contacts; he feels them to be his joys and pains and sorrows, and yet heis not incapacitated thereby."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER X THE UNIVERSALITY OF INITIATIONIt has been emphasised many times in the occult teachings that the process ofinitiation, as it is usually understood, is an abnormal and not a normal one.All progression in the realm of consciousness is naturally by a graded series ofawakenings, but this would proceed much more gradually and cover a longer periodof time than is the case under our present planetary conditions. This particularmode of developing the consciousness of the human family was initiated by theHierarchy during the Atlantean root-race at the latter end of the fourthsub-race, and will persist until the middle of the next round. At that time theneeded stimulus will have been imparted, and as three-fifths of the human familywill then have esoterically \"set their feet upon the path,\" and a largepercentage of them will then be in process of becoming the Path itself, the morenormal routine will again be resumed.Initiation on the various planets .The process of stimulation of the human Egos by means of graded instructions,and the application of the dynamic electrical force of the Rod is employed onthree of the planets of our system at this time. It is instituted during everyfourth round, and its peculiar interest lies in the fact that the emphasis forthe fourth Creative Hierarchy in every fourth chain and globe during the fourthround is laid upon the fourth initiation, that of the Crucifixion. The fourthCreative Hierarchy is the great expression of the conscious will and sacrificeof the Solar Logos, and the great symbol of the intelligent union of spirit andmatter. Hence the fourth initiation, with its presentation of these cosmictruths, and its epitomising of the purpose of this fundamental sacrifice, has apre-eminent place.The student needs to remind himself that the other planetary schemes, thoughfundamentally the same as our fourth scheme, yet have their profound differencesin manifestation, due to the varying characteristics and the individual karma ofthe incarnating Planetary Logos or Ray. These differences affect:—a. The initiatory process, both in its ceremonial and altruistic aspects. b. Theapplication of the Rod, for the type of force which it embodies, when broughtinto conjunction with the differentiated force of the planetary type, producesresults of varying nature and degree. c. The seasons of initiation. The Egos inincarnation on any planet will—according to ray type—be easily stimulated or notas the case may be, according to astrological conditions, and this will produceshorter or more protracted periods of development prior to or between eachinitiation. d. The electrical phenomena produced on the higher planes, as moreand more the human units esoterically \"blaze forth.\" It must be remembered thatthe entire solar system, with all that is included therein, is expressing itselfin terms of light, and that the process of initiation might therefore beregarded as one in which the different points of light (or human sparks) arestimulated, their radiance and temperature increased, and the sphere ofinfluence of each light extended in radius.The three planetary schemes wherein the great experiment of initiation is beingtried are the Earth, Venus, and one other. Venus was the first sphere ofexperiment, and the success of the endeavour and the force generated was thecause of a similar effort being made on our planet. No planet increases itsstore of force, and consequently its sphere of influence, without incurringobligations and affecting other schemes; the interchange of force and energybetween these two planets, Earth and Venus, is continuous. A similar process hasbut lately been instituted on another planetary scheme, and when, in the nextround, our Earth attains a point in evolution analogous to that of the Venusianscheme at the time its influence was felt by us, then we shall aid in thestimulation of still another group of planetary Egos; we shall assist in theinstitution of a similar procedure among the sons of men in another scheme.In the three great planetary schemes, Neptune, Uranus, and Saturn, the method ofinitiation will not be employed. They will be the recipients of those who areesoterically \"saved\" from among the other schemes. That is to say that all thosewho, in any scheme, achieve the needed expansions of consciousness (such as willbe achieved by the majority of the human family prior to the middle of the nextgreat cycle, or round), will be considered \"saved,\" whilst the remainder will beheld to be failures, and will be held over for further development during laterperiods, or will be transferred to those planetary schemes which from the pointof view of time are not so far advanced as our Earth scheme. These three majorschemes are the absorbers and synthesisers of the energy of the others.Initiation and the Devas .The question may be asked whether the devas undergo initiation, and we mightdeal briefly with the point here.Initiation has to do with the conscious development of the self, and concernsthe wisdom aspect of the One Self. It presupposes the development of theintelligence principle, and involves the apprehension by the human unit ofpurpose and of will, and his intelligent participation therein through love andservice. The devas, with the exception of those greater devas who have inearlier cycles passed through the human kingdom and are now co-operating in theevolution of man, are not as yet self-conscious. They grow and develop throughfeeling and not through the power of conscious thought. Man, however, growsthrough expansions of self-conscious realisation, self-initiated andself-imposed. It is the line of aspiration and of conscious endeavour, and isthe most difficult line of development in the solar system, for it follows notalong the line of least resistance, but seeks to initiate and impose a higherrhythm. The devas follow the line of least resistance, and seek to appropriateand experience in fullest tide of feeling and sentiency the vibration of thingsas they are . Therefore the method for them is an ever-increasing intensity ofappreciation for the feeling of the moment, and not, as in man, anever-increasing depreciation of things as they are, or of the material aspect,which leads to an endeavour to reach out and enfold within his consciousness thesubjective reality, or the things of the spirit—this in contradistinction to theobjective unreality, or the things of matter. The devas seek to feel, whilst manseeks to know. For the former, then, those expansions of consciousness which wecall Initiation, exist not, except in the cases of those advanced beings who,having passed through the human stage, both feel and know, and who, under theevolutionary law, expand their knowledge in ever-increasing degree.Cosmic influences and solar initiations .All that can be done here in dealing with this profound subject is to enumeratebriefly some of the cosmic influences which definitely affect our earth, andproduce results in the consciousness of men everywhere, and which, during theprocess of initiation, bring about certain specific phenomena.First and foremost is the energy or force emanating from the sun Sirius . If itmight be so expressed, the energy of thought, or mind force, in its totality,reaches the solar system from a distant cosmic centre via Sirius. Sirius acts asthe transmitter, or the focalising centre, whence emanate those influences whichproduce self-consciousness in man. During initiation, by means of the Rod ofInitiation (acting as a subsidiary transmitter and as a powerful magnet) thisenergy is momentarily intensified, and applied to the centres of the initiatewith terrific force; were it not that the Hierophant and the two sponsors of theinitiate pass it primarily through their bodies, it would be more than he couldstand. This increase of mind energy results in an expansion and an apprehensionof the truth as it is, and is lasting in its effects. It is felt primarily inthe throat centre, the great organ of creation through sound.Another type of energy reaches man from the Pleiades , passing through theVenusian scheme to us, just as the Sirian energy passes through the Saturnian.It has a definite effect upon the causal body, and serves to stimulate the heartcentre.A third type of energy is applied to the initiate, and affects his head centre.It emanates from that one of the seven stars of the Great Bear whose ensoulinglife holds the same relationship to our Planetary Logos as the Ego does to ahuman being. This energy, therefore, is seven-fold, and differs according to aman's ray or type.It is not possible here to state the order of the application of these varyingtypes of energy, nor to give the initiation during which the man contacts thedifferent types. These facts involve the secrets of the mysteries, and nopurpose is served by revealing them. Other types of force from certain of theplanetary schemes, as well as from cosmic centres, are brought into play by theInitiator and transmitted through the medium of the Rod to the various centresin the initiate's three vehicles, the mental, the astral, and the ethericcentres. At the fourth initiation a specialised type of force from a centrewhich must remain nameless is applied to a man's causal body, and is one of thecauses of its final disintegration.In thinking of this matter of the attainment of the sons of men, we mustrecognise that as mankind completes one unification after another, the \"HeavenlyMen\" on intuitional levels and on spiritual levels are completed, and in theirturn go to the formation of the centres in the great \"Heavenly Men\" of the solarsystem. These seven Heavenly Men, in Whose bodies each human Monad and each devafinds his place, form the seven centres in the body of the Logos. He, in Histurn, forms the Heart centre (for God is Love) of a still greater Entity. Theconsummation of all for this solar system will be when the Logos takes His fifthinitiation. When all the sons of men attain the fifth initiation, He achieves.This is a great mystery and incomprehensible to us."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XI THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE MYSTERIESThe participants in the mysteries are generally known, and no secret has beenmade of the general personnel and procedure. It is only sought here to impart agreater sense of reality to the data already given by a fuller exposition and amore pointed reference to the parts played by such during the ceremony. At thisstage the student would be wise to bear in mind certain things as he pondersupon the mysteries touched upon here:—That care must be taken to interpret all here given in terms of spirit and notof matter or form. We are dealing entirely with the subjective or consciousnessaspect of manifestation, and with that which lies back of the objective form.This realisation will save the student from much later confusion.That we are considering facts which are substantial and real on the mental plane—the plane on which all the major initiations take place—but which are notmaterialised on the physical plane, and are not physical plane phenomena. Thelink between the two planes exists in the continuity of consciousness which theinitiate will have developed, and which will enable him to bring through to thephysical brain, occurrences and happenings upon the subjective planes of life.Corroboration of these occurrences, and proof of the accuracy of the transmittedknowledge will demonstrate as follows:—In and through the etheric centres . These centres will be greatly stimulated,and will, through their increased inherent energy, enable the initiate toaccomplish more in the path of service than he ever before dreamed possible. Hisdreams and ideals become, not possibilities, but demonstrating facts inmanifestation.The physical centres , such as the pineal gland and the pituitary body, willbegin to develop rapidly, and he will become conscious of the awakening of the\"siddhis,\" or powers of the soul, in the higher connotation of the words. Hewill be aware of the process of conscious control, and of the self-initiatedmanipulations of the above powers. He will realise the methods of egoic contactand the right direction of force.The nervous system , through which the emotional body or astral nature works,will become highly sensitised, yet strong withal. The brain will become evermore rapidly an acute transmitter of the inner impulses. This fact is of realimportance, and will bring about—as its significance becomes more apparent—arevolution in the attitude of educators, of physicians and others, to thedevelopment of the nervous system and the healing of nervous disorders.Occult memory . The initiate finally becomes aware increasingly of the growth ofthat inner recollection, or \"occult memory,\" which concerns the work of theHierarchy and primarily his share in the general plan. When the initiate, whooccultly recalls, in his waking consciousness, a ceremonial fact, finds allthese manifestations of increased growth and conscious realisation in himself,then the truth of his inner assurance is proven and substantiated to him.It must be remembered that this inner substantiation is of no value to anyonebut the initiate. He has to prove himself to the outer world through his life ofservice and the work accomplished, and thereby call forth from all hisenvironing associates a recognition that will show itself in a sanctifiedemulation and a strenuous effort to tread the same path, actuated ever by thesame motive,—that of service and brotherhood, not self-aggrandisement andselfish acquirement. It should also be remembered that if the above is true inconnection with the work, it is still more true in connection with the initiatehimself. Initiation is a strictly personal matter with a universal application .It rests upon his inner attainment. The initiate will know for himself when theevent occurs and needs no one to tell him of it. The expansion of consciousnesscalled initiation must include the physical brain or it is of no value. As thoselesser expansions of consciousness which we undergo normally every day, and call\"learning\" something or other, have reference to the apprehension by thephysical brain of an imparted fact or apprehended circumstance, so with thegreater expansions which are the outcome of the many lesser.At the same time, it is quite possible for men to be functioning on the physicalplane and to be actively employed in world service who have no recollection ofhaving undergone the initiatory process, yet who, nevertheless, may have takenthe first or second initiation in a previous or earlier life. This is theresult, simply, of a lack of \"bridging\" from one life to another, or it may bethe outcome of a definite decision by the Ego. A man may be able better to workoff certain karma and to carry out certain work for the Lodge if he is free fromoccult occupation and mystic introspection during the period of any one earthlife. There are many such amongst the sons of men at this time who havepreviously taken the first initiation, and a few who have taken the second, butwho are nevertheless quite unaware of it, yet their centres and nervousorganisation carry proof to those who have the inner vision. If initiation istaken for the first time in any life, the recollection of it extends to thephysical brain.Curiosity, or even ordinary good living, never brought a man to the Portal ofInitiation. Curiosity, by arousing a strong vibration in a man's lower nature,only serves to swing him away from, instead of towards the goal he is interestedin; whilst ordinary good living, when not furthered by a life of utter sacrificefor others, and by a reticence, humility, and disinterestedness of a veryunusual kind, may serve to build good vehicles which will be of use in anotherincarnation, but will not serve to break down those barriers, outer and inner,and overcome those opposing forces and energies which stand between a \"good\" manand the ceremony of initiation.The Path of Discipleship is a difficult one to tread, and the Path of Initiationharder still; an initiate is but a battle-scarred warrior, the victor in many ahard-won fight; he speaks not of his achievements, for he is too busy with thegreat work in hand; he makes no reference to himself or to all that he hasaccomplished, save to deprecate the littleness of what has been done.Nevertheless, to the world he is ever a man of large influence, the wielder ofspiritual power, the embodier of ideals, the worker for humanity, whounfailingly brings results which succeeding generations will recognise. He isone who, in spite of all this great achievement, is seldom understood by his owngeneration. He is frequently the butt of men's tongues, and frequently all thathe does is misinterpreted; he lays his all—time, money, influence, reputation,and all that the world considers worth while—upon the altar of altruisticservice, and frequently offers his life as a final gift, only to find that thosewhom he has served throw his gift back to him, scorn his renunciation, and labelhim with unsavory names. But the initiate cares not, for his is the privilege tosee somewhat into the future, and therefore he realises that the force he hasgenerated will in due course of time bring to fulfilment the plan; he knows alsothat his name and effort are noted in the archives of the Lodge, and that the\"Silent Watcher\" over the affairs of men has taken notice.Planetary Existences .In considering now the personalities taking part in the initiation ceremonies,the first to be dealt with are Those Who are termed Planetary Existences. Thisrefers to those great Beings who, for a period of planetary manifestation,overshadow or stay with our humanity. They are not very many in number, for themajority of the Great Ones pass on steadily and increasingly to other and higherwork, as Their places can be taken and Their functions carried on by members ofour earth evolution, both deva and human.Among Those directly connected with our Lodge of Masters in its variousdivisions upon the planet, the following might be enumerated:—The \"Silent Watcher ,\" that great Entity Who is the informing life of theplanet, and Who holds the same position to the Lord of the World, Sanat Kumara,as the Ego does to the lower self of man. Some idea of the high stage ofevolution of this Great Being may be gathered from the analogous degree ofevolutionary difference existing between a human being and a perfected adept.From the standpoint of our planetary scheme, this great Life has no greater, andHe is, as far as we are concerned, a correspondence to the personal God of theChristian. He works through His representative on the physical plane, SanatKumara, Who is the focal point for His life and energy. He holds the worldwithin His aura. This great Existence is only contacted directly by the adeptwho has taken the fifth initiation, and is proceeding to take the other two, thesixth and seventh. Once a year, at the Wesak Festival, the Lord Buddha,sanctioned by the Lord of the World, carries to the assembled humanity a dualstream of force, that emanating from the Silent Watcher, supplemented by themore focalised energy of the Lord of the World. This dual energy He pours out inblessing over the people gathered at the ceremony in the Himalayas, and fromthem in turn it flows out to all peoples and tongues and races. It may notperhaps be generally known that at a certain crisis during the Great War theHierarchy of our planet deemed it well nigh necessary to invoke the aid of theSilent Watcher, and—employing the great mantram whereby the Buddha can bereached—called the attention of the latter, and sought his agency with thePlanetary Logos. In consultation between the Planetary Logos, the Lord of theWorld, one of the Buddhas of Activity, the Buddha, the Mahachohan, and the Manu(these names are given in order of their relative evolutionary stage) it wasdecided to watch proceedings a little longer before interfering with the trendof affairs, as the karma of the planet would have been delayed should the strifehave been ended toc soon. Their confidence in the ability of men duly to adjustconditions was justified, and interference proved needless. This conference tookplace at Shamballa. This is mentioned to show the close scrutiny given toeverything concerning the affairs of men by the various Planetary Existences. Itis literally true, in an occult sense, that \"not a sparrow falleth\" without itsfall being noticed.It may be asked why the Bodhisattva was not included in the conference. Thereason was that the war was in the department of the Manu, and members of theHierarchy concern Themselves with that which is strictly Their own business; theMahachohan, being the embodiment of the intelligent or manasic principle,participates in all conferences. In the next great strife the department ofreligions will be involved, and the Bodhisattva intimately concerned. HisBrother, the Manu, will then be relatively exempt, and will proceed with His ownaffairs. And yet withal there is the closest co-operation in all departments,with no loss of energy. Owing to the unity of consciousness of those who arefree from the three lower planes, what transpires in one department is known inthe others.As the Planetary Logos is only concerned in the two final initiations, which arenot compulsory as are the earlier five, it serves no purpose to enlarge upon Hiswork. These initiations are taken upon the buddhic and atmic planes, whereas thefirst five are taken upon the mental.The Lord of the World , the One Initiator, He Who is called in the Bible \"TheAncient of Days,\" and in the Hindu Scriptures the First Kumara, He, Sanat Kumarait is, Who from His throne at Shamballa in the Gobi desert, presides over theLodge of Masters, and holds in His hands the reins of government in all thethree departments. Called in some Scriptures \"the Great Sacrifice,\" He haschosen to watch over the evolution of men and devas until all have been occultly\"saved.\" He it is Who decides upon the \"advancements\" in the differentdepartments, and Who settles who shall fill the vacant posts; He it is Who, fourtimes a year, meets in conference with all the Chohans and Masters, andauthorises what shall be done to further the ends of evolution.Occasionally, too, He meets with initiates of lesser degree, but only at timesof great crises, when some individual is given the opportunity to bring peaceout of strife, and to kindle a blaze whereby rapidly crystallising forms aredestroyed and the imprisoned life consequently set free.At stated periods in the year the Lodge meets, and at the Wesak Festival gathersunder His jurisdiction for three purposes:1. To contact planetary force through the medium of the Buddha.2. To hold the principal of the quarterly conferences.3. To admit to the ceremony of initiation those who are ready in all grades.Three other initiation ceremonies take place during the year:—1. For the minor initiations administered by the Bodhisattva, all of which arein the department of the Mahachohan, and on one or other of the four lesserrays, the rays of attribute.2. For the major initiations on one or other of the three major rays, the raysof aspect, which are administered by the Bodhisattva, and are therefore thefirst two initiations.3. For the higher three initiations at which Sanat Kumara wields the Rod.At all initiations the Lord of the World is present, but at the first two Heholds a position similar to that held by the Silent Watcher, when Sanat Kumaraadministers the oath at the third, fourth and fifth initiations. His powerstreams forth and the flashing forth of the star before the initiate is thesignal of His approval, but the initiate does not see Him face to face until thethird initiation.The function of the three Kumaras , or the three Buddhas of Activity atinitiation is interesting. They are three aspects of the one aspect, and thepupils of Sanat Kumara. Though Their functions are many and varied, and concernprimarily the forces and energies of nature, and the direction of the buildingagencies, They have a vital connection with the applicant for initiation,inasmuch as They each embody the force or energy of one or other of the threehigher subplanes of the mental plane. Therefore at the third initiation one ofthese Kumaras transmits to the causal body of the initiate that energy whichdestroys third subplane matter, and thus brings about part of the destruction ofthe vehicle; at the fourth initiation another Buddha transmits second planeforce, and at the fifth, first subplane force is similarly passed into theremaining atoms of the causal vehicle, producing the final liberation. The workdone by the second Kumara, with second subplane force, is in this solar systemthe most important in connection with the egoic body, and produces its completedissipation, whereas the final application causes the atoms themselves (whichformed that body) to disperse.During the initiation ceremony, when the initiate stands before the Lord of theWorld, these three great Beings form a triangle, within whose lines of force theinitiate finds himself. At the first two initiations, wherein the Bodhisattvafunctions as the Hierophant, the Mahachohan, the Manu, and a Chohan whotemporarily represents the second department perform a similar office. At thehighest two initiations, those three Kumaras who are called \"the esotericKumaras\" form a triangle wherein the initiate stands, when he faces thePlanetary Logos.These facts are imparted to teach two things, first, the unity of the method,second, that the truism \"as above so below\" is an occult fact in nature.At the final two initiations many members of the Hierarchy who are, if one mightso express it, extra-planetary, and who function outside the dense physical andthe etheric globe of our planet, take part, but a stricter enumeration isneedless. Sanat Kumara is still the Hierophant, yet in a very esoteric manner itis the Planetary Logos Himself who officiates. They are merged at that time intoone Identity, manifesting different aspects.Suffice it to say, in concluding this brief statement, that the making of aninitiate is an affair with a dual effect, for it involves ever a passing on ofsome adept or initiate to a higher grade or to other work, and the coming inunder the Law of some human being who is in process of attainment. Therefore itis a thing of great moment, involving group activity, group loyalty, and unitedendeavour, and much may depend upon the wisdom of admitting a man to high officeand to a place in the council chambers of the Hierarchy.The Departmental Heads .The Manu.The Bodhisattva.The Mahachohan.As has been said, these three great Beings, represent the triplicity of allmanifestation, and might be expressed under the following form, remembering thatall this deals with subjectivity, and therefore with the evolution ofconsciousness and primarily with self-consciousness in man.Consciousness The Manu The Bodhisattva The Mahachohan Matter aspect Spiritaspect Intelligence aspect. Form Life Mind. The Not-Self The Self The relationbetween. Body Spirit Soul.Or, in words strictly dealing with self-conscious realisation.Politics Religion Science. Government Beliefs Civilisation. Races FaithsEducation.All human beings belong to one or other of these three departments, and all areof equal importance, for Spirit and matter are one. All are so interdependent,being but expressions of one life, that the endeavour to express the functionsof the three departments in tabular form is liable to lead to error.The three Great Lords closely co-operate in the work, for that work is one, justas man, though a triplicity, is yet an individual unit. The human being is aform through which a spiritual life or entity is manifesting, and employing theintelligence under evolutionary law.Therefore the Great Lords are closely connected with the initiations of a humanunit. They are too occupied with greater affairs and with group activities tohave any relationship with a man until he stands upon the probationary path.When he has, through his own effort, brought himself on to the Path ofDiscipleship, the particular Master Who has him under supervision reports to theHead of one of the three departments (this being dependent upon a man's ray)that he is nearing the Portal of Initiation and should be ready for the greatstep during such and such a life. Each life, and later each year, report ismade, until the final year upon the Path of Probation, when closer and morefrequent reports are handed in. During this final year also, the applicant'sname is submitted to the Lodge, and after his own Master has reported upon him,and his record has been briefly summarised, his name is balloted, and sponsorsare arranged.During the initiation ceremony the important factors are:1. The Initiator.2. The triangle of force formed by three adepts or three Kumaras.3. The sponsors.In the case of the first two initiations, two Masters stand, one on each side ofthe applicant, within the triangle; at the third, fourth and fifth initiations,the Mahachohan and the Bodhisattva perform the function of sponsor; at the sixthand seventh initiations two great Beings, Who must remain nameless, stand withinthe esoteric triangle. The work of the sponsors is to pass through Their bodiesthe force or electrical energy emanating from the Rod of Initiation. This force,through radiation, circles around the triangle and is supplemented by the forceof the three guardians; it next passes through the centres of the sponsors,being transmitted by an act of will to the initiate.Enough has been said elsewhere in this book anent the Lodge of Masters and Theirrelation to the applicant for initiation, whilst the work of the initiatehimself has been likewise touched upon. That work is not unknown to the childrenof men everywhere, but remains as yet an ideal and a far-off possibility. Yetwhen a man strives to reach that ideal, to make it a demonstrating fact withinhimself, he will find that it becomes not only a possibility, but somethingattainable, provided he strives sufficiently. The first initiation is within thereach of many, but the necessary one-pointedness and the firm belief in thereality ahead, coupled to a willingness to sacrifice all rather than turn back,are deterrents to the many. If this book serves no other purpose than to spursome one to renewed believing effort, it will not have been written in vain."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XII THE TWO REVELATIONSWe can now consider the stages of the initiation ceremony, which are five innumber, as follows:—1. The \"Presence\" revealed.2. The \"Vision\" seen.3. The application of the Rod, affecting:—a. The bodies. b. The centres. c. The causal vehicle.4. The administration of the oath.5. The giving of the \"Secret\" and the Word.These points are given in due order, and it must be remembered that this orderis not idly arranged, but carries the initiate on from revelation to revelationuntil the culminating stage wherein is committed to him one of the secrets andone of the five words of power which open to him the various planes, with alltheir evolutions. All that is aimed at here is to indicate the five maindivisions into which the initiation ceremony naturally divides itself, and thestudent must bear in mind that each of these five stages is in itself a completeceremony, and capable of detailed division.Let us now take up the various points, dwelling briefly upon each, andremembering that words but limit and confine the true meaning.The revelation of the \"Presence.\"Right through the later periods of the cycle of incarnation wherein the man isjuggling with the pairs of opposites, and through discrimination is becomingaware of reality and unreality, there is growing up in his mind a realisationthat he himself is an immortal Existence, an eternal God, and a portion ofInfinity. Ever the link between the man on the physical plane and this innerRuler becomes clearer until the great revelation is made. Then comes a moment inhis existence when the man stands consciously face to face with his real Selfand knows himself to be that Self in reality and not just theoretically; hebecomes aware of the God within, not through the sense of hearing, or throughattention to the inner voice directing and controlling, and called the \"voice ofconscience.\" This time the recognition is through sight and direct vision . Henow responds not only to that which is heard, but also to that which he sees.It is known that the first senses developed in a child are hearing, touch, andsight; the infant becomes aware of sound and turns his head; he feels andtouches; finally, he consciously sees, and in these three senses the personalityis co-ordinated. These are the three vital senses. Taste and smell follow later,but life can be lived without them, and should they be absent, the man remainspractically unhandicapped in his contacts on the physical plane. On the path ofinner, or subjective development, the sequence is the same.Hearing —response to the voice of conscience, as it guides, directs, andcontrols. This covers the period of strictly normal evolution.Touch —response to control or vibration, and the recognition of that which liesoutside of the separated human unit on the physical plane. This covers theperiod of gradual spiritual unfoldment, the Paths of Probation and ofDiscipleship right up to the door of initiation. The man touches at intervalsthat which is higher than himself; he becomes aware of the \"touch\" of theMaster, of the egoic vibration and of group vibration, and through this occultsense of touch he accustoms himself to that which is inner and subtle. Hereaches out after that which concerns the higher self, and through touchingunseen things, habituates himself to them.Finally, Sight —that inner vision which is produced through the initiationprocess, yet which is withal but the recognition of faculty, always present yetunknown. Just as an infant has eyes which are perfectly good and clear frombirth, yet there comes a day wherein the conscious recognition of that which isseen is first to be noted, so with the human unit undergoing spiritualunfoldment. The medium of the inner sight has ever existed, and that which canbe seen is always present, but the recognition of the majority as yet existsnot.This \"recognition\" by the initiate is the first great step in the initiationceremony, and until it has transpired all the other stages must wait. That whichis recognised differs at the different initiations, and might be roughlysummarised as follows:—The Ego, the reflection of the Monad, is in itself a triplicity, as is all elsein nature, and reflects the three aspects of divinity, just as the Monadreflects on a higher plane the three aspects—will, love-wisdom, and activeintelligence—of the Deity. Therefore:At the first initiation the initiate becomes aware of the third, or lowest,aspect of the Ego, that of active intelligence. He is brought face to face withthat manifestation of the great solar angel (Pitri) who is himself, the realself. He knows now past all disturbance that that manifestation of intelligenceis that eternal Entity who has for ages past been demonstrating its powers onthe physical plane through his successive incarnations.At the second initiation this great Presence is seen as a duality, and anotheraspect shines forth before him. He becomes aware that this radiant Life, Who isidentified with himself, is not only intelligence in action but also islove-wisdom in origin. He merges his consciousness with this Life, and becomesone with it so that on the physical plane, through the medium of that personalself, that Life is seen as intelligent love expressing itself.At the third initiation the Ego stands before the initiate as a perfectedtriplicity. Not only is the Self known to be intelligent, active love, but it isrevealed also as a fundamental will or purpose, with which the man immediatelyidentifies himself, and knows that the three worlds hold for him in the futurenaught, but only serve as a sphere for active service, wrought out in lovetowards the accomplishment of a purpose which has been hid during the ages inthe heart of the Self. That purpose, being now revealed, can be intelligentlyco-operated with, and thus matured.These profound revelations shine forth before the initiate in a triple manner:—As a radiant angelic existence . This is seen by the inner eye with the sameaccuracy of vision and judgment as when a man stands face to face with anothermember of the human family. The great solar Angel, Who embodies the real man andis his expression on the plane of higher mind, is literally his divine ancestor,the \"Watcher\" Who, through long cycles of incarnation, has poured Himself out insacrifice in order that man might BE.As a sphere of radiant fire , linked with the initiate standing before it bythat magnetic thread of fire which passes through all his bodies and terminateswithin the centre of the physical brain. This \"silver thread\" (as it is ratherinaccurately called in the Bible, where the description of its loosing of thephysical body and subsequent withdrawal is found) emanates from the heart centreof the solar Angel, linking thus heart and brain,—that great duality manifestingin this solar system, love and intelligence. This fiery sphere is linkedlikewise with many others belonging to the same group and ray, and thus it is aliteral fact in demonstration that on the higher planes we are all one. One lifepulsates and circulates through all, via the fiery strands. This is part of therevelation which comes to a man who stands in the \"Presence\" with his eyesoccultly opened.As a many tinted Lotus of nine petals . These petals are arranged in threecircles around a central set of three closely folded petals, which shield whatis called in the eastern books \"The Jewel in the Lotus.\" This Lotus is a thingof rare beauty, pulsating with life and radiant with all the colours of therainbow, and at the first three initiations the three circles are revealed inorder, until at the fourth initiation the initiate stands before a still greaterrevelation, and learns the secret of that which lies within the central bud. Inthis connection the third initiation differs somewhat from the other two,inasmuch as through the power of a still more exalted Hierophant than theBodhisattva, the electrical fire of pure Spirit, latent in the heart of theLotus, is first contacted.In all these words, \"solar angel,\" \"sphere of fire,\" and \"lotus,\" lies hid someaspect of the central mystery of human life, but it will only he apparent tothose who have eves to see. The mystic significance of these pictorial phraseswill prove only a snare or a basis for incredulity to the man who seeks tomaterialise them unduly. The thought of an immortal existence, of a divineEntity, of a great centre of fiery energy, and of the full flower of evolution,lies hidden in these terms, and they must be thus considered.At the fourth. initiation, the initiate is brought into the Presence of thataspect of Himself which is called \"His Father in Heaven.\" He is brought face toface with his own Monad, that pure spiritual essence on the highest plane butone, which is to his Ego or higher self, what that Ego is to the personality orlower self.This Monad has expressed itself on the mental plane through the Ego in a triplefashion, but now all aspects of the mind, as we understand it, are lacking. Thesolar angel hitherto contacted has withdrawn himself, and the form through whichhe functioned (the egoic or causal body) has gone, and naught is left butlove-wisdom and that dynamic will which is the prime characteristic of Spirit.The lower self has served the purposes of the Ego, and has been discarded; theEgo likewise has served the purposes of the Monad, and is no longer required,and the initiate stands free of both, fully liberated and able to contact theMonad, as earlier he learned to contact the Ego. For the remainder of hisappearances in the three worlds he is governed only by will and purpose,self-initiated, and creates his body of manifestation, and thus controls (withinkarmic limits) his own times and seasons. The karma here referred to isplanetary karma, and not personal.At this fourth initiation he contacts the love aspect of the Monad, and at thefifth the will aspect, and thus completes his contacts, responds to allnecessary vibrations, and is master on the five planes of human evolution.Further, it is at the third, the fourth, and the fifth initiations that hebecomes aware also of that \"Presence\" which enfolds even that spiritual Entity,his own Monad.He sees his Monad as one with the Planetary Logos. Through the channel of hisown Monad he sees the selfsame aspects (which that Monad embodies) on a widerscale, and the Planetary Logos, Who ensouls all the Monads on His ray, is thusrevealed. This truth is well-nigh impossible to express in words, and concernsthe relation of the electrical point of fire, which is the Monad, to thefive-pointed star, which reveals the Presence of the Planetary Logos to theinitiate. This is practically incomprehensible to the average man for whom thisbook is written.At the sixth initiation, the initiate, functioning consciously as thelove-aspect of the Monad, is brought (via his \"Father\") into a still vasterrecognition, and becomes aware of that Star which encloses his planetary star,just as that star has earlier been seen as enclosing his own tiny \"Spark.\" Hethus makes his conscious contact with the solar Logos, and realises withinhimself the Oneness of all life and manifestation.This recognition is extended at the seventh initiation, so that two aspects ofthe One life become realities to the emancipated Buddha.Thus by a graded series of steps is the initiate brought face to face with Truthand Existence. It will be apparent to thoughtful students why this revealing ofthe Presence has to precede all other revelations. It produces within the mindof the initiate the following basic realisations:His faith for ages is justified, and hope and belief merge themselves inself-ascertained fact. Faith is lost in sight, and things unseen are seen andknown. No more can he doubt, but he has become instead, through his own effort,a knower.His oneness with his brothers is proven, and he realises the indissoluble linkwhich binds him to his fellow-men everywhere. Brotherhood is no longer a theorybut a proven scientific fact, no more to be disputed than the separateness ofmen on the physical plane is to be disputed.The immortality of the soul and the reality of the unseen worlds is for himproven and ascertained. Whereas, before initiation, this belief was based onbrief and fleeting vision and strong inner convictions (the result of logicalreasoning and of a gradually developing intuition) now it is based on sight andon a recognition past all disproving, of his own immortal nature.He realises the meaning and source of energy, and can begin to wield power withscientific accuracy and direction. He knows now whence he draws it, and has hada glimpse of the resources of energy which are available. Before, he knew thatthat energy existed, and used it blindly and sometimes unwisely; now he sees itunder the direction of the \"open mind,\" and can co-operate intelligently withthe forces of nature.Thus, in many ways, does the revelation of the Presence produce definite resultsin the initiate, and thus it is judged by the Hierarchy to be the necessarypreamble to all later revelations.The Revelation of the Vision .Having brought the initiate face to face with the One with whom for countlessages he has had to do, and having awakened in him an unshakable realisation ofthe oneness of the fundamental life as it manifests through all lesser lives,the next momentous revelation is that of the Vision. The first revelation hasconcerned that which is undefinable, illimitable, and (to the finite mind),infinite in its abstractness and absoluteness. The second revelation concernstime and space, and involves the recognition by the initiate—through the newlyaroused sense of occult sight—of the part he has played and has to play in theplan, and later of the plan itself in so far as it concerns:—a. His Ego. b. His egoic group. c. His ray group. d. His Planetary Logos.In this fourfold apprehension you have portrayed the gradual realisation that ishis during the process of the four initiations preceding final liberation.At the first initiation he becomes aware definitely of the part, relativelyinconspicuous, that he has to play in his personal life during the periodensuing between the moment of revelation and the taking of the secondinitiation. This may involve one more life or several. He knows the trend theyshould take, he realises somewhat his share in the service of the race; he seesthe plan as a whole where he himself is concerned, a tiny mosaic within thegeneral pattern; he becomes conscious of how he—with his particular type ofmind, aggregate of gifts, mental and otherwise, and his varying capacities—canserve, and what must be accomplished by him before he can again stand in thePresence, and receive an extended revelation.At the second initiation the part his egoic group plays in the general scheme isshown to him. He becomes more aware of the different group units with whom he isintrinsically associated; he realises who they are in their personalities, if inincarnation, and he sees somewhat what are the karmic relations between groups,units and himself; he is given an insight into the specific group purpose, andits relation to other groups. He can now work with added assurance, and hisintercourse with people on the physical plane becomes more certain; he can bothaid them and himself in the adjusting of karma, and therefore bring about a morerapid approach to the final liberation. Group relations are consolidated, andthe plans and purposes can be furthered more intelligently. As thisconsolidation of group relations proceeds, it produces on the physical planethat concerted action and that wise unity in purpose which results in thematerialisation of the higher ideals, and the adaptation of force in the wisefurthering of the ends of evolution. When this has reached a certain stage, theunits forming the groups have learned to work together, and have thus stimulatedeach other; they can now proceed to a further expansion of knowledge, resultingin a further capacity to help.At the third initiation there is revealed to the initiate the purpose of thesubray of the ray to which he belongs, that upon which his Ego finds itself. Allegoic units are upon some subray of the monadic ray. This knowledge is conferredupon the initiate so as to enable him eventually to find for himself (along theline of least resistance) the ray of his Monad. This subray bears upon itsstream of energy many groups of Egos, and the initiate is therefore made awarenot only of his egoic group and its intelligent purpose, but of many othergroups, similarly composed. Their united energy is working towards a clearlydefined goal.Having learned somewhat group relations, and having developed the ability towork with units in group formation, the initiate now learns the secret of groupsubordination to the good of the aggregate of groups. This will demonstrate onthe physical plane as an ability to work wisely, intelligently and harmoniouslywith many diverse types, and to co-operate in large plans and wield wideinfluence.A part of the plans of the Planetary Logos becomes revealed to him, and thevision includes the revelation of the plan and purpose as it concerns theplanet, though as yet the vision is obscured in connection with those plans intheir planetary relationship. This brings the initiate through a series ofgraded realisations to the portals of the fourth initiation. Through the entireloosing of the initiate from all trammels in the three worlds and the breakingof all bonds of limiting karma, the vision this time is greatly extended, and itmight be said that for the first time he becomes aware of the extent ofplanetary purpose and karma within the scheme. His own personal unimportantkarma being now adjusted, he can give his attention to the working off ofplanetary karma, and the far reaching plans of that great Life Who includes allthe lesser lives. He not only is brought to a full recognition of the purposesand plans for all the evolutions upon his own planetary scheme, the earth, butalso there swings into the radius of his apprehension that planetary schemewhich is our earth's complement or polar opposite. He realises theinter-relation existing between the two schemes and the vast dual purpose isrevealed to him. It is shown to him how this dual purpose must become one unitedplan, and henceforth he bends all his energies towards planetary co-operation asit is furthered by work with and through the two great evolutions, human anddeva, upon our planet. This concerns the making of adjustments, and the gradualapplication of energy in stimulation of the various kingdoms in nature, so thatthrough the blending of all of nature's forces the interplay of energy betweenthe two schemes may be quickened. In this way the plans of the solar Logos, asthey are being worked out through two Planetary Logoi, may be consummated. Thehandling, therefore, of solar energy on a tiny scale, is now his privilege, andhe is admitted not only into the council chambers of his own Hierarchy, but ispermitted entrance also when agents from other planetary schemes are inconference with the Lord of the World and the two great departmental heads.At the fifth Initiation the vision brings to him a still more extended outlookand a third planetary scheme is seen, forming with the other two schemes one ofthose triangles of force which are necessitated in the working out of solarevolution. Just as all manifestation proceeds through duality and triplicityback to eventual synthesis so these schemes, which are but centres of force inthe body of a solar Logos, work first as separated units living their ownintegral life, then as dualities, through the interplay of force through any twoschemes, thus aiding, stimulating and complementing each other, and finally as asolar triangle, circulating force from point to point and centre to centre untilthe energy is merged and synthesised and the three work together in unity.When the adept of the fifth initiation can work in line with the plans of thethree Logoi involved, co-operating with Them with ever greater ability, as timeelapses, he becomes ready for the sixth Initiation, which admits him to stillhigher conclaves. He becomes a participant in solar and not merely planetarypurposes.At this sixth Initiation the most marvelous vision of the entire series is his.He sees the solar system as a unit, and gets a brief revealing which opens tohis amazed understanding the fundamental purpose of the solar Logos; for thefirst time he sees the plans as a whole in all their ramifications.At the seventh Initiation his vision penetrates beyond the solar ring-pass-not,and he sees that which he has long realised as a basic theoretical fact, thatour solar Logos is involved in the plans and purposes of a still greaterExistence, and that the solar system is but one of many centres of force throughwhich a cosmic Entity vastly greater than our own solar Logos is expressingHimself. In these visions one great purpose underlies them all,—the revelationof essential unity and the unveiling of those inner relationships, which, whenknown, will tend ever more fully to swing the initiate into the line ofself-abnegating service, and which will make of him one who works towardssynthesis, towards harmony, and towards a basic unity.During the Initiation ceremony, the opening of the eyes of the Initiate to seeand realise, divides itself into three parts, which are nevertheless parts ofone process:—1. The past sweeps before him, and he sees himself playing many parts, all ofwhich are realised to be but the gradual bringing of his forces and capacitiesto the point where he can be of service to and with his group. He sees andidentifies himself—according to the particular initiation—with a. Himself inmany earlier lives. b. His group in earlier groups of lives. c. His egoic ray asit pours down through many cycles of time. d. His Planetary Logos as Hefunctions in the past through many evolutions and kingdoms in the entire scheme,and so on until he has identified himself with the past of the one life flowingthrough all planetary schemes and evolutions in the solar system. This producesin him the resolve to work off karma, and the knowledge (from the seeing of pastcauses) of how it must be accomplished.2. The present . It is revealed to him what is the specific work to be doneduring the lesser cycle in which he is immediately involved. This means that hesees not only that which concerns him in any one life, but he knows what is tobe the immediate bit of the plan—involving maybe several of his tiny cyclescalled lives—which the Planetary Logos seeks to see consummated. He then may besaid to know his work past all gainsaying, and can apply himself to his taskwith a clear knowledge as to the why, the how, and the when.3. The future . Then, for his encouragement, there is granted to him a pictureof a final consummation of a glory past all description, with a few outstandingpoints indicative of the major steps thereto. He sees for one brief second theglory as it shall be, and that path of radiant beauty which shineth ever moreand more unto the perfect day. In the earlier stages he sees the glory of hisperfected egoic group; later the radiance which pours forth from the ray whichcarries on its bosom the perfected sons of men of one particular colour andtype; later again he gets a glimpse of the perfection of that great Being who ishis own Planetary Logos, until finally the perfection of all beauty and theradiance which includes all other rays of light is revealed,—the sun shining inhis strength, the solar Logos at the moment of consummated purpose."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIII THE RODS OF INITIATIONThe Rods of Initiation are of four kinds:—1. Cosmic , used by a cosmic Logos in the initiations of a solar Logos and ofthe three major Planetary Logoi.2. Systemic , used by a solar Logos in the initiations of a Planetary Logos.With cosmic initiation we have naught to do; it concerns expansions ofrealisation beyond even the ken of the highest initiate in our solar system.With systemic initiations we are concerned only in trifling measure, for theyare on so vast a scale that the average human mind cannot as yet envisage them.Man appreciates these initiations only in so far as they produce effects in theplanetary scheme with which he may be concerned. Particularly is this so shouldthe scheme in which he plays his microscopic part be the centre in the Logoicbody receiving stimulation. When that is the case, the initiation of his ownPlanetary Logos takes place, and consequently he (as a cellular body) receivesan added stimulation along with the other sons of men.3. Planetary , used by a Planetary Logos for initiatory purposes, and for thethird, fourth, and fifth major initiations, with the two higher. At theplanetary initiation the Rod of Power, wielded by the solar Logos, is chargedwith pure electrical force from Sirius, and was received by our Logos during thesecondary period of creation, from the hands of that great Entity Who is thepresiding Lord of the Lords of Karma. He is the repository of the law duringmanifestation, and He it is Who is the representative in the solar system ofthat greater Brotherhood on Sirius Whose Lodges are found functioning as theoccult Hierarchies in the different planets. Again, He it is Who, with the solarLogos to assist Him, invests the various Initiators with power, gives to Themthat word in secret which enables Them to draw down the pure electric force withwhich Their rods of office must be charged, and commits to Their keeping thepeculiar secret of Their particular planetary scheme.4. Hierarchical , used by an occult Hierarchy for minor initiations, and for thefirst two initiations of manas by the Bodhisattva.When man individualised in Lemurian days, it was through the application of theRod of Initiation to the Logos of our earth chain, which touched into activitycertain centres in His body, with their corresponding groups. This applicationproduced literally the awakening of the life to intelligent work on the mentalplane. Animal man was conscious on the physical and on the astral planes. By thestimulation effected by the electric rod this animal man awoke to consciousnesson the mental. Thus the three bodies were co-ordinated, and the Thinker enabledto function in them.All Rods of Initiation cause certain effects:a. Stimulation of the latent fires till they blaze. b. Synthesis of the firesthrough an occult activity that brings them within the radius of each other. c.Increase of the vibratory activity of some centre, whether in man, a HeavenlyMan, or a solar Logos. d. Expansion of all the bodies, but primarily of thecausal body. e. The arousing of the kundalinic fire (or the fire at the base ofthe spine), and the direction of its upward progression. This fire and the fireof manas, are directed along certain routes—or triangles—by the following of theRod as it moves in a specified manner. There is a definite occult reason, underthe laws of electricity, behind the known fact that every initiate presented tothe Initiator is accompanied by two of the Masters, Who stand one on either sideof the initiate. The three of Them together form a triangle which makes the workpossible.The force of the Rod is twofold, and its power terrific. Apart and alone theinitiate could not receive the voltage from the Rod without serious hurt, but intriangular transmission comes safety. We need to remember here that two Masterssponsor all applicants for initiation, and represent two polarities of theelectric All. Part of Their function is to stand with applicants for initiationwhen they come before the Great Lord.When the rods are held in the hands of the Initiator in His position of power,and at the stated seasons, they act as transmitters of electric force from veryhigh levels, so high indeed that the \"Flaming Diamond,\" at certain of the finalinitiations, the sixth and seventh, transmits force via the Logos from outsidethe system altogether. This major Rod is the one used on this planet, but withinthe system there are several such Rods of Power, and they are to be found inthree grades—if it may be so expressed.One Rod of Initiation is used for the first two initiations, and is wielded bythe Great Lord. It is magnetised by the application of the \"Flaming Diamond,\"the magnetisation being repeated for each new World Teacher. There is awonderful ceremony performed at the time that a new World Teacher takes office,in which He receives His Rod of Power—the same Rod as used since the foundationof our Planetary Hierarchy—and holds it forth to the Lord of the World, Whotouches it with His own mighty Rod, causing a fresh recharging of its electriccapacity. This ceremony takes place at Shamballa.The Rod of Initiation known as the \"Flaming Diamond,\" is used by Sanat Kumara,the One Initiator. This Rod lies hidden \"in the East,\" and holds the fire hiddenthat irradiates the Wisdom Religion. This Rod was brought by the Lord of theWorld from Venus, and once in every world period it is subjected to a similarprocess to that of the lesser Rod, only this time it is recharged by the directaction of the Logos Himself, the Logos of the solar system. The exact locationof this Rod is known only to the Lord of the World and to the Chohans of therays, and being the talisman of this evolution the Chohan of the second rayis—under the Lord of the World—its prime guardian, aided by the deva Lord of thesecond plane. The Buddhas of Activity are responsible for its custody, and underThem the Chohan of the ray. It is produced only at stated times, when specificwork has to be done. It is used not only at the initiating of men, but atcertain planetary functions of which nothing is at present known. It has itsplace and function in certain ceremonies connected with the inner round, and thetriangle formed by the Earth, Mars, and Mercury.The Purpose of the Rods of Power .In the sceptre of a ruling monarch at this day is hidden the symbolism of thesevarious Rods. They are duly recognised as symbols of office and of power, but itis not generally appreciated that they are of electrical origin, and that theirtrue significance is concerned with the dynamic stimulation of all thesubordinates in office who come under their touch, thus inspiring them toincreased activity and service for the race.The great Rod of Power of the Logos Himself is hidden in the sun.To recapitulate, the esoteric location of the various rods is as follows:—1. The Rod of the Bodhisattva lies hidden in the \"heart of the wisdom,\" that is,at Shamballa.2. The Rod of the One Initiator is hidden in \"the East,\" a definite planetarylocation.3. The Rod of the solar Logos is hidden in \"the heart of the sun,\" thatmysterious subjective sphere which lies back of our physical sun, and of whichour physical sun is but the environing shield and envelope.4. The Rod of the cosmic Logos associated with our solar Logos is secreted inthat central spot in the heavens around which our solar system revolves, andwhich is termed \"the central spiritual sun.\"One Rod is charged anew at Shamballa for each new World Teacher; the Rod ofSanat Kumara is charged afresh at each recurring world period, and thereforeseven times in the history of a planetary scheme. The Logoic Rod of Power iselectrified at the recurrence of each new period of creation, or for each solarsystem through which the Logos manifests, as a man manifests through hisphysical body life. The first two ceremonies take place at Shamballa, the sacredpoint of planetary manifestation, that central location in our physical planetwhich corresponds to the heart of a human being. Many of the places on theearth's surface, for instance, which are famed for their healing properties, arethus noted because they are magnetised spots, and their magnetic propertiesdemonstrate as healing influences. The recognition of these properties by man isbut the preamble of a later and more definite recognition, which will eventuatewhen his etheric sight is normally developed.These magnetic spots are magnetised in three ways:—1. By Sanat Kumara working through the Manu. This occurs when it is desirable toform a central magnetic point which, by its attractive power, will draw into acoherent whole some race, nation, or large organisation. Every nation has its\"magnetic point,\" formed in etheric matter by the application of the \"FlamingDiamond\" to the ethers; it is the national heart and the basis of the nationalcharacter. Usually the chief city of a nation is built up around it, but this isnot invariably so.2. By Sanat Kumara working through the Bodhisattva. In this case, the electricforce in the Rod is wielded in order to draw closer together those influenceswhich demonstrate in the great religions of the world. The lesser Rod of Poweris used here in conjunction with the greater. By their means the attractivequality or keynote of any religion is struck, and of any organisation with areligious basis.3. By Sanat Kumara working through the Mahachohan. By the wielding of the Rod ofPower the magnetic focal points of those great organisations which affect thecivilisation and the culture of a people are brought into coherent activity.All physical plane organisation—governmental, religious, or cultural—is theworking out of inner forces and causes, and, before they definitely appear inphysical manifestation, a focalisation—if it might be so expressed—of theseinfluences and energies, takes place on etheric levels. The organisation of theFreemasons is a case in point. It has two magnetic centres, one of which is inCentral Europe. In all the cases cited, the Lord of the World was theofficiating agent, as is ever the case in the founding of great and importantmovements. In all lesser movements for the helping of the race, initiated by theMasters working through Their disciples, the aid of the Bodhisattva is invoked,and the lesser Rod of Power employed.When disciples initiate a movement on a relatively tiny scale, the Master withWhom they work can similarly assist them, and though He wields no Rod of Power,He has methods whereby He can stimulate and cause to cohere the little endeavourof the faithful followers. Thus in all departments of human life the Rods ofInitiation and the Words of Power are used. The entire world governmentfunctions under law and order, and the whole scheme is interdependent.To return to the subject of human initiation, and these Rods of Power. At thetime of the Initiation ceremony, after the two great revelations there comes amoment of utter silence, and in the interim the initiate realises within himselfthe meaning of \"Peace .\" He stands, as it were, in a void, or in a vacuum,wherein naught seemingly can reach him; he stands betwixt earth and heaven for abrief second, conscious of naught but the meaning of things as they are,realising his own essential divinity, and the part which he must play when heagain returns to earth service from the Council Chamber of Heaven. He isconscious of no anxiety, fear, or doubt. He has contacted the divine \"Presence,\"and has seen the vision. He knows what he has to do and how he must do it, andpeace and joy unutterable fill his heart. This is an interlude of stillnessbefore a period of renewed activity, which begins at the moment that the Rod isapplied. Whilst he has been thus withdrawn within himself, with all his forcescentred in his heart, the attendant Lodge of Masters have been performingcertain ceremonies and chanting certain words, preparatory to the appearance ofthe Initiator upon the throne, and the wielding of the Rod. The Hierophant hashitherto been present, but the work has been handled by the Lodge and theSponsors. He now ascends to the place of power, and the Rod is brought to Him byits legitimate custodians.It is not possible here to publish the details of the next stage, beyond usingthe description as embodied in the words \"fire descends from heaven.\" Throughthe utterance of certain words and phrases, which are one of the secrets ofinitiation, and which vary with each initiation, the electrical force to beemployed descends upon the Rod, passing through the heart and the hand of theInitiator to the Three Who stand in triangular relation to the throne of office.They receive it in turn, and circulate it by act of will through Their hearts,thus passing it to the Sponsors. They again, by an act of will, prepare totransmit it to that centre in the body of the Initiate which is (according tothe initiation) to receive stimulation. Then succeeds an interesting interlude,wherein the united wills of the Hierarchy are blended in order to transmit thatforce which the Rod has put into circulation. The Hierophant utters the word,and the force is literally thrown into the initiate's bodies and centres,passing down through the centres on the mental plane, via the astral centres, tothe centres on etheric levels, which finally absorb it. This is the stupendousmoment for the initiate, and brings to him a realisation of the literal absolutetruth of the phrase that \"God is a consuming fire.\" He knows past all gainsayingthat fiery energy and electric force constitute the sumtotal of all that is. Heis literally bathed in the fires of purification; he sees fire on all sides,pouring out through the Rod, circulating around the Triangle, and passingthrough the bodies of the two sponsoring adepts. For a brief second, the entireLodge of Masters and initiates, standing in Their ceremonial places without theTriangle, are hidden from view by a wall of pure fire. The initiate sees no one,save the Hierophant, and is aware of nothing but a fiery blaze of pure,blue-white flame, which burns, but destroys not, which intensifies the activityof every atom in his body without disintegrating, and which purifies his entirenature. The fire tries his work, of what sort it is, and he passes through theFlame.The Effect of the Application of the Rod .A. Upon the Initiate's bodies: The effect is four-fold and lasting, but variesaccording to the initiation taken. The action of the Rod is most carefully andscientifically regulated, and at each succeeding initiation the voltage isincreased, and the activity of the resulting fire and its heat intensified. Bythe application of the Rod the initiate finds:—1. That the activity of each individual atom in the various bodies is increased,resulting in a greater degree of nervous energy and an elasticity and resistancewhich will serve him in good stead in the strenuous life of service ahead.2. That matter of an undesirable type in his bodies is shaken loose, and theatomic wall somewhat destroyed, making the atoms radioactive—if it might be soexpressed—and therefore more easily eliminated.3. The fires of the body are stimulated, and the total energy of the threefoldlower man is co-ordinated, so that there is less waste of energy and a greatercoherence and uniformity in action.4. The aligning of the various bodies in connection with the causal, or egoicbody is aided, and thus continuity of consciousness, and receptivity to thebehests of the Ego, become possible.The initiate will find, when he returns from the ceremony, and takes up his workin the world, that the stimulation received will bring about in his bodies aperiod of great activity, and also of strife. This strife, persisted in to thepoint of victory, will result in his taking out of his body undesirable matter,and building in new and better material; he will find that his powers forservice are enormously increased, and his nervous energy intensified, so that hecan draw upon reserves of force in service hitherto unsuspected. He will find,also, that the response of the physical brain to the voice of the higher Self,and its receptivity to the higher and subtler impressions, is greatly furthered.Eventually, through the work accomplished, he will succeed in eliminating allmatter of a subatomic character, and will then build bodies of substance of thehighest subplane on each plane; he will become aware that all his energies canbe consciously and constructively controlled, that he knows the real meaning ofcontinuity of consciousness, and can function simultaneously on the three planeswith full inner realisation.B. Upon the causal or egoic body .It is only possible to touch very briefly upon the effect of the application ofthe Rod to the causal body of the initiate. The subject is immense, and will bemore fully dealt with in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire . There are just two ways inwhich some idea of the fundamental truth will be conveyed to the mind of thestudent, which we might now consider.First, the student should bear in mind the interesting significance of the factthat he, on the physical plane, is a functioning personality, with known andrealised characteristics, and yet withal, that he is a subjective Life, who usesthat personality as a medium of expression, and who—through the agency of thephysical, emotional, and mental bodies which comprise the threefold lowerman—makes his contacts with the physical plane and thus develops. The samegeneral idea of development must be now extended to the higher Self, the Ego onits own plane. This Ego is a great solar angel, who is the medium of expressionfor the Monad or pure spirit, just as is the personality for the Ego on thelower level. From the point of view of man in the three worlds, this Ego, orSolar Lord, is eternal; he persists throughout the entire cycle of incarnations,just as the personality persists during the tiny physical life cycle.Nevertheless, this period of existence is only relatively permanent, and the daydawns when the life which expresses itself through the medium of the Ego, theThinker, the Solar Lord or Manasadeva, seeks to loose itself from even thislimitation, and to return to the source from which it originally emanated.The life then, which manifested as a solar angel, and which, through inherentenergy, held together through long ages the form egoic, withdraws itselfgradually, and the form slowly dissipates; the lesser lives of which it has beenconstituted, return to the general fount of deva substance, plus the increasedconsciousness and activity which is theirs through the experience of being builtinto a form, and utilised by a still higher aspect of existence. Similarly, inthe case of the personality, when the life egoic withdraws, the threefold lowerself dissipates; the little lives which form the body of what has been calledthe lunar self (in contradistinction to the solar self, being but itsreflection) are absorbed into the general reservoir of deva substance of a lowervibration to that which composed the body egoic. Similarly, also, theirevolution has been furthered through having been built into a form for the useof the higher Self.Through the application of the Rod of Initiation, the work of separating thespiritual self from the higher self is furthered, and the imprisoned lifegradually escapes, whilst the causal body is slowly absorbed or dissipated.This has led to the expression, sometimes used in occult books, of \"the crackingof the causal body\" at each initiation, and to the idea of the inner centralfire gradually breaking through and destroying the confining walls, and also ofthe destruction of the Temple of Solomon through the withdrawal of the Shekinah.All these phrases are symbolic wordings, and are attempts to convey to the mindof man fundamental truth from different angles.By the time the fourth initiation has been reached, the work of destruction isaccomplished, the solar angel returns to his own place, having performed hisfunction, and the solar lives seek their point of emanation. The life within theform mounts up then in triumph to the bosom of its \"Father in Heaven,\" just asthe life within the physical body at the moment of death seeks its source, theEgo, and this likewise in four stages:—1. By the withdrawal from the dense physical body.2. By the withdrawal from the etheric body.3. By a later vacating of the astral body.4. A final leaving of the mental body.Another way of emphasising the same truth is to regard he egoic body as a centreof force, a wheel of energy, or a lotus, and to picture it as a lotus with ninepetals, hiding within these petals a central unit of three petals; these in turnsecrete the central life, or the \"jewel in the lotus.\" As evolution proceeds,these three circles of three petals gradually unfold, having a simultaneouseffect on one or other of the central three. These three circles are calledrespectively the petals of Sacrifice, Love, and Knowledge. At initiation the Rodis applied to the petals in a scientific manner, and regulated according to rayand tendency. This brings about the opening of the central bud, the revelationof the jewel, the withdrawal of that jewel from the casket which has so longshielded it, and its transference to \"the crown,\" as it is occultly called,meaning its return to the Monad whence it came.We must clearly recognise that all the above is but an attempt, through thelimiting agency of words, to describe the method and the rites whereby spiritualliberation is finally achieved in this cycle; first, through the method ofevolutionary unfoldment, or gradual development, and then in the final stagesthrough the Rod of Initiation.C. Upon the centres .At the time that initiation is taken, the centres are all active, and the lowerfour (which correspond to the Personality) are beginning the process oftranslating the fire into the three higher. The dual revolution in the lowercentres is clearly to be seen, and the three higher are commencing to besimilarly active. By the application of the Rod of Initiation at the time of theinitiation ceremony, definite results are achieved in connection with thecentres, which might be enumerated as follows:—The fire at the base of the spine is definitely directed to whichever centre isthe object of special attention. This varies according to ray, or thespecialised work of the initiate.The centre has its activity intensified, its rate of revolution increased, andcertain of the central spokes of the wheel brought into more active radiance.These spokes of the wheel, or these petals of the lotus, have a close connectionwith the different spirillae in the permanent atoms, for instance, and in theirstimulation comes into play one or more of the corresponding spirillae in thepermanent atoms on the three lower planes. After the third initiation acorresponding stimulation takes place in the permanent atoms of the Triad,leading to a co-ordination of the buddhic vehicle, and the transference of thelower polarisation into the higher.By the application of the Rod of Initiation, the down-flow of force from the Egoto the personality is tripled, the direction of that force being dependent uponwhether the centres receiving attention are the etheric or the astral at thefirst and second initiations, or whether the initiate is standing before theLord of the World. In the latter case, his mental centres, or theircorresponding force vortices on higher levels, will receive stimulation. Whenthe World Teacher initiates at the first and second initiations, the directionof the triadal force is turned to the vivification of the heart and throatcentres in their position of synthesising the lower. When the One Initiatorapplies the Rod of His power, the downflow is from the Monad, and though thethroat and heart intensify vibration as a response, the main direction of theforce is to the seven head centres, and finally (at liberation) to the radianthead centre above, synthesising the lesser seven head centres.The centres, at initiation, receive a fresh access of vibratory capacity and ofpower, and this results in the exoteric life as:—1. A sensitiveness and refinement of the vehicles which may result at first inmuch suffering to the initiate, but which produce a capacity to respond, thatfar outweighs the incidental pain.2. A development of psychic faculty that again may lead to temporary distress,but which eventually causes a recognition of the one self in all selves, whichis the goal of endeavour.S. A burning away of the etheric web, through the gradual arousing of kundaliniand its correct geometrical progression, and a resultant continuity ofconsciousness that enables the initiate consciously to utilise time as a factoron the planes of evolution.4. A gradual grasp of the law of vibration as an aspect of the basic law ofbuilding, the law of attraction, is brought about, and the initiate learnsconsciously to build, to manipulate thought matter for the perfecting of theplans of the Logos, to work in mental essence, and to apply the law on mentallevels, and thereby affect the physical plane. Motion originates cosmically oncosmic levels, and in the microcosm the same will be seen. There is an occulthint here that, pondered on, will reveal much. At initiation, at the moment ofthe application of the Rod, the initiate consciously realises the meaning of theLaw of Attraction in form building, and in the synthesis of the three fires.Upon his ability to retain that realisation, and himself to apply the law, willdepend his power to progress.5. The Hierophant transmits higher manasic energy to the initiate, so that he isenabled consciously to know and recognise the plan for his group centre, throughthe immensely increased stimulation. This force descends from the manasicpermanent atom via the antahkarana, and is directed to whichever centre theHierophant—under the law—sees should be stimulated.6. The Initiator stabilises the force and regulates its flow, as it circulatesthrough the egoic body, so that when the work of unfoldment is accomplished, theseventh principle at the Heart of the Lotus can stand revealed. After eachinitiation the lotus is more unfolded, and light from the centre begins to blazeforth—a light or fire which ultimately burns through the three enshriningpetals, and permits the full inner glory to be seen, and the electric fire ofspirit to be manifested. As this is brought about on the second subplane of themental plane (whereon the egoic lotus is now situated) a correspondingstimulation takes place in the dense substance which forms the petals or wheelsof the centres on the astral and etheric levels."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIV THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE OATHThe Work of the Lodge during Initiation .We now come to the most solemn part of the initiation ceremony. This ceremony,from one point of view, divides itself into three parts:—First. That in which the initiate is concerned and in which he realises his ownaugust Self, the Presence, and sees the vision and the plan.Second. That in which the Initiator is concerned, in which He wields the Rod ofFire, and effects certain specific results in the body of the applicant.Third. That in which certain words and formulas are committed to the initiate bythe Hierophant, and which he carries away within his consciousness in order thebetter to carry out that portion of the plan which concerns himself.During the whole procedure the Lodge of Masters, congregated without theTriangle of force, has been occupied with a three-fold work, Their aim being toproduce certain results in the consciousness of the initiate and thus to aid theHierophant in His strenuous endeavour. It must be remembered that under the lawof economy wherever there is an application or a transmission of force from oneforce centre to another there is a consequent diminution in the centre ofwithdrawal. This is the basis of the set times and seasons in connection withthe initiation ceremony. The sun is the source of all energy and power, and thework of the Initiator is facilitated when advantage is taken of favourable solarconditions. The times and seasons are ascertained through esoteric solar andcosmic astrology; this being based, of course, on the correct figures, the truemathematical conception, and a real knowledge of the basic facts concerning theplanets and the solar system. The horoscope of the initiate is also invariablycast so as to check the time for an individual initiation, and only when theindividual signs blend and coincide with the ceremonial chart by which theInitiator is guided, is it possible to perform the ceremony. This is the reasonwhy sometimes initiation has to be postponed to a later life, even when theinitiate has done the necessary work.The threefold work of the Lodge during the ceremony may be described asfollows:—First: The chanting of certain mantrams sets loose energy from a particularplanetary centre. It must be remembered here that every planetary scheme is acentre in the body of a Solar Logos, and embodies a peculiar type of energy orforce. According to the energy desired at a particular initiation, so it istransferred, via the sun, from that planetary centre to the initiate. Theprocedure is as follows:—a. The energy is set in motion from the planetary centre through the power ofthe Planetary Logos, aided by the scientific knowledge of the Lodge, and theutilisation of certain words of power. b. It passes thence to the sun where itmingles with pure solar energy. c. It is transmitted from the sun to thatparticular chain in our Earth scheme which corresponds numerically to theparticular originating planetary scheme.d. From there it is transferred to the corresponding globe, and thence to thedense physical planet. By the use of a particular mantram the Initiator thenfocuses the energy in His own body, using it both as a receiving and atransmitting station. Eventually it reaches the initiate, via the Triangle andthe Sponsors. It will be apparent, therefore, to the student that when theInitiator is the Lord of the World, or the physical reflection of the PlanetaryLogos of our scheme, the force comes more directly to the initiate than at thefirst two initiations, wherein the Bodhisattva is the Hierophant. Only at thethird initiation will the initiate be in a condition to receive direct planetaryforce.Second: The concentration undertaken by the Lodge assists the initiate torealise within himself the various processes undergone. This is accomplished byworking definitely on. his mental body, and thus stimulating all the atoms,through the united thought power of the Masters. The work of apprehension isthus directly aided. This concentration in no way resembles hypnotic suggestion,or the powerful impress of stronger minds upon the weaker. It takes the form ofa strenuous meditation by the assembled Masters and initiates upon the realitiesconcerned and upon the Self; through the force thus liberated the initiate isenabled to transfer his consciousness more easily away from the not-self to thedivine essentials wherewith he is immediately concerned. The thought power ofthe Masters succeeds in shutting out the vibration of the three worlds andenables the applicant literally to \"leave behind him\" all the past and to havethat far-seeing vision which sees the end from the beginning and the things oftime as though they were not.Third: Through certain ceremonial rhythmic action the Lodge greatly assists inthe work of initiation. Just as in the Wesak Festival, results in forcedemonstration arc brought about by the use of chanted mantrams and the sacredceremonial pacing and interweaving of the assembled crowd in the formation ofgeometrical figures, so in the initiation ceremony a similar procedure isfollowed. The geometrical figures appropriate for the various initiationsdiffer, and herein lies one of the safeguards of the ceremony. The initiateknows the set figure for his own initiation, but no more.All these three aspects of the work of the Masters and initiates in Lodgeassembled, occupy them until the moment when the Rod has been applied. Throughits application the initiate has become a member of the Lodge, and the entireceremonial then changes, prior to the taking of the oath and the revelation ofthe Word and Secret.The Sponsors drop back from either side of the initiate and take Their places inthe ranks, whilst the three Buddhas of Activity (or Their representatives at thefirst two initiations) take Their stand behind the seat of office of theHierophant. The Lodge members are grouped differently, and initiates of the samedegree as the newly admitted applicant place themselves around him, and assistin the final part of the ceremony; the remainder of the initiates and adeptsstand in their various grades.The earlier three stages of the initiation ceremony are the same for allinitiations. In the final two stages those who are not of equal rank with thenewly made initiate (such as first degree initiates at the initiation of a thirddegree member) drop back to the rear of the Hall of Initiation at Shamballa, anda \"wall of silence\" is built up through mantric energy between the two groups; avacuum, so to speak, is formed, and nothing can then be transmitted from theinner group to the outer. The latter confine themselves to deep meditation andthe chanting of certain formulas, and in the inner group around the Hierophant adual performance is taking place:a. The newly made initiate is taking the oath. b. Certain Words and Secrets arebeing handed over to him.Two Types of Oaths .All oaths connected with the occult Hierarchy may be divided into two groups:—1. The Oath of Initiation , in which the initiate binds himself by the mostsolemn pledges never to reveal, on pain of summary punishment, any occultsecret, or to express in words outside the Initiation Hall that which has beencommitted to his keeping.2. The Oath of Office , administered when any member of the Lodge takes aspecific post in Hierarchical work. This oath deals with his functions and withhis relations to a. The Lord of the World, b. His immediate superior, c. Hisfellow workers in the Lodge, d. The world of men whom he is to serve.It is needless to say more here regarding this latter type of oath, as itconcerns only officials of the Hierarchy.The Oath of Initiation .The Oath of Initiation, with which we are dealing now, is divided into threesections, and is administered by the Hierophant to the initiate, being repeatedafter the Initiator phrase by phrase; it is punctuated at various points by thechanting, by initiates of the same degree, of words in Sensa equivalent to \"Solet it be.\"The three divisions of the oath may be roughly described as:—1. A solemn phrase embodying the purpose actuating the initiate, a protestationas to his unchangeable will-attitude, and a solemn declaration as to hisrealisation, coupled with a promise to reveal no part of the realised purposeexcept in so far as his daily life in the world of men and his service for therace will proclaim it. This involves an oath as to secrecy concerning therevealed part of the Logoic plan seen in the \"revelation of the vision.\"2. An undertaking of a profoundly solemn nature concerning his relation to hisother selves, the Lodge of which he is a member, and the selves of meneverywhere. This involves his attitude to his brothers of all degrees, andincludes also a serious undertaking never to reveal the true nature of the Selfaspect as it has been shown to him in initiation. This includes an oath ofsecrecy as to the realised relationship of the Solar Logos to the PlanetaryLogos, and of the Planetary Logos of our scheme to the scheme itself.3. The enunciation of a solemn undertaking never to reveal to anyone theknowledge that has come to him as to the sources of energy and of force withwhich he has been brought into contact. This is a triple oath to retain completesilence as to the true nature of energy, as to its laws of manipulation, and apledge only to use the force placed at his disposal through initiation for theservice of the race and the furthering of the plans of the Planetary Logos.This great oath is couched in different terms, according to the initiationundergone, and, as earlier said, is taken in three sections with an interludebetween each part occupied by certain ceremonial work of the initiated grouparound the newly admitted brother.It might here be noted that each section of the oath really concerns one of thethree aspects of divine manifestation, and as the initiate takes his pledge, oneof the three Heads of Departments collaborates with the Initiator in the work ofadministration. In this way energy of a triple nature becomes availableaccording to the different sections of the oath taken. This energy flows downfrom the three major rays, through the Hierophant and the correspondingdepartmental head at the first two initiations, to the initiate, via the groupof initials of the same degree, so that each initiation is a means ofstimulation and expansion to all. At the final five initiations the force flowsvia the three Buddhas of Activity instead of the departmental heads.It might be of interest to point out here that during this part of the ceremonythe group is bathed in colour, corresponding to the type of energy and itsoriginating planetary scheme, and it is the work of the Initiator to put theinitiate in touch with this energy. This pours down upon the group from themoment that segregation has been effected, and is brought about by the Initiatorusing certain words and elevating His Rod of Power. The three Buddhas ofActivity, Who are the great energy centres upon our planet, then touch the tipof the Rod with Their staffs of office, a certain mystic Word is jointly utteredby Them, and the downpour begins, continuing to the end of the ceremony.The question may be asked whether any initiates break their oath. Very rarely,for we must remember that no initiation is taken until a certain stage has beenreached. A few cases have occurred, but as the Lord of the World is cognisant ofall that transpires, the future, as well as the present and the past, noopportunity is ever given to an initiate to reveal that which is hidden. Intentmay exist. but opportunity will lack. The initiate who thus sins in intentionwill be struck dumb, and sometimes dead, prior to thus failing."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XV THE GIVING OF THE WORDThe Solar Words .The basis of all manifested phenomena is the enunciated sound, or the Wordspoken with power, that is, with the full purpose of the will behind it. Herein,as is known, lies the value of meditation, for meditation produces eventuallythat inner dynamic purpose and recollection, or that internal ideation whichmust invariably precede the uttering of any creative sound. When it is said thatthe Logos produced the worlds through meditation it means that within His owncentre of consciousness there was a period wherein He brooded over and meditatedupon the purposes and plans He had in view; wherein He visualised to Himself theentire world process as a perfected whole, seeing the end from the beginning andbeing aware of the detail of the consummated sphere. Then, when His meditationwas concluded, and the whole completed as a picture before His inner vision, Hebrought into use a certain Word of Power which had been committed to Him by theOne about Whom naught may be said , the Logos of the cosmic scheme of which oursystem is but a part. With cosmic and Logoic initiations we are not concerned,except in so far as the human initiations reflect their stupendous prototypes,but it is of interest to the student to realise that just as at each initiationsome Word of Power is committed to the initiate, so similarly to the Logos wascommitted the great Word of Power which produced our solar system, that Wordwhich is called the \"Sacred Word,\" or AUM. It must be here remembered that thissound AUM is man's endeavour to reproduce on an infinitesimally small scale thecosmic triple sound whereby creation was made possible. The Words of Power ofall degrees have a triple sequence.First. They are sounded by some fully selfconscious entity, and this invariablytakes place after a period of deliberation or meditation wherein the purpose intoto is visualised.Second. They affect the deva kingdom and produce the creation of forms. Thiseffect is dual in character—a. The devas on the evolutionary path, the great builders of the solar system,and those under them who have passed the human stage respond to the sound of theWord, and with conscious realisation collaborate with the one who has breathedit forth, and thus the work is carried out. b. The devas on the involutionaryarc, the lesser builders, who have not passed through the human stage, alsorespond to the sound, but unconsciously, or perforce, and through the power ofthe initiated vibrations build the required forms out of their own substance.Third. They act as a stabilising factor, and as long as the force of the soundpersists, the forms cohere. When the Logos, for instance, finishes the soundingof the sacred AUM, and the vibration ceases, then disintegration of the formswill ensue. So with the Planetary Logos, and thus on down the scale.The Words of Power, or the permutations of the AUM, exist in every possibletone, sub-tone, and quarter-tone, and upon these shades of sound the work ofcreation and its sustentation is built up. A multiplicity of sounds existswithin each greater sound and affects different groups. It must be rememberedalso that, generally and broadly speaking, the sounds within the solar systemfall into two groups:—1. The initiatory sounds , or those which produce manifestation or phenomena ofany kind on all planes.2. Eventuating sounds , or those which are produced from within the formsthemselves during the evolutionary process, and which are the aggregate of thetones of every form in any particular kingdom of nature. Every form likewise hasa tone which is produced by the minute sounds produced by the atoms composingthat form. These sounds grow out of the other group and affect inferior groupsor kingdoms, if the word \"inferior\" may be used in connection with anydepartment of divine manifestation. For instance, the human kingdom (the fourthcreative Hierarchy) was produced by a triple AUM sounded in a particular key bythe three persons of the Trinity in unison,—God the Father, God the Son, and Godthe Holy Spirit, or Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma. This sound is still going forth;the interplay and interblending of the many tiny notes of each human beingproduces a great united sound which call be heard in the high places and which,in its turn, is having a definite effect upon the animal kingdom. It is one ofthe factors which produces animal forms, both for human and animal occupation,for it must ever be remembered that man links the animal and the divine.It is neither possible nor desirable to enumerate the Words of Power, butcertain general indications may be given which will help the student to realisesomewhat the magnitude of the subject and its intricacy.1. The Great Word, as sounded by the Logos of the solar system, and communicatedto Him by His superior.2. Three Words committed by the Solar Logos to each of the three Logoi asfollows:—a. The sacred sound A to Shiva, He Who embodies the spirit or will aspect. It isthe Word through which God the Father works. b. The sound U to Vishnu, God theSon. He is the form-builder and provides the body which the spirit must occupy,thereby making divine incarnation possible. A is the life sound, U is the formsound. c. The sound M to Brahma, Who, in His work of Energy-provider, links inactive intelligence, spirit and form, or the self and not-self.It might here be pointed out that much information anent the three departmentsof the Hierarchy of our planet will come to the student who wisely ponders thesefunctions.3. Seven Great Words, again based on the sacred three sounds AUM. These producedcreation, or the manifestation of the seven planes of our solar system. They arecommitted not to human entities, but to the seven great Devas or Raja-Lords whoare the ensouling lives of a plane; hence in the various initiations theircollaboration is necessary, before these key words can be committed to theinitiate.4. Forty-nine Words related to the forty-nine subplanes or Fires. These againare committed to the forty-nine Builders of the Sacred Fires.The above two groups of words are in the jurisdiction of the third aspect, andare given out by Brahma.5. There are again five Great Words with signs which come under the departmentof Vishnu, or God the Son, and are breathed out by Him. By their means the fivekingdoms of nature on the evolutionary arc came into being:a. The mineral kingdom. b. The vegetable kingdom. c. The animal kingdom. d. Thehuman kingdom. e. The spiritual kingdom.These five are permutations of, or are built up upon the sound U, as the onesearlier enumerated are built up upon the sound M.In connection with the first three kingdoms it may be of interest to note thatthey are based upon two sounds, the U sounded on the basic key tone of the M. Inthe fourth kingdom the M tone is dying down and the two notes sounded forth arethe U and the A. In the fifth kingdom the M has subsided into a distantundertone, the U is blended with it so as to be indistinguishable, and the A, orShiva note, is pealing forth in power, and is practically the only note heard.By the sounding of this note,—that of Shiva the Destroyer,—the not-self isnegated, and all that is not of spirit passes into dissolution. It is the comingin of the A sound which affects the severance or liberation of the initiate fromthe three worlds.6. There are certain Words also committed to each of the Planetary Logoi, andthey are the basis of planetary manifestation. As is well known, the sound ofthe Brahma aspect, or the third aspect of our particular Planetary Logos, is FA,and herein lies much of illumination as to His point in evolution, for it isimmediately apparent that the A sound is reaching even the dense physical.7. Within our own Hierarchy there are numbers of Words built up upon the GreatWord of our Planetary Logos, and these are committed to the Departmental Heads,who in turn pass them on in permutated order to the graded initiates. It will bewise here for the student to differentiate carefully in his mind between wordsand sounds , for the word veils the thought or intended idea or purpose, and thesound makes it possible to manifest in matter of some kind, on one or other ofthe seven planes.We cannot here trace the expansion of the basic words, from their enunciation bycosmic entities down to the infinitesimal differentiations produced in thespeech of man, the vocal expression of the animals, and the song of birds. Eachis a manifestation of consciousness in some degree, and each produces an effect.What the initiate is learning to do is to make sounds consciously , and thusproduce a studied and desired result; to utter words, and be fully aware of theconsequence on all planes; and to create forms and direct energy through sacredsounds, and thus further the ends of evolution.It has been necessary to digress thus before taking up the committal of words tothe initiate, in order to emphasise the radical importance of the matter, andthus account for the carefully guarding of this aspect of divine work.The Use of the Words .We have already dealt with the significance of the Words of Power in a briefmanner. We might now sum up certain of the inferred postulates, and then touchsomewhat upon the initiation ceremony, and the Words as committed to theinitiate. The postulates here made are nine in number, and if duly pondered uponby the aspirant, will reveal to him much anent the creative process and thepower of speech.1. All the Words of Power are rooted in the Great Word committed to the SolarLogos at the dawn of manifestation.2. All the Words of Power are permutations or expansions of the three basicsounds, and increase in length as the planes are involved, until the sentencesand speech of the finite unit, man, in their myriad differentiations are arrivedat.3. Therefore, on the path of return, speech becomes ever more brief, words aremore sparingly used, and the time eventually comes when the adept employsformulas of words only as required to carry out specific purposes along twolines:—a. Definite creative processes. b. Specific direction of energy.This, of course, on the planes in the three worlds.4. The aspirant, therefore, has mainly three things to do when preparing forinitiation:—a. To control every activity of his threefold lower nature. This involves theapplication of intelligent energy to every atom of his three sheaths—physical,astral, and mental. It is literally the shining forth of the Brahma, or thirdaspect, of the inner God. b. To control his speech every minute of every day.This is a statement easily made, but most difficult to make practical. He whoachieves it is rapidly nearing emancipation. This applies not to the reticence,the moroseness, the silence, and the voicelessness which often distinguishesnatures but little evolved, and which are in reality an inarticulate condition.It refers to the controlled use of words to effect certain ends, and theretention of speech energy when not needed,—a very different matter. It involvesa realisation of cycles; of times and of seasons; it supposes a knowledge of thepower of sound, and of the effects produced through the spoken word; it involvesan apprehension of the building forces of nature and their due manipulation, andis based on an ability to wield mental matter, and to set it in motion, in orderto produce results in physical matter, consonant with the clearly definedpurpose of the inner God. It is the shining forth of the second aspect of theSelf, the Vishnu, or form-building aspect, which is the prime characteristic ofthe Ego on its own plane. It would be well to ponder on this. c. To meditate,and thus arrive at the purpose of the Ego. By thus meditating the first aspectcomes steadily into greater prominence, and the conscious will of the inner Godcan make itself felt on the physical plane.The three activities of the aspirant must parallel each other, and it will benoted that the second is the outcome of the first and will manifest as energy onthe physical plane. Only when the aspirant has made real progress in these threelines of endeavour will the first of the Great Words be committed to him.5. Every Great Word includes within itself its differentiations, its expansionsand permutations, and by its utterance the initiate sets in motion the lesser,through the vibration of the greater. Hence the terrific responsibility and themagnitude of the results achieved. Each Word is committed to the initiate orallyand visually. It is spoken to him first in the form of seven syllables, each ofwhich he has to memorise as a separate Word. Then he is shown how to blend theseseven so as to make a threefold sound and thus produce more united and farreaching results. Finally the three die blended into one Word which is committedto him. The seven words which form the Great Word at any initiation arecommunicated to the initiate by the initiates of equal rank with his own. Thisgroup divides itself into seven groups, according to subray or ray formation,and each group then chants one word in rapid rotation. Simultaneously, thecolours and symbols of the various sounds pass in front of him, so that he hearsand sees that which is committed to him. The more advanced group around thethrone of office (the three Departmental Heads at the first two initiations, andthe Pratyeka Buddhas at the final ones) chant then for him the triple Word whichblends the seven, and again he sees it before his inner eye. Finally theInitiator sounds it forth, and the initiate becomes aware within himself, inpractical experience, of the one great sound, and knows in one particular centrewhat its vibration is. As is well known, every centre is connected with someplane, scheme, ray, and other septenary divisions, and thus the significance ofits inner reaction will be apparent.6. The Masters and initiates, in Their work of aiding the evolution of the threeworlds, concern Themselves principally with the seven syllables of the Word ofTheir degree or initiated grade. The three Words which blend the seven areseldom used except under the direct sanction of one of the departmental heads(according to the syllable involved each Word is directly connected with thetriple AUM, and therefore with the Brahma, Vishnu, or Siva aspect, of which thethree Heads are the planetary representatives) .When any initiate desires to use, for evolutionary purposes, the entire Word asa unit, the sanction of the assembled Lodge has to be gained, for such a Wordaffects the matter of an entire plane within a planetary scheme, andconsequently the matter of those planes which are subsidiary to the oneinvolved. For instance, an initiate of the third degree, in sounding the Word ofhis degree, affects the matter of the lower mental subplanes, and subsequentlythe matter of the astral and physical planes. An initiate of the second degreesimilarly affects the astral plane, and subsequently the physical. Far reachingresults are thus achieved, and the work of many is thus affected.7. Every Word, differentiated or synthesised, affects the deva kingdoms, andhence the form-building aspects of manifestation. No sound is ever made withoutproducing a corresponding response in deva substance, and driving multitudes oftiny lives to take specific forms. These forms persist and carry out theirfunctions just as long as the sound which caused them is prolonged, and thespecific will-energy of the one who initiated the sound is directed towards theliving form. This is equally true of a Solar Logos enunciating the AUM, and thusproducing the solar system; of a Planetary Logos sounding his planetary Word,and producing a planetary scheme; of an adept producing results for the helpingof humanity on the physical plane; and of an ordinary human being, who—in muchdifferentiated diversified speech—expresses an inner purpose or state of mind,and thus builds a form or vehicle in deva substance. The majority of humanbeings as yet build unconsciously, and the form constructed is either of abeneficent or maleficent agency, according to the underlying motive or purposeof the man, and will carry out his will as long as its term of being persists.8. Every Word sounded is distinguished by:—a. A specific colour. b. A particular tone. c. A special form. d. A degree ofenergy or activity. e. The nature of the ensouling life, self-conscious,self-conscious, or unconscious, God, man, or deva.The student, again, will find this equally true of a solar system, of aplanetary scheme, of a human being, of a thought form ensouled by an elementallife, and of the atom of the physicist or chemist. In the knowledge of thesefacts, and in their conscious realisation, may be known the true occultist. TheSolar Logos sounded forth a Word, the form of our solar system came into being,its color being blue and its note a particular cosmic musical tone. Its degreeof activity is of a specific mathematical notation beyond the grasp of the humanmind at this stage of development; and the nature of its great ensouling Life,that of the triple Logos, is active, intelligent Love.9. The Great Word of our solar system keys in, if it might be so expressed, withother Words, and is but one Word of the sevenfold Word, known to that greatExistence Who stands in the same relation to the Solar Logos as the latter doesto the Planetary Logos. The sacred Words of seven solar systems (of which oursis but one) make up this septenary sound, which vibrates at this time in thecosmic spheres.In these nine statements are very cursorily summed up the major truths anent thecreative processes in the solar system. In them lies hidden the secret of thetrue magic, and in their comprehension will come to the man who has spiritualintuition, purity of life and motive, altruistic intention, and a sternself-control and courage, the power to further the purposes of the Ego, who is aconscious collaborator in the work of evolution, and a sharer in part of theplans of the Planetary Logos of our scheme. They are given in this brief formboth to protect the concealed truths and yet to reveal them to those who areready.These seven Words of the solar system, which form the logoic Word which we onlyknow in its triple form as AUM, are revealed at the seven initiations.At the first initiation is given the Word for the physical plane.At the second initiation is given the Word for the astral plane.At the third initiation is given the Word for the lower mental plane.At this initiation, in which, as earlier said, the Hierophant is the Lord of theWorld, not only is the Word given for the lower mental plane, but a word whichsynthesises the three Words for the three worlds is also committed. It is givento the initiate as a topic for meditation, until he takes the fourth initiation,but he is forbidden to use it until the final liberation, as it gives entirecontrol on the three lower planes.At the fourth initiation the Word for the higher mental plane is imparted.At the fifth initiation the Word for the buddhic plane is given.At the sixth initiation the Word for the atmic plane.At the seventh initiation the Word for the monadic plane is given.At the sixth initiation the Word which synthesises the fourth, fifth and sixthWords is given by the Hierophant, and thus the initiate wields complete control,through the power of sound, over the substance of the five planes of humanevolution. At the seventh initiation the triple AUM, in its true character, isrevealed to the illuminated Buddha, and he can then manipulate energy in the sixworlds or planes.Two more initiations can be taken, but little is ever said about them on ourearth scheme, for the reason that our scheme is not a \"sacred\" scheme, and few,if any, of our humanity achieve the eighth and ninth initiations. To do so, theymust first pass to another scheme for a lengthy period of service andinstruction. All that can be hinted at is, that at the eighth initiation theduality of the triple AUM is brought out, and at the ninth the one sound of theAbsolute stands revealed, and its significance is heard and seen. This bringsinto the consciousness of the initiate somewhat of the energy and power of the\"One about Whom Naught may be Said ,\" or the Logos of our Solar Logos. The unitof consciousness is then perfect, as the Logos is perfect, and passes on to workparalleling that of the Solar Logos. Such is the great program and theopportunity reaching out before the sons of man, aye, and before every atomeverywhere."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XVI THE IMPARTING OF THE SECRETSWe now come to the consideration of the secrets committed at the initiationceremony to the initiate. It is apparent, of course, that only the fact of thesecret, and an indication as to the matter with which it concerns itself can betouched upon, and even this would be left unmentioned were it not that aknowledge of the general outline of the subject may inspire the applicant forinitiation to a more careful study of such a subject and to a more diligentequipping of his mental body with information. Thereby (when in due course oftime he stands before the Initiator) he will lose no time in utilising theacquired secret.The Sevenfold Secret .After the administration of the oath which pledges the initiate to inviolablesecrecy, the newly made initiate advances alone closer to the Hierophant; hethen places his hand upon the lower end of the Rod of Initiation which is heldin the centre by the Hierophant. The Three Who stand around the throne of officethen place Their hands upon the glowing diamond which surmounts the Rod, andwhen these five personalities are thus linked by the circulating energyemanating from the Rod, the Initiator confides to the initiate the secret. Thereason for this is as follows: Each of the five initiations with which we areimmediately concerned (for the higher two, not being compulsory, are outside ourpresent consideration) affects one of the five centres in man, 1. The head, 2.The heart, 3. The throat, 4. The solar plexus, 5. The base of the spine, andreveals to him knowledge concerning the various types of force or energy bywhich the solar system is animated, and which reach him via a particular ethericcentre. At the application of the Rod his centres were affected in a particularfashion. By the impartation of the Secret, the reason is committed to his care,and that reason is demonstrated to him to be identical with that whichnecessarily produces some particular planetary manifestation, and which causes acertain specific greater cycle.It might be pointed out that:—1. Each secret concerns one or other of the seven great planes of the solarsystem.2. Each secret deals with, and is the enunciation of, one of the seven laws ofnature. They therefore concern one or other of the basic evolutions of eachplanetary scheme. Each scheme embodies one of the laws as its primary law, andall its evolutions tend to demonstrate the perfection of that law with its sixsubsidiary mutations, these six differing in one particular in each caseaccording to the primary law manifested.3. Each secret conveys a key to the nature of some particular Planetary Logos,and consequently gives the clue to the characteristics of those Monads who areon that particular planetary ray. It is obvious how necessary such knowledge isto the adept who seeks to work with the sons of men, and to manipulate the forcecurrents affecting them and which they emanate.4. Each secret concerns some one ray or colour and gives the number, note, andthe vibration which corresponds.These seven secrets are simply short formulas, not of mantric value, such as inthe case of the Sacred Word, but of a mathematical nature, precisely worded soas to convey the exact intent of the speaker. To the uninitiated they would lookand sound like algebraical formulas, except that each is composed (when seenclairvoyantly) of an oval of a specific hue, according to the secret imparted,containing five peculiar hieroglyphics or symbols. One symbol contains theformula of the law concerned, another gives the planetary key and tone, a thirddeals with vibration, whilst the fourth shows the number and department underwhich the ray concerned falls. The last hieroglyph gives one of the sevenhierarchical keys by means of which the members of our planetary hierarchy canlink up with the solar. This is evidently very vague and ambiguous information,but it will serve to show that, as in the case of the Words, apprehension had toinvolve two senses, so in the cognition of the secrets the two senses again comeinto play, and the secret is both heard and appears symbolically to the innereye.It will now be apparent why so much stress is laid upon the study of symbols,and why students are urged to ponder and meditate upon the cosmic and systemicsigns. It prepares them for the grasp and inner retention of the symbols andformulas which embody the knowledge whereby they can eventually work. Theseformulas are based upon nine symbols which are now recognised:—1. The cross in its varying forms.2. The lotus.3. The triangle.4. The cube.5. The sphere and the point.6. Eight animal forms, the goat, the bull, the elephant, the man, the dragon,the bear, the lion, and the dog.7. The line.8. Certain signs of the Zodiac, hence the need for the study of astrology.9. The cup, or the holy grail.All these symbols allied, interwoven, or taken in part, are combined to expressone or other of the seven Secrets. The initiate has to recognise them by sightas well as to hear them, and by an effort of the will to imprint themirrevocably upon his memory. This he is aided to do in three ways:—First , by along prior training in observation; this can be begun here and now by allaspirants, and as they learn to imprint details accurately upon their memorythey are laying the foundation for that acute instantaneous apprehension of thatwhich is shown them by the Hierophant; secondly , by having cultivated withinthemselves the power to visualise again that which has once been seen. It willbe apparent here why the emphasis has been laid by all wise teachers ofmeditation upon the faculty of the careful building of mental pictures. The aimhas been two-fold:—a. To teach the student to visualise his thought-forms accurately, so that whenhe begins to create consciously he may lose no time in inaccuratetransformation. b. To enable him to picture again accurately the impartedsecret, so that it may instantly be of use to him whenever needed.Finally , by the strongly applied will of the other four Personalities who areholding the Rod at the same time as the initiate. Their trained intense mentalconcentration greatly facilitates his apprehension.In the case of human evolution certain types of force are generated, dealt with,assimilated, and used, at first unconsciously, and finally with fullintelligence.a. In the Hall of Ignorance the force or energy of Brahma (the activity andintelligence of substance) is that mostly dealt with, and the man has to learnthe meaning of activity based on:—a. Inherent energy. b. Absorbed energy. c. Group energy. d. Material energy, orthat which is hidden in physical plane matter. b. In the Hall of Learning hebecomes aware of, and uses the energy of the second aspect in form building, insocial relations, and in family affiliations. He comes to the recognition of sexand its relations, but as yet views this force as something to be controlled,but not consciously and constructively utilised. c. In the Hall of Wisdom hecomes to the knowledge of the first aspect of energy, the dynamic use of will insacrifice, and to him is then committed the key to the threefold mystery ofenergy. This energy in its threefold aspect he became aware of, in the other twoHalls. At the third initiation, and at the fourth and fifth, the three keys tothe three mysteries are given to him.The key to the mystery sensed in the first Hall, the mystery of Brahma, ishanded to him, and he can then unlock the hidden energies of atomic substance.The key to the mystery of sex, or of the pairs of opposites, is thrust into hishand, and he can then unlock the hidden forces of the will aspect. The dynamo ofthe solar system is shown to him,—if it might be so expressed—and theintricacies of the mechanism revealed.The Three Solar Mysteries .The three mysteries of the solar system are:—1. The mystery of Electricity . The mystery of Brahma, The secret of the thirdaspect. It is latent in the physical sun.2. The mystery of Polarity , or of the universal sex impulse. The secret of thesecond aspect. It is latent in the Heart of the Sun, or the subjective Sun.3. The mystery of Fire itself , or the dynamic central systemic force. Thesecret of the first aspect. It is latent in the Central Spiritual Sun.Their Sequential Revelation .The secrets, as imparted sequentially to the initiate, are roughly three innumber, though within them may be found lesser mysteries which are earlierrevealed. At the third initiation the first of the three fundamental secrets ofthe solar system is imparted to the initiate, immediately after he has taken theoath. This we might, for lack of a better term, call \"the secret ofelectricity.\" It concerns the phenomena of the dense objective manifestation ofthe Logos. It would be wise here for the student to remember that the threeplanes of the three worlds, physical, astral, and mental, form the densephysical body of the solar Logos. whilst the four higher form His etheric body.Students are apt to for- get that our seven planes are the seven sub-planes ofthe cosmic physical. This has a very definite bearing on the secret ofelectricity. This is why the secret is not revealed till the third initiation,and is prepared for by the impartation of two lesser secrets which concern thephysical and astral planes, and which are imparted at the first two initiationsby the Bodhisattva.Electrical phenomena are scientifically recognised as dual in nature, but theinherent triplicity of electricity is as yet but a matter for speculation formodern science. The fact that it is triple is demonstrated to the initiate atthe first initiation, and the secret of how to balance forces on the physicalplane, and thereby produce equilibrium, is revealed to him at the firstinitiation. This secret likewise puts him in touch with certain of the Builderson the physical plane—that is, on the etheric levels—and he can then producephysical plane phenomena should he deem it wise. This he seldom does, as theresults gained thereby are practically unimportant and he wastes not energy inthis manner. The workers with the involutionary forces, the brothers ofdarkness, employ this method for the startling and the enthralling of theunwary. Not thus work the brothers of humanity.The secret of the coherence of the atom is revealed to the initiate, and he thenis in a position to study the microcosm under the law of correspondences in anew and illuminating manner. Similarly, through this revelation concerning thedensest part of the logoic body, he can ascertain much concerning the previoussolar system, and the facts anent the first round of our scheme. This secret isalso called \"the mystery of matter.\"At the second initiation \"the secret of the sea\" is unfolded to him, and throughthis revelation two subjects of profound interest become clarified to his innervision. They are:—a. The mystery of the astral light. b. The law of karma.He is, after this, in a position to do two things, without which he cannot workoff that which hinders, and thus achieve liberation; he can read the akashicrecords and ascertain the past, thereby enabling himself to work intelligentlyin the present, and he can begin to balance his karma, to work off hisobligations, and to understand how karma in the three worlds can be negated. Therelation of that hierarchy of spiritual beings who are connected with the law ofkarma as it affects man is demonstrated to him, and he knows with first-handknowledge that the lords of karma are no myth, or symbolical units, but arehighly intelligent entities who wield the law for the benefit of humanity, andthus enable men to become fully self-conscious and self-reliant in the occultsense, and to become creators through perfected knowledge.At the third initiation \"the secret of fohat\" is given to him, and then themystery of the threefold body of the triple Logos is his, and the why of thephenomena of the dense liquid and gaseous bodies of the Supreme Being isunfolded before his amazed vision. The two secrets previously imparted, and theknowledge which they gave having been utilised, the initiate is now in aposition to profit by this greater revelation, and to understand somewhat thefollowing facts:—1. The creative process of thought form building.2. The transmission of energy from the Ego to the physical body via the forcecentres on the various planes.3. The uprising of kundalini, its geometrical progression, and its vivificationof all the centres.By the knowledge thus imparted, and the progress which the initiate has made inthe study of the law of analogy, he can comprehend the manipulation of the sameforces on a vastly larger scale in the planetary scheme and in the solar system.The method of development in the three earlier rounds is revealed to him, and heunderstands, practically as well as theoretically, the evolutionary process inits earlier stages. The key to the three lower kingdoms of nature is in hishands, and certain ideas anent the subject of polarity, of at-one-ment, andessential union, are beginning to come within his range of consciousness, onlywaiting for the fourth initiation to complete the revelation.This secret of electricity, which is essentially triple in its nature, dealswith the Brahma or third aspect, and is called sometimes by the followingnames:—1. The Secret of Brahma.2. The Revelation of the Mother.3. The Secret of Fohatic Force.4. The Mystery of the Creator.5. The Secret of the Three Who issued from the First (solar system), and also byfour mystic phrases conveying much light to the intuition:6. The Boat of Mystery which Ploughs the Ocean.7. The Key to the Divine Storehouse.8. The Light that Guides through the triple caves of Darkness.9. The Clue to the Energy uniting Fire and Water.In all these names much information will come to the student who carefullyponders them, remembering that they deal with the Brahma aspect in its lowestmanifestation and with the three worlds of human endeavour, and thus meditating,the student must relate this present solar system to the preceding one, in whichthe Brahma aspect dominated, as the Vishnu, or consciousness aspect dominates inthis.The initiate, through the knowledge imparted, is now in a position to understandhis own triple lower nature, and therefore to balance it in relation to thehigher, to read the records and understand his place within the group, tomanipulate the forces in the three worlds and thereby effect liberation forhimself, thus helping the ends of evolution, and to co-operate intelligentlywith the plans of the Planetary Logos as they may be revealed to him stage bystage. He can now wield power, and becomes a centre of energy in a greatlyincreased degree, being able to dispense or retract force currents. The moment aman becomes consciously powerful on the mental plane, his power for good is ahundredfold increased.At the fourth initiation another of the great secrets is revealed to him. It iscalled \"the mystery of polarity,\" and the clue to the significance of sex inevery department of nature on all the planes is given to him. It is not possibleto say much along these lines. All that can be done is to enumerate some of thesubjects to which it gives the clue, adding to this the information that in ourplanetary scheme; owing to the point in evolution of our own Planetary Logos,this secret is the most vital. Our Planetary Logos is at the stage wherein He isconsciously seeking the at-one-ment with his polar opposite, another PlanetaryLogos.The subjects on which this secret throws a flood of light are:—a. Sex on the physical plane. It gives us a key to the mystery of the separationof the sexes in Lemurian days. b. The balancing of forces in all departments ofnature. c. The clue as to which Scheme forms with ours a duality. d. The truename of our Planetary Logos and His relation to the Solar Logos. e. \"TheMarriage of the Lamb\" and the problem of the heavenly bride. A clue to this liesin the solar system of S… which must be read astrologically. f. The mystery ofthe Gemini, and the connection of our particular Planetary Logos with thatconstellation.On a lesser scale, and in relation to the microcosm, the following subjects areilluminated when the initiate receives the second great secret, or the fourthwhich includes the earlier lesser ones:—g. The processes of at-one-ment in the different kingdoms of nature. Thebridging between the kingdoms is shown him, and he sees the unity of the scheme.h. The method of egoic at-one-ment is seen clearly revealed, and the antahkaranais shown in its real nature, and having been thus revealed, is dispensed with.i. The essential unity existing between the Ego and the personality is seen. j.The relation of the two evolutions, human and deva, is no longer a mystery, buttheir position in the body of the Heavenly Man is seen to be a fact.One could go on emphasising the multiplicity of matters which the mystery ofpolarity, when revealed, makes clear to the initiate, but the above suffices.This secret concerns primarily the Vishnu, or second aspect. It sums up in oneshort phrase the totality of knowledge gained in the Hall of Wisdom, as theearlier secrets summed up the totality achieved in the Hall of Learning. Itdeals with consciousness and its development by and through the matter aspect.It concerns literally the unification of the self and the not-self till they areverily and indeed one.At the fifth initiation the great secret which concerns the fire or spiritaspect is revealed to the wondering and amazed Master, and He realises in asense incomprehensible to man the fact that all is fire and fire is all. Thissecret may be said to reveal to the Initiate that which makes clear to Him:a. The secret name of the Planetary Logos, thus revealing one syllable of thename of the Solar Logos. b. The work and method of the destroyer aspect ofdivinity. c. The processes whereby obscuration and pralaya are induced. d. Themathematical formula which sums up all the cycles of manifestation. e. Thetriple nature of fire, and the effect of the great fire upon the lesser.As this Shiva, or first, aspect is the one which will arrive at perfection, or,rather, come within the reach of comprehension within the next solar system, itprofits not to continue considering this secret. The following tabulation maymake the whole matter clearer to the mind of the student:—Secret of Initiation Logos Concerned Source of Energy Planes Fohat Third BrahmaCreator Physical Sun Seven Six Five Polarity Fourth Vishnu Preserver SubjectiveSun Four Three Fire Fifth Shiva Destroyer Central Spiritual Sun TwoAs the student will observe, the source of the particular energy concerned isone aspect of the sun.At the sixth and seventh initiations two more secrets are revealed, one—a lessersecret—preparing the way for the revelation of the fourth. Only four secrets ofa major order are revealed to initiates on this planet, and herein lies the clueto our position in the scheme of solar evolution. There are only five secretsaltogether, of a major kind, revealed in this solar system, owing to the factthat this is a system wherein pre-eminently the fifth principle of mind formsthe basis of unfoldment. This fifth revelation is only imparted to those whopass to the Schemes of synthesis."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XVII DIVERSITIES OF INITIATIONSMajor and Minor Initiations .In dealing with this question of the diversities of initiations it may be ofvalue to the student to remember that the great moment in which a man passed outof the animal kingdom into the human, which is called in many occult textbooksthe \"moment of individualisation,\" was in itself one of the greatest of allinitiations. Individualisation is the conscious apprehension by the self of itsrelation to all that constitutes the not-self, and in this great initiatoryprocess, as in all the later ones, the awakening of consciousness is preceded bya period of gradual development; the awakening is instantaneous at the moment ofself-realisation for the first time, and is always succeeded by another periodof gradual evolution. This period of gradual evolution, in its turn, leads up toa later crisis which is called Initiation. In the one case, we have initiationinto self-conscious existence, in the other, initiation into spiritualexistence.These realisations, or apprehended expansions of consciousness, are undernatural law, and come in due course of time to every soul without exception . Ina lesser degree they are undergone daily by every human being, as his mentalgrip of life and experience gradually grows, but they only become initiationsinto the wisdom (as differentiated from expansions of knowledge) when theknowledge gained is:—a. Consciously sought for. b. Self-sacrificingly applied to life. c. Willinglyused in service for others. d. Intelligently utilised on the side of evolution.Only souls of a certain amount of experience and development do all these fourthings consistently and steadily, and thus transmute knowledge into wisdom, andexperience into quality. The ordinary average man transmutes ignorance intoknowledge, and experience into faculty. It would be helpful if all of uspondered upon the difference between inherent quality and innate faculty; one isthe very nature of buddhi, or wisdom, and the other of manas, or mind. The unionof these two, through a man's conscious effort, results in a major initiation.These results are brought about in two ways:—First, by a man's own unaidedeffort, which leads him in due course of time to find his own centre ofconsciousness, to be guided and led by the inner ruler or Ego entirely, and tounravel, through strenuous effort and painful endeavour, the mystery of theuniverse, which is concealed in material substance energised by Fohat. Secondly,by a man's efforts, supplemented by the intelligent loving co-operation of theKnowers of the race, the Masters of the Wisdom. In this case the process isquicker, for a man comes under instruction—should he so desire—and subsequently,when he has on his part provided the right conditions, there is placed at hisdisposal the knowledge and the help of Those Who have achieved. In order toavail himself of this help he has to work with the material of his own body,building right material into an ordered form, and has therefore to learndiscrimination in the choice of matter, and to understand the laws of vibrationand of construction. This entails the mastering, in some measure, of the lawsthat govern the Brahma and Vishnu aspects: it means a faculty of vibrating withatomic accuracy, and the development of the quality of attractiveness, which isthe basis of the building, or Vishnu aspect.He has to equip, also, his mental body so that it may be an explainer andtransmitter, and not a hindering factor as now. He must likewise develop groupactivity, and learn to work in a co-ordinated manner with other units. These arethe main things that a man must accomplish along the path of initiation, butwhen he has worked at them, he will find the Way, it will be made clear to him,and he will then join the ranks of the Knowers.Another point to be remembered is that this effort to make people co-operateintelligently with the Hierarchy, and to train them to join the ranks of theLodge, is, as earlier pointed out, a special effort (inaugurated in Atlanteandays and continued to this time) made by the Hierarchy of the planet, and isvery largely in the nature of an experiment. The method whereby a man assumesconscious place in the body of a Heavenly Man differs in different planetarySchemes; the Heavenly Man, Who uses our planetary Scheme as His body ofmanifestation, chooses to work in this particular way during this particularperiod for His own specific purposes; it is part of the process of vitalisingone of His centres, and of linking up His heart centre with its connection inthe head. As other of His centres are vitalised, and come into full activity,other methods of stimulating the cells in His body (the deva and human monads)may be followed, but for the present the cosmic Rod of Initiation, which isapplied to a Heavenly Man, in much the same manner as the lesser rods areapplied to man, is being utilised in such a way that it produces that specificstimulation which demonstrates in the activity of man on the Path of Probationand the Path of Initiation.Therefore man must recognise the cyclic nature of initiation, and the place ofthe process in time and space. This is a special period of activity in the cycleof a Heavenly Man, and it works out on our planet as a vast period of trial orinitiatory testing; it is, nevertheless, equally a period of vitalisation and ofopportunity.We must also endeavour to realise the fact that initiation may be seen takingplace on the three planes in the three worlds, and the thought must ever beborne in mind of the relative value and place of the unit, or cell, in the bodyof a Heavenly Man. The point must here be emphasised that the major initiations,or the initiations of manas, are those taken on the mental plane and in thecausal body . They mark the point in evolution where the unit recognises infact, and not only in theory, his identity with the divine Manasaputra in Whosebody he has place. Initiations can be taken on the physical plane, on theastral, and on the lower mental, but they are not considered major initiations,and are not a conscious, co-ordinated, unified stimulation that involves thewhole man.A man, therefore, may take initiation on each plane, but only those initiationswhich mark his transference from a lower four into a higher three are consideredso in the real sense of the word, and only those in which a man transfers hisconsciousness from the lower quarternary into the triad are major initiations.We have, therefore, three grades of initiations:—First, initiations in which a man transfers his consciousness from the lowerfour subplanes of the physical, astral, and mental planes respectively, into thehigher three subplanes. When this is done upon the mental plane a man is thenknown technically as a disciple, an initiate, an adept. He uses then each of thethree higher subplanes of the mental plane as a point from which to work his waycompletely out of the three worlds of human manifestation into the triad.Therefore it is apparent that what one might consider as lesser initiations canbe taken on the physical and astral planes, in the conscious control of theirthree higher subplanes. These are true initiations, but do not make a man whatis technically understood as a Master of the Wisdom. He is simply an adept of alesser degree.Secondly, initiations in which a man transfers his consciousness from plane toplane, instead of from subplane to subplane. Herein comes a point to becarefully recognised. A true Master of the Wisdom has not only taken the lesserinitiations referred to above, but has also taken the five steps involved in theconscious control of the five planes of human evolution. It remains for him thento take the two final initiations which make him a Chohan of the sixth degree,and a Buddha, before that control is extended to the remaining two planes of thesolar system. It is obvious, therefore, that it is correct to speak of the seveninitiations, yet it would be nevertheless equally correct to enumerate five,ten, or twelve initiations. The matter is complicated for occult students, owingto certain mysterious factors about which they can naturally know nothing, andwhich must remain to them, as yet, utterly incomprehensible. These factors arefounded in the individuality of the Heavenly Man Himself, and involve suchmysteries as His particular karma, the aim He may have in view for anyparticular cycle, and the turning of the attention of the cosmic ego of aHeavenly Man to His reflection, the evolving Heavenly Man of a solar system.A further factor may also be found in certain periods of stimulation, and ofincreased vitalisation, such as a cosmic initiation produces. These outsideeffects naturally produce results in the units or cells in the body of theHeavenly Man, and lead often to events unforeseen and apparently inexplicable.Thirdly, initiations in which a Heavenly Man may take either a minor or a majorinitiation, thereby involving His entire nature. For instance, whenindividualisation took place during the Lemurian, or the third root race, andthe human family in this cycle definitely came into manifestation, it signifieda major initiation for our Heavenly Man. The present stimulation in hierarchicaleffort is leading up to a lesser initiation. Each great cycle sees a majorinitiation of a Heavenly Man taken on one or other of the globes, and hereinagain complication lies, and much food for thought.To the three above points we might also briefly add that of the coming in, orpassing out, of any particular ray. The little that can be said upon this point,which is one of the greatest difficulty, might be summed up in the followingthree statements: First, that initiations taken on the four minor rays rank notin equality with initiations taken upon the major three. This is complicatedsomewhat by the fact that within the planetary Scheme, during cyclic evolution,a minor ray may be temporarily regarded as a major ray. For instance, at thisparticular time in our planetary Scheme, the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Law orOrder is regarded as a major ray, being a ray of synthesis, and one on which theMahachohan is blending His work. Secondly, that the first three initiations aretaken upon the ray of the Ego, and link a man up with the great White Lodge; thelast two are taken upon the ray of the monad, and have a definite effect uponthe path for service that will be chosen later by the adept. This statement mustbe linked up with that earlier made, which stated that the fifth initiation madea man a member of the Greater Lodge, or Brotherhood, on Sirius, being literallythe first of the Sirian initiations. The fourth initiation is the synthesis ofthe Initiations of the Threshold in the Sirian Lodge. Finally, according to theray on which initiation is taken, so very largely depends the subsequent path ofservice.The Day of Opportunity .The question might here be asked wherein this information is of value to thestudent. In illustration of this it would be wise if students would ponder thesignificance of the coming in of the present Ray of Ceremonial Law or Magic. Itis the ray that deals with the building forces of nature, that concerns itselfwith the utilisation of the form intelligently by the life aspect. It is largelythe ray of executive work, with the object of building, co-ordinating andproducing cohesion in the four lower kingdoms of nature. It is distinguishedlargely by the energy which manifests itself in ritual, but this word ritualmust not be narrowed down to its present use in connection with Masonic, orreligious ritual. Its application is far wider than this, and includes themethods of organisation which are demonstrated in all civilised communities,such as in the world of commerce and of finance, and the great businessorganisations everywhere to be seen. Above all, its interest lies for us in thefact that it is the ray which brings opportunity to the occidental races, andthrough the medium of this life force of executive organisation, of governmentby rule and order, by rhythm and by ritual, will come the time wherein theoccidental races (with their active, concrete mind, and their vast businesscapacity) can take initiation,—an initiation, we must remember, upon a ray whichis temporarily recognised as a major ray. A large number of the initiates andthose who have obtained adeptship in the last cycle, have been orientals andthose in Hindu bodies. This cycle has been dominated by the sixth ray, which isjust passing out, and the two preceding. In the preservation of equilibrium thetime now comes when a period of attainment by occidentals will be seen, and thisupon a ray suited to their type of mind. It is interesting to note that theoriental type attains its objective through meditation, with a modicum ofexecutive organisation and ritual, and that the occidental will achieve largelythrough the organisation which lower mind produces, and a type of meditation ofwhich intense business concentration might be considered an illustration. Theone-pointed application of the mind by a European or American business man mightbe regarded as a type of meditation. In the purification of motive lying back ofthis application will come, for the occidental, his day of opportunity.By availing themselves of the present day of opportunity, and by conformity tothe rules for treading the Path, will come to many in the West the chance totake these further steps. That opportunity will be found by the man who is readyin the place where he is, and among the familiar circumstances of his dailylife. It will be found in attention to duty, in the surmounting of tests andtrials, and in that inner adherence to the voice of the God within, which is themark of every applicant for initiation. Initiation involves the very thing thatis done from day to day by any who are consciously endeavouring to trainthemselves:—the next point to be reached, and the next bit of work to beaccomplished is pointed out by the Master (either the God within or a man'sMaster if he is consciously aware of Him) and the reason is given. Then theTeacher stands aside and watches the aspirant achieve. As He watches, Herecognises points of crisis, where the application of a test will do one of twothings, focalise and disperse any remaining unconquered evil—if that term mighthere be used—and demonstrate to the disciple both his weakness and his strength.In the great initiations, the same procedure can be seen, and the ability of thedisciple to pass these greater tests and stages is dependent upon his ability tomeet and surmount the daily lesser ones. \"He that is faithful in that which isleast is faithful also in much,\" is an occult statement of fact, and shouldcharacterise the whole daily activity of the true aspirant; the \"much\" issurmounted and passed, because it is regarded simply as an intensification ofthe normal, and no initiate has ever passed the great test of initiation who hasnot accustomed himself to pass lesser tests every day of his life; tests thencome to be regarded as normal, and are considered, when encountered, as part ofthe usual fabric of his life. When this attitude of mind is attained and held,there exists no surprise or possible defeat."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XVIII THE SEVEN PATHSAs might be expected, very little has appeared in our literature as to the sevenPaths which stretch before the man who has reached the fifth initiation. It isobviously impossible, and also unnecessary, to convey to our mind any impressionas to the significance of these paths, or as to the attributes needed for theirtreading. As time progresses and the race reaches a higher point of development,we shall be able to comprehend more, but under the law of economy it would befruitless effort for the teachers of the race to instruct us on thecharacteristics needed for the treading of the seven Paths, before we have asyet apprehended or developed those required for traversing the ProbationaryPath, not to mention the Path of Initiation.One general fact we do know, and that is, that before these Paths can betrodden, a man must be a Master of the Wisdom, he must be a Brother ofCompassion, and he must be able, through intelligence and love, to wield thelaw. Our part at this time is to fit ourselves for the treading of the Path ofInitiation, by the discipline of the Probationary Path, by the careful directionof the life, by obedience to the law as understood, and by service to the race.When we have attained liberation, then these Paths will stretch before us, andthe one that we should tread will become apparent to us. All in this systemworks under the great law of attraction, and therefore, according to ourvibration, according to our colour and tone, will depend, in all probability,our choice. The greater free will of the cosmic system is under limitation, justas is the free will of the system of which we are a part, and the free will ofman himself. Upon innate quality will depend the direction of our furtherprogress.These seven Paths might be enumerated as follows, and certain deductions, basedon the law of correspondence, might be given out, provided always that weremember that words serve more to blind than to elucidate, and that the briefestdetails only are possible.1. The Path of Earth Service .This is the Path that keeps a man linked to the Hierarchy that is pledged to theservice of our planet, and to the help of its evolutions. It comprises those whowork under the Lord of the World in the seven groups into which our Masters ofthe Wisdom are divided. Not so many Masters follow this Path as some of theothers, and only enough are permitted to do so to carry on planetary evolutionsatisfactorily. More is known about this path than about the others, and morewill be found out as members of our humanity fit themselves to contact theBrotherhood. Their field of employ, Their methods of work, will eventuallybecome exoteric knowledge, and as the seven groups are recognised and known,schools of development for the filling of posts in these groups will be thelogical sequence.2. The Path of Magnetic Work .Those who do the work of wielding forces, or electrical magnetism for the use ofthe Great Ones on all the planes, pass to this Path. They wield the elementalformative energy, manipulating matter of every density and vibration.Great waves of ideas and surging currents of public opinion on astral levels, aswell as on the higher levels where the Great Ones work, are manipulated by them.A large number of fifth ray people, those who have the Ray of Concrete Knowledgefor their monadic ray, pass to this line of endeavour. The inherent quality inthe type of the monad settles usually the line of activity. The karma of thefifth ray is one of the factors which produces this. These monads work withFohat, and must, to the end of the greater manvantara. They have their eventualposition on the cosmic mental plane, but as yet the capacity for abstractthought is so little developed that it is impossible for us to comprehend thesignificance of this expression.3. The Path of Training for Planetary Logoi .This Path is trodden by those who will take up the work of the seven PlanetaryLogoi of the next system, and of the forty-nine sub-planetary Logoi, Theirassistants, and of certain other Entities working in that particular department.There will be seven systems, though we are only concerned with the three majorsystems, of which our present system is the second major system. Each Chohan ofa ray takes a certain number of initiates of the sixth initiation and trainsthem specially for this work; special aptitude in colour and sound predisposesthe choice, and the ability to work with \"psyche,\" or the spirits in evolutionmarks a man out for this high post. We might say that the Planetary Logoi arethe divine psychologists, and therefore in the training for this post psychologyis the basic subject, though it is a psychology inconceivable as yet to us.Every Planetary Logos has, in His own special planet, schools for thedevelopment of subordinate Logoi, and there trains Them for this high office,giving Them opportunity for wide experience. Even the Logoi Themselves progressonward, and Their places must be taken.4. The Path to Sirius .Very little may be communicated about this Path, and the curiously closerelation between it and the Pleiades can only be mentioned, further speculationbeing impossible. The bulk of liberated humanity goes this way, and the prospectholds out glorious possibilities. The seven stars of the Pleiades are the goalfor the seven types, and this is hinted at in the Book of Job, in the words,\"Canst thou bind the sweet influence of the Pleiades?\" In the mystery of thisinfluence, and in the secret of the sun Sirius, are hidden the facts of ourcosmic evolution, and incidentally, therefore, of our solar system.5. The Ray Path .It is difficult to know by what other name to call this Path, as so little isknown about it. In treading it, a man stays on his own ray, and works thereon inthe various kingdoms on all the planes, carrying out the behests of the Lord ofthe World, and working under His direction. It carries a man to every part ofthe solar system, yet links him definitely with the synthetic ray. It is a verycomplex path, for it necessitates a capacity for the most intricate mathematics,and an ability to geometrise in a manner incomprehensible to ourthree-dimensional brains. This path is taken by the man to whom the law ofvibration is of profound importance. He works first in the council chamber ofthe Lord of the World at Shamballa, manipulating the law of vibration on his ownray. Later he will have his habitat on the planet corresponding to his own ray,and not on the earth unless he is on the ray of the Planetary Logos holding swayupon the earth. Later again as his evolution progresses, he will pass to thesun; then having mastered all connected with vibration in this system he willpass to the cosmic system, going off his own ray (which is but a subsidiary rayof one cosmic ray), on to the corresponding cosmic ray.Just as the evolution of man in this system is fivefold, so in the above we haveenumerated the principal five Paths from which a Master has to choose. Theremaining two can only be touched upon still more briefly, for they hold but avery few of the evolving sons of men, owing to the high point of attainmentnecessitated for their entrance, and the fact that those who enter upon thempass out of the system altogether. They do not lead to Sirius, as do some of theother Paths. It will be noted that four groups remain in the system, passingeventually, in dim and distant aeons, to the cosmic planes. One group passesdirectly to Sirius, and the remaining two groups pass directly after initiationto the cosmic planes, with no period of intermediate work on earth, in thesystem, or on Sirius. These two Paths are:—6. The Path the Logos Himself Is On .It will have become apparent to all occult students who have studied with carethe world processes in the light of the law of correspondences, that the Logoson the cosmic planes is evolving inner cosmic vision, just as man in his lesserdegree is aiming at the same vision in the system. This might be called thedevelopment of the cosmic third eye. In the physical plane structure of the eyelies hid the secret and in its study may come some revelation of the mystery.A certain part of the eye is the nucleus of sight, and the apparatus of visionitself; the remainder of the eye acts as a protecting shell, and both parts arerequired, and neither can exist without the other. So in this greater case, onlythe analogy exists on such high levels that words only blur and dim the truth.Certain of the sons of men, a nucleus who reached a very high initiation in theprevious solar system, formed an esoteric group around the Logos when He decidedupon further progress. In consequence He formed this system, cosmic desire forincarnation driving Him on. This esoteric group remains with the Logos on theatomic, or first plane of the system, on the subjective inner side, and itcorresponds, in an occult sense, to the pupil of the eye. The real home of thesegreat Entities is upon the cosmic buddhic plane.Gradually, by dint of hard effort, certain Masters have qualified Themselves, orare qualifying Themselves, to take the place of the original members of thegroup, permitting of Their return to a cosmic centre around which our system,and the greater system of Sirius revolve. Only one adept here and there has thenecessary qualifications, for it involves the development of a certain type ofresponse to cosmic vibration. It means a specialising in the inner sight, andthe development of a certain measure of cosmic vision. More of the devaevolution pass to this path than do the human. Human beings pass to it via thedeva evolution, which can be entered by transference to the fifth Path, the rayPath. On this latter Path, the two evolutions can merge, and from the fifth Paththe sixth can be entered.7. The Path of Absolute Sonship .This Sonship is a correspondence on the highest plane to that grade ofdiscipleship which we call \"Son of the Master.\"It is the Sonship to a Being higher than our Logos, of whom we may not speak. Itis the great controlling Path of Karma. The Lipika Lords are on this Path, andall who are fitted for that line of work, and who are close to the Logos in apersonal intimate sense, pass to the Path of absolute Sonship. It is the Path ofthe special intimates of the Logos, and into Their hands He has put the workingout of karma in the solar system. They know His wishes, His will and His aim,and to Them He entrusts the carrying out of His behests. This group, associatedwith the Logos, forms a special group linked to a still higher Logos."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIX RULES FOR APPLICANTSThere are certain aphorisms and injunctions which the applicant for initiationneeds to study and obey. There is a great distinction between the terms\"aspirant to the Path\" and \"applicant for initiation.\" He who aspires andstrives towards discipleship is in no way pledged to the same specific attitudeand discipline as is the applicant for initiation, and he can, if he so choose,take as long as he desires in the treading of the Probationary Path. The man whoseeks initiation is in a different position, and having once made applicationhas to bring his life under a definite rule, and a strict regime which is onlyoptional to the disciple.The rules given here are fourteen in number, and are gathered from a series ofinstructions compiled for those who seek to take the first initiation.RULES FOR APPLICANTSRule 1 .Let the disciple search within the heart's deep cave. If there the fire burnsbright, warming his brother yet heating not himself, the hour has come formaking application to stand before the door.When love for all beings, irrespective of who they may be, is beginning to be arealised fact in the heart of a disciple, and yet nevertheless love for himselfexists not, then comes the indication that he is nearing the Portal ofInitiation, rand may make the necessary preliminary pledges. These arenecessitated before his Master hands in his name as a candidate for initiation.If he cares not for the suffering and pain of the lower self, if it isimmaterial to him whether happiness comes his way or not, if the sole purpose ofhis life is to serve and save the world, and if his brother's need is for him ofgreater moment than his own, then is the fire of love irradiating his being, andthe world can warm itself at his feet. This love has to be a practical, testedmanifestation, and not just a theory, nor simply an impractical ideal and apleasing sentiment. It is something that has grown in the trials and tests oflife, so that the primary impulse of the life is towards self-sacrifice and theimmolation of the lower nature.Rule 2 .When application has been made in triple form, then let the disciple withdrawthat application, and forget it has been made.Herein lies one of the initial tests. The disciple's attitude of mind must bethat he cares not whether he takes initiation or not. Selfish motive must notenter in. Only those applications which reach the Master through the energyengendered through pure altruistic motive are transmitted by Him to therecording angel of the Hierarchy; only those disciples who seek initiationbecause of the added power to help and bless that it confers, will find aresponse to their plea. Those careless of initiation receive not the occultaccolade, and those anxious, through selfishness or curiosity, to participate inthe mysteries, enter not the door but remain knocking outside. Those who arekeen to serve, those who are weighed down with a sense of world need, and thepersonal responsibility thereby awakened, and who have fulfilled the law, knockand meet with response, and make application which meets with recognition. Theyare the ones who send forth a cry for added power to aid, which penetrates tothe ear of Those Who silently wait.Rule 3 .Triple the call must be, and long it takes to sound it forth. Let the disciplesound the cry across the desert, over the sea, and through the fires whichseparate him from the veiled and hidden door.Under this symbology comes to the disciple the injunction to make the desert ofthe physical plane life to blossom like the rose, so that from the garden of thelower life may arise those sounds and scents, and a vibration strong enough tocross the intervening space between it and the portal; to still the restlesswaters of the emotional life, so that in their limpid, still expanse, thatportal may be reflected, and the lower life mirror forth the spiritual life ofthe indwelling divinity; to pass through the fiery furnace those motives, words,and thoughts which are the mainspring of activity, and have their origin uponthe mental plane. When these three aspects of the manifesting Ego, the Godwithin, are brought under control, co-ordinated, and utilised, then, evenunconsciously to himself, will the voice of the disciple be heard, demanding theopening of the door. When the lower life upon the physical plane is fertilised,the emotional stabilised, and the mental transmuted, then naught can prevent thelatch upon that door being lifted, and the disciple passing through. Onlysynchronous vibration to that which lies the other side of the door produces itsopening, and when the key of the disciple's life is attuning itself to that ofthe hierarchical life, then, one by one, the doors will open, and nothing cankeep them closed.Rule 4 .Let the disciple tend the evolution of the fire; nourish the lesser lives, andthus keep the wheel revolving.Here comes an injunction to the disciple to remember his responsibility to thosemany lesser lives which, in their sum-total, compose his triple body ofmanifestation. Thus is evolution possible, and thus each life, in the differentkingdoms of nature, consciously or unconsciously, fulfils its function ofrightly energising that which is to it as is the planet to the sun. Thus willthe unfolding of the plan logoic proceed with greater accuracy. The kingdom ofGod is within, and the duty of that inner hidden Ruler is twofold, first, to thelives which form the bodies, physical, astral, and mental, and then to themacrocosm, the world of which the microcosm is but an infinitesimal part.Rule 5 .Let the applicant see to it that the solar angel dims the light of the lunarangels, remaining the sole luminary in the microcosmic sky.To fulfil this injunction all applicants need to do two things, first, to studytheir origin, to realise their own true psychology occultly understood, and tobecome scientifically aware of the real nature of the Ego, or the Higher Self,functioning in the causal body. Then they have to assert upon the physicalplane, through the medium of the three lower bodies, their innate divinity, andto demonstrate in ever increasing degree their essential value. Secondly, tostudy the constitution of man, to understand the method of functioning in thelower nature, to realise the interdependence and interrelation of all livingthings, and thus bring the lesser lives, which compose those three bodies ofmanifestation, under control. Thus the solar Lord, the inner Reality, the Son ofthe Father, and the Thinker on his own plane becomes the intermediary betweenthat which is of the earth, earthy, and that which finds its home within thesun. Two verses in the Christian Bible hide something of this idea withinthemselves, and students in the occident may find it helpful to meditate uponthem:—\"The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdom of our Lord and of HisChrist.\" \"O Lord, our God, other lords beside Thee have had dominion over us,but by Thee only will we make mention of Thy name.\" The last verse isparticularly interesting, as it demonstrates the suppression of the lower soundand creative force by that which is of higher origin.Rule 6 .The purificatory fires burn dim and low when the third is sacrificed to thefourth. Therefore let the disciple refrain from taking life, and let him nourishthat which is lowest with the produce of the second.This rule might be summed up in the trite instruction to each disciple that hebe strictly vegetarian. The lower nature becomes clogged and heavy, and theinner blaze cannot shine forth when meat is included in the diet. This is adrastic rule for applicants, and may not be violated. Aspirants can choose toeat meat or not as they prefer, but at a certain stage upon the path it isessential that all meat eating of every kind be stopped, and the strictestattention must be paid to diet. A disciple must confine himself to vegetables,grains, fruits and nuts. Only thus can he build the type of physical body whichcan stand the entry of the real man who has stood in his subtler bodies beforethe Initiator. Should he not do this, and should it be possible for him to takeinitiation without having thus prepared himself, the physical body would beshattered by the energy pouring through the newly stimulated centres, and diredanger to the brain, the spine, or the heart would eventuate.It must, of course, here be recognised that no hard or fast rules can ever belaid down, except the initial one that for all applicants for initiation meat,fish, and fermented liquors of all kinds, as well as the use of tobacco, areabsolutely forbidden. For those who can stand it, eggs and cheese are sometimesbetter eliminated from the diet, but this is not in any way compulsory. It isadvisable always that those who are in process of developing psychic facultiesof any kind should not permit themselves to eat eggs and very little cheese.Milk and butter come under a different category, and most initiates andapplicants find it necessary to retain them in the diet. A few exceptionalpeople can subsist and retain their full physical energies on the diet mentionedin the preceding paragraph. but there the ideal is embodied, and, as we allknow, the ideal is seldom attainable in the present transitional period.In this connection two things should be emphasised:—First, the need that allapplicants have for common sense; this factor is very often lacking, andstudents do well to remember that unbalanced fanatics are not desirable membersof the Hierarchy. Equilibrium, a just sense of proportion, a due regard forenvironing conditions, and a sane common sense are the marks of the trueoccultist. When a real sense of humour exists likewise, many dangers will beavoided. Secondly, a recognition of time , and an ability to move slowly wheneffecting changes in the diet and in the habits of a lifetime. Everything innature progresses slowly, and applicants must learn the occult truth of thewords:—\"Make haste slowly.\" A process of gradual elimination is usually the pathof wisdom, and this eliminating period should—under ideal conditions which soseldom exist —cover the stage which we call that of the aspirant, so that when aman becomes an applicant for initiation he will have done the necessarypreparatory purification of the diet.Rule 7 .Let the disciple turn his attention to the enunciating of those sounds whichecho in the halls where walks the Master. Let him not sound the lesser noteswhich awaken vibration within the halls of Maya.The disciple who seeks to enter within the Portals of Initiation cannot do sountil he has learnt the power of speech and the power of silence. This has adeeper and a wider significance than perhaps is apparent, for it holds, ifrightly interpreted, the key to manifestation, the clue to the great cycles, andthe revelation of the purpose underlying pralaya. Until a man comprehends thesignificance of the spoken word, and until he utilises the silence of the highplaces for the bringing about of desired effects on one plane or another, hecannot be admitted into those realms wherein every sound and every word spokenproduces powerful results in matter of some kind, being energised by twopredominant factors, (a) a powerful will, scientifically applied, (b) rightmotive, purified in the fires.An adept is a creator in mental matter, an originator of impulses on the mentalplane, thereby producing results in astral or physical manifestation. Theseresults are powerful and effective, and hence the necessity for their originatorto be pure in thought, accurate in word, and skilful in action. When these ideasare realised by applicants, the immediate consequence will be important changesin the life of every day. These changes might, for the sake of their practicaluse, be enumerated as follows:a. Motives will be closely searched, and a strict check will be kept uponoriginating impulses. Hence during the first year in which the applicant devoteshimself to the work of preparation for initiation he will, three times a day,keep a written account of the investigations he pursues, which concern hismotives, or the mainspring of action. b. Speech will be watched, and anendeavour will be made to eliminate all unkind, unnecessary and wasteful words.The effects of the spoken word will be studied, and be traced back to thoseoriginating impulses which, in every case, initiate action upon the physicalplane. c. Silence will be cultivated, and applicants will be careful to preservestrict silence concerning themselves, their occult work or. knowledge, theaffairs of those associated with them, and the work of their occult group. Onlyin group circles or in connection with their superiors will a wise latitude inspeech he permitted. There is a time to speak. That time comes when the groupcan be served by wise words, a careful intimation of conditions, good or bad,and a rare, but necessary word to some brother concerning the inner life, or tosome superior or group of officials, in cases where a brother may he hindering agroup through error of some kind, or might help the group if put to differentwork. d. The effect of the Sacred Word will be studied, and conditions for itsuse wisely arranged. The sounding of the Word, and its effect upon a particularesoteric centre (not in any case whatsoever a physical centre) will be watched,and the life thereby influenced and regulated.The whole question of the study of sound and of words, sacred or otherwise, hasto be taken up by applicants for initiation. This is something which must befaced more strenuously by all eventuating occult groups.Rule 8 .When the disciple nears the portal, the Greater Seven must awaken and bringforth response from the lesser seven upon the double circle.This rule is a very difficult one, and one which holds in it the elements ofdanger for the man who undertakes too early to tread the final path. Literallyit can be interpreted thus: The would-be initiate must develop somewhat thevibration of the seven head centres, and thus sweep into increased vibratoryactivity the seven centres in the body upon the etheric plane; affecting also,through reciprocal vibration, the seven physical centres which are inevitablystimulated when the etheric centres approach their maximum vibration. It is notnecessary to enlarge upon this point beyond pointing out that as the sevencentres within the head become responsive to the Ego the following sevencentres, 1. The head, considered as a unit, 2. The heart, 3. The throat, 4. Thesolar plexus, 5. The base of the spine, 6. The spleen, 7. The organs ofgeneration, are also affected, but affected along the line of purification andcontrol. This will produce results in the definitely physical organs throughwhich man functions on the physical plane. In illustration:—Man can thentransfer consciously the creative fire and energy from the organs of generationà to the throat, or, through the conscious control of the heart, producesuspended animation of the physical body. This is not achieved through what iscalled Hatha Yoga practices, or concentrating the attention upon the physicalorgans, but through the development of the control by the inner God, Who worksthrough the head centre and thus dominates all else.The applicant, therefore, will bend all his energies towards the development ofthe spiritual life, which development will be the outcome of right thinking,meditation, and service. Through deep study of all there is to be knownconcerning energy and its focal points, he will co-ordinate his life so that thelife of the spirit may flow through it. This study can only be safely undertakenat present in group work and under guidance from a teacher; the pupils willpledge themselves to permit no experimentation in their lives, and no carelesstrifling with the fires of the body. They will simply apply themselves to atheoretical comprehension and a life of service.The centres will then develop normally, whilst the applicant bends his attentionto loving his brother perfectly in truth and in deed, to serving wholeheartedly,to thinking intelligently, and to keeping a close watch upon himself. He willalso record all that seems to him in his inner life to be concerned with theevolution of the centres. This record can be surveyed by the teacher, commentmade, deduction sought, and the quota of information thus gained filed for groupreference. In this way much knowledge can be stored up for use.The applicant who misuses knowledge, who indulges in such practices as\"breathing for development,\" or concentrating upon the centres, will inevitablyfail in his endeavour to reach the portal, and will pay the price in his body bythe appearance of insanity, of neurasthenic conditions, and various physicalills.Rule 9 .Let the disciple merge himself within the circle of his other selves. Let butone colour blend them and their unity appear. Only when the group is known andsensed can energy be wisely emanated.One thing all disciples and applicants for initiation have to do is to find thatparticular group of servers to which they belong on the inner plane, torecognise them upon the physical plane, and to unite with them in service forthe race. This recognition will be based upon:a. Unity of aim. b. Oneness of vibration. c. Identity in group affiliation. d.Karmic links of long standing. e. Ability to work in harmonious relation.Superficially, this may appear one of the easiest of the rules, but in practiceit is not so. Mistakes are easily made, and the problem of working harmoniouslyin group alignment is not so simple as it may appear. Egoic vibration andrelationship may exist, yet the outer personalities may not harmonise. It is thework, then, of the applicant to strengthen the grip of his Ego upon hispersonality, so that the esoteric group relation may become possible upon thephysical plane. He will do this by the disciplining of his own personality, andnot by the correction of his brothers.Rule 10 .The Army of the Voice, the devas in their serried ranks, work ceaselessly. Letthe disciple apply himself to the consideration of their methods; let him learnthe rules whereby that Army works within the veils of Maya.This rule refers to the work of occult investigation, which must be pursued atsome time or another by all who seek initiation. Though it is not safe for theuninitiated to tamper with the parallel evolution of the devas, yet it isnecessary and safe to investigate the procedure pursued by the builders, themethods followed by them, in reproducing from the archetype, via the ethericthat which we call physical manifestation; their groups must be somewhattheoretically cognised, and the sounds whereby they are swept into activityconsidered. This involves, therefore, the organised study, by all applicants,of:—1. The purpose of sound.2. The esoteric meaning of words, of grammar, and of syntax.3. The laws of vibration and of electricity, and many other subsidiary studieswhich concern themselves with the manifestation of divinity and consciousnessthrough the medium of deva substance and the activity of the controlling devas.The laws of the macrocosm will be investigated, and the correspondence betweenthe activities of the microcosm, and the active manifestation of the macrocosmwill be recognised.Rule 11 .Let the disciple transfer the fire from the lower triangle to the higher, andpreserve that which is created through the fire of the midway point.This means, literally, the control by the initiate of the sex impulse, asusually understood, and the transference of the fire which now normallyvitalises the generative organs to the throat centre, thus leading to creationupon the mental plane through the agency of mind. That which is to be createdmust then be nourished and sustained by the love energy of nature issuing fromthe heart centre.The lower triangle referred to is:—1. The solar plexus.2. The base of the spine.3. The generative organs.Whilst the higher one is, as pointed out:—1. The head.2. The throat.3. The heart.This might be interpreted by the superficial reader as an injunction to thecelibate life, and the pledging of the applicant to abstain from all physicalmanifestation of the sex impulse. This is not so. Many initiates have attainedtheir objective when duly and wisely participating in the marriage relation. Aninitiate cultivates a peculiar attitude of mind, wherein there is a recognitionthat all forms of manifestation are divine, and that the physical plane is asmuch a form of divine expression as any of the higher planes. He realises thatthe lowest manifestation of divinity must be under the conscious control of thatindwelling divinity, and it that all acts of every kind should be regulated bythe endeavour to fulfil every duty and obligation, to control every action anddeed, and to utilise the physical vehicle so that the group may be therebybenefited and aided in its spiritual progress, and the law perfectly fulfilled.That it may be advisable, at certain stages, for a man to perfect control alongany particular line through a temporary abstention is not to be denied, but thatis a means to an end, and will be succeeded by stages when—the control havingbeen gained—the man demonstrates perfectly through the medium of the physicalbody, the attributes of divinity, and every centre will be normally and wiselyused, and thus race purposes furthered.Initiates and Masters, in many cases marry, and normally perform their duties ashusbands, wives, and householders, but all is controlled and regulated bypurpose and intention, and none is carried away by passion or desire. In theperfect man upon the physical plane, all the centres are under complete control,and their energy is legitimately used; the spiritual will of the divine innerGod is the main factor, and there will be a unity of effort shown on all theplanes through all the centres for the greatest good o£ the greatest number.This point has been touched upon because so many students go astray upon thesematters, and cultivate either an attitude of mind which results in the completeatrophying of the entire normal physical nature, or indulge in an orgy oflicense under the specious plea of \"stimulating the centres,\" and thusfurthering astral development. The true initiate should be known by his wise andsanctified normality, by his steady conformity to that which is best for thegroup as emphasised by the group laws of the land, by his control and hisrefraining Non, excess of any kind, and by the example he sets to his environingassociates of spiritual living and moral rectitude, coupled with the disciplineof his life.Rule 12 .Let the disciple learn the use of the hand in service; let him seek the mark ofthe messenger in his feet, and let him learn to see with the eye that looks outfrom between the two.This rule looks easy of interpretation upon the first reading, and seems toenjoin upon the applicant the use of the hands in service, of the feet uponhierarchical errands, and the development of clairvoyance. But the real meaningis much more esoteric. Occultly understood, the \"use of the hands\" is theutilisation of the chakras (or centres) in the palms of the hands in:—a. Healing bodily ills. b. Blessing, and thus curing emotional ills. c. Raisedin prayer, or the use of the centres of the hands during meditation in themanipulation of mental matter and currents.These three points will bear careful consideration, and much may be learnt byoccidental students from the study of the life of Christ, and a consideration ofHis methods in using His hands. More cannot be said here, as the subject is toovast to be enlarged upon in this brief commentary.The \"mark of the messenger\" in the feet, is a reference to that well-knownsymbol of the wings on the heels of Mercury. Much upon this subject will herevealed to students in occult schools who will gather together all that can befound concerning the Messenger of the Gods, and who also will study with careinformation which astrological students have gleaned anent the planet Mercury,and which occult students have gathered concerning the inner round.On the surface, the expression \"the eye which looks out from between the two\"seems to signify the third eye, which clairvoyants utilise, but the meaning isvery much deeper than that, and lies hidden in the following facts:a. That the inner vision is that which all self-conscious beings, from a Logosto a man, are in process of developing. b. That the Ego, or Higher Self, isliterally to the Monad what the third eye is to man, and therefore is describedas looking out from between the Monad or spiritual self on the one hand, and thepersonal self on the other.In the fullest sense, therefore, this rule incites the applicant to developself-consciousness, and thus learn to function in the causal body on the higherlevels of the mental plane, controlling from thence all the lower vehicles andseeing clearly all that can be seen in the three worlds, in the past and in thefuture.Rule 13 .Four things the disciple must learn and comprehend before he can be shewn thatinmost mystery: first, the laws of that which radiates; the five meanings ofmagnetisation make the second; the third is transmutation, or the secret lost ofalchemy; and lastly the first letter of the Word which has been imparted, or thehidden name egoic.This rule cannot be enlarged upon. It concerns mysteries and subjects tooimmense to be fully handled here. It is included in these rules so that it mayform a subject for meditation, for study, and for group discussion.The final rule is very brief and consists of five words.Rule 14 .Listen, touch, see, apply, know.These words concern what the Christian might aptly call the consecration of thethree major senses, and their utilisation in the evolution of the innerspiritual life, application then made of that which is learnt and ascertained,followed by the fruition of realised knowledge."},{"pageContent":"AN ESOTERIC CATECHISMThe following are some words from Archive XIII of the Masters’ Records, thatcarry with them a message for the struggler on the Way. They are somewhat on theline of an old catechism, and used to be recited by the participants in thelesser mysteries before they passed on into the greater.What seest thou, O Pilgrim? Lift up thine eyes and tell what thou beholdest.I see a ladder, mounting within the vault of blue, its feet lost sight of in themists and fogs that circle round our planet.Where standest thou, O Pilgrim? On what are placed thy feet?I stand upon a portion of the ladder, the fourth division well nigh mounted; itslatter part stretches before me into the darkness of a stormy night. Beyond thatsphere of utter gloom I see the ladder rise again, radiant and glowing in itsfifth division.What marks those portions which you thus describe as separated from anotherpart? Do not all form but one completed ladder of clearly marked proportions?Always a gap appeareth to the eye, which (when approached more closely)resolveth then itself into a Cross, by which one mounteth to the next division.What causeth then the Cross? How mount you by its aid?The Cross is formed by aspirations, instilled by Godlike urge, which cut athwartthe lower world desires, implanted by the life developed from below.Explain more clearly what you mean, and how that Cross becomes the Way.The arms that form the Cross become the great dividing line, placed twixt thelower and the higher. Upon those arms the hands are nailed,—the hands that graspand hold, ministering to the lower needs, trained thus through many aeons. Lo,when the hands are helpless held, and cannot grasp and hold, the inner lifeslips from its sheath, mounting the limb upright. It passeth from the lowerfourth, and the Cross doth bridge the gap.Pass they with ease that mount that limb, and leave the fourth behind?They pass through tears, through clouds and mists; they suffer and they die.They bid adieu to all earth's friends; they mount the Way alone; they bridge thegap with loving deeds done in the pain of living; they lift one hand aloft toHim Who standeth just above; they lean one downward to the man who standeth nextbelow. The hands, freed from the transverse arms, are freed but to be held. Onlythe empty nail-marked hands can keep the chain complete.Where ends the ladder's length? What point of gloom is pierced by it and whereprojects its end?It cuts the crystallising sphere with all its myriad forms; it pierces throughthe watery plane, washed by the swirling tides; it passes through the nethermosthell, down into densest maya, and ends within the latent fire, the molten lakeof fiercest burning, touching the denizens of fire, the Agnichaitans of thescarlet heat.Where mounts the ladder's length? Where is its consummation?It mounteth through the radiant spheres, through all their six divisions. Itriseth to the mighty Seat within the final fifth, and passeth from that mightySeat to yet another greater.Who sits upon that mighty Seat within the final fifth?He with the Name we mention not, save in utter adoration; the Youth of EndlessSummers, the Light of Life itself, the Wondrous One, the Ancient One, Lord ofVenusian Love, the great Kumara with the Flaming Sword, the Peace of all theEarth.Sits He alone, this Wondrous One, upon His sapphire throne?He sits alone, yet close upon the rainbow steps there stand three other Lords,garnering the product of Their work and sacrificing all Their gain to aid theLord of Love.Are They assisted in Their work? Do other Ones of greater powers than ours standtoo upon the ladder?These mighty Four, Action and Love, in wise co-operation work with TheirBrothers of a lesser grade, the three Great Lords we know.Who aid these mighty Lords? Who carry on Their work, linking the lower with thehigher?The Brothers of Logoic Love in all Their many grades. They stay within the finalfifth till it absorbeth all the fourth.Where mounts the ladder then?To the greatest Lord of all, before Whom e’en that Ancient One bends inobeisance low; before Whose throne of effulgent light Angels of highest rank,Masters and Lords of uttermost compassion, prostrate Themselves and humbly bend,waiting the Word to rise.When sounds that Word and what transpires when it echoes through the spheres?That Word sounds not till all is done, until the Lord of endless love deemeththe work correct. He uttereth then a lesser Word that vibrateth through thescheme. The greater Lord of cosmic Love, hearing the circling sound, addethcompletion to the chord, and breatheth forth the whole.What will be seen, O Pilgrim on the Way, when sounds that final chord?The music of the endless spheres, the merging of the seven; the end of tears, ofsin, of strife, the shattering of forms; the finish of the ladder, the blendingin the All, completion of the circling spheres and their entry into peace.What part, O Pilgrim on the Way, play you within this scheme? How will you enterinto peace? How stand before your Lord?I play my part with stern resolve, with earnest aspiration;I look above, I help below; I dream not, nor I rest; I toil; I serve; I reap; Ipray; I am the Cross; I am the Way; I tread upon the work I do; I mount upon myslain self; I kill desire, and I strive, forgetting all reward. I forego peace;I forfeit rest, and in the stress of pain I lose myself and find Myself andenter into peace."},{"pageContent":"THE GREAT INVOCATIONFrom the point of Light within the Mind of God Let light stream forth into theminds of men. Let Light descend on Earth.From the point of Love within the Heart of God Let love stream forth into thehearts of men.

The beauty and the strength of this Invocation lies in itssimplicity, and in its expression of certain central truths which all men,innately and normally, accept—the truth of the existence of a basic Intelligenceto Whom we vaguely give the name of God; the truth that behind all outerseeming, the motivating power of the universe is Love; the truth that a greatIndividuality came to earth, called by Christians, the Christ, and embodied thatlove so that we could understand; the truth that both love and intelligence areeffects of what is called the Will of God; and finally the self-evident truththat only through humanity itself can the Divine Plan work out.\"—Alice A.Bailey."},{"pageContent":"GLOSSARYAdept .
