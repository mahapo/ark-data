BAILEY"},{"pageContent":"EXTRACT FROM A STATEMENT BY THE TIBETANSuffice it to say, that I am a Tibetan disciple of a certain degree, and thistells you but little, for all are disciples from the humblest aspirant up to,and beyond, the Christ Himself. I live in a physical body like other men, on theborders of Tibet, and at times (from the exoteric standpoint) preside over alarge group of Tibetan lamas, when my other duties permit. It is this fact thathas caused it to be reported that I am an abbot of this particular lamasery.Those associated with me in the work of the Hierarchy (and all true disciplesare associated in this work) know me by still another name and office. A.A.B.knows who I am and recognises me by two of my names.I am a brother of yours, who has travelled a little longer upon the Path thanhas the average student, and has therefore incurred greater responsibilities. Iam one who has wrestled and fought his way into a greater measure of light thanhas the aspirant who will read this article, and I must therefore act as atransmitter of the light, no matter what the cost. I am not an old man, as agecounts among the teachers, yet I am not young or inexperienced. My work is toteach and spread the knowledge of the Ageless Wisdom wherever I can find aresponse, and I have been doing this for many years. I seek also to help theMaster M. and the Master K.H. whenever opportunity offers, for I have been longconnected with Them and with Their work. In all the above, I have told you much;yet at the same time I have told you nothing which would lead you to offer methat blind obedience and the foolish devotion which the emotional aspirantoffers to the Guru and Master Whom he is as yet unable to contact. Nor will hemake that desired contact until he has transmuted emotional devotion intounselfish service to humanity-not to the Master.The books that I have written are sent out with no claim for their acceptance.They may, or may not, be correct, true and useful. It is for you to ascertaintheir truth by right practice and by the exercise of the intuition. Neither Inor A.A.B. is the least interested in having them acclaimed as inspiredwritings, or in having anyone speak of them (with bated breath) as being thework of one of the Masters. If they present truth in such a way that it followssequentially upon that already offered in the world teachings, if theinformation given raises the aspiration and the will-to-serve from the plane ofthe emotions to that of the mind (the plane whereon the Masters can be found)then they will have served their purpose. If the teaching conveyed calls forth aresponse from the illumined mind of the worker in the world, and brings aflashing forth of his intuition, then let that teaching be accepted. But nototherwise. If the statements meet with eventual corroboration, or are deemedtrue under the test of the Law of Correspondences, then that is well and good.But should this not be so, let not the student accept what is said.August 1934"},{"pageContent":"KEYNOTEWhenever there is a withering of the law and an uprising of lawlessness on allsides, then I manifest Myself.For the salvation of the righteous and the destruction of such as do evil, forthe firm establishing of the Law, I come to birth age after age.THE BHAGAVAD GITABook IV, Sutra 7, 8."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE - THE DOCTRINE OF THE COMING ONETHE DOCTRINE OF THE COMING ONE - Western TeachingTHE DOCTRINE OF AVATARS - Eastern Teaching[5] Right down the ages, in many world cycles and in many countries (and todayin all) great points of tension have occurred which have been characterised by ahopeful sense of expectancy. Some one is expected and His coming is anticipated.Always in the past, it has been the religious teachers of the period who havefostered and proclaimed this expectancy and the time has always been one ofchaos and difficulty, of a climaxing point at the close of a civilisation orculture and when the resources of the old religions have seemed inadequate tomeet men’s difficulties or to solve their problems. The coming of the Avatar,the advent of a Coming One and, in terms of today, the reappearance of theChrist are the keynotes of the prevalent expectancy. When the times are ripe,the invocation of the masses is strident enough and the faith of those who knowis keen enough, then always He has come and today will be no exception to thisancient rule or to this universal law. For decades, the reappearance of theChrist, the Avatar, has been anticipated by the faithful in both hemispheres—notonly by the Christian faithful, but by those who look for Maitreya and for theBoddhisattva as well as those who expect the Imam Mahdi.When men feel that they have exhausted all their own resources and have come toan end of all their own innate possibilities and that the problems andconditions confronting them are beyond their solving or handling, they are aptto look for a divine Intermediary and for the [6] Mediator Who will plead theircause with God and bring about a rescue. They look for a Saviour. This doctrineof Mediators, of Messiahs, of Christs and of Avatars can be found running like agolden thread through all the world faiths and Scriptures and, relating theseworld Scriptures to some central source of emanation, they are found in richabundance everywhere. Even the human soul is regarded as an intermediary betweenman and God; Christ is believed by countless millions to act as the divinemediator between humanity and divinity.The whole system of spiritual revelation is based (and has always been based) onthis doctrine of interdependence, of a planned and arranged conscious linkingand of the transmission of energy from one aspect of divine manifestation toanother—from God in the “secret Place of the Most High” to the humblest humanbeing, living and struggling and sorrowing on earth. Everywhere thistransmission is to be found; “I am come that they may have life” says theChrist, and the Scriptures of the world are full of the intervention of someBeing, originating from some source higher than the strictly human. Always theappropriate mechanism is found through which divinity can reach and communicatewith humanity, and it is with this communication and these Instruments of divineenergy that the doctrine of Avatars or of divine “Coming Ones” has to do.An Avatar is one Who has a peculiar capacity (besides a self-initiated task anda pre-ordained destiny) to transmit energy or divine power. This is necessarilya deep mystery and was demonstrated in a peculiar manner and in relation tocosmic energy by the Christ Who—for the first time in planetary history, as faras we know—transmitted the divine energy of love directly to our planet and in amost definite sense to humanity. Always [7] too these Avatars or divineMessengers are linked with the concept of some subjective spiritual Order orHierarchy of spiritual Lives, Who are concerned with the developing welfare ofhumanity. All we really know is that, down the ages, great and divineRepresentatives of God embody divine purpose, and affect the entire world insuch a manner that Their names and Their influence are known and felt thousandsof years after They no longer walk among men. Again and again, They have comeand have left a changed world and some new world religion behind Them; we knowalso that prophecy and faith have ever held out to mankind the promise of Theircoming again amongst us in an hour of need. These statements are statements offact, historically proven. Beyond this we know relatively few details.The word “Avatar” is a Sanskrit word, meaning literally “coming down from faraway.” Ava (as prefix to verbs and verbal nouns) expresses the idea of “off,away, down.” Avataram (comparative) farther away. The root AV seems at all timesto denote the idea of protection from above , and is used in compounds, in wordsreferring to protections by kings or rulers; in regard to the gods, it meansaccepted favourably when a sacrifice is offered. With the result that the rootword can be said to mean “Coming down with the approval of the higher sourcefrom which it came and with benefit to the place at which it arrives.” (FromMonier-Williams’ Sanskrit Dictionary. )All the world Avatars or Saviours, however, express two basic incentives: theneed of God to contact humanity and to have relationship with men and the needof humanity for divine contact, help and understanding. Subject to thoseincentives, all true Avatars are therefore divine Intermediaries. They can actin this fashion because They [8] have completely divorced Themselves from everylimitation, from all sense of self hood and separativeness and are no longer—byordinary human standards—the dramatic centre of Their lives, as are most of us.When They have reached that stage of spiritual decentralisation, They Themselvescan then become events in the life of our planet; toward Them every eye can lookand all men can be affected. Therefore, an Avatar or a Christ comes forth fortwo reasons: one, the inscrutable and unknown Cause prompts Him so to do, andthe other is the demand or the invocation of humanity itself. An Avatar isconsequently a spiritual event, coming to us to bring about great changes ormajor restorations, to inaugurate a new civilisation or to restore the “ancientlandmarks” and lead man nearer to the divine. They have been defined as“extraordinary men Who from time to time appear to change the face of the worldand inaugurate a new era in the destinies of humanity.” They come in times ofcrisis; They frequently create crises in order to bring to an end the old andthe undesirable and make way for new and more suitable forms for the evolvinglife of God Immanent in Nature. They come when evil is rampant. For this reason,if for no other, an Avatar may be looked for today. The necessary stage is setfor the reappearance of the Christ.Avatars are of all degrees and kinds; some of them are of great planetaryimportance because They express whole cycles of future development withinThemselves and strike the note and give the teaching which will bring in a newage and a new civilisation; They embody great truths towards which the masses ofmen must work and which still constitute an objective to the greatest minds ofthe age, even though as yet unrealised. Certain Avatars also express inThemselves the sum total of human achievement [9] and of racial perfection, andthus become the “ideal men” of the ages. Others, greater still, are permitted tobe the custodians of some divine principle or some divine quality which needsfresh presentation and expression upon Earth; this They can be because They haveachieved perfection and have attained to the highest possible initiations. Theyhave the gift of being these embodied spiritual qualities, and because They havein fullness expressed such a specific principle or quality They can act aschannels for its transmission from the centre of all spiritual Life. This is thebasis for the doctrine of Avatars or Divine Messengers.Such an one was the Christ; He was twice an Avatar because He not only struckthe keynote of the new age (over two thousand years ago) but He also, in somemysterious and incomprehensible manner, embodied in Himself the divine Principleof Love; He was the first to reveal to men the true nature of God. Theinvocative cry of humanity (the second of the incentives producing a divineEmergence) is potent in effect because the souls of men, particularly inconcerted action, have in them something which is akin to the divine nature ofthe Avatar. We are all Gods, all the children of the One Father, as the latestof the Avatars, the Christ, has told us. It is that divine centre in every humanheart which, when awakened into activity, can call forth response from the highPlace where the Coming One awaits His hour of appearance. It is only the uniteddemand of humanity, its “massed intent,” which can precipitate the descent (asit is called) of an Avatar.To sum up, therefore: the doctrine of Avatars is paralleled by the doctrine ofthe continuity of revelation . Ever down the ages, and at every great humancrisis, always in the hours of necessity, at the founding of a new [10] race, orin the awakening of a prepared humanity to a new and wider vision, the Heart ofGod—impelled by the Law of Compassion—sends forth a Teacher, a world Saviour, anIlluminator, an Avatar, a transmitting Intermediary, a Christ. He gives themessage which will heal, which will indicate the next step to be taken by therace of men, which will illumine a dark world problem and give to man anexpression of some hitherto unrealised aspect of divinity. Upon this fact of thecontinuity of revelation and upon the sequence of this progressive manifestationof the divine Nature, is based the doctrine of Avatars, divine Messengers,divine Appearances and Saviours. To Them all, history unmistakenly testifies. Itis upon the fact of this continuity, this sequence of Messengers and Avatars,and upon the dire and dreadful need of humanity at this time, that the worldwideexpectancy of the reappearance of the Christ is based. It is the innaterecognition of all these facts that has led to the steadily mounting invocativecry of humanity in every land for some form of divine relief or divineintervention; it is the recognition of these facts which also prompts the orderwhich has gone forth from “the centre where the will of God is known” that theAvatar should come again; it is the knowledge of both these demands which hasled the Christ to let His disciples in every land know that He will re-appearwhen they have done the needed preparatory work.The Avatars most easily known and recognised are the Buddha in the East and theChrist in the West. Their messages are familiar to all, and the fruits of Theirlives and words have conditioned the thinking and civilisations of bothhemispheres. Because They are human-divine Avatars, They represent what humanitycan easily understand; because They are of like nature to us, “flesh of [11] ourflesh and spirit of our spirit,” we know and trust Them and They mean more to usthan other divine Emergences. They are known, trusted and loved by countlessmillions. The nucleus of spiritual energy which each of Them set up is beyondour measuring; the establishing of a nucleus of persistent energy, spirituallypositive, is the constant task of an Avatar ; He focusses or anchors a dynamictruth, a potent thoughtform or a vortex of magnetic energy in the world of humanliving. This focal point acts increasingly as a transmitter of spiritual energy;it enables humanity to express some divine idea and this in time produces acivilisation with its accompanying culture, religions, policies, governments andeducational processes. Thus is history made. History is after all only therecord of humanity’s cyclic reaction to some inflowing divine energy, to someinspired leader, or to some Avatar.An Avatar is at present usually a Representative of the second divine aspect,that of Love-Wisdom, the Love of God. He will manifest as the Saviour, theBuilder, the Preserver; humanity is not yet sufficiently developed or adequatelyoriented to the life of the Spirit to bear easily the impact of an Avatar Whowould express the dynamic will of God. For us as yet (and this is ourlimitation) an Avatar is one Who preserves, develops, builds, protects, shieldsand succours the spiritual impulses by which men live; that which brings Himinto manifestation is man’s need and man’s demand for preservation and help.Humanity needs love, understanding and right human relations as an expression ofattained divinity. It was this need which brought the Christ to us before as theAvatar of Love. The Christ, that great human-divine Messenger, because of Hisstupendous achievement—along the line of understanding—transmitted to [12]humanity an aspect and a potency of the nature of God Himself, the lovePrinciple of Deity. Light, aspiration, and the recognition of God Transcendenthad been the flickering expression of the human attitude to God, prior to theadvent of the Buddha, the Avatar of Illumination. Then the Buddha came anddemonstrated in His Own life the fact of God Immanent as well as GodTranscendent, of God in the universe and of God within humanity. The Selfhood ofDeity and the Self in the heart of individual man became a factor in humanconsciousness. It was a relatively new truth to man.However, until Christ came and lived a life of love and service and gave men thenew command to love one another, there had been very little emphasis upon God asLove in any of the world Scriptures. After He had come as the Avatar of Love,then God became known as love supernal, love as the goal and objective ofcreation, love as the basic principle of relationship and love as workingthroughout all manifestation towards a Plan motivated by love. This divinequality, Christ revealed and emphasised and thus altered all human living, goalsand values.The reason He has not come again is that the needed work has not been done byHis followers in all countries. His coming is largely dependent, as we shalllater see, upon the establishing of right human relations. This the church hashindered down the centuries, and has not helped because of its fanatical zeal tomake “Christians” of all peoples and not followers of the Christ. It hasemphasised theological doctrine, and not love and loving understanding as Christexemplified it. The Church has preached the fiery Saul of Tarsus and not thegentle Carpenter of Galilee. And so, He has waited. But His hour has now come,because of the people’s need in every [13] land and because of the invocativecry of the masses everywhere and the advice of His disciples of all faiths andof all world religions.It is not for us yet to know the date or the hour of the reappearance of theChrist. His coming is dependent upon the appeal (the often voiceless appeal) ofall who stand with massed intent; it is dependent also upon the betterestablishment of right human relations and upon certain work being done at thistime by senior Members of the Kingdom of God, the Church Invisible, thespiritual Hierarchy of our planet; it is dependent also upon the steadfastnessof the Christ’s disciples in the world at this time and His initiate-workers—allworking in the many groups, religious, political and economic. To the above mustbe added what Christians like to call “the inscrutable Will of God,” thatunrecognised purpose of the Lord of the World, the Ancient of Days (as He iscalled in The Old Testament ) Who “knows His own Mind, radiates the highestquality of love and focusses His Will in His Own high Place within the centrewhere the Will of God is known.”When the Christ, the Avatar of Love, makes His reappearance then will the“Sons of men who are now the Sons of God withdraw Their faces from the shininglight and radiate that light upon the sons of men who know not yet they are theSons of God . Then shall the Coming One appear, His footsteps hastened throughthe valley of the shadow by the One of awful power Who stands upon the mountaintop, breathing out love eternal, light supernal and peaceful, silent Will.“Then will the sons of men respond. Then will a newer light shine forth into thedismal, weary vale of earth. Then will new life course through the veins of [14]men, and then will their vision compass all the ways of what may be.“So peace will come again on earth, but a peace unlike aught known before. Thenwill the will-to-good flower forth as understanding, and understanding blossomas goodwill in men.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO - CHRIST’S UNIQUE OCCASIONThe World Today[15] In any acceptance of the teaching that Christ will come, one of thedifficulties today is the feeling that the teaching has been given for manycenturies and nothing has ever happened. That is a statement of fact, and herelies a great deal of our trouble. The expectancy of His coming is nothing new;in it lies nothing unique or different; those who still hold to the idea areregarded tolerantly, or with amusement or pity, as the case may be. A study oftimes and seasons, of significances, of divine intention or of the will of God,plus a consideration of the world situation, may lead us, however, to believethat the present time is unique in more ways than one, and that the Christ isconfronted with an unique occasion. This unique opportunity with which He ispresented is brought about by certain world conditions which themselves areunique; there are factors present in the world today, and happenings have takenplace within the past century which have never before occurred; it might profitus if we considered these matters and so gained a better perspective. The worldto which He will come is a new world, if not yet a better world; new ideas areoccupying people’s minds and new problems await solution. Let us look at thisuniqueness and gain some knowledge of the situation into which the Christ willbe precipitated. Let us be realistic in our approach to this theme and avoidmystical and vague thinking. If it is true that He plans to reappear, if [16] itis a fact that He will bring His disciples, the Masters of the Wisdom, with Him,and if this coming is imminent, what are some of the factors which He and theymust take into consideration?First of all, He will come to a world which is essentially one world. Hisreappearance and His consequent work cannot be confined to one small locality ordomain unheard of by the great majority, as was the case when He was herebefore. The radio, the press and the dissemination of news will make His comingdifferent to that of any previous Messenger; the swift modes of transportationwill make Him available to countless millions, and by boat, rail and plane theycan reach Him: through television, His face can be made familiar to all, andverily “every eye shall see Him.” Even if there is no general recognition of Hisspiritual status and His message, there must necessarily be an universalinterest, for today even the many false Christs and Messengers are finding thisuniversal curiosity and cannot be hidden. This creates an unique condition inwhich to work, and one which no salvaging, energising Son of God has ever beforehad to face.The sensitivity of the people of the world to what is new or needed is alsouniquely different; man has progressed far in his reaction to both good and eviland possesses a far more sensitive response apparatus than did humanity in thoseearlier times. If there was a quick response to the Messenger when He camebefore, it will be more general and quicker now, both in rejection and inacceptance. Men are more enquiring, better educated, more intuitive and moreexpectant of the unusual and the unique than at any other time in history. Theirintellectual perception is keener, their sense of values more acute, theirability to discriminate and choose is fast developing, [17] and they penetratemore quickly into significances. These facts will condition the reappearance ofthe Christ and tend to a more rapid spreading of the news of His coming and thecontents of His message.Today, when He comes, He will find a world uniquely free from the grip and holdof ecclesiasticism; when He came before, Palestine was held in the vicious graspof the Jewish religious leaders, and the Pharisees and the Sadducees were to thepeople of that land what the potentates of the church are to the people in theworld today. But—there has been a useful and wholesome swing away fromChurchianity and from orthodox religion during the past century, and this willpresent a unique opportunity for the restoration of true religion and thepresentation of a simple return to the ways of spiritual living. The priests,the Levites, the Pharisees and the Sadducees were not the ones who recognisedHim when He came before. They feared Him. And it is highly improbable that thereactionary churchmen will be the ones to recognise Him today. He may reappearin a totally unexpected guise; who is to say whether He will come as apolitician, an economist, a leader of the people (arising from the midst ofthem), a scientist or an artist?It is a fallacy to believe, as some do, that the main trend of Christ’s workwill be through the medium of the churches or the world religions. Henecessarily will work through them when conditions permit and there is a livingnucleus of true spirituality within them, or when their invocative appeal ispotent enough to reach Him. He will use all possible channels whereby theconsciousness of man may be enlarged and right orientation be brought about. Itis, however, truer to say that it is as World Teacher that He will consistentlywork, and that the churches are but one of the teaching avenues He will [18]employ. All that enlightens the minds of men, all propaganda that tends to bringabout right human relations, all modes of acquiring real knowledge, all methodsof transmuting knowledge into wisdom and understanding, all that expands theconsciousness of humanity and of all subhuman states of awareness andsensitivity, all that dispels glamour and illusion and that disruptscrystallisation and disturbs static conditions will come under the realisticactivities of the Hierarchy which He supervises. He will be limited by thequality and the calibre of the invocative appeal of humanity and that, in itsturn, is conditioned by the attained point in evolution.In the Middle Ages of history and earlier, it was the churches and the schoolsof philosophy which provided the major avenues for His subjective activity, butit will not be so when He is objectively and actually here. This is a pointwhich the churches and organised religions would do well to remember. There isnow a shift of His emphasis and attention into two new fields of endeavour:first, into the field of world-wide education, and secondly, into the sphere ofimplementing intelligently those activities which come under the department ofgovernment in its three aspects of statesmanship, of politics and oflegislation. The common people are today awakening to the importance andresponsibility of government; it is, therefore, realised by the Hierarchy thatbefore the cycle of true democracy (as it essentially exists and will eventuallydemonstrate) can come into being, the education of the masses in cooperativestatesmanship, in economic stabilisation through right sharing, and in clean,political interplay is imperatively necessary. The long divorce between religionand politics must be ended and this can now come about because of the high levelof the human mass intelligence and the fact that science has made all men soclose [19] that what happens in some remote area of the earth’s surface is amatter of general interest within a few minutes. This makes it uniquely possiblefor Him to work in the future.The development of spiritual recognition is the great need today in preparationfor His reappearance; no one knows in what nation He will come; He may appear asan Englishman, a Russian, a Negro, a Latin, a Turk, a Hindu, or any othernationality. Who can say which? He may be a Christian or a Hindu by faith, aBuddhist or of no particular faith at all; He will not come as the restorer ofany of the ancient religions, including Christianity, but He will come torestore man’s faith in the Father’s love, in the fact of the livingness of theChrist and in the close, subjective and unbreakable relationship of all meneverywhere. The facilities of the entire world of contact and relation will beat His disposal; that will be part of the uniqueness of His opportunity and—forthis He too must prepare.Another unique factor which will distinguish His coming will be not only thegeneral expectancy but also the fact that much is today known and taught aboutthe Kingdom of God, or the Spiritual Hierarchy of the planet. Everywhere, in allcountries, there are thousands who are interested in the fact of that Hierarchy,who believe in the Masters of the Wisdom, the disciples of the Christ, and whowill not be surprised when this group of Sons of God, surrounding their greatLeader, the Christ, makes its appearance on Earth. The churches in all countrieshave familiarised the public with the phrase “the Kingdom of God”; theesotericists and occultists everywhere have publicised the fact of the Hierarchyduring the past century; the spiritualists have laid the emphasis upon the [20]aliveness of those who have passed over into the hidden world of being, andtheir Guides have also borne testimony to the existence of an inner, spiritualworld. All this creates a unique preparedness which presents the Christ withunique opportunities and unique problems. All these spiritual forces and manyothers, both within and without the world religions and the philosophical andhumanitarian groups, are working at this time under direction, are closelyrelated and their activities most intimately synchronised. They are all workingtogether (even if this is not physically apparent) because in the human familythere are those at every stage of responsiveness. The forces of regeneration, ofreconstruction, of restoration and of resurrection are making their presencefelt in all the many groups which are seeking to aid and lift humanity, torebuild the world, to restore stability and the sense of security and thus(consciously or unconsciously) prepare the way for the coming of the Christ.There is also a unique revival of the ancient teaching of the Buddha and it ispenetrating into the Western countries and finding devoted adherents in everyland. The Buddha is the symbol of enlightenment and there is everywhere today aunique emphasis upon light . Countless millions down the ages have recognisedthe Buddha as the Light Bearer from on high. His Four Noble Truths exposed thecauses of human trouble and pointed to the cure. He taught: Cease to identifyyourselves with material things or with your desires; gain a proper sense ofvalue; cease regarding possessions and earthly existence as of major importance;follow the Noble Eightfold Path which is the Path of right relations—rightrelations to God, and right relations to your fellowmen—and thus be happy. Thesteps on this Path are: [21]Right Values. Right Aspiration. Right Speech. Right Conduct. Right Modes ofLiving. Right Effort. Right Thinking. Right Rapture or Happiness.This message is uniquely needed today in a world in which most of these rightsteps to happiness have been consistently ignored. It is on the foundation ofthis teaching that Christ will raise the superstructure of the brotherhood ofman, for right human relations are an expression of the love of God; they willconstitute man’s major and next demonstration of divinity. Today, in the midstof this devastated, chaotic and unhappy world, mankind has a fresh opportunityto reject selfish materialistic living and to begin to tread the Lighted Way.The moment that humanity shows its willingness to do this, then the Christ willcome, and there is every evidence at this time that men are learning this lessonand making their first faltering steps along that Lighted Way of rightrelationships.The present time is unique in that it is (as never before) a cycle or period ofconferences—communal, national and international—and of men getting together.Clubs, forums, committees, conferences, and leagues are forming everywhere forthe discussion and study of human welfare and liberation; this phenomenon is oneof the strongest indications that the Christ is on His way. He is the embodimentof freedom, and the Messenger of Liberation. He stimulates the group spirit andthe group consciousness, and His spiritual energy is the attractive force,binding men together for the common good. His reappearance will knit and bindtogether all men and women of goodwill throughout the world, irrespective ofreligion or nationality. His coming will evoke among men a widespread and mutualrecognition of the [22] good in all. This is part of the uniqueness of Hiscoming and for it we are already preparing. A study of the daily press willprove this. It is the invocative appeal of the many groups working on behalf ofhumanity (consciously or unconsciously made) which will bring Him forth. Thosewho carry out this great act of invocation are the spiritually minded people,the enlightened statesmen, the religious leaders and the men and women whosehearts are full of goodwill. They will evoke Him if they can stand with massedintent, with hope and with expectancy. This preparatory work must be focussedthrough and implemented by the world intelligentsia and leading lovers ofhumanity, by groups dedicated to human betterment and by representativeunselfish people. The success of the effort now being planned by Christ and thespiritual Hierarchy is dependent upon the ability of mankind to use what lightit already has in order to establish right relations in their families, theircommunity, in their nation and in the world.There is, therefore, this unique difference between the expected coming of theChrist and the time when He came before: the world is full of groups working forhuman welfare. This effort, in the light of past aeons of human history, is arelatively new thing and for it the Christ must prepare and with this trend Hewill have to work. The “cycle of conferences” which is now swinging into fulltide is part of the unique condition with which the Christ is faced.Before, however, Christ could come with His disciples, our present civilisationhad to die. During the coming century, we shall begin to learn the meaning ofthe word “resurrection,” and the new age will begin to reveal its deep purposeand intention. The first step will be the emergence of humanity from the deathof its civilisation, [23] of its old ideas and modes of living, therelinquishing of its materialistic goals and its damning selfishness, and itsmoving forward into the clear light of the resurrection. These are notsymbolical or mystical words but part of the general setting which will surroundthe period of Christ’s reappearance; it is a cycle as real as the cycle ofconferences now so busily organising. Christ taught us when He came before thetrue meaning of Renunciation or of the Crucifixion; this time His message willbe concerned with the resurrection life . The present cycle of conferences ispreparing men everywhere for relationships, even though today they may seemwidely divergent in nature; the important factor is the general human interestand thought about establishing the need, the objectives involved, the means tobe employed. The resurrection period which the Christ will inaugurate and whichwill constitute His unique work—within which all His other activities will havetheir place—will be the outcome of the fermentation and the germination going onin the world of men at this time, of which the many conferences are the outerevidence.It was these various unique conditions which the Christ faced during the yearsof war when the need of humanity forced Him to decide to hasten His coming. Theunhappy state of the world as the result of centuries of selfishness and of theworld war, the unique sensitivity which men everywhere were showing (as a resultof the evolutionary process), the unique spread of knowledge about the spiritualHierarchy and the unique development of group consciousness, showing itself onevery hand in the multiplicity of conferences, confronted Christ with His uniqueoccasion and presented Him with a decision which He could not avoid.[24] Reverently we might say that in this “occasion” of the Christ’s, two factswere involved and that both of them are difficult for man to understand. Thefact of the synchronisation of His will with that of the Father, and the factthat this synchronisation led to a basic decision, must be recognised by us. Itis not easy for the average Christian to realise that the Christ passes onsteadily to increasingly potent experiences, and that in His divine experiencethere is nothing static or permanent—except His unalterable love for humanity.A close study of the Gospel story, unimpeded by orthodox interpretations,reveals certain things. The usual interpretations, if men would but recognisethem in their true meaning, are simply some man’s understanding of a series ofAramaic, Greek or Latin words. The fact that the majority of acceptedcommentators lived many hundreds of years ago seems to have given such words atotally unwarranted value. The words of a commentator or of an interpreter todayare apparently of no value in comparison with those of ancient date; yet themodern commentator is probably more intelligent and better educated than theancient one and has, also, the benefit of the many recognised translations and aprecise science. We are suffering theologically from the ignorance of the past;it is a peculiar thing that an ancient commentator is supposed to carry greaterweight than the modern, more educated and intelligent man. If The New Testamentis true in its presentation of the Christ, if it is true in its repetition ofHis words, that we can do “greater things” than He did, and if it is true inthat He told us to “be perfect even as our Father in Heaven is perfect,” what isthere wrong in our recognising the capacity of a human being to keep pace withthe mind of Christ and to know what He intends us to know? Christ said that “ifany [25] man will do the will of God, he shall know”; that was how the ChristHimself learnt and that is the mode He assures us will be successful for each ofus.It was the dawning of this significance of the will of God upon theconsciousness of the Christ which led Him to certain great decisions, and whichforced Him to cry out: “Father, not my will but Thine be done.” These wordsdefinitely indicate conflict and do not indicate the synchronisation of the twowills; they indicate the determination on the part of the Christ that thereshould be no opposition between His will and that of God. Suddenly, He receiveda vision of the emerging, divine intention for humanity and—through humanity—forthe planet as a whole. At the particular stage of spiritual development whichChrist had then attained and which had made Him the Head of the spiritualHierarchy, the One who engineered the emergence of the Kingdom of God andestablished Him as the Master of all the Masters and the Teacher of angels andof men, His consciousness was absolutely at one with the divine Plan; itsapplication on Earth and its goal of establishing the Kingdom of God and theappearance of the fifth kingdom in nature was simply for Him the fulfilling ofthe law and to that fulfilment His entire life was and had been geared.The Plan, its goal, its techniques and its laws, its energy (that of love) andthe close and growing relation between the spiritual Hierarchy and humanity wereknown to him, and fully understood. At the highest point of this consummatedknowledge and at the moment of His complete surrender to the necessary sacrificeof His life to the fulfilling of this Plan, suddenly a great expansion ofconsciousness took place. The significance, the intention, the purpose of itall, and the comprehensive divine Idea (as it existed in the mind of the Father)[26] dawned upon His soul—not on His mind, for the revelation was far greaterthan that. He saw still further into the meaning of divinity than had everbefore seemed possible; the world of meaning and the world of phenomena fadedout and—esoterically speaking—He lost His all. For the time being, neither theenergy of the creative mind nor the energy of love were left to Him. He wasbereft of all that had made life bearable and full of meaning. A new type ofenergy became available—the energy of life itself, imbued with purpose andactuated by intention . But it was new and unknown and hitherto unrealised. Forthe first time, the relation of the will which had hitherto expressed itself inHis life through love and the creative work of inaugurating the new dispensationbecame clear to Him. At this point, He passed through the Gethsemane ofrenunciation. The greater, the larger and the more inclusive was revealed to Himand all that hitherto seemed so vital and important was lost to sight in thegreater vision. It is this living realisation of Being and of identificationwith the divine intention of God Himself, the Father, the Lord of the World uponlevels of awareness of which we know nothing (as yet) which constituted theunfolding awareness of the Christ upon the Way of the Higher Evolution. This WayHe treads today and He began to tread it in Palestine two thousand years ago. Heknew , in a sense hitherto unknown to Him, what God intended and what humandestiny meant, and the part that He had to play in the working out of thatdestiny. We have paid little attention down the centuries of human thinking toChrist’s reaction to His own destiny, as it affected the human. We have paidsmall attention to the aspect of His reaction to knowledge, as it unfoldeditself to [27] Him. We have been selfish and grasping in our reaction to Hiswork and sacrifice.The word to “know” (in relation to the initiate-consciousness of the Christ andof still lesser initiates) concerns the certainty of the knowledge the initiatehas gained through experiment, experience and expression. The first faint tremorof reaction to monadic “destiny” and to the widespread universal influence a Sonof God can exert makes itself felt in the consciousness of the Christ—as it willin the consciousness of all those who obey His injunction and arrive at theperfection which He pointed out as possible. The highest divine quality oraspect now makes itself felt in the life of the progressing Son of God; He knowsthe meaning of intelligence; He realises the significance of love and itsattractive quality. Now—because of these two recognitions—He becomes aware ofthe potency of will and of the reality of the divine intention which that willmust (at any cost) implement. This was the major crisis of the Christ.There are in the Gospel story (as testimony to this divinely progressingunfoldment) four recorded moments wherein this universal or monadic realisationshowed itself. Let us look at each one of them for a moment:1. There is, first of all, His statement to His parents in the Temple, “Wist yenot that I must be about my Father’s business?” We should note here that He wastwelve years old at the time and, therefore, the work with which He had beenoccupied (as a soul) was finished; twelve is the number of completed work, aswitness the twelve labours of Hercules, another Son of God. The symbolism of Histwelve years is now replaced by that of the twelve apostles, the symbol ofservice and sacrifice. He was also in the Temple of Solomon, which is the symbol[28] of the perfect life of the soul, just as the Tabernacle in the wildernessis the symbol of the imperfect ephemeral life of the transient personality;Christ was, therefore, speaking on soul levels and not only as the spiritual manon Earth. He was also serving, when He spoke these words, as a working Member ofthe Spiritual Hierarchy, for He was found by His parents teaching the priests,the Pharisees and the Sadducees. These points all indicate His recognition ofHis work as a World Teacher, becoming conscious, for the first time in Hisphysical brain, of divine intention or of the divine will.2. Next comes His statement to His disciples: “I must go up to Jerusalem,” afterwhich we read that He “steadfastly set His face to go” to that city. This wasthe intimation to them that He now had a new objective. The only place ofcomplete “peace” (which is the meaning of the name “Jerusalem”) is the “centrewhere the will of God is known.” The spiritual Hierarchy of our planet (theinvisible Church of Christ) is not a centre of peace but a very vortex of lovingactivity, the meeting place of energies coming from the centre of the divinewill, and from humanity, the centre of divine intelligence. Christ had orientedHimself to that divine centre which has, in the ancient Scriptures, been calledthe “place of serene determination and of poised, quiescent will.” Thisstatement marked a point of crisis and of determination in the life of Christ,and proved His progress towards divine fulfilment.3. Then in the Garden of Gethsemane He said, “Father, not My will but Thine bedone,” thus indicating His realisation of divine destiny. The meaning of thesewords is not (as is so often stated by Christian [29] theologians) a statementof acceptance of pain and of an unpleasant future and of death. It was anexclamation, evoked surely by His realisation of the universal implications ofHis mission and the intense focussing of His life in a universal sense. TheGethsemane experience was an experience uniquely possible only to those Sons ofGod Who have reached His rare point in evolution; it had no real relation to theCrucifixion episode, as the orthodox commentators emphasise.4. The final words of the Christ to His apostles were, “Lo, I am with you allthe days, even unto the end of the age” or cycle. (Matt. 28.20.) The importantword is “end.” The word used is the Greek “sun-teleia,” which means the end ofthe time period, with another immediately following after (what would be calledthe end of a cycle). In Greek the final end is another word “telos.” In Matt.24.6, “but the end is not yet,” the other word telos is used for it means “theend of the first period has not yet been reached.” Here He was speaking as theHead of the spiritual Hierarchy and expressing His divine will (at-one now withthe will of God) to inform and pervade continuously the world of men with Hisovershadowing consciousness. It was a tremendous affirmation, sent forth uponthe energy of His developed will, His all-inclusive love and His intelligentmind. This affirmation has made all things possible.It was also to the magnetic power of the will that Christ referred when He said,“I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto Me.” This had no reference to thecrucifixion but to the magnetic will of the Christ to draw all men, through thelife of the indwelling Christ in every heart, out of the world of materialvalues into the world of spiritual recognitions. It did not relate to death [30]but to life; it had no reference to the Cross but to the resurrection. In thepast, the keynote of the Christian religion has been death, symbolised for us inthe death of Christ and much distorted by St. Paul in his effort to blend thenew religion which Christ brought with the old blood religion of the Jews. Inthe cycle which Christ will inaugurate after His reappearance, the goal of allthe religious teaching in the world will be the resurrection of the spirit inmankind; the emphasis will be upon the livingness of the Christ nature in everyhuman being, and upon the use of the will in bringing about this livingtransfiguration of the lower nature. The proof of it will be the risen Christ.This “Way of Resurrection” is the radiant Way, the lighted Way which leads fromone great expression of divinity in man to another; it is the way whichexpresses the light of the intelligence, the radiant substance of true love, andthe inflexible will which permits of no defeat or withdrawal. These are thecharacteristics which will be declarative of the Kingdom of God.Today, humanity stands at a peculiar and unique middle point, between an unhappypast and a future which is full of promise if the reappearance of the Christ isrecognised and preparation for His coming is undertaken. The present is full ofpromise and also full of difficulty; in the hands of human beings today and inthe immediate present, lies the destiny of the world and—if it may be reverentlysaid—the immediate activity of the Christ. The agony of the war, and thedistress of the entire human family led Christ, in the year 1945, to come to agreat decision—a decision which found expression in two most importantstatements. He announced to the assembled spiritual Hierarchy and to all Hisservants and disciples on Earth that He had decided to emerge again intophysical contact with humanity, if they would bring [31] about the initialstages of establishing right human relations; secondly, He gave to the world(for the use of the “man in the street”) one of the oldest prayers ever known,but one which hitherto had not been permitted to be used except by the mostexalted, spiritual Beings. He used it Himself for the first time, we are told,at the time of the Full Moon of June, 1945, which is recognised as the Full Moonof the Christ, just as the Full Moon of May is that of the Buddha. It was noteasy to translate these ancient phrases (so ancient that they are without dateor background of any kind) into modern words, but it has been done, and thegreat Invocation, which may eventually become the world prayer, was pronouncedby Him and taken down by His disciples. It has been translated as follows:From the point of Light within the Mind of GodLet light stream forth into the minds of men.Let Light descend on Earth.From the point of Love within the Heart of GodLet love stream forth into the hearts of men.May Christ return to Earth.From the centre where the Will of God is knownLet purpose guide the little wills of men—The purpose which the Masters know and serve.From the centre which we call the race of menLet the Plan of Love and Light work out.And may it seal the door where evil dwells.Let Light and Love and Power restore the Plan on Earth.Its extraordinary potency can be seen in the fact that hundreds of thousands ofpeople are already using it day by day and many times a day; it is (1947)translated [32] into eighteen different languages and used by people in allthose languages; in the jungles of Africa, groups of natives are using it and itcan be seen on the desks of great executives in our major cities; it goes forthover the radio in Europe and in America and there is no country or island in theworld where its use is unknown. All this has taken place in the space ofeighteen months.This new Invocation, if given widespread distribution, can be to the new worldreligion what the Lord’s Prayer has been to Christianity and the 23rd Psalm hasbeen to the spiritually minded Jew. There are three approaches to this greatPrayer or Invocation:1. That of the general public.2. That of the esotericists, or of the aspirants and the disciples of the world.3. That of the Members of the Hierarchy.First, the general public will regard it as a prayer to God Transcendent. Theywill not recognise Him yet as immanent in His creation; they will send it forthon the wings of hope—hope for light and love and peace, for which theyceaselessly long. They will also regard it as a prayer for the enlightenment ofall rulers and leaders in all groups who are handling world matters; as a prayerfor the inflow of love and understanding among men, so that they may live inpeace with one another; as a demand for the working out of the will of God—awill of which they can know nothing and which ever seems to them so inscrutableand so all-inclusive that their normal reaction is patience and a willingness torefrain from questioning; as a prayer for the strengthening of humanresponsibility in order that the recognised evils of today—which so distress and[33] trouble mankind—may be done away with and some vague source of evil may beharnessed. They will regard it finally as a prayer that some equally vagueprimeval condition of blissful happiness may be restored and all unhappiness andpain disappear from the earth. This is, for them, entirely good and helpful andall that is immediately possible.Secondly, esotericists, aspirants and spiritually minded people will have adeeper and more understanding approach. To them it will convey the recognitionof the world of causes and of Those Who stand subjectively behind world affairs,the spiritual Directors of our life. They stand ready to strengthen those withtrue vision, ready to indicate not only the reason for events in the variousdepartments of human living, but also to make those revelations which willenable humanity to move forward out of darkness into light. With thisfundamental attitude, the necessity for a widespread expression of theseunderlying facts will be apparent and an era of spiritual propaganda, engineeredby disciples and carried forward by esotericists, will mature. This era began in1875 when the fact of the existence of the Masters of the Wisdom was proclaimed.It has been carried forward in spite of misrepresentation, attack upon theconcept, and scorn. Recognition of the substantial nature of the availableevidence and the appearance of an intuitive response by occult students and manyof the intelligentsia throughout the world has been helpful.A new type of mystic is coming to be recognised; he differs from the mystics ofthe past by his practical interest in current world affairs and not in religiousand church matters only; he is distinguished by his lack of interest in his ownpersonal development, by his ability to see God immanent in all faiths and notjust in his own [34] particular brand of religious belief, and also by hiscapacity to live his life in the light of the divine Presence. All mystics havebeen able to do this to a greater or less degree, but the modern mystic differsfrom those in the past in that he is able clearly to indicate to others thetechniques of the Path ; he combines both head and heart, intelligence andfeeling, plus an intuitive perception, hitherto lacking. The clear light of theSpiritual Hierarchy now illumines the way of the modern mystic, and not simplythe light of his own soul; this will be increasingly the case.Thirdly, both of these groups—the general public and the world aspirants intheir varying degrees—have, among them those who stand out from the generalaverage as possessing a deeper insight and understanding; they occupy ano-man’s-land, intermediate on the one hand between the masses and theesotericists and, on the other, between the esotericists and the Members of theHierarchy. Forget not, They also use this great Invocation and that not a daygoes by that the Christ Himself does not sound it forth.On the surface, the beauty and the strength of this Invocation lie in itssimplicity and in its expression of certain central truths which all men,innately and normally, accept—the truth of the existence of a basic Intelligenceto Whom we vaguely give the name of God ; the truth that, behind all outerseeming, the motivating power of the universe is love ; the truth that a greatIndividuality came to earth, called by Christians the Christ , and embodied thatlove so that we could understand; the truth that both love and intelligence areeffects of what is called the will of God, and finally the self-evident truththat only through humanity itself can the divine Plan work out.[35] This Plan calls mankind to the expression of Love and challenges men to“let their light shine.” Then comes the final solemn demand that this Plan ofLove and Light, working through mankind, may “seal the door where evil dwells.”The final line then contains the idea of restoration , indicating the keynotefor the future and that the day will come when God’s original idea and Hisinitial intention will no longer be frustrated by human free will and evil—purematerialism and selfishness; the divine purpose will then, through the changedhearts and goals of humanity, be achieved.This is the obvious and simple meaning and it ties in with the spiritualaspiration of all men everywhere.The use of this Invocation or Prayer and the rising expectancy of the coming ofthe Christ hold out the greatest hope for mankind today. If this is not so, thenprayer is no use and only an hallucination, and the Scriptures of the world,with their proved forecasting. are useless and deceiving. The testimony of theages proves that none of this is so . Prayer always is answered and always hasbeen; great Sons of God have ever come on humanity’s demand and always will, andHe for Whom all men wait today is on His way."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE - THE REAPPEARANCE OF THE CHRISTWorld Expectancy[36] God Transcendent, greater, vaster and more inclusive than His createdworld, is universally recognised and has been generally emphasised; all faithscan say with Shri Krishna (speaking as God, the Creator) that “having pervadedthe whole universe with a fragment of Myself, I remain.” This God Transcendenthas dominated the religious thinking of millions of simple and spirituallyminded people down the centuries which have elapsed since humanity began topress forward towards divinity.Slowly, there is dawning upon the awakening consciousness of humanity, the greatparalleling truth of God Immanent—divinely “pervading” all forms, conditioningfrom within all kingdoms in nature, expressing innate divinity through humanbeings and—two thousand years ago—portraying the nature of that divine Immanencein the Person of the Christ. Today, as an outcome of this unfolding divinePresence, there is entering into the minds of men everywhere a new concept: thatof “Christ in us, the hope of glory.” (Col. 1.27.) There is a growing anddeveloping belief that Christ is in us, as He was in the Master Jesus, and thisbelief will alter world affairs and mankind’s entire attitude to life.The wonder of that life, lived two thousand years ago, is still with us and haslost none of its freshness; it is an eternal inspiration, hope, encouragementand example. The love He demonstrated still holds the thinking world [37] inthrall, even though relatively few have really attempted to demonstrate the samequality of love as He did—a love that leads unerringly to world service, tocomplete self-forgetfulness and to radiant, magnetic living. The words He spokewere few and simple and all men can understand them, but their significance hasbeen largely lost in the intricate legalities and discussions of St. Paul, andin the lengthy disputation of theological commentators since Christ lived andleft us—or apparently left us.Yet—today Christ is nearer to humanity than at any other time in human history;He is closer than the most aspiring and hopeful disciple knows, and can drawcloser still if what is here written is understood and brought to the attentionof men everywhere. For Christ belongs to humanity, to the world of men, and notalone to the churches and religious faiths throughout the world.Around Him—in that High Place on Earth where He has His abiding place—aregathered today all His great Disciples, the Masters of the Wisdom, and all Thoseliberated Sons of God Who, down the ages, have passed from darkness to Light,from the unreal to the Real, and from death to Immortality. They stand ready tocarry out His bidding and to obey Him, the Master of all the Masters and theTeacher alike of Angels and of men. The Exponents and the Representatives of allthe world faiths are there waiting, under His guidance, to reveal to all thosewho today struggle in the maelstrom of world affairs, and who seek to solve theworld crisis, that they are not alone . God Transcendent is working through theChrist and the Spiritual Hierarchy to bring relief; God Immanent in all men isstanding on the verge of certain stupendous Recognitions.The great Apostolic Succession of the Knowers of God is poised today for renewedactivity—a succession [38] of Those Who have lived on Earth, accepted the factof God Transcendent, discovered the reality of God Immanent, portrayed in Theirown lives the divine characteristics of the Christ life and (because They livedon Earth as He did and does) have “entered for us within the veil, leaving us anexample that we too should follow His steps” and Theirs. We too belongeventually in that great succession.The Buddha Himself is standing behind the Christ in humble recognition of thedivine task which He is on the verge of consummating, and because of theimminence of that spiritual accomplishment. Not only are all those who arefunctioning consciously in the Kingdom of God aware of His Plans, but thosegreat spiritual Beings Who live and dwell in the “Father’s House,” in the“centre where the will of God is known,” are also mobilised and organised toassist His work. The spiritual line of succession from the throne of the Ancientof Days down to the humblest disciple (gathered with others at the feet of theChrist) is today focussed on the task of helping humanity.The great moment for which He has so patiently waited has almost arrived; the“end of the age” to which He referred when speaking to His small group ofdisciples: “Lo! I am with you all the days even unto the end of the age” hascome. Today He stands and waits, knowing that the hour has come when He will“see of the travail of His soul and be satisfied.” (Is. LIII.11.)Right through the spiritual succession of the Sons of God, there is naught to beseen and felt but expectancy and preparation. “The Hierarchy waits.” It has doneall that is possible from the angle of the present opportunity. The Christstands in patient silence, attentive to the effort that will make His workmaterialise on Earth [39] and enable Him to consummate the effort He made 2000years ago in Palestine. The Buddha hovers over the planet, ready to play Hispart if the opportunity is offered to Him by mankind. Everything now dependsupon the right action of the men of goodwill.From the Father’s House (the “centre where the will of God is known” orShamballa of the esotericist) the fiat has gone forth: The hour has come. Fromthe Kingdom of God where reigns the Christ, the answer has been flung back:“Father, Thy will be done.” Down in our struggling, bewildered, unhappy world ofmen, the cry is ceaselessly rising: “May Christ return to Earth.” For the threegreat spiritual centres: the Father’s House, the Kingdom of God, and awakeningHumanity, there is but one purpose, one idea and one united expectancy.It is essential that today there should be a measure of fuller knowledgeconcerning the “centre where the will of God is known.” The public shouldpossess some understanding of this highest spiritual centre to which—if webelieve the Gospel story—Christ Himself was always attentive. Frequently we readin The New Testamen t that “the Father spoke to Him” or that “He heard a Voice,”unheard by others, or that the words were heard, “this is my beloved Son.”Several times, we read, the seal of affirmation (as it is spiritually called)was given to Him. Only the Father, the planetary Logos, the “One in Whom we liveand move and have our being” (Acts XVII.28), the Lord of the World, the Ancientof Days (Dan. VII.9) can speak this final affirmative word. There are, as wellwe know, five crises or initiations which concern the Master Jesus—the Birth atBethlehem, the Baptism, the Transfiguration, the Crucifixion and theResurrection—but lying behind this obvious and practical teaching, lies anundercurrent or thought of something much higher [40] and of greaterimportance—the affirmative Voice of the Father, recognising that which theChrist has done.When Christ completes the work during the next two thousand years which Heinaugurated two thousand years ago, that affirmative Voice will surely again beheard and divine recognition of His coming will be accorded. Then the Christwill take that stupendous initiation of which we know nothing except that twodivine aspects will blend and fuse in Him (love-wisdom in full manifestation,motivated by divine will or power). Then the Buddha and the Christ will togetherpass before the Father, the Lord of the World, will together see the glory ofthe Lord and eventually pass to higher service of a nature and a calibre unknownto us.I write here in no fanatical or adventist spirit; I speak not as a speculativetheologian or an exponent of one phase of religious, wishful thinking. I speakbecause many know that the time is ripe and that the appeal of simple, faithfulhearts has penetrated to the highest spiritual sphere and set in motion energiesand forces which cannot now be stopped. The invocative cry of distressedhumanity is today of such a volume and sound that—united to the wisdom and theknowledge of the Spiritual Hierarchy—it has given rise to certain activities inthe Father’s House. These will result in the glory of God, in the transformationof the divine will-to-good into human goodwill, and resultant peace on Earth.A new chapter in the great book of spiritual living is about to be written; anew expansion of consciousness is an imminent happening; a fresh recognition ofdivine attentiveness is now possible to humanity and a revealing expectancy willprove the accuracy of the Biblical statement, “every eye shall see Him.” (Rev.1.7.) The religious livingness or spiritual history of mankind can be [41]summarised for us by a series of recognitions—recognition of Those Who, down theages, have constituted the Apostolic Succession, culminating for us in the greatreligious leaders who have come out among us since 700 B.C. and founded thegreat modern world faiths, and—above all else—in the Christ Himself Who embodiedthe perfection of God Immanent, plus awareness of God Transcendent; recognitionof those major spiritual concepts of love, life and relationship which havehovered ever in the background of man’s thinking and which are now on the vergeof right expression; recognition of the true brotherhood of man, based on theone divine life, working through the one soul and expressing itself through theone humanity; recognition, therefore, of relationship both to the divine lifethroughout the world and to mankind itself. It is this developing spiritualattitude which will lead to right human relations and eventual world peace.Today, another recognition is becoming possible. It is the recognitioneverywhere of the imminent return of Christ (if such a phrase can be true ofsomeone Who has never left us!) and of the new spiritual opportunities whichthis event will make possible.The basis for this recognition lies in the deep-seated conviction, innate in thehuman consciousness, that some great Teacher, some Saviour, Revealer, Lawgiveror divine Representative must come forth from the world of spiritual realities,because of human need and human demand. Always down the centuries, at the hourof man’s greatest need and in response to his voiced demand, a divine Son of Godhas come forth and under many different names. Then the Christ came andapparently left us, with His work unfinished and His vision for mankind not yetconsummated. For two thousand years it has seemed as if all His work had beenblocked, frustrated, [42] and of no avail, for the growth of the churches duringthe centuries is no guarantee of the spiritual success at which He aimed. Itneeded more than theological interpretations and the numerical growth of theworld religions (including Christianity and Buddhism) to prove His world missionsuccessfully carried forward. It all seemed impossible, necessitating threeconditions; under these a test of His work could be attempted; today these threeconditions are proven facts. First, as we have seen, a general planetarycondition which has unfortunately (owing to man’s selfishness) proved to be socatastrophic in nature that humanity has been forced to recognise the cause andsource of the disaster; secondly, a spiritual awakening which would have itsimpulse in the deepest depths of man’s consciousness and such is the case todayas a result of the World War (1914-1945); thirdly, a steadily mountinginvocative cry, prayer or demand, directed toward high spiritual sources, nomatter by what name such sources may be called.Today, these three conditions have been fulfilled and humanity faces renewedopportunity. The disaster which has overtaken mankind is universal andwidespread; no one has escaped and all men are involved in some way oranother—physically, economically or socially. The spiritual awakening of meneverywhere (within or without the world faiths, and largely outside of them) isgeneral and complete and a turning to God is to be seen on every hand. Finallythese two causes have aroused—as never before—the invocative cry of humanity; itis clearer, purer and more selfless than at any other time in human historybecause it is based on clearer thinking and a common distress. True religion isagain emerging in the hearts of men in every land; this recognition of a divinehope and background may possibly take people back [43] into the church and intothe world faiths, but it will most certainly take them back to God.Religion is the name, surely, which we give to the invocative appeal of humanitywhich leads to the evocative response of the Spirit of God. This Spirit works inevery human heart and in all groups. It works also through the SpiritualHierarchy of the planet. It impels the Head of the Hierarchy, the Christ, totake action and the action which He is taking will lead to His return with Hisdisciples.The idea of the return of Christ is a most familiar one, and the concept of theSon of God returning in response to human need has its place in the teaching ofthe majority of the world faiths. Ever since He apparently departed to thesphere where the faithful have put Him, little groups of these people havereasoned themselves into the belief that on such and such a date He will comeback, and ever their prophecies and expectancies have been doomed to failure. Hehas not come. Such people have been laughed at by the crowd and rebuked by theintelligent. Their eyes have not seen Him and there has been no tangibleindication of His Presence. Today, thousands know that He will come; that plansfor His coming are already set on foot, but they set no date or hour . The timeis known only to the two or three, but “in such an hour as ye think not, He willcome.” (Matt. XXIV.44.)A truth hard for the orthodox thinker of any faith to accept is the fact thatChrist cannot return because He has always been here upon our Earth , watchingover the spiritual destiny of humanity; He has never left us but, in physicalbody and securely concealed (though not hidden), He has guided the affairs ofthe Spiritual Hierarchy, of His disciples and workers Who are unitedly pledgedwith Him to Earth service. He can only re-appear. [44] It is a spiritual factthat those who have passed from the cave of the tomb into the fullness of theresurrection life can be seen and at the same time evade the vision of thebeliever. Seeing and recognition are two very different things, and one of thegreat recognitions of mankind in the near future is the recognition that alwaysHe has been with us, sharing with us the familiar usefulness and peculiarcharacteristics of our civilisation and its many gifts to man.The early signs of His approach with His disciples can already be discerned bythose who note and rightly interpret the signs of the times. There is (amongthese signs) the coming together spiritually of those who love their fellowmen.This is in reality the organising of the outer physical army of the Lord—an armywhich has no weapons but those of love, of right speech and right humanrelations. This unknown organisation has proceeded with phenomenal speed duringthe aftermath of war, because humanity is sick of hate and controversy.The general staff of the Christ is already active in the form of the New Groupof World Servers; they are as potent a body of forerunners as has ever precededa great world Figure into the arena of mankind’s living. Their work andinfluence is already seen and felt in every land, and nothing can destroy thatwhich they have accomplished. The spiritual and organising effect of expressedand voiced invocation has been also attempted since 1935, and the energy of theinvocative cry of humanity has been directed into those channels which reachfrom Earth to that High Place where dwells the Christ. From there, it has beentransmitted to those still higher spheres where the attention of the Lord of theWorld, the Ancient of Days, the Father of all, plus the Creative Energies andLiving Beings Who dwell there with Him, [45] can be focussed on humanity andthose steps can be taken which will embody more rapidly the Purposes of God.For the first time in human history, the demand of the people of the Earth is sopotent and so in line with divine direction, in time and space, that the end isinevitably sure; the looked-for spiritual Representative must come forth; thistime He will not come alone but will be accompanied by Those Whose lives andwords will evoke recognition in every department of human thinking. The symbolicprophecies found in all the world Scriptures anent this imminent event willprove their veracity; their symbolism will nevertheless elicitre-interpretation; circumstances and happenings will not necessarily be exactlyas the Scriptures would appear to indicate. For instance, He will come indeed inthe “clouds of the air” (Matt. XXVI.64), as the Christian Scriptures say, but ofwhat great interest is that when millions come and go in the clouds, each hourof the day and of the night? I mention this as one of the outstanding propheciesand one of the most familiar; it is, however, one which means little in ourmodern civilisation. The fact of importance is that He will come.The Wesak Festival has been held down the centuries in the well-known valley inthe Himalayas (if the faithful would only believe it) in order:1. To substantiate the fact of Christ’s physical existence among us ever sinceHis so-called departure.2. To prove (on the physical plane) the factual solidarity of the Eastern andWestern approaches to God. Both the Christ and the Buddha are present.3. To form a rallying-point and a meeting-place for those who annually—insynthesis and symbolically—link up and represent the Father’s House, the Kingdomof God and Humanity. [46]4. To demonstrate the nature of the work of Christ as the great and chosenIntermediary, standing as the Representative of the Spiritual Hierarchy and asthe Leader of the New Group of World Servers. In His Person, He voices theirdemand for the recognition of the factual existence of the Kingdom of God hereand now.Perhaps one of the major messages for all of us who read these words is thisgreat truth and fact of the physical Presence on Earth at this time of theChrist, of His group of disciples and executives, of Their representativeactivities on behalf of mankind and of Their close relationship. Thisrelationship comes out at certain of the great spiritual festivals where therelationship demonstrated includes not only the Kingdom of God but also theFather and the Father’s Home. There is the Festival of Easter, the Festival ofthe Buddha Who in physical Presence expresses the spiritual solidarity of ourplanet, and the Festival in June, peculiarly the Festival of the Christ, whenHe—as leader of the New Group of World Servers—employs the new Invocation onbehalf of all men of goodwill in all lands; at the same time, He gathers up theinchoate and unexpressed demands of those masses who seek a new and better wayof life. They want love in daily living, right human relations and anunderstanding of the underlying Plan.It is these physical happenings which are of moment and not the vague hopes andpromises of the theological faiths. It is the physical Presence upon our planetof such recognised spiritual figures as the Lord of the World, the Ancient ofDays; the seven Spirits Who are before the throne of God; the Buddha, thespiritual leader of the East, and the Christ, the spiritual leader of theWest—all of Whom are brought at this climaxing time to our attention. The vaguebelief in Their existence, the dreamy [47] speculations as to Their work andTheir interest in human welfare, and the unconvinced, yet hopeful, wishfulthinking of believers (and also unbelievers), will soon give place to certainknowledge, to visual recognition, to provable signs of executive work and to thereorganisation (by men of unusual potency) of the political, religious, economicand social life of humanity.All this will not come as the result of some proclamation or some stupendousplanetary event which will force human beings everywhere to say: “Lo: He isthere! Lo: Here are the signs of His divinity!” for that would evoke onlyantagonism and laughter, resistance or fanatical credulity.It will come as a recognition of potency in leadership, through dynamic butlogical changes in world affairs, and through action taken by the masses of thepeople from the depths of their own consciousness.Many years ago, I indicated that the Christ would come in three ways, or rather,that the fact of His Presence could be proved in three distinctive phases.It was pointed out then that the first move which the Christ would make would bethe stimulation of the spiritual consciousness in man, the evocation ofhumanity’s spiritual demands on a large scale and the nurturing—on a worldwidescale—of the Christ consciousness in the human heart. This has already been doneand with most effective results. Of the factual nature of this process, thevociferous demands of men of goodwill, of welfare workers and of those pledgedto international cooperation, to the relief of the world distress and to theestablishment of right human relations, are the undeniable expression. Thatphase of the preparatory work which is indicative of His coming has now reacheda stage where nothing can arrest its progress or slow down its momentum. In [48]spite of appearances, this uprising of the Christ consciousness has beensuccessful and what may appear as reverse activity is of no importance in thelong run, but is only of a temporary nature.The second indicated move of the Hierarchy would be the impressing of the mindsof enlightened men everywhere by spiritual ideas embodying the new truths, bythe “descent” (if I may so call it) of the new concepts which will govern humanliving and by the overshadowing of all world disciples and the New Group ofWorld Servers by the Christ Himself. This planned move of the Hierarchy isprogressing well; men and women everywhere and in every department of life areenunciating those new truths which should in the future guide human living; theyare building those new organisations, movements and groups—large or small—whichwill familiarise the mass of men with the reality of the need and the mode ofmeeting it. This they are doing because they are driven thereto by the warmth oftheir hearts and by their loving response to human distress; without formulatingit thus to themselves, they are, nevertheless, working to bring into visibilitythe Kingdom of God on Earth. No denial of these facts is possible, in view ofthe multiplicity of organisations, books and speeches.Thirdly we are told that Christ might come in Person and walk among men as Hedid before. This has not yet taken place but plans are being laid which willenable Him to do so. Those plans do not involve the birth of some nice child insome nice home on Earth; they will not produce the wild claims and the credulousrecognition of the well-meaning and the unintelligent as is so frequently thecase today, nor will someone appear and say: “This is the Christ. He is here orHe is there.” I would point out to you, however, that the widespread appearance[49] of such tales and claims, though undesirable, misleading and wrong,nevertheless demonstrates human expectancy of the imminence of His coming.Belief in His coming is basic in the human consciousness. How He will come andin what manner is not yet stated. The exact moment has not yet arrived nor hasthe method of His appearance been determined. The factual nature of the twoearlier and preparatory moves, already made by the Hierarchy under Hisdirection, are the guarantee that He will come and that when He does, mankindwill be ready.Let us summarise certain aspects of the work He set in motion two thousand yearsago, because they hold the clue to His future work. Some of it is well known toyou, for it has been emphasised by the world faiths and particularly by teachersof the Christian faith. But all of them have made His work appear difficult forman to grasp, and the undue emphasis laid upon His divinity (an emphasis whichHe Himself never made) has made it appear that He and He only and no one elsecould possibly do the same works. Theologians have forgotten that He Himselfstated that “greater things shall ye do, because I go unto my Father.” (JohnXIV.12.) He here indicates that this passing to the Father’s House would resultin such an inflow of spiritual strength, insight and creative accomplishment forman, that their deeds would surpass His; because of the distortion of Histeaching and its remote relation to man, we have not yet done those “greaterthings.” Some day, we assuredly will and—along certain lines—we already have.Let me relate some of the things He did which we can do, and which He will aid.1. For the first time in human history, the love of God was embodied in a manand Christ inaugurated the era of love. That expression of divine love is stillin the [50] making; the world is not yet full of love and few there are whounderstand the true meaning of the word. But—speaking symbolically—when theUnited Nations has emerged into factual and actual power, the welfare of theworld will then be assured. What is that welfare but love in action? What isinternational cooperation but love on a world scale? Those are the things whichthe love of God in Christ expressed and those are the things which we areworking here today to bring into being. We are attempting to do it on a vastscale and this in spite of opposition—an opposition which can only temporarilysucceed, such is the potency of the awakened spirit of man. These are the thingswhich the Hierarchy, in its already successful procedures, is aiding and willcontinue to aid.2. Christ taught also that the Kingdom of God was on Earth and told us to seekthat Kingdom first and let all things be of secondary importance for its sake.That Kingdom has ever been with us, composed of all those who down the ages,have sought spiritual goals, liberated themselves from the limitations of thephysical body, emotional controls and the obstructive mind. Its citizens arethose who today (unknown to the majority) live in physical bodies, work for thewelfare of humanity, use love instead of emotion as their general technique, andcompose that great body of “illumined Minds” which guides the destiny of theworld. The Kingdom of God is not something which will descend on Earth when manis good enough! It is something which is functioning efficiently today anddemanding recognition. It is an organised body which is already evokingrecognition from those people who do seek first the Kingdom of God, and discoverthereby that the Kingdom they seek is already here. Christ and His disciples areknown by many to be [51] physically present on Earth and the Kingdom which Theyrule, with its laws and modes of activity, is familiar to many and has beenthroughout the centuries.Christ is the world Healer and Saviour. He works because He is the embodied soulof all Reality. He works today, as He worked in Palestine two thousand yearsago, through groups. There He worked through the three beloved disciples,through the twelve apostles, through the chosen seventy, and the interested fivehundred.... Now He works through His Masters and Their groups, and therebygreatly intensifies His efforts. He can and will work through all groups justinsofar as they fit themselves for planned service, for the distribution oflove, and come into conscious alignment with the great potency of the innergroups.Those groups who have always proclaimed the physical Presence of the Christ haveso distorted the teaching by dogmatic assertions on unimportant details and byridiculous claims that they have evoked little recognition of the underlyingtruth, nor have they portrayed a kingdom which is attractive. That Kingdomexists but is not a place of disciplines or golden harps, peopled byunintelligent fanatics, but a field of service and a place where every man hasfull scope for the exercise of his divinity in human service.3. At the Transfiguration, Christ revealed the glory which is innate in all men.The triple lower nature—physical, emotional and mental—is there shown asprostrate before the glory which was revealed. In that moment, wherein ChristImmanent was in incarnation, wherein humanity was represented by the threeapostles, a voice came from the Father’s Home in recognition of the revealeddivinity and the Sonship of the Transfigured Christ. On this innate divinity,upon this recognised [52] Sonship, is the brotherhood of all men based—one life,one glory which shall be revealed, and one divine relationship. Today, on alarge scale (even when by-passing the implications of divinity), the glory ofman and his fundamental relationships are already a fact in the humanconsciousness. Accompanying those characteristics which as yet remain deplorableand which would appear to negate all claims to divinity, is the wonder of man’sachievement, of his triumph over nature. The glory of scientific attainment andthe magnificent evidence of creative art—both modern and ancient—leave no roomto question man’s divinity. Here then are the “greater things” of which Christspoke and here again is the triumph of the Christ within the human heart.Why this triumph of the Christ consciousness must always be spoken of in termsof religion, of church-going and of orthodox belief is one of the incredibletriumphs of the forces of evil. To be a citizen of the Kingdom of God does notmean that one must necessarily be a member of some one of the orthodox churches.The divine Christ in the human heart can be expressed in many differentdepartments of human living—in politics, in the arts, in economic expression andin true social living, in science and in religion. It might be wise here toremember that the only time it is recorded that Christ (as an adult) visited theTemple of the Jews, He created a disturbance! Humanity is passing from glory toglory and, in the long panorama of history, this is strikingly observable. Thatglory is today revealed in every department of human activity, and theTransfiguration of those who are on the crest of the human wave of civilisationis very close at hand.4. Finally, in the triumph of the Crucifixion or (as it is more accuratelycalled in the East) the Great Renunciation, [53] Christ, for the first time,anchored on Earth a tenuous thread of the divine Will as it issued from theFather’s House (Shamballa), passed into the understanding custody of the Kingdomof God and, through the medium of the Christ, was brought to the attention ofmankind. Through the instrumentality of certain great Sons of God, the threedivine aspects or characteristics of the divine Trinity—will, love andintelligence—have become a part of human thinking and aspiration. Christians areapt to forget that the crisis in the final hours of the Christ was not thatspent upon the Cross, but those spent in the Garden of Gethsemane. Then Hiswill—in agony and almost despair—was submerged in that of the Father. “Father,”He said, “not My will but Thine be done.” (Luke XXII.42.)Something new, yet planned for from the very depth of time, happened then inthat quiet garden; Christ, representing mankind, anchored or established theFather’s Will on Earth and made it possible for intelligent humanity to carry itout. Hitherto, that Will had been known in the Father’s House; it had beenrecognised and adapted to world need by the Spiritual Hierarchy, working underthe Christ, and thus took shape as the divine Plan. Today, because of whatChrist did in His moment of crisis hundreds of years ago, humanity can add itsefforts to the working out of that Plan. The will-to-good of the Father’s Housecan become the goodwill of the Kingdom of God and be transformed into righthuman relations by intelligent humanity. Thus the direct line or thread of God’swill reaches now from the highest place to the lowest point, and can in due timebecome a cable of ascension for the sons of men and of descent for the loving,living spirit of God.[54] Let us forget distance, remoteness and vagueness and realise that we aretalking of exact and literal happenings on our planet. We are dealing withrecognitions and occurrences and with factual events which are the consciouspossession of many. The Christ of history and the Christ in the human heart areplanetary facts.There is one aspect of this return of the Christ which is never touched upon andto which no reference is ever made. It is the factor of what this coming outagain among men, this return to outer everyday activity will mean to the Christas He faces it. How will He feel when the hour of His appearance arrives?There is a great initiation spoken of in The New Testament to which we havegiven the name of the Ascension. Of it we know nothing. Only a few items ofinformation are brought to us in the Gospel story; the fact of the mountain top,of attendant watchers, and of the words of Christ, assuring them that He was notleaving them. Then a cloud received Him out of their sight. (Acts I.9.) Therewere none present who could go further with Him. Their consciousness could notpenetrate to the place where He had chosen to go; they even misinterpreted Hiswords and only in a vague and mystical sense has humanity ever understood Hisdisappearance, or the significance of His persistent but unobserved Presence.The watchers were assured by two of the Knowers of God Who were also presentthat He would come again in like manner. He ascended. The cloud received Him;today the clouds which cover our planet are waiting to reveal Him.He is now waiting to descend. This descent into our unhappy world of men canpresent Him with no alluring picture. From the quiet mountain retreat where Hehas waited, guided and watched over humanity and where [55] He has trained Hisdisciples, initiates and the New Group of World Servers, He must come forth andtake His place prominently on the world stage; take His part in the great dramawhich is there being played. This time, He will play His part, not in obscurityas He previously did but before the eyes of the entire world. Because of thesmallness of our little planet, and because of the prevalence of the radio, oftelevision and the rapidity of communication, His part will be watched by alland the prospect must surely, for Him, hold certain horror, must present itstests and major adjustments, plus painful and unavoidable experience. He doesnot come as the omnipotent God of man’s ignorant creation, but as the Christ,the Founder of the Kingdom of God on Earth, to complete the work He started, andagain to demonstrate divinity in far more difficult circumstances.The Christ suffers, however, far more from those in His Own household than fromthose in the outer world; His work is more impeded by the advanced aspirant thanby the intelligent thinker. It was not the cruelty of the outer world of menwhich caused the depths of sorrow to the Christ; it was His Own disciples, plusthe massed sorrow—spread over the entire cycle of living—past, present andfuture—of humanity.He comes to correct the mistakes and the misrepresentations of those who havedared to interpret His simple words in terms of their own ignorance, and torecognise those whose faithful service has made His return possible. He too isfacing a major test, preparatory to a great initiation and when He has passedthe test and fulfilled His task, He will pass to a still more exalted positionin the Father’s House or to some distant place of service where only the mostexalted can follow Him; [56 ] His present position will then be taken by theOne Whom He has prepared and trained.But before all this can happen, He must again enter the public arena, play Hispart in world affairs, and prove the scope of His mission. He will gather roundHim, in the flesh, His chosen associates and advisors; these will not be theones who gathered around in those earlier simpler days but those members of ourhuman family who today recognise Him and are preparing to work with Him as faras in them lies. It is a different world to which He is now planning to returnand this is largely due to the intellectual development of the mass of men. Thispresents Him with stupendous difficulties, for the intellects of men must now bereached and not just their hearts (as in the earlier days) if the Will of God isto be intelligently carried out on Earth. His major task is surely theestablishing of right human relations in every department of human living. Iwould ask you to use your imagination and endeavour to think out what must bethe implications of the task which confronts Him; I would ask you to ponder onthe difficulties which He must inevitably face—the difficulty, above all, ofmass intellectual wrong emphasis.He, the Representative of the love of God, is asked to work again in the worldarena wherein His earlier message has been negated, forgotten or misinterpretedfor two thousand years, and wherein hate and separativeness have distinguishedall men everywhere. This will plunge Him into a foreign atmosphere and into asituation wherein all His divine resources will be needed, and will have to betried out to the uttermost. The generally accepted idea that He will return as atriumphant warrior, omnipotent and irresistible, has surely no basis in fact.That He will ultimately lead His people, humanity, [57] into Jerusalem is afact, founded on a secure foundation, but it will not be into a Jewish citycalled Jerusalem but into “the place of peace” (as the word “Jerusalem” means).A careful consideration of the world situation today and a dedicated use of theimagination will reveal to the sincere thinker how appalling is the task whichHe has undertaken. But He has again “set His face to go to Jerusalem.” (LukeIX.51.) He will re-appear and guide mankind into a civilisation and a state ofconsciousness in which right human relations and worldwide cooperation for thegood of all will be the universal keynote. He will—through the New Group ofWorld Servers and the men of goodwill—complete His association with the Will ofGod (His Father’s business) in such a manner that the eternal will-to-good willbe translated by humanity into goodwill and right relations. Then His task willbe done; He will be free again to leave us, but this time not to return but toleave the world of men in the hands of that great spiritual Server Who will bethe new Head of the Hierarchy, the Church Invisible.The question now arises: In what way can we be of service? How can we aid duringthis preparatory stage?What the members of the Spiritual Hierarchy are doing is much indeed; thosedisciples who are in conscious touch with the Masters of the Wisdom—or, if youprefer the term, with the senior disciples of the Christ—are working day andnight in order to establish such confidence, correct attitudes and anunderstanding of the divine spiritual “push” or enterprise that His way will bemade easier. They and their groups of lesser disciples, aspirants and studentsof the realities stand unitedly behind the Christ and can thus enable Him toaccomplish His purpose. Their major realisation is that of a cyclic crisis inthe spiritual life of our planet; it is one which [58] has been anticipated inthe Father’s House (Shamballa) for thousands of years. They have registered thefact that, for the first time in human history, all the three spiritual centresor groups through which God works are unitedly focussed on the same objective.Shamballa, the Spiritual Hierarchy and Humanity (the Father’s House, the Kingdomof God and the World of Men) are all striving in one vast movement for anintensification of the Light of the World. This Light will irradiate (in afashion unknown before) not only the Father’s House, which is the source of allour planetary light but also the spiritual centre from which have come all thoseTeachers and World Saviours Who have stood before men and said, as did Hermes,the Buddha and the Christ: “I am the Light of the World.” This light will nowflood the world of men, bringing illumination to men’s minds and light into thedark places of human living.It is light and—above all else—“life more abundantly” which Christ will bring,and until He brings it we know not what it signifies; we cannot realise therevelation which this will entail and the new possibilities which will open upbefore us. But through Him, light and life are on their way, to be interpretedand applied in terms of goodwill and of right human relations. For this theSpiritual Hierarchy is preparing. This time the Christ will not come alone forHis co-workers will come with Him. His experience and Theirs will be the reverseof the previous one, for this time every eye will see Him, every ear will hearHim and every mind will pass judgment upon Him.We can freely aid in the reconstruction work which the Christ proposes, if wewill familiarise ourselves and all men whom we can contact with the followingfacts:1. That the reappearance of Christ is imminent. [59]2. That the Christ, immanent in every human heart, can be evoked in recognitionof His appearance.3. That the circumstances of His return are only symbolically related in theworld Scriptures; this may produce a vital change in the preconceived ideas ofhumanity.4. That the major required preparation is a world at peace; however, that peacemust be based on an educated goodwill, which will lead inevitably to right humanrelations, and, therefore, to the establishment (figuratively speaking) of linesof light between nation and nation, religion and religion, group and group andman and man.If we can succeed in presenting these four ideas to the world at large, and thusin overcoming the intelligent criticism that all that is said is too vague,prophetic, and visionary, we shall have done much. It is possible surely thatthe ancient truism that “the mind is the slayer of the real” may befundamentally true where the mass of humanity is concerned and that the purelyintellectual approach (which rejects the vision and refuses to accept theunprovable) may be far more at fault than the anticipation of the Knowers of Godand the expectant multitude.The intelligence of divinity is vested in the Spiritual Hierarchy, and thatHierarchy is today composed of Those Who have united in Themselves both theintellect and the intuition, the practical and the apparently impractical, thefactual way of life and way of the man who sees a vision. There are also peoplewho must be found in the market place of daily life; these are the people whomust be trained in the divine recognitions which are essentially physical planeresponses to the newer expansions of consciousness. The Christ Who will returnwill not be like the Christ Who (apparently) departed. He will not be a “man ofsorrows”; He will not be a silent pensive figure; He will be the enunciator ofspiritual statements which [60] will not necessitate interpretation and receivethe wrong interpretation, because He will be present to indicate the truemeaning.He has been for two thousand years the supreme Head of the Church Invisible, theSpiritual Hierarchy, composed of disciples of all faiths. He recognises andloves those who are not Christian but who retain their allegiance to TheirFounders—the Buddha, Mohammed and others. He cares not what the faith is if theobjective is love of God and of humanity. If men look for the Christ Who leftHis disciples centuries ago, they will fail to recognise the Christ Who is inprocess of returning. The Christ has no religious barriers in His consciousness.It matters not to Him of what faith a man may call himself.The Son of God is on His way and He cometh not alone. His advance guard isalready here and the Plan which they must follow is already made and clear. Letrecognition be the aim."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR - THE WORK OF THE CHRIST TODAY AND IN THE FUTURE[61] We have seen that the doctrine of great Appearances and of the coming ofAvatars or World Teachers or Saviours underlies all the world religions. ThroughThem, the continuity of revelation is implemented and humanity is enabled, eachsuccessive age, to take its next step forward along the Path of Evolution closerto God and that divine Centre in which the will of the One “in Whom we live andmove and have our being” (as St. Paul expressed it in Acts XVII.28) is focussed,understood and directed. We have touched upon the mission of two of theseAvatars—the Buddha, the Messenger of Light for the East, and the Christ, theMessenger of Love for the West—and Their work for the entire world; we have alsoconsidered the unique opportunity with which Christ is today faced and theresponse He made in 1945 when He signified His intention to reappear and gavethe great Invocation to us as an aid in the preparatory work with which we areimmediately confronted. It would seem appropriate at this point to consider thenature of the work which He will do and also the teaching which He will probablygive. The fact of the continuity of the revelation and teaching given down theages entitles us to a wise consideration and spiritual speculation upon theprobable lines which His work will take.Over the years, much has been given out from many sources, schools of thoughtand churches about the Christ, [62] the situation which He faces and theprobabilities as to His reappearance. Disciples, aspirants, and men of goodwillhave done much already to prepare the world for His so-called return. Today, theEast and the West stand equally expectant. As we approach the theme of His work,it is essential that we remember that the Eastern Teacher embodied in Himselfthe Wisdom of God, of which human intelligence (the third aspect of divinity) isan expression; that through Christ, the second divine aspect was revealed in itsperfection; and in Him two aspects, therefore, light and love, received fullexpression. It remains now for the highest of the divine aspects, the Will ofGod, to receive embodiment and for this the Christ is preparing. The continuityof revelation may not stop; and upon what other expressions of the divine naturemay still later be revealed it is needless for us to speculate.The uniqueness of the impending mission of the Christ and the uniqueness of Hisopportunity consist in the fact that He is able—in Himself—to give expression totwo divine energies: the energy of love and the energy of will, the magneticpotency of love and the dynamic effectiveness of the divine will. Never before,in the long long history of humanity, has such a revelation been possible.The work and the teaching of the Christ will be hard for the Christian world toaccept, though easier of assimilation in the East. Nevertheless, some hard blowor some difficult presentation of the truth is badly needed if the Christianworld is to be awakened, and if Christian people are to recognise their placewithin a worldwide divine revelation and see Christ as representing all thefaiths and taking His rightful place as World Teacher. He is the World Teacherand not a Christian teacher. He Himself told us that He had other folds and tothem He has meant [63] as much as He has meant to the orthodox Christian. Theymay not call Him Christ, but they have their own name for Him and follow Him astruly and faithfully as their Western brethren.Let us look for a moment at the erroneous interpretations given to the Gospelstory. The symbolism of that Gospel story—an ancient story-presentation oftenpresented down the ages, prior to the coming of the Christ in Palestine—has beentwisted and distorted by theologians until the crystalline purity of the earlyteaching and the unique simplicity of the Christ have disappeared in a travestyof errors and in a mummery of ritual, money and human ambitions. Christ ispictured today as having been born in an unnatural manner, as having taught andpreached for three years and then as having been crucified and eventuallyresurrected, leaving humanity in order to “sit on the right hand of God,” inaustere and distant pomp. Likewise, all the other approaches to God by any otherpeople, at any time and in any country, are regarded by the orthodox Christianas wrong approaches, as being practised by so-called “heathen,” and as requiringChristian interference. Every possible effort has been made to force orthodoxChristianity on those who accept the inspiration and the teachings of the Buddhaor of others who have been responsible for preserving the divine continuity ofrevelation. The emphasis has been, as we all well know, upon the “bloodsacrifice of the Christ” upon the Cross and upon a salvation dependent upon therecognition and acceptance of that sacrifice. The vicarious at-one-ment has beensubstituted for the reliance which Christ Himself enjoined us to place upon ourown divinity; the Church of Christ has made itself famous and futile (as theworld war proved) for its narrow creed, its wrong emphases, its clerical pomp,its spurious authority, [64] its material riches and its presentation of a deadChrist. His resurrection is accepted, but the major appeal of the churches hasbeen upon His death.Christ has been for two thousand years a silent, passive Figure, hidden behind amultitude of words written by a multitude of men (commentators and preachers).The church has pointed us to the dying Christ upon the Cross and not to theliving, working, active, present Christ Who has been with us in bodily Presence(according to His promise) for twenty centuries.Let us, therefore, endeavour to get a truer picture of Christ’s activities andlife and—consequently—of our future hope. Let us try and realise theever-present yet divine Person, laying His plans for the future helping ofhumanity, assessing His resources, influencing His disciples and organising thedetails which will attend His reappearance. We need to awaken faith in thefactual nature of divine revelation, and galvanise the church of Christ into atruer appreciation of Him and of His work. It is the living, acting, thinkingChrist with whom we must deal, remembering always that the Gospel story iseternally true and only needs re-interpreting in the light of its place in thelong succession of divine revelations. His Mission on earth two thousand yearsago is a part of that continuity and is not an extraordinary story, having norelation to the past, emphasising a period of only 33 years and presenting noclear hope for the future.What is the hope held out today by the orthodox and unimaginative theologians?That at some distant date, known only to the inscrutable will of God the Father,Christ will issue forth from His seat at the right hand of God, and (followed byHis angels and by the Church invisible) descending upon the clouds of Heaven, tothe sound of a trumpet, He will make an appearance in [65] Jerusalem. The battleraging at that time will then end, and He will enter the city of Jerusalem torule for one thousand years. During this millennium, Satan or the principle ofevil will be bound or imprisoned, and there will be a new heaven and new earth.Further than that, we are told nothing; humanity hopes for so much more that thepicture presented does not intrigue them.Behind this portrayal, if rightly interpreted, stands the human, the loving andthe divine Presence of the Christ, embodying divine love and wielding divinepower, directing His Church and establishing the Kingdom of God on Earth. Whatis this church of Christ? It is constituted of the sum total of all those inwhom the life of Christ or the Christ-consciousness is to be found or is inprocess of finding expression; it is the aggregation of all who love theirfellowmen, because to love one’s fellowmen is the divine faculty which makes usfull members of Christ’s community. It is not the accepting of any historicalfact or theological creed which places us en rapport with Christ. The citizensof the Kingdom of God are all those who are deliberately seeking the light andattempting (through self-imposed discipline) to stand before the One Initiator;this worldwide group (whether in the body or out of it) accepts the teachingthat “the sons of men are one”; they know that divine revelation is continuousand ever new, and that the divine Plan is working itself out on Earth.There are those today on Earth who know that through the instrumentality, theinspiration and the instruction of those sons of men who have wrought out theirdivinity in the crucible of daily human living the Kingdom of God will come intobeing; these Knowers now work actively, under the direct impression of theChrist, in leading humanity [66] from darkness to light and from death toimmortality.These are the great underlying truths which are distinctive of the Christ, ofthe Buddha, and of the Church of God, as it expresses itself in the East and inthe West; these are the only truths which matter. In the future, the eyes ofhumanity will be fixed upon Christ and not upon any such manmade institutions asthe Church and its dignitaries; Christ will be seen as He is in reality, workingthrough His disciples, through the Masters of the Wisdom and through Hisfollowers who toil unseen (and usually unrecognised) behind world affairs. Thesphere of His activity will be known to be the human heart and also the crowdedmarket places of the world, but not some stone edifice and not the pomp andceremony of any ecclesiastical headquarters.Our study of the future work of the Christ is necessarily based upon threeassumptions:1. That the reappearance of the Christ is inevitable and assured.2. That He is today and has been actively working—through the medium of thespiritual Hierarchy of our planet, of which He is the Head—for the welfare ofhumanity.3. That certain teachings will be given and certain energies will be released byHim in the routine of His work and coming. People are apt to forget that thecoming of the Christ necessitates a period of intensive preparation by Him; He,too, works under law and is subject to control from various sources—just as areall human beings, but in a much lesser degree.His reappearance is conditioned and determined by the reaction of humanityitself; by that reaction He must abide. His work is subject also to certainphases of spiritual [67] and cyclic timing and to impressions from sources to befound on higher levels than those upon which He normally works. Just as humanaffairs have effects upon His action, so great “determinations” and “profoundsettlements within the will of God” also have their effects. The human side ornature of the Christ, perfected and sensitive, responds to the invocation and tothe appeal of men; His divine side or nature is equally responsive to the impactof energies, issuing from “the centre where the will of God is known.” Betweenthese two, He has to make adjustment and bring about right timing. The bringingof good out of human so-called evil is no easy task; the vision of the Christ isso vast and His grasp of the Law of Cause and Effect, of Action and Reaction issuch that the arriving at right decision as to activity and time is no simpleone. Human beings are apt to look at all that happens, or that could happen,from the purely human and immediate angle; they have little understanding of theproblems, decisions and implications with which Christ is today faced. In these,His pledged disciples share. Their task is to develop “the mind that is inChrist” and as they do so, they will help make clear the way for “the coming ofHis feet,” as the Bible puts it (Heb. XII.13). Seeing life and events in thelight of the spiritual values, as He does, will facilitate the giving out of thenew teaching and will provide the skeleton structure of the new world religion,thus giving us a fresh view of divine intention and a living insight into theminds of Those Who implement the divine will and are the engineers of humanity’sfuture. Let us, therefore, try and appreciate not only the opportunity whichChrist has to help us (which is the usual presentation), but let us look also atthe crises and problems with which He is confronted as He faces the work whichHe must do.I. The Crises of the Christ[68] In the life of every disciple, particularly of those who face certain greatexpansions of consciousness, a point of crisis will come about. In that point ofcrisis, decisions are voluntarily or involuntarily made; having made them, thedisciple then stands at a point of tension , with the decision behind him andthe next step to be taken becoming clearer to his mental perception, andinfluencing his attitude to the future. When the work is done in the period oftension, then there comes what we might call the point of emergence . This isboth an emergence from and also an emergence into a field of experience.The Christ Himself is no exception to this threefold experience and—in orderthat we may understand more fully—let us apply these three phrases(inappropriate as they basically are) to the actions and the reactions of theChrist.There is no crisis for Him in the sense that crises exist for us; there is nostrain or stress attached to His point of tension; the parallel is, however,good enough to convey something to you of what has transpired within that stateof awareness which distinguishes the spiritual Hierarchy; to this state ofconsciousness we can give the name of “spiritual perception,” incontradistinction to the mental perception which is the human counterpart. Itmust be remembered that the point of crisis, producing the point of tension towhich the Christ may be regarded as voluntarily subjecting Himself is ahierarchical matter or event, because the entire Hierarchy is involved in thecrisis. The reason for this is simple: the Christ and His workers know only theexperience of group consciousness . A separative participation and attitude isunknown to [69] Them, for Their state of awareness is inclusive and in no wayexclusive.Using, therefore, human terminology in order to interpret the divine reactionsof the Christ and His disciples, it must be realised that the point of crisiswhich is responsible for hierarchical tension and for the eventual appearance orthe emergence of the Christ, lies behind the Christ; it is in the field of longpast experience. The consequent point of tension is now controlling the affairsof the spiritual Hierarchy and its many groups of workers. The “point ofdecision,” as it is called in all hierarchical circles, was reached during theperiod between the Full Moon of June, 1936, and the Full Moon of June, 1945. Thepoint of decision covered, therefore, nine years (a relatively brief time); itresulted in the decision arrived at by the Christ to re-appear or return tovisible Presence on Earth as soon as possible, and considerably earlier than hadbeen planned.This decision was necessarily made in consultation with the Lord of the World,the “Ancient of Days” of The Old Testament , and the “One in Whom we live andmove and have our being” of The New Testament. He is the Custodian of the Willof God. It was also made with the full understanding and cooperation of theMasters and the senior initiates. This was inevitably so, because Theirparticipation and help were imperative. They also necessarily had to be with Himin thought, and cooperating mentally, because His reappearance connotes a greathierarchical approach to humanity and a great spiritual event.The decision was, nevertheless, the decision of the Christ and marked not only apoint of crisis in His experience but a point of climax in His expression ofdivinity. With all reverence and within the bounds of our human [70]understanding, it must be remembered that there is nothing static in the entireevolutionary process of our planet or of the cosmos; there is naught but processand progress, a moving on, an increasing attainment and a mounting achievement.To this great law of the universe, even the Christ Himself is subject. In allreverence again, let it here be pointed out that He too has moved on in Hisexperience of divinity and is (if it may be so expressed) closer to the Fatherand to the One Universal Life than ever before. His comprehension and Hisapprehension of the Will of God is deeper and His fulfilment of that Will ismore in line with the divine Purpose than it was in Palestine two thousand yearsago. There has necessarily been (on the part of Christ) a growing perception ofthe intention of the divine Mind, as it is embodied in that Identity to Whom wegive the name of God .No longer need Christ, in agony say “Father, not my will but Thine be done”; Hehas today no personal will but only the will of His Father animates Him and theability to make decisions which are a full expression of that divine Will. It isdifficult to express His achievement in other words. Commentators have sought toexplain away and gloss over the Gethsemane experience of the Christ, and toattribute what appears as weakness to an upsurging of Christ’s humanity and,consequently, to a temporary submergence of His divine nature. They have beenforced into this position because of the prevalent theological dictum as toChrist’s divine perfection—an absolute, sovereign and ultimate perfection towhich He Himself never made the slightest claim. He is today nearer thatperfection than He ever was when before on Earth. It was this divine unfoldmentwhich made it possible for Him to make right choice, not only for Himself [71]but also for the spiritual Hierarchy, during the years of decision, prior toJune, 1945.Under the divine will, He had to reappear on Earth in visible Presence. He hadto preside over the materialisation of the Kingdom of God on Earth, and He hadto re-institute the Mysteries of Initiation in such a form that they would provethe basis of the new world religion. Above all, He had to reveal the nature ofthe will of God. That will is often regarded as a power by means of which thingsare done, situations are brought about, activities are instituted and plans areworked out, and often ruthlessly worked out. This general definition is theeasiest for men to formulate, because it is understood by them in terms of theirown self-will, the will to individual self-betterment. This type of will isselfish and misunderstood at first, but tends eventually to selflessness, asevolution carries out its beneficent task. Then the will is interpreted in termsof the hierarchical plan and the effort of the individual man becomes that ofnegating his original self-will, and seeking then to merge his will with that ofthe group—the group being itself an aspect of hierarchical effort. This is agreat step onward in orientation and will lead eventually to a change inconsciousness.It is at this stage that most aspirants today find themselves. However, the willis in reality something very different to these expressions of it which exist inthe human consciousness as men attempt to interpret the divine Will in terms oftheir present point in evolution. The clue to understanding is to be found inthe words, “blotting out all form.” When the lure of substance is overcome anddesire dies, then the attractive power of the soul becomes dominant, and theemphasis (so long laid upon [72] individual form and individual living andactivity) gives place to group form and group purpose. Then the attractive powerof the Hierarchy and of the Masters’ groups of disciples supersedes the lowerattractions and the lesser focal points of interest. When these then assumetheir rightful place in consciousness, then the dynamic pull of the Will Aspectof divinity can be felt—entirely unrelated to form or forms, or to groups or agroup.In the light of the Will of God, Christ made certain basic decisions anddetermined to carry them out in the relatively immediate future—the exact dateof His coming being known only to Him and a few of His senior workers; yet allof these future events lie hid in a certain fundamental decision of humanityitself. This decision is being arrived at through certain new trends in humanthinking, and will be the result of a subjective human reaction to the decisionalready arrived at by the Christ and the spiritual Hierarchy, the Churchinvisible.The motivation for this reappearance is complete and settled. It is clearlyperceived by the Christ. The work initiated by Him two thousand years ago mustbe completed; the new world religion must be inaugurated; the needs of ademanding, invocative humanity cannot be ignored; those steps which precede astupendous hierarchical initiation in which the Christ is the leadingParticipant must be taken; the events which are symptomatic of the “time of theend” may not be delayed.If one may venture to speak in such terms (reverent and symbolical), the rewardaccorded to the Christ, as He announced His decision as final and irrevocable,was the permission or rather the right to use a certain great Invocation—neverbefore granted—and to use it in two ways: [73]1. As a hierarchical invocation, directed towards the “centre where the will ofGod is known.”2. As a world prayer, expressed in such phraseology that all humanity couldintelligently use it.The right to use certain great Words of Power or “Stanzas of Direction” is neverlightly accorded. The decision of Christ to appear again among men, bringing Hisdisciples with Him, drew forth this permission from the Lord of the World, theAncient of Days.After this climaxing point of spiritual crisis and its consequent decision, apoint of tension was reached and it is in this state of spiritual tension thatthe Church invisible is now working and planning, swinging the disciples of theChrist, active on Earth, into the same condition of spiritual tension. Thesuccess of Christ’s return to visible Presence, as well as other factors(related to His reappearance), are dependent upon happenings and contacts whichare now taking place within this period of tension. In any point of tension—nomatter what the time factor may be—energy is being generated, held for futureuse, and focussed in such a manner or condition that its force can be directedwherever needed and whenever called for. This is necessarily a statement hard tounderstand. A point of tension is, symbolically, a storehouse of power. Todaythe energies which will be uniquely distinctive of the Kingdom of God aregathering momentum and assuming direction through the agency of the Masters ofthe Wisdom, in cooperation with the will of Christ.Whilst this energy has been accumulating or mounting in potency ever since theFull Moon of June 1945, three events of great moment in the living experience ofChrist (and, therefore, of the Hierarchy) have taken place and [74] theireffects are in process of consolidation. I can only make reference to them, forit is not possible to prove the factual nature of what is here said; onlypossibility, probability and the Law of Correspondences can indicate therightness of these events. Their effects will be noted, especially after themoment of emergence. These three events can be described as follows:1. The Spirit of Peace descended upon Christ. The New Testament bears witness toa somewhat similar event when, at the Baptism, we read that “he saw the Spiritof God, descending like a dove and alighting upon Him.” (St. Matt. III.16.) ThisSpirit is a Being of tremendous cosmic potency and is today overshadowing theChrist in much the same manner as Christ (two thousand years ago) overshadowedor worked through the Master Jesus. This Spirit of Peace is not the sum total ofan emotional and static calm, bringing to an end the turmoil on the Earth andinstituting an era of peace. He is, in a mysterious sense, the Spirit ofEquilibrium; He works with the Law of Action and Reaction and the inevitabilityof His activity will be recognised. His work will demonstrate in two ways—fullywhen the Christ appears among men and slowly and gradually until that time:a. The chaos, turmoil, emotional disturbance and mental unbalance found in theworld today will be (under this Law) balanced by a corresponding cycle of calm,emotional quiet and mental poise, thus releasing humanity into a new phase andexperience of freedom. The adjusted peace will be commensurate to theexperienced disturbance.b. The hate which is so dominant in the world today will—through the life of theSpirit of Peace, working through the Christ, the Embodiment of the [75] love ofGod—be balanced by an expressed goodwill. The guarantee of the appearance ofthat goodwill is the excessive expression of hate—a hate which has been slowlymounting in the minds of men since the beginning of the 19th century, and whichis reaching a new high at this time. A proportionate measure of the energy oflove will demonstrate later as the result of the activity of the Spirit ofPeace, working through the Prince of Peace, as Christ has sometimes been called.(Is. IX.6.) This spiritual Being will not descend from the high place whereon Heworks and from whence His energy is directed, but the Christ will act and serveas the channel for His directed potency. The inflow of His divine energy(extra-planetary energy) is destined to bring peace eventually upon Earth,through the expression of goodwill. This goodwill will bring about right humanrelations. Humanity registered (unconsciously, of course) the first impact ofthis energy in May, 1936, and again in June, 1945.2. The evolutionary force to which we give the name “the Christ consciousness”(a term largely used by the metaphysical groups in the world today) focusseditself in the person of the Christ in a manner hitherto unknown. This is thepotency, latent in every human heart which was described by St. Paul as “Christin you, the hope of glory” (Col. I.27), and is that which, under evolutionarylaw, brings a man eventually into the Kingdom of God and “unto the measure ofthe stature of the fullness of Christ.” (Eph. IV.13.) Of this potency and glory,Christ has ever been the symbol. During the [76] present period of hierarchicaltension and as a result of His decision to reappear, Christ became theEmbodiment of this energy and thus entered into a closer relation to humanity.Other great Sons of God are channels for this energy in relation to the subhumankingdoms, but the Christ holds a unique place in relation to humanity. Toexpress the idea symbolically, this energy creates a living bridge from thehuman kingdom to the Kingdom of God, from the fourth kingdom in nature to thefifth. The Christ is the custodian of this energy, but only temporarily and forthe period of this human crisis. He can, because of this, stimulate theresponsive factor in the hearts of men, enabling them to recognise and know Himfor Who and what He is, when He reappears. This channelling of energy began atthe close of the world war and is still going on; it is responsible for thetrend towards betterment everywhere to be sensed, for the growth of theprinciple of sharing, and for the undeniable soundness of men’s hearts andthinking today—the soundness of the masses (when informed), far more than oftheir leaders.3. As you are well aware, human history has been essentially the history ofgreat spiritual Messengers Who—from time to time, in the hours of humancrisis—have come forth from the secret place of the Most High to aid, inspire,reveal, lead and direct. It is the history of the presentation of ideas, broughtto the attention of humanity and gradually developed into civilisations andcultures. Such is the urgency of human need at this time, and such is theopportunity, that one such Son of God is—during this cycle of tension—seeking tocooperate with the Christ. As a result of Christ’s decision and His “spiritualfusion” with the Will of God, the Avatar of Synthesis has become, for the timebeing, His close Associate. [77] This is an event of supreme and planetaryimportance. His relationship and planned help date from the time of thepronouncing of the great Invocation and its use by men everywhere. Owing to thestupendous task confronting Christ, the Avatar of Synthesis will fortify Him,and He will be buttressed by this “Silent Avatar” Who (to speak symbolically)will “keep His eye upon Him, His hand beneath Him and His heart in unison withHis.”This Being is closely related to the Will Aspect of divinity, and Hiscooperation has been made possible through Christ’s Own attainment along theline of the highest, spiritual will. He works under the great natural Law ofSynthesis, producing at-one-ment, unification and fusion. His function (inunison with the energy of Christ) is to generate spiritual will in humanity, thewill-to-good; His potency works in three fields of activity at this time:a. Within the spiritual Hierarchy itself, revealing the nature of the divinewill-to-good which the Kingdom of God must express, and the nature also ofdivine Purpose.b. Within the Assembly of the United Nations, though not within the SecurityCouncil; He is there generating a slowly growing will-to-unity.c. Within the masses of men everywhere, fostering the urge to a generalbetterment.His activity is necessarily a mass activity, for He can only channel Hisenergies through the mass consciousness or through a group conscious entity,such as the Hierarchy, the United Nations or Humanity. The focal point of Hiseffort and the Agent through which distribution of His energy can be made is theNew Group of World Servers; [78] this group is uniquely related to this Avatarof Synthesis. The bringing together of all the agents of goodwill (who areresponsive to the energy of the divine will-to-good) constitutes the majorobjective of the New Group of World Servers and always has been. Their work cannow be constructively and creatively intensified through the association of theAvatar of Synthesis with the Christ. Their task is to usher in the New Age; inthat New Age, the five Kingdoms in Nature will begin to function as one creativewhole. Their work falls into the following parts, functions or activities:a. The production of a human synthesis or unity which will lead to an universalrecognition of the one humanity , brought about through right human relations.b. The establishing of right relations with the subhuman kingdoms in nature,leading to the universal recognition that there is One World .c. The anchoring of the Kingdom of God, the spiritual Hierarchy of our planet,in open expression on Earth, thus leading to the universal recognition that thesons of men are one .These objectives the Avatar of Synthesis will foster and aid and for thispurpose He has associated Himself with the Christ, working through theHierarchy, under instruction from the “centre where the will of God is known.”These three related events and distributing points of energy have all come intoactivity during the point of tension in which Christ and the Hierarchy are atthis time held. They all serve to re-direct and focus energy in relation tohumanity, for all are the result of the decision made by Christ after His pointof crisis, and are all connected [79] with the hierarchical preparation forChrist’s reappearance.II. Christ as the Forerunner of the Aquarian AgePeople are very apt to overlook the fact that though Christ recognised Hisfunction as Teacher and spiritual Leader of humanity during the age which is sorapidly drawing to a close, He also recognised the work which He would do whenthat age came to an end and the new astronomical cycle came into existence.The average Christian is singularly unaware of the times and cycles throughwhich our planet passes, under influence of solar progression. The at presentdubious science of astrology has sidetracked the legitimate interest of humanityin the astronomical teaching and its spiritual interpretation of the passage ofthe Sun through the signs of the zodiac. Yet, in The New Testament , thatrecognition is clearly revealed and colours the presentation of the entireGospel story. It is found also in The Old Testament . What was the sin of theChildren of Israel in the desert but a reversion to the old Mithraic worshipwhich distinguished the time when the sun was “in the sign of Taurus, the Bull,”as it is technically called. They fell down and worshipped the golden calf andforgot the new teaching of the age of Aries, the Ram, into which they wereentering, the teaching of the Scapegoat which colours Jewish history.The fact that Christ was the Teacher of the new period into which the Sun wasentering, the period of Pisces, is forgotten, but is clearly evidenced in thefish symbology which runs consistently through all four Gospels; the symbol ofthe Fish is the astrological symbol for the sign Pisces, and has been for untoldages. But Christ also [80] looked ahead to the work He would have to do in theAquarian Age, in the next sign into which the sun would enter. Prior to His“disappearance,” He referred to the symbol of the Aquarian Age and to the taskHe would then perform. With His twelve disciples, He enacted a dramatic episodewhich epitomises the work which He would later undertake when the two thousandyears of the Piscean era would have passed away. He told His disciples to gointo the city and that there they would meet a man, carrying a pitcher of water,that they should follow him to the upper room and there make ready the communionfeast in which He and they would share. (Luke XXII.10.) This they did and theLast Supper took place. The ancient symbol for the sign Aquarius (into which ourSun is now entering) is that of the Water-carrier, the man with a pitcher ofwater. This passing of the Sun into the sign Aquarius is an astronomical fact,as any one can ascertain by writing to any observatory; it is not anastrological prognostication. The great spiritual achievement and evolutionaryevent of that age will be the communion and human relationships establishedamong all peoples, enabling men everywhere to sit down together in the Presenceof the Christ and share the bread and wine (symbols of nourishment).Preparations for that shared feast (symbolically speaking) are on their way, andthose preparations are being made by the masses of men themselves, as they fightand struggle and legislate for the economic sustenance of their nations, and asthe theme of food occupies the attention of legislators everywhere. Thissharing, beginning on the physical plane, will prove equally true of all humanrelations and this will be the great gift of the Aquarian Age to humanity. Thisthe church has ignored and yet their ecclesiastics cannot explain away the factthat the Jews demonstrated [81] their liking for the Taurian worship of the Bullin the golden calf, that the Jewish dispensation used the symbol of thescapegoat or ram in the age of Aries, the Ram, and that the Christian emphasisesthe fish in the Piscean era, the Christian era.Christ came to bring to an end the Jewish dispensation which should haveclimaxed and passed away as a religion with the movement of the sun out of Ariesinto Pisces. He, therefore, presented Himself to them as their Messiah,manifesting through the Jewish race. In the rejection of the Christ as theMessiah, the Jewish race has remained symbolically and practically in the signAries, the Scapegoat; they have to pass—again speaking symbolically—into thesign, Pisces, the Fishes, and recognise their Messiah when He comes again in thesign Aquarius. Otherwise, they will repeat their ancient sin of non-response tothe evolutionary process. They rejected that which was new and spiritual in thedesert; they did it again in Palestine two thousand years ago; will they do itagain, as opportunity is offered to them? The difficulty with the Jew is that heremains satisfied with the religion of nearly five thousand years ago and showsas yet little desire to change.The coming in of the Aquarian Age, Christ foresaw and reduced to pictorial formfor us, thus preserving for us—down the centuries—a prophetic episode, theinterpretation of which is possible of demonstration only in our time and age.Astronomically, we are not yet functioning fully within the influence ofAquarius; we are only just emerging from the Piscean influence, and the fullimpact of the energies which Aquarius will set loose has not yet been felt.Nevertheless, each year carries us closer to the centre of power, the majoreffect of which will be to induce recognition of man’s essential unity, [82] ofthe processes of sharing and of cooperation and of the emergence of that newworld religion whose keynote will be universality and initiation. If the word“initiation” signifies the processes of “entering into,” then it is indeed truetoday that humanity is undergoing a true initiation as it enters into the newage of Aquarius; it will then be subjected to those energies and forces whichwill break down the barriers of separation, and which will blend and fuse theconsciousness of all men into that unity which is distinctive of the Christconsciousness.In June, 1945, at the time of the full moon (so significant a day in thespiritual experience of the Christ), He definitely and consciously took over Hisduties and responsibilities as the Teacher and Leader during the Aquarian solarcycle. He is the first of the great world Teachers to cover two zodiacalcycles—the Piscean and the Aquarian. This is a statement easily made and writtendown, but again it involves the three modes or techniques of appearance to whichI have already referred. His outpouring love and spiritual vitality (augmentedby the energies of the Spirit of Peace, the Avatar of Synthesis and the Buddha)were refocussed and channelled into a great stream, pulled through intoexpression (if I may word it so inadequately) by the words of the Invocation,“Let love stream forth into the hearts of men.... Let Light and Love and Powerrestore the Plan on Earth.”In those three words—light, love and power—the energies of His three Associates(the great Triangle of Force which stands in power behind Him) are described:the energy of the Buddha: Light, for the light ever comes from the East; theenergy of the Spirit of Peace: Love, establishing right human relations; theenergy of the Avatar of Synthesis: Power, implementing both light and love. Atthe centre of this Triangle the Christ took His [83] stand; from that point HisAquarian work began, and it will continue for two thousand five hundred years.Thus He inaugurated the new era and, upon the inner spiritual planes, the newworld religion began to take form. The word “religion” concerns relationship,and the era of right human relations and of a right relation to the Kingdom ofGod began. Such a statement as this is easily made but its implications arefar-reaching and stupendous.At that time also, the Christ assumed two new functions: one is connected withthe second mode of His physical appearance and the other with the mode ofover-shadowing. Over the masses, light, love and power are being poured forthand the growth of the Christ-consciousness is, therefore, being constantlystimulated. By His physical Presence, He will become the “Dispenser of the Waterof Life” ; through the over-shadowing of those sensitive to His impression andof His focussed Mind, He becomes what is technically known as the “Nourisher ofthe little ones.”As Dispenser of the Water of Life and as Nourisher of the Little Ones, He entersupon His duties in the Aquarian Age, whilst as the centre of the Triangle abovementioned, He influences, enlightens, and produces right relations in the massesof men. In the coming era, He will, therefore, be known as1. The Point within the Triangle.2. The Dispenser of the Water of Life.3. The Nourisher of the Little Ones.These are descriptive of His threefold duties to mankind, and of the work whichwill be distinctive of His world service, throughout the Aquarian Age.[84] Let us look at these phases of His work and try to understand thesignificance of the responsibility which He has undertaken. Some understandingis necessary if the New Group of World Servers and the working disciples in theworld are to prepare mankind adequately for His appearing. Much can be done ifmen will apply themselves to comprehension and to the needed subsequentactivity.First, as the Point within the Triangle , Christ becomes the awakener of thehearts of men, and the one who institutes right human relations by being simplywhat He is and by standing unmoved where He is. This He accomplishes bytransmitting the energies from the three points of the surrounding Triangle tohumanity. This blended, impersonal energy, triple in nature, will be spreadabroad universally, producing evolutionary growth, attracting people and nationsmagnetically to each other and automatically causing the unfoldment of the senseof synthesis, of provable unity and of a desirable fusion. Just as, during thePiscean Age, there was unfolded in humanity a mass responsiveness to knowledgeand to the principle of intelligence, so in the Aquarian Age, a mass response toright relations will equally be evoked, and goodwill (as its expression) will bedistinctive of the mass consciousness. It may be difficult to realise andappreciate this possibility but it was equally difficult for the mass of men inthe first centuries of the Christian or Piscean era to realise the future growthof the educational systems of the world and the spread of that knowledge whichis distinctive of our present civilisation and culture. Past attainment is everthe guarantee of future possibility.As Dispenser of the Water of Life , His work is most mysterious and not at alleasy to comprehend. In His public work, two thousand years ago, He said: “I amcome [85] that they may have life and that they may have it more abundantly.”(John X.10.) The Life Aspect—from the angle of the vision of Christ—expressesitself in three ways:1. As physical life , nourishing the cells of the body. This life is foundwithin each atom of substance as the central point of living light.2. As livingness , seen as love and light within the heart. When this livingnessis present and expressing itself, the human atom becomes a part of the spiritualHierarchy.3. As Life more abundantly . This life can be known as light, love and powerwithin and above the head of the disciple of the Christ. This abundant lifeenables him to cooperate, not only with humanity and with the spiritualHierarchy, but also with Shamballa itself—the centre of life in its purestessence.If we say that life is the livingness which enables , the words are relativelymeaningless, are they not? If, however, the livingness is referred to thephysical plane life, to the spiritual life of the disciple and to the livingpurpose of God, then some faint concept may come of the wonder of the workundertaken by the Christ in the past, and foreseen by Him as His futureresponsibility. Christ can draw upon the energies which are defined by thephrase “life more abundantly,” because they will set loose (in the Aquarian Age)in a new and dynamic manner the new energies needed in order to bring aboutrestoration and resurrection. This new energy is the “implementing force ofuniversality”; it concerns the future. This inflow of Aquarian energy is one ofthe factors which will enable [86] the Christ to complete His task as worldSaviour and world Teacher. It was to the definite performance of His duties asDistributor, Nourisher and Dispenser that He pledged Himself in June, 1945, andentered upon His responsibilities as the Forerunner and the Teacher of theAquarian Age.As Nourisher of the Little Ones , we are dealing with an aspect of Christ’s workwhich involves the stimulation of the consciousnesses of His disciples as theyprepare to undergo initiation or to enter into deeper phases of spiritualawareness. The result of His work in the Triangle with the masses of men will bethe presentation of the first initiation—the Birth of the Christ in the cave ofthe Heart—as the basic ceremony in the new world religion. By means of thisceremony, the masses of men in all lands will be enabled to register consciouslythe “birth of the Christ” in the heart, and the “being born again” to which HeHimself referred (John III.3) when here on Earth before. This new birth is whatesotericists mean when they speak of the first initiation . It will not, in thefuture, be the experience of the occasional disciple but the general experienceof countless thousands towards the close of the Aquarian Age. The purifyingwaters of the Baptism Initiation (the second initiation) will submerge hundredsof aspirants in many lands, and these two initiations (which are preparatory totrue service, and the third initiation of the Transfiguration) will set the sealon Christ’s mission as the Agent of the great spiritual Triangle which Herepresents.The major work of Christ, however, as far as the disciples and the definitelyspiritually-minded people of the world are concerned, plus the hundreds ofthousands of advanced humanity, is so to “nourish” their spiritual consciousnessand life that they will be enabled to take [87] the third and fourthinitiations—those of the Transfiguration and the Renunciation (or Crucifixion).As esotericists know, the term “little ones” refers to those disciples who are“babes in Christ” (as The New Testament terms it) and who have taken the firsttwo initiations of the Birth and the Baptism. They are aware of the spiritualaspiration which is indicative of the Christ life in their hearts, and they havesubjected themselves to the processes of purification which culminate in thebaptismal waters. Christ must prepare these aspirants for the higher initiationsand so nourish and aid them that they can stand before the One Initiator andbecome pillars in the Temple of God (i.e., agents of the spiritual Hierarchyand, therefore, active, working disciples).When He was in Palestine, centuries ago, He said, “no man cometh unto the Fatherbut by me.” (John XIV.6.) This was a foretelling of the work which He would becalled upon to do in the Aquarian era. In the first two initiations, aspirants(trained by senior disciples) find their way to Christ, Who administers thefirst two initiations; but—in these words—He is referring to still higher statesof unfoldment. Through these initiations, administered by the Christ, thedisciple becomes an agent of the love of God; the higher initiations enable him,however, to become, stage by stage, an agent of the will of God. The first groupknows and understands the second stanza of the Invocation, “From the point oflove within the heart of God, let love stream forth into the hearts of men”; thegroup which (in the Aquarian Age) the Christ Himself will “nourish” and preparewill know the meaning of the third stanza, “From the centre where the will ofGod is known, let purpose guide the little wills of men.”[88] The work of Christ, during the Piscean Age, was to relate humanity to theHierarchy of the planet; in the Aquarian Age, His work will be to relate thisrapidly growing group to that higher centre where the Father is contacted, whererecognition of sonship is accorded and where the divine purpose can be known.Through the coming work of Christ, the three divine aspects, recognised by allthe world religions (including the Christian religion)—Intelligence or theUniversal Mind, Love and Will—will be consciously developed in mankind;humanity, the spiritual Hierarchy and the “centre where the will of God isknown” will be brought into a more open and general relationship.The mystical approach to the Kingdom of God will gradually die out as the raceachieves increasing intelligence and a more scientific approach will befavoured; the rules for admission into that Kingdom will become objective; thelaws governing the highest centre of the divine will will also be revealed tothose who are members of the Kingdom of God and all this will come about underthe supervision of the Christ after His reappearance among men. The keynote ofHis mission then will be to evoke from humanity a response to spiritualinfluence and an unfoldment (on a large scale) of intuitive perception—a facultywhich is, at present, rare indeed. When He came before, He evoked from humanitya gradual response to truth and mental understanding. That is why, at the end ofthe cycle which He inaugurated two thousand years ago, we have formulateddoctrines and a widespread mental or intellectual development.III. Christ as the Releaser of EnergyDuring the first three months of the period of crisis through which Christ andthe Hierarchy passed and which [89] was ended by His announced decision, certaingreat Energies, or fundamental streams of force were made available to Christand His disciples. Today, the fact that energy is the basic substance in theuniverse, that all forms of life are energy forms, living within greater energyforms, and that all such forms—great or small—use energy and act as distributorsof energy is a well-known and generally accepted fact by thinking andintelligent people. Speech, the written word, and motivated activity are allexpressions of energy, lead to the spread of energy and to activities which areall expressions of energy and the cause of energy distribution. Governments,churches, organisations and groups are all energy distributors, and alsostorehouses of energy. Humanity itself is a great centre of energy, affectingall the subhuman kingdoms, and forming likewise within itself a great system ofinter-related energies. The same thing is true of the individual who, by hisacts and words, employs energy, produces effects which are energy effects andacts as a distributor of energy. Where the undeveloped individual is concerned,he realises none of this and the energy which he manipulates is of relativelysmall importance. As evolution proceeds, and individual men and women achievepower and expression, their use of energy is frequently of major importance;they become dynamic centres of energy distribution and their words (spoken orwritten), plus their activities, produce wide effects and momentous results. TheHierarchy is a great energy centre and, through the Christ, its energy reacheshumanity; this is the significance of His words “I am come that they might havelife.” Life and energy are synonymous terms.During the war (1914-1945), the Christ and the Hierarchy looked on at a dyingworld; men and forms were dying on every hand; old ideals, organisations and[90] groups were passing away and the spectre of death stalked on every hand.Destruction characterised the phenomenal world, as well as the subtler worlds offeeling and of thought; life was withdrawn and death resulted. The problem ofChrist and His disciples was to see that the old and the undesirable were notrevivified. Their task was not the resuscitation of the dead and the useless;the directed inflow of life, carrying the capacity to build anew and the energywhich could produce a new world and a new civilisation—there lay Theiropportunity and Their responsibility.The reactionary forces of the world—political and religious—desired theresurrection of the old and dead forms; they threw their weight and theirinfluence (which is only another name for energy) against all that was new.This, they are still doing. The progressive forces fight only for that which isnew, and seek not the preservation of any of the old forms, even if they couldserve a useful purpose. Their energetic denial of all that is of the past, andthe destroying energy which they direct against anything which is of the oldregime are likewise handicapping the efforts of the Hierarchy. In theseprogressive forces, hope does indeed lie, but they sadly lack skill in actionand have too great a love for destruction. The New Group of World Servers holdssteadily to the “Noble Middle Way” (as the Buddha called it) and seeks thedecent burial of old forms, the implementation of that which is new and therestoration of that which has, in the past, proved useful and good and whichcould form the living germ of the new creation.At the time of the Full Moon of April 1945, during the Easter season of thatyear and covering approximately a period of five weeks, the Forces ofRestoration began their work, emerging first upon the subtler planes [91] ofhuman experience. This type of energy is peculiarly creative in nature andcarries the “life which produces the birth of forms.” It poured into theHierarchy, via certain of the Masters and Their groups of disciples, and wasimmediately transmitted by Them to humanity as a whole. This energy is a massenergy and is related to the stimulation of the mass intelligence; it is not theenergy which we have earlier considered when dealing with the Christconsciousness in man. This is the energy which makes men think, plan and takeaction; it produces neither bad nor good results but simply brings about theawakening of men’s minds so that they take intelligent action. That action isnecessarily dependent upon the type of mind of the man who responds to theforces of restoration, conditioned by his point in evolution, his racial andnational background, his tradition and his religious and civilised reactions.These forces are active now in every land, frequently producing increasedinitial difficulties but leading eventually to a definite reorganisation of thenational or planetary life. Their effects will be primarily physical; they willbring about a new world in which the evidences of war will have disappeared, thephysical health of men and animals will be bettered, and cities and villageswill be rebuilt. Their objective is the production of the new Earth and all theouter evidences of an inflowing new life.Following this inflow, at the time of the Full Moon of the Buddha in May 1945,the forces of enlightenment became active, and light began to stream into theminds of men. These are, in reality, the energies which initiate the new worldeducation. Those first to be affected by them are the great educationalmovements, the forums of the people in all lands and the values which are nowunfolding through the radio and the moving picture industry; [92] others deeplyaffected are the press, the publishers of world literature, speakers, writers,radio commentators, newspaper men and social workers. These effects may not yetbe apparent for little time has as yet elapsed, but all these movements andpeople are the recipients today of the energies of enlightenment if they areprompt to recognise new emerging ideas; they are the custodians of this energyand its distributing agents, channelling it and directing it so that the massesof the people everywhere come under its influence. Progressive and liberalchurchmen in all the world religions are also responsive to this energy, buttheir usefulness is greatly handicapped, owing to the reactionary nature of thesetting or field in which they have to work; they are confronted with awell-nigh impossible task.These energies of enlightenment reach humanity, via the New Group of WorldServers who are very susceptible to their impact, and who are in a position todistribute them, because they are to be found working in all the fields ofactivity mentioned above.The forces of restoration are related to and emanate from the Mind of God andare connected with the intelligent principle in the divine nature; the intellectis that divine aspect which distinguishes man from all other forms in nature.The forces of enlightenment come from the Heart of God and are related to divineunderstanding and can, therefore, reach and strengthen all those who love andserve their fellowmen. This energy is related to the second aspect or principleof divinity, love-wisdom, of which the Buddha and the Christ are the twooutstanding divine expressions. It is mainly through Them and Their disciples,or the Masters on the same line of divine expression, that these energies reachhumanity, channelled by the New Group of World Servers.[93] The Christ and the Buddha combined the Way of the Mind and the Way of theHeart in Their perfection, and towered above their fellowmen from the heights ofTheir achievement. They swayed hemispheres and centuries, whereas lesser sons ofGod sway countries and shorter periods of time. They still have someconsummating work to carry through, though the indicated work lies not so muchwith the forms which embody Their enunciated divine principles—light and love—aswith the souls who have evolved through the application of these principles.In June 1945, Christ set in motion the forces of reconstruction which arerelated to the Will aspect of divinity and which remain as yet the leastpowerful of the three streams of energy, released during the three Full MoonFestivals in 1945. These forces of reconstruction are effective mainly inrelation to those entities which we call nations . The Hierarchy is at this timeattempting to channel them into the Assembly of the United Nations; the use madeof these impersonal energies is dependent upon the quality and the nature of therecipient nation, on its measure of true enlightenment and on its point inevolution. Nations are the expression today of the massed self-centredness of apeople and of their in stinct to self-preservation . These energies can,therefore, increase that aspect of their lives. They can, however, and in spiteof this, increase the potency of the objective which the United Nations (atpresent) theoretically hold before the eyes of men everywhere. The main objectof the Hierarchy is so to distribute these constructive, synthesising energiesthat the theory of unity may slowly be turned into practice, and the word“United” may come to have a true significance and meaning. It is with this typeof energy that the Avatar of Synthesis is peculiarly allied. He will convey tohumanity, with the aid of the Christ, [94] something for which we have as yet noname. It is neither love nor will, as we understand them. Only a phrase ofseveral words will bring to us something of the meaning. This phrase is “theprinciple of directed Purpose.” This principle involves three things:1. Understanding—intuitive and spiritually instinctual, but intelligentlyinterpreted—of the Plan, as it can be worked out in the immediate future by theChrist and His disciples.2. Focussed intention, based upon the above and emphasising an aspect of thewill, hitherto undeveloped in man.3. Capacity to direct energy (through understanding and intent) towards arecognised and desired end, overcoming all obstacles and destroying all thatstands in its way. This is not the destruction of forms by force such as we haveseen imposed upon the world, but a destruction brought about by the greatlystrengthened life within the form.The significance of these divine principles will make little sense to us today;we are dealing with major mysteries. A mystery remains a mystery only whenignorance or unbelief exist. There is no mystery where there is knowledge andfaith. All we know at this time is that the Christ will fuse and blend withinHimself three principles of divinity; when He appears “the light that always hasbeen will be seen; the love that never ceases will be realised, and theradiance, deep concealed, will break forth into Being.” We shall then have a newworld—one which will express the light, the love and the knowledge of God in acrescendo of revelation.[95] The beauty of this synthesis which Christ will manifest, and the wonder ofthe presented opportunity, must surely be apparent to all of us. Great Forces,under potent spiritual Leadership, are standing ready to precipitate themselvesinto this world of chaos, of confusion, of aspiration, of hope and ofbewilderment. These groups of energies are ready for focussing and distributionby the Hierarchy and that Hierarchy, under its Great Leader, the Christ, iscloser to mankind than ever before in human history. The New Group of WorldServers are also standing attentive to direction in every country in the world,united in their idealism, in their humanitarian objectives, in their sensitivityto spiritual impression, in their united, subjective purpose, in their love oftheir fellowmen and in their dedication to selfless service. The men and womenof goodwill are also to be found everywhere, ready to be guided intoconstructive activity and to be the agents, gradually trained and educated, forthe establishing of that which has never yet before truly existed—right humanrelations .Thus from the highest spiritual Being upon our planet, through the gradedspiritual groups of enlightened and perfected men who work upon the inner sideof life, on into the outer world of daily living where thinking, loving men andwomen serve, the tide of the new life sweeps. The Plan is ready for immediateapplication and intelligent implementing; the workers are there and the power towork is adequate to the need. Above all else, the Hierarchy stands and theChrist stands ready to issue forth and demonstrate reality.IV. Christ, as the Unifier of East and WestThis is a hard saying for the orthodox and narrow Christian churchman to accept;it means primarily that [96] Christ will work in the closest cooperation withthe Buddha until this fusion and reconstruction have truly taken place. TheBuddha is closely allied with the Christ in this process of His reappearing,though He will not be involved or active during the entire period of Christ’scoming, active work on earth. As you know, He, too, has not relinquished Hiscontact and relationship with humanity, though He relinquished His physical bodycenturies ago. He did this in order to accomplish certain assigned work whichhad in it (besides many things unknown to humanity) activities connected withthe work of the Christ, with the immediacy of His coming and with certain plansfor the coming civilisation of the Aquarian Age. As many millions in the worldknow, each year (at the time of the Wesak Festival at the May Full Moon) Hecommunicates with humanity, via the Christ and the assembled, attentiveHierarchy. He acts in this way as an agent bringing about relationship betweenthe “centre where the will of God is known” and the “centre which we call therace of men.” These two descriptive phrases are used advisedly because all thework now being done by these two great Sons of God is concerned with thedistribution of energy—the energy of light and the energy of love. It is throughthe Triangle, earlier mentioned, that the energy of will eventually will bedistributed and one of these divine distributors is the Buddha.Actually the work of the Buddha for humanity is nearly over, and His longalliance with the race of men has nearly come to an end. The moment that theappearance of the Christ is an accomplished fact, and the rule of right humanrelations is beginning definitely to condition human living, then the Buddhawill pass to the work which awaits Him. One of the senior disciples of theChrist, ranking next to the Christ in hierarchical status, [97] will take Hisplace and carry on the work, connected with mankind.By the time this particular Master takes over His task, the intelligentprinciple or knowledge, which is the outstanding characteristic of humanity,will have been to a large extent transmuted into wisdom by the worldintelligentsia, though not as yet by the masses of men. Wisdom is thepredominant characteristic of the Buddha and the momentum of this wisdom energywill eventually be so strong that it will need no further distribution orcontrol by the Buddha. He can then re-orient Himself to higher spheres ofactivity where His true work lies, and begin to work with an aspect of wisdom ofwhich we know nothing but of which both knowledge and wisdom have beenexpressing themselves through the Christ and the Buddha; later, through thecooperation of the Avatar of Synthesis, Christ will be able to blend withinHimself both of these major divine energies, and thus be a pure expression oflove and wisdom, of right relationship and intuitive understanding.In order to make this possible and thus release His spiritual Brother from thearduous task of relating humanity to the “centre where the will of God is known”(Shamballa), Christ is subjecting Himself at this time to an unique process oftraining. Of this training, His thirty years of work in the carpenter’s shop inPalestine has ever been the hitherto unrecognised symbol. The word “carpenter”is significant of building, of construction, and means (in its derivation)someone who is an artificer in timber or a builder of wooden houses. This is thetrue meaning of the Biblical story of Christ’s being crucified upon the cross ofwood or the tree. It is related in reality to the decision made by Christ in theGarden of Gethsemane to take over the building or reconstruction [98] work inAquarius, and thus complete the task which He attempted to do in the PisceanAge. He and His disciples and the New Group of World Servers are the pledgedbuilders of the new civilisation, the new “house of humanity.” The preparatorywork He is now doing will fit Him to demonstrate in wisdom (and not only throughlove) the nature of the hierarchical Plans, wise constructive measures, wisechoice of builders and correct methods of construction.It is apparent, therefore, that this greatest of the Sons of God, the Christ,Representative of humanity and of the second divine aspect, will demonstratewithin Himself, during the Aquarian Age and after His reappearance, certainmajor fused and blended dualities. It would profit us to study them and knowwhich they are:1. The fusion of the second divine aspect of Love and the first divine aspect ofWill—the Will-to-good.2. The fusion of love and wisdom, enabling Him to be the Builder of the new ageand civilisation.3. The fusion of Piscean energy, generated during the past two thousand years ofChrist’s spiritual activity and the Aquarian energies to be generated and activeon Earth during the next two thousand years, or two thousand five hundred.It is for this process of fusion and all that it entails that He now subjectsHimself to training. When this is completed, He can become in a sense hithertounknown to Him the focal point and the transmitting Agent for all these fivedivine energies:1. The energy of Love.2. The energy of Will. [99]3. The energy of Wisdom.4. Piscean energy, generated during the Christian era.5. Aquarian energy, already generating upon the inner planes of thought andfeeling, and to be generated during the centuries ahead of us.The lines which His training follows are known only to Christ, to the Buddha andto the Avatar of Synthesis. All esoteric or spiritual training has to beself-applied; this is as true of the Christ as it is of the humblest aspirant.Into the processes of Christ’s thinking, reactions and planning, it is notpossible for us to enter.In Palestine, His appearance was mainly prophetic and His work primarily that oflaying the foundation for the activities which will follow His reappearance,plus the sowing of the seed, the harvest of which He will garner in the new age.The tragedy of His appearance two thousand years ago has coloured thepresentation of truth by the theologians and made them posit an unhappy story,producing a miserable and unhappy world. This tragedy was based on:1. His discovery that humanity was not ready for that which He came to give andthat for centuries much experience, teaching, trial and testing would be neededbefore His real work could begin.2. His recognition that He Himself needed a deeper relation with that centrewhich He always referred to as “the Father’s House”; it was this realisationwhich led to His comment that His disciples could and would do “greater things”than He had done and that He had to go to His Father.3. His arriving at the conclusion that He must have more trained and dedicatedworkers and agents [100] than at that time was possible, or has proved possiblesince. Hence the gathering out and the training of the New Group of WorldServers. When there are enough of these servers and enlightened workers, He willcome and nothing can arrest His approach.4. He discovered also that men were not then desperate enough to “take theKingdom of Heaven by violence”; it is only in desperation and when completely atthe end of his tether that the disciple finds his way into that Kingdom and isready to relinquish the old ways. What is true of the individual must also betrue, on a larger scale, of humanity.It is to the whole world that Christ comes and not just to the Christian world.He comes to the East and to the West, and has foreseen this “time of the end,”with its planetary catastrophes, phenomenal disasters, despair andinvocation—arising from both the East and West. He knew that in the time offinal crisis and tension, humanity itself would force His emergence. The NewTestament story is true and correct; it is only the man-made interpretationswhich have misled humanity.In the East there is an ancient legend which has an application today and whichholds the clue to the relation of the Christ and of the Buddha; it concerns aservice which, the legend says, the Buddha will render Christ. In symbolic form,the legend runs that when the Buddha reached enlightenment, and experience onEarth could teach Him no more, He looked ahead to the time when His Brother, theChrist, would be active in the Great Service—as it is called. In order,therefore, to aid the Christ, He left behind Him (for His use) what aremysteriously called “His vestures.” He bequeathed and left [101] in some safeplace the sum total of His emotional-intuitive nature, called by some the astralbody and the sum total of His knowledge and His thought, called His mind ormental body. These, the legend says, will be assumed by the Coming One and proveof service, supplementing Christ’s Own emotional and mental equipment andproviding Him with what He needs as the Teacher of the East as well as of theWest. He can then with strength and success contemplate His future work andchoose His workers. There is something of this same idea latent in theinjunction given in The New Testament , “Let this mind be in you which was alsoin Christ.” (Phil. II:5.)Thus the Christ, with the fused energies of love and wisdom, with the aid of theAvatar of Synthesis and of the Buddha and under the influence of the Spirit ofPeace and of Equilibrium, can implement and direct the energies which willproduce the coming new civilisation. He will see, demonstrating before His eyesthe true resurrection—the emergence of mankind from the imprisoning cave ofmaterialism. Thus He will “see of the travail of His soul and shall besatisfied.” (Is. LIII.11.)"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE - THE TEACHINGS OF THE CHRISTThe Establishing of Right Human RelationsThe Law of RebirthRevelation of the Mystery of InitiationThe Dispelling of Glamour[102] It might be useful to make a few opening remarks upon the general subjectof the teaching given (down the ages) by the Sons of God Who have come forth inthe hour of humanity’s need, in order to present to the consciousness of the menof Their time certain required ideas and concepts of truth. When They come,Their aim is to meet the immediate need in such a fashion that the ideaspresented may become ideals to which eventually the life of mankind would laterconform and bring about a better civilisation. There has been a great continuityof such teaching down the ages.There is not the time to write or the time to read a complete analysis orstatement as to the progressive revelation of ideas which great and illuminedminds, authorised by the spiritual Hierarchy of the planet, have brought tohumanity. All the cyclic Teachers (to differentiate Them from the many lesserTeachers) have mastered life for Themselves in the three worlds of humanevolution—physical, emotional and mental—have achieved control of the physicallevel of consciousness, of Their emotional-feeling nature, and have attainedmental understanding and finally enlightenment.The problem of the Hierarchy has been (and still is) how much exact truthhumanity can comprehend, and to [103] what extent absolute truth can bepresented to their awakening minds; They have to decide which aspect ofuniversal truth will enable man to emerge out of his difficulties and thus moveforward on the Path of Return to God; They have to know, therefore, at whatpoint on the ladder of evolution humanity stands at any given period. This initself presents a field of research to Them.The method hitherto followed has been to decide what is the major factor lackingin man’s perception of reality (at any given time), and what recognised divinetruth has in it the seeds of a living activity for a humanity in a particularcondition, necessitating a certain type of help. They have also to determine howthat help can best be presented, so that its results will be lasting, culturaland effective. Hitherto, the presented concepts have been formulated by theworld Teachers of the period, and presented to a picked and chosen few whosetask it has been to take the newly presented idea and promulgate it among thosemen who are enlightened enough to accept it, to spread it, to live it and tomake it popular. This they have done for ages with more or less success.It is also not possible here to give the relatively few truths which guided thedevelopment of humanity in old Atlantis; these, however, form the firmfoundation of all later teaching. We can study (as a background to ourconsideration of the teachings which Christ will give after His reappearance)several of the minor concepts which today underlie the teaching of all the worldreligions, and which modern religious teachers should be presenting to thepublic mind.The first such Teacher is of such ancient date that it is not possible to saywhen He truly lived; even His name is a modernised one, given to an ancienthero-teacher. His name is Hercules . He presented to the world, through [104]the form of a pictorial and world drama (symbolic in nature) the concept of agreat objective, only to be reached as the result of struggle and difficulty. Hepointed to a goal toward which men must make their way, no matter what theobstacles; these obstacles He portrayed in the Twelve Labours of Hercules whichwere dramas and not factual occurrences. He thus pictured for those who had eyesto see and hearts to understand the nature of the problem to be solved upon thePath of Return to God; He depicted the Prodigal Son’s journey back to theFather’s house, and the tests and trials which all disciples, aspirants andinitiates have to face and which all Those Who today compose the spiritualHierarchy have already faced. When this statement is considered, it must includealso the Christ Who, we are told, “was in all points tempted like as we are”(Heb. IV.15), but also passed triumphantly the tests and trials.At some also unknown date Hermes came and, so the records say, was the first toproclaim Himself as “the Light of the World.” Later the great Teacher, Vyasa ,appeared. He gave one simple and needed message that death is not the end. FromHis time, the thinking of humanity about the possible immortality of the soulcan be seen to stem. Vaguely and instinctively, men had hoped and sensed thatthe discarding of the physical vehicle was not the final consummation to allhuman struggle, loving and aspiration; in those early days, feeling dominatedand instinct led; thought was not found among the masses of men as it is today.In this period of culmination in which we now live, the work of thespiritualistic movement, in its many forms, is in reality the emergence of thatstream of thought-energy and of the idea which Vyasa, thousands of years ago,implanted in the human consciousness. The effort of the intellectuals [105] toprove the scientific possibility of immortality is part also of this greatstream, carried onto intellectual levels, thus salvaging Vyasa’s work from themists and glamours and the psychic dishonesty with which it is now surrounded.The fact of immortality is today on the verge of scientific proof; the fact ofthe survival of some factor has already been proved, though what has beendemonstrated as surviving is apparently not in itself intrinsically immortal.The factual nature of the soul, and the fact of soul survival and of its eternallivingness, go hand in hand and have not yet been scientifically proven; theyare, however, known and recognised as truths today by such countless millionsand by so many intellectuals that—unless mass hysteria and mass deception isposited—their existence is already correctly surmised.Buddha is the next Teacher to Whom we should refer, though there were manybetween His time and that of Vyasa. During those centuries wherein history isrelatively dim and faint in its outlines, the intelligence of men had beenrapidly growing, and the enquiring perception of mankind came into increasinglyactive use. The asking of questions, to which there seem no apparent or easyanswers, focussed itself in a group of thinkers in India and they representedthinking men in every land. They asked the ancient questions as to why there issorrow and misery in every land and in every life; they asked what caused thesethings and what must be done to change these circumstances of life; theydemanded to know what was the integrating principle in man, and what was thesoul and was there a self. The Buddha came forth to give the answer and to laythe foundation for a more enlightened approach to life, giving the teachingwhich [106] would open the door to the work of the Christ Who would, He knew,follow in His steps.It is interesting to remember that when the Buddha came, approximately fivehundred years before Christ (for the exact date of Christ’s birth remainsdebatable), the first dim influences of the Piscean Age could be felt, impingingupon the powerful quality of the age of Aries, the Scapegoat or the Ram. It wasthe influence of this age—persisting throughout the Jewish dispensation—whichled eventually to the distortion of the simple teaching of the Christ when Hecame. He was erroneously presented to the world as the living Scapegoat, bearingaway the sins of the people, and thus originating the doctrine of the vicariousat-one-ment. It was St. Paul who was responsible for this emphasis. Aparalleling instance of a similar distortion was also of Jewish origin andappeared in the early stages of the cycle of Aries, the Ram. We are told thatthe Children of Israel fell down and worshipped the golden calf, the symbol ofTaurus, the Bull; this was the preceding astronomical cycle. These areastronomical cycles and not a presented astrology. In the early stages of Aries,the teaching reverted to that of Taurus and in the early stages of Pisces, itreverted to that of Aries and thus set the seal of retrogression upon theteaching which now controls so many orthodox Christians.Buddha answered the questions posited in His time by giving out the Four NobleTruths , which satisfactorily and eternally answer man’s demand of why . TheseTruths can be summarised as follows: the Buddha taught that misery and sufferingwere of man’s own making and that the focussing of human desire upon theundesirable, the ephemeral and the material was the cause of all despair, allhatred and competition, and the reason why [107] man found himself living in therealm of death—the realm of physical living, which is the true death of thespirit. He made a unique contribution to the teaching given by Hercules andVyasa, and added to the structure of truth which They had erected. Thus Heprepared the way for Christ. Between the times of these two great Teachers, theBuddha and the Christ, lesser teachers appeared to amplify and add to thealready given basic truths; of these Sankaracharya was one of the mostimportant, giving, as He did, deep instruction upon the nature of the Self. Alsothe teacher in The Bhagavad Gita , Shri Krishna, must be noted, for many believeHim to be a previous incarnation of the Christ.Thus the fundamental truths upon which relation to God (and, therefore, relationto our fellowmen) is founded are always given out by the Son of God, Who—in anyparticular world period—is the teaching Head of the spiritual Hierarchy.In due time, Christ came and gave out to the world (mainly through Hisdisciples) two major truths: the fact of the existence of the human soul and,secondly, the system of service (this phrase is used advisedly) as a mode ofestablishing right human relations—to God and to one’s fellowmen. He told menthat they were all the Sons of God in the same sense that He was; He told themin many symbolic ways who and what He was and assured them that they could doeven greater things than He had done, because they were divine as He was. Thesegreater things, humanity has already accomplished upon the physical plane and inits control of nature, as Christ knew men would, because He knew the workings ofthe Law of Evolution. He taught them that service was the key to the life ofliberation, teaching them the technique of service through His own life as Hewent [108] about doing good, healing the sick, as well as preaching and teachingthe things of the Kingdom of God and feeding the hungry, both physically andspiritually. He made the life of every day a divine sphere of spirituallivingness, thus emphasising the teaching of the Buddha, through desiringnothing for the separated self. Thus the Christ taught, loved, and lived,carrying forward the great continuity of revelation and of hierarchicalteaching; then He entered for us within the veil, leaving us an example that weshould follow His steps (1 Pet. II.21)—follow Him in His belief in divinity, inHis service and in ability to penetrate into that area of consciousness and thatfield of activity which we call the true Church of Christ, the spiritual (atpresent invisible) Hierarchy of our planet, the true Kingdom of God. The veilthat hides that real church from us is now in process of disappearing and Christis on the verge of reappearing.In the light of the past, therefore, and of humanity’s present need, whichChrist and the Hierarchy must meet, what will be the teaching which He will thistime give? Such is the question which His disciples are now asking. Theprobability is that His teaching will fall into four parts; we would do well toconsider each of them and do our best to understand and prepare the human mindfor the reception of what He has to give.I. The Establishing of Right Human RelationsThe phrase “right human relations” is one that is today being much discussed; itis being increasingly realised that it is a major human need, and the only hopeof a peaceful and secure future. Wrong human relations have reached such a stageof difficulty that every phase of human life is in a state of chaotic turmoil;every aspect [109] of daily living is involved—family life, communal living,business relations, religious and political contacts, governmental action andthe habitual life of all peoples, including the entire field of internationalrelations. Everywhere there is hate, competition, mal-adjustment, strife betweenparties, the vilest kind of muck raking and scandal making, deep distrustbetween men and nations, between capital and labour and among the many sects,churches and religions. The difference between a sect and a church is, afterall, only one of degree and historical inception; it is one of interpretation,of fanatical adherence to some pet truth and always—exclusiveness, which iscontrary to Christian teaching. Nowhere is there peace today or understanding;only a small minority in relation to the Earth’s population are struggling forthose conditions which will lead to peaceful and happy relationships.The strength of this fighting minority, struggling for peace and rightrelations, consists in the fact that the work they are attempting to do is inline with divine intention and purpose. Into this chaos of conflicting,competitive and fighting interests, Christ plans to reappear. I would ask you tocontemplate the very real horror of what He has to face, and the necessity forsome measure of order to be brought about in the world, for certain basicprinciples to be enunciated and partially, at least, accepted, before He canusefully work amongst men. If He were to come immediately, His voice would notbe heard, for the noise of men’s quarrelling is too great; if He sought toattract human attention, even through the prophesied sound of the trumpet (Matt.XXIV.31), He would be classed simply as one who advertised himself; if Hepreached and taught, He would attract primarily those who think naturally inunison with His message, or the gullible and the credulous would flock to Him,as they [110] do to all new teachers—no matter what they teach. The bulk ofhuman beings are still too hungry, too devastated psychically, too bewilderedand distressed, and too unsure of their future, their freedom and their securityto be in any condition to listen to Him.He will not come, we may be sure, as a conquering hero, as the interpretationsof the theological teachers have led man to believe, for that would certainlyfail to identify Him and He would be simply classed as another military figure;of them we have had a plethora; He will not come as the Messiah of the Jews tosave the so-called Holy Land and the city of Jerusalem for the Jews, because Hebelongs to the whole world and no Jews nor any other people have special rightsor unique privileges or may claim Him as their own; He will not come to convertthe “heathen” world for, in the eyes of the Christ and of His true disciples, nosuch world exists and the so-called heathen have demonstrated historically lessof the evil of vicious conflict than has the militant Christian world. Thehistory of the Christian nations and of the Christian church has been one of anaggressive militancy—the last thing desired by the Christ when He sought toestablish the church on earth.When He came before He said (and the words have been sadly misread): “I come notto bring peace but a sword” (Matt. X.34). This will be true especially duringthe early days of His advent. The sword which He wields is the sword of theSpirit; it is that sword which produces cleavage between a true spirituality andan habitual materialism. The major effect of His appearance will surely be todemonstrate in every land the effects of a spirit of inclusiveness —aninclusiveness which will be channelled or expressed through Him. All who seekright human relations will be gathered automatically to Him, [111] whether theyare in one of the great world religions or not; all who see no true or basicdifference between religion and religion or between man and man or nation andnation will rally around Him; those who embody the spirit of exclusiveness andseparativeness will stand automatically and equally revealed and all men willknow them for what they are. The cleaving sword of the spirit will—withoutwounding—bring revelation and indicate the first needed step towards humanregeneration.Standing as the focal point of the inner Triangle—of the Buddha, of the Spiritof Peace and of the Avatar of Synthesis—the consequent outpouring potency of theChrist will be so great that the distinction between love and hate, betweenaggression and freedom, and between greed and sharing will be made lucidly clearto the eyes and minds of all men and, therefore, the distinction between goodand evil will be made equally clear. The invocative prayer, “From the point oflove within the heart of God, let love stream forth into the hearts of men” willmeet with fulfilment. Christ will let loose into the world of men the potencyand the distinctive energy of intuitive love. The results of the distribution ofthis energy of love will be twofold:1. Countless men and women in every land will form themselves into groups forthe promotion of goodwill and for the production of right human relations. Sogreat will be their numbers that from being a small and relatively unimportantminority, they will be the largest and the most influential force in the world.Through them, the New Group of World Servers will be able to work successfully.2. This active energy of loving understanding will mobilise a tremendousreaction against the potency [112] of hate. To hate, to be separate, and to beexclusive will come to be regarded as the only sin, for it will be recognisedthat all the sins—as listed and now regarded as wrong—only stem from hate orfrom its product, the anti-social consciousness. Hate and its dependentconsequences are the true sin against the Holy Ghost, about which commentatorshave so long debated, overlooking (in their silliness) the simplicity and theappropriateness of the true definition.The power of the hierarchical spiritual impact, focussed through Christ and Hisworking disciples, will be so great that the usefulness, the practicality andthe naturalness of right human relations will become so evident that worldaffairs will rapidly be adjusted and the new era of goodwill and of peace onearth will be inaugurated. The new culture and the new civilisation will then bepossible.This is the picture of no optimistic, mystical and impossible event. It is notbased upon wishful thinking or upon a blind hope. Already today, the disciplesof the Christ are preaching the doctrine of right human relations; men and womenof goodwill are endeavouring to show that only through goodwill can true peacebe brought about in the arena of international life. In the presentation of true“livingness” which the Christ will demonstrate to the world of thinking men,there is necessarily no room for exclusiveness or for separativeness, becausethat “life more abundantly” (which He seeks to channel to us) is a free andflowing current, sweeping away obstructions and barriers, and establishing anunimpeded circulation of truth and life itself—the essential quality of bothbeing love .[113] All the world religions have posited the fact that God is Love essentiallyand that God is life essentially as well as intelligence. That life carrieswithin itself the essential quality of the will of God, as well as the love ofGod. Both are equally important because that will is qualified by love.Hitherto, men have known nothing of the factual nature of the quality oflivingness, energised by love and will, except through a vague theoreticalconception. The reappearance of Christ will establish the fact of this divinelivingness; the work which He will accomplish—with the aid of His disciples—willdemonstrate the love and the divine purpose which lie behind all phenomenalexperience.The establishing of right human relations is an aspect of the divine will forhumanity and the next facet of the divine expression to manifest itself in humanaffairs—individual, communal, national, and international. Nothing has everfinally impeded this divine expression, except the time factor, and that timefactor is determined by humanity and is an expression of divine freewill. Theintended, divine expression can move rapidly or slowly into manifestation,according as man decides; hitherto, man has decided upon a slow—a veryslow—manifestation. It is here that the freedom of the human will shows itself.Because divinity is immanent or present in all forms and, therefore, in allhuman beings, that will must eventually be fulfilled; because of thetremendously material intention (esoterically speaking) of all forms at present,that Will has hitherto been retarded in its expression; it has not been the willof man to establish right human relations. Hence the discipline of war, thetorture of the forms, and the misery in human living today.These factors are bringing about a great and general transformation; theindications of this is easily to be [114] seen by spiritually minded people.Such people are constantly saying (as Christ did in the Garden of Gethsemane),“Let the will of God be done.” (Matt. XXVI.39.) They say it ignorantly and oftenhopelessly; nevertheless, it indicates a general process of spiritualre-orientation, of submission and of acquiescence. Christ demonstrated thissubmission when He said, “I came not to do my own will but the will of Him Whosent me.” (John VI.38.) He proved His acquiescence when He cried, “Father, notmy will but Thine be done.” Submission has in it the elements of conquest bycircumstances and of a recognition which may not understand but which submits tothat which is imposed. Acquiescence has in it the element of an understandingintelligence, and this marks a great step forward. Both admit the fact of adivine over-shadowing will in the life of mankind today; both are preparatory toa recognition of Christ’s work in bringing about right human relations. Atpresent, the submission of mankind to the divine will is a negative submission;the true submission is a positive attitude of spiritual expectancy, leadingeventually to a positive acquiescence.A spiritual expectancy is also to be seen; it is part of the work of the NewGroup of World Servers to intensify this. They have also to foster spiritualsubmission and intelligent acquiescence in the masses, who normally dividethemselves into the two classes, expressing these two attitudes; these factorsof submission, acquiescence and expectancy are latent in every man. It is thesethree divine potentialities which will enable men to respond to the message ofthe Christ and, therefore, the selfless sacrifice, the understanding compromiseand the comprehension of the many and diverse points of view (necessary [115] tothe establishing of right human relations) will be far easier to bring about.We would all find it helpful to reflect upon what are the factors recognised insubmission and acquiescence. In establishing right human relations,relinquishment, renunciation, submission to existent facts, and obedientacquiescence to divine law are all involved. These are the things which Christearlier demonstrated on Earth, and they are the things which He will helphumanity to accept with enthusiasm and understanding. This will producehappiness. Happiness is a difficult lesson to learn; it is for mankind a totallynew experience and Christ will have to teach men how to handle happinesscorrectly, to overcome the ancient habits of misery, and thus to know themeaning of true joy. Christ, however, is not coming simply to teach men the needfor right human relations; He is coming to teach them how to establish itsuccessfully themselves.II. Christ Will Teach the Law of RebirthThis Law is the major corollary of the Law of Evolution. It has never beengrasped or properly understood in the West and, in the East, where it isacknowledged as a governing principle of life, it has not proved useful becauseit has been soporific in its effect, and a detriment to progress. The Easternstudent regards it as giving him plenty of time; this has negated the drivingeffort to achieve a goal. The average Christian confuses the Law of Rebirth withwhat he calls “the transmigration of souls” and frequently believes that the Lawof Rebirth signifies the passing of human beings into the bodies of animals orof lower forms of life. Such is by no means the case. As the life of Godprogresses onwards through [116] form after form, that life in the subhumankingdoms of nature proceeds progressively from mineral forms into vegetableforms, and from these vegetable forms into animal forms; from the animal formstage, the life of God passes into the human kingdom, and becomes subject to theLaw of Rebirth and not the law of Transmigration. To those who know something ofthe Law of Rebirth or of Reincarnation, the mistake seems ridiculous.The doctrine or theory of reincarnation strikes the orthodox Christian withhorror; yet if one asks him the question which the disciples asked Christ aboutthe blind man, “Master, did this man sin or his fathers that he was born blind?”(John IX.2), they refuse the implications; or they express amusement or dismayas the case may be. The presentation to the world of the thought by the averageoccult or theosophical exponent has been, on the whole, deplorable. It has beendeplorable because it has been so unintelligently presented. The best that canbe said is that they have familiarised the general public with the theory; hadit, however, been more intelligently presented, it might have been moregenerally accepted in the West.If the goal of right human relations will be taught universally by the Christ,the emphasis of His teaching must be laid upon the Law of Rebirth. This isinevitably so, because in the recognition of this law will be found the solutionof all the problems of humanity, and the answer to much of human questioning.This doctrine will be one of the keynotes of the new world religion, as well asthe clarifying agent for a better understanding of world affairs. When Christwas here, in person, before, He emphasised the fact of the soul and the value ofthe individual. He told men that they could be saved by the life of the soul,and of the Christ within [117] the human heart. He said also that “except a manbe born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God.” (John III.3.) Only souls canfunction as citizens of that kingdom, and it was this privileged functioningthat He held, for the first time, before humanity, thus giving men a vision of adivine possibility and an unalterable conclusion to experience. He told them to“Be ye, therefore, perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect.”(Matt. V.48.)This time, He will teach men the method whereby this possibility can becomeaccomplished fact—through the constant return of the incarnating soul to theschool of life on Earth, there to undergo the perfecting process of which He wasthe outstanding example. That is the meaning and teaching of reincarnation. DaneRudhyar, in his book New Mansions for New Men, page 123, gives a satisfyingdefinition of this mysterious cosmic and human process. He says that “Theindividual structure of the new manifestation is necessarily conditioned by theunfulfillment of the past; by the remains, the failures of the past—preserved inthe records of nature in the memory of universal substance.” The wholestory—yours and mine and that of everyone—is covered in those few words.It should be remembered that practically all the occult groups and writings havefoolishly laid the emphasis upon past incarnations and upon their recovery; thisrecovery is incapable of any reasonable checking—anyone can say and claimanything they like; the teaching has been laid upon imaginary rules, supposed togovern the time equation and the interval between lives, forgetting that time isa faculty of the brain-consciousness and that, divorced from the brain, time isnon-existent; the emphasis has always been laid upon a fictional presentation ofrelationships. The teaching (hitherto given out on reincarnation) [118] has donemore harm than good. Only one factor remains of value: the existence of a Law ofRebirth is now discussed by many and accepted by thousands.Beyond the fact that there is such a law, we know little and those who know fromexperience the factual nature of this return reject earnestly the foolish andimprobable details, given out as fact by the theosophical and occult bodies. TheLaw exists; of the details of its working we know as yet nothing. Only a fewthings can be said with accuracy about it and these few warrant nocontradiction:1. The Law of Rebirth is a great natural law upon our planet.2. It is a process, instituted and carried forward under the Law of Evolution.3. It is closely related to and conditioned by the Law of Cause and Effect.4. It is a process of progressive development, enabling men to move forward fromthe grossest forms of unthinking materialism to a spiritual perfection and anintelligent perception which will enable a man to become a member of the Kingdomof God.5. It accounts for the differences among men and—in connection with the Law ofCause and Effect (called the Law of Karma in the East)—it accounts fordifferences in circumstances and attitudes to life.6. It is the expression of the will aspect of the soul and is not the result ofany form decision; it is the soul in all forms which reincarnates, choosing andbuilding suitable physical, emotional and [119] mental vehicles through which tolearn the next needed lessons.7. The Law of Rebirth (as far as humanity is concerned) comes into activity uponthe soul plane. Incarnation is motivated and directed from the soul level, uponthe mental plane.8. Souls incarnate in groups, cyclically, under law and in order to achieveright relations with God and with their fellowmen.9. Progressive unfoldment, under the Law of Rebirth, is largely conditioned bythe mental principle for “as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.” These fewbrief words need most careful consideration.10. Under the Law of Rebirth, man slowly develops mind, then mind begins tocontrol the feeling, emotional nature, and finally reveals the soul and itsnature and environment to man.11. At that point in his development, the man begins to tread the Path ofReturn, and orients himself gradually (after many lives) to the Kingdom of God.12. When—through a developed mentality, wisdom, practical service andunderstanding—a man has learnt to ask nothing for the separated self, he thenrenounces desire for life in the three worlds and is freed from the Law ofRebirth.13. He is now group conscious, is aware of his soul group and of the soul in allforms and has attained—as Christ had requested—a stage of Christlike perfectionreaching unto the “Measure of the stature of the fullness of the Christ.” (Eph.IV.13.)[120] Beyond this generalisation, no intelligent person will attempt to go. WhenChrist reappears, our knowledge will become more true and realistic; we shallknow that we are eternally related to the souls of all men, and that we have adefinite relationship to those who reincarnate with us, who are learning with usthe same lessons and who are experiencing and experimenting with us. This provenand accepted knowledge will regenerate the very sources of our human living. Weshall know that all our difficulties and all our problems are caused by ourfailure to recognise this fundamental Law, with its responsibilities andobligations; we shall then gradually learn to govern our activities by its justand restraining power. The Law of Rebirth embodies the practical knowledge whichmen need today to conduct rightly and correctly their religious, political,economic, communal and private lives and thus establish right relations with thedivine life in all forms.III. Revelation of the Mysteries of InitiationMuch that is here written and which is conveyed in these pages is in realityconcerned with the appearance of the Kingdom of God—an appearance which can nowtake place because of three factors:1. The growth of that Kingdom on Earth, and the thousands of people whorecognise its laws and endeavour to live in accordance with its rules andspirit.2. The fact that the signs of the time and the wide-spread need of humanity haveevoked the Christ, and that He has decided to reappear. [121]3. The invocative cry of humanity is ascending hourly to “the secret place ofthe Most High” and the Hierarchy plans to emerge when Christ appears andrestores the rule of the Spirit on Earth. The hour for the restoration of theancient Mysteries has arrived.These facts have been widely given out, during the past two years, as the resultof the cleansing of the Earth through the medium of the world war (1914-1945)and through the suffering to which humanity has been subjected (with an equallypotent purifying effect, which will demonstrate later). It will then be possiblefor the Hierarchy, the Church of Christ hitherto invisible, to externaliseitself and to function openly upon the physical plane. This will indicate areturn to the situation which existed in Atlantean days when (to use Biblicalsymbology, Genesis Chaps. 2 and 3) God Himself walked among men; He talked withthem and there was no barrier between the Kingdom of men and the Kingdom of God.Divinity was then present in physical form and the Members of the spiritualHierarchy were openly guiding and directing the affairs of humanity as far asman’s innate freedom permitted. Now, in the immediate future, and on a higherturn of the spiral of life, this will again happen. The Masters will walk openlyamong men; the Christ will reappear in physical Presence. Another thing thatwill happen will be that the ancient Mysteries will be restored, the ancientlandmarks will again be recognised—those landmarks which Masonry has soearnestly preserved and which have been hitherto securely embalmed in theMasonic rituals, waiting the day of restoration and of resurrection.[122] These ancient Mysteries were originally given to humanity by the Hierarchyand contain the entire clue to the evolutionary process, hidden in numbers, inritual, in words and in symbology; these veil the secret of man’s origin anddestiny, picturing to him, in rite and ritual, the long, long path which he musttread, back into the light. They provide also (when rightly interpreted andcorrectly represented) the teaching which humanity needs in order to pass fromdarkness to Light, from the unreal to the Real and from death to Immortality.Any true Mason who understands, even if only to a slight degree, thesignificance of the three degrees of the Blue Lodge, and the implications ofthat in which he participates, will recognise the above three phrases for whatthey are, and will recognise the significance of the three degrees. I mention ithere with Masonic purpose because it is closely related to the restoration ofthe Mysteries and has held the clue (down the ages) to that long awaitedrestoration, to the platform upon which the required teaching can be based andthe structure which can express (when freed of its Jewish names andnomenclature, which are long out of date, though right three thousand years ago)the history of man’s moving forward upon the Path of Return.It is these Mysteries which Christ will restore upon His reappearance, thusreviving the churches in a new form, and restoring the hidden Mystery which theylong have lost through their materialism. Masonry has also lost the truelivingness it once possessed but, in its forms and rituals, the truth ispreserved and can be recovered. This Christ will do. He will also revive theseMysteries in other ways; not all will seek the church or Masonry for therevitalising of their spiritual life. The true Mysteries will also revealthemselves through science and [123] the incentive to search for them there willbe given by the Christ. The Mysteries contain, within their formulas andteachings, the key to the science which will unlock the mystery ofelectricity—the greatest spiritual science and area of divine knowledge in theworld, the fringes of which have only just been touched. Only when the Hierarchyis present visibly on Earth and the Mysteries of which the disciples of theChrist are the Custodians are given openly to the world, will the true secretand nature of electrical phenomena be revealed.The Mysteries are, in the last analysis, the true source of revelation; it canonly be when the mind and the will-to-good are closely fused and blended and arethus conditioning human behaviour that the extent of the coming revelation canbe safely grasped. There are planetary energies and forces which men as yetcannot and do not control; they know nothing of them and yet upon them the lifeof the planet is dependent; they are also closely related to the despisedpsychic powers (today so stupidly approached and ignorantly used), yet thesepowers (when correctly assessed and used) will prove of enormous usefulness inthe sciences which the Mysteries will reveal .The Mystery of the Ages is, through the reappearance of the Christ, on the vergeof revelation. Through the revelation of the soul that Mystery (which soulknowledge veils) will stand revealed. The Scriptures of the world have everprophesied that, at the end of the age, we shall see the revelation of thatwhich is secret and the emergence of that which has hitherto been concealed,into the light of day. As we know, our present cycle marks the end of thePiscean age; the next two hundred years will see the abolition of death orrather of our misconceptions as to death and the firm establishing of the factof the soul’s existence; the soul will then be [124] known to be an entity andthe motivating impulse and the spiritual force behind all manifested forms. Thework of the Christ (two thousand years ago) was to proclaim certain greatpossibilities and the existence of great powers. His work when He reappears willbe to prove the fact of these possibilities and to reveal the true nature andpotency of man. The proclamation He made that we were all sons of God and ownone universal Father will, in the near future, no longer be regarded as abeautiful, mystical and symbolic statement, but will be regarded as a provedscientific pronouncement. Our universal brotherhood and our essentialimmortality will be proven to be facts in nature.The ground is being prepared at this time for the great restoration which theChrist will engineer. The world religions (including Christianity) and Masonryare today before the judgment seat of humanity’s critical mind; the word hasgone forth almost unanimously that both of them have failed in their divinelyassigned tasks. It is realised everywhere that new life must be poured in, butthis will take a new vision and a new approach to living conditions and thisonly the appearance of the Christ can teach and help us bring about. As anancient Scripture says:“That which has been a mystery shall no longer be so, and that which has beenveiled will now be revealed; that which has been withdrawn will emerge into thelight and will then enhance that light and all men will see and together willrejoice. The time will come when destruction will have wrought its beneficentwork; then men, through suffering, will seek that which they have discarded. Invain pursuit, they sought that which was near at hand and easy of attainment.[125] Possessed, they found that it proved an agency of death. Yet all the time,they sought for life, not death.”And the Christ will bring them life and life abundantly. There is much talk these days concerning the mysteries of initiation. Everycountry is full of spurious teachers, teaching the so-called Mysteries, offeringspurious initiations (usually at a cost and with a diploma) and misleading thepeople. Christ Himself taught that just before He came, this state of affairswould be found and that everywhere the false and the spurious would beproclaiming themselves. All this is, however, but indicative of His coming. Thecounterfeit ever guarantees the true. The talk, the discussions, the sillyclaim-making, the pseudo-occultism and the futile efforts to “take aninitiation” (that undistinguished phrase which ignorant theosophical teachershave coined to express a deep spiritual experience) have been distinctive of theesoteric teaching ever since its modern inception in 1875. Then H.P. Blavatskybrought to the attention of the Western world the fact that great disciples andMasters of the Wisdom were present on the Earth, obedient to the guidance of theChrist. Later she deeply regretted doing this, as some of her papers, issued toher Esoteric Section, proclaimed. Yet what she did was all a part of the greatplan and was no mistake. The interpretations and the excited reactions of thetheosophists of her time were the mistake—a mistake which they have not yetacknowledged. This stupid reaction was aided and helped by the inquisitivenature of humanity itself, as well as by its aspiration which was undoubtedlyaroused thereby. Men also, full of cupidity and commercial greed, exploited thetheme and are still doing so.[126] The total effect of all these stupidities and errors of presentation hasnevertheless been good. In all lands, men today are aware of the existence ofthe Masters and of the possibility offered and the opportunity presented to makescientific spiritual progress and thus become members of the Kingdom of God.This the churches had ignored and had—in the Victorian age particularly—lookedupon science as an arch enemy.All this flood of information about the mysteries of initiation—some of itindicative of a hidden truth, some of it the fabrications of an aspirationalimagination and some commercially instigated—has definitely prepared humanityfor the teaching it is believed Christ will give when again here with us inphysical Presence.Little as the orthodox Christian may care to admit it, the entire Gospel storyin its four forms or presentations, contains little else except symbolic detailsabout the Mysteries which are (as far as humanity is concerned) five in all.These Mysteries indicate, in reality, five important points in the spiritualhistory of an aspirant; they indicate also five important stages in the progressof human consciousness. This advance will become definite and clear in a mannernot understood today, at some point during the Aquarian Age. Humanity, the worlddisciple (through its various groups all at various stages of unfoldment) will“enter into” new states of awareness and into new realms or spheres of mentaland spiritual consciousness, during the next two thousand years.Each age has left a reflection of a modern fivefold development upon it. Fourages have just passed away, astronomically speaking: Gemini, Taurus, Aries, andPisces. Today Aquarius, the fifth age, is coming into power. In Gemini, itssymbolical sign of the two pillars set its seal upon the Masonic Fraternity ofthe time [127] and the two pillars of Jachin and Boaz—to give them their Jewishnames which are, of course, not their real names—came into being approximatelyeight thousand years ago. Then came Taurus, the Bull, wherein Mithra came as theworld Teacher and instituted the Mysteries of Mithras with an (apparent) worshipof the Bull. Next followed Aries the Ram, which saw the start of the JewishDispensation which is of importance to the Jews and unfortunately of importanceto the Christian religion, but of no importance to the untold millions in theother parts of the world; during this cycle came the Buddha, Shri Krishna andSankaracharya; finally we have the age of Pisces the Fishes, which brought to usthe Christ. The sequence of the Mysteries which each of the signs of the Zodiacembodies will be clarified for us by the Christ, because the publicconsciousness today demands something more definite and spiritually real thanmodern astrology, or all the pseudo-occultism so widely extant.In the era which lies ahead, after the reappearance of the Christ, hundreds ofthousands of men and women everywhere will pass through some one or other of thegreat expansions of consciousness, but the mass reflection will be that of therenunciation (though this does not mean that the masses will by any means takethe fourth initiation); they will renounce the materialistic standards whichtoday control in every layer of the human family. One of the lessons to belearnt by humanity at the present time (a time which is the ante-chamber to thenew age) is how few material things are really necessary to life and happiness.The lesson is not yet learnt. It is, however, essentially one of the values tobe extracted out of this period of appalling deprivations through which men areevery day passing. The real tragedy is that the [128] Western Hemisphere,particularly the United States, will not share in this definite spiritual andvitalising process; they are at present too selfish to permit it to happen.You can see, therefore, that initiation is not a ceremonial procedure, or anaccolade, conferred upon a successful aspirant; neither is it a penetration intothe Mysteries—of which the mysteries of Masonry are, as yet, only the pictorialpresentation—but is simply the result of experiencing “livingness” on all threelevels of awareness (physical, emotional and mental) and—through thatlivingness—bringing into activity those registering and those recording cellswithin the brain substance which have hitherto not been susceptible to thehigher impression. Through this expanding area of registration or, if you preferit, through the development of a finer recording instrument or responsiveapparatus, the mind is enabled to become the transmitter of higher values and ofspiritual understanding. Thus the individual becomes aware of areas of divineexistence and of states of consciousness which are always eternally present butwhich the individual man was constitutionally unable to contact or to register;neither the mind, nor its recording agent, the brain, were able to from theangle of their evolutionary development.When the searchlight of the mind is penetrating slowly into hithertounrecognised aspects of the divine mind, when the magnetic qualities of theheart are awakening and becoming sensitively responsive to both the otheraspects, then the man becomes able to function in the new unfolding realms oflight, love and service. He is initiate.These are the mysteries with which the Christ will deal; His acknowledgedPresence with us and the presence of His disciples will make possible a far morerapid development than would otherwise be the case. The stimulation [129] of theobjective Hierarchy will be increasingly potent and the Aquarian Age will see somany of the sons of men accepting the great Renunciation that world effort willbe on the same scale as the mass education of mankind in the Piscean Age.Materialism as a mass principle will be rejected and the major spiritual valueswill assume greater control.The culmination of a civilisation, with its special note, quality and gifts toposterity, is significant of the reflection of the spiritual intent, and(through its massed populations) of one of the initiations. History will someday be based and written upon the record of the initiatory growth of humanity;prior to that, we must have a history which is constructed around thedevelopment of humanity under the influences of great and fundamental ideas.That is the next historical presentation.The production of the culture of any given period is simply the reflection ofthe creative ability and the precise consciousness of the initiates of thetime—those who knew they were initiate and were also conscious of admittanceinto direct relation with the Hierarchy. At present, we use neither of these twowords, civilisation and culture, in their rightful sense or with their truemeaning. Civilisation is the reflection in the mass of men of some particularcyclic influence, leading to an initiation. Culture is esoterically related tothose within any era of civilisation who specifically, precisely and in fullwaking consciousness, through self-initiated effort, penetrate into those innerrealms of thought activity which we call the creative world. These are therealms which are responsible for the outer civilisation.The reappearance of the Christ is indicative of a closer relation between theouter and the inner worlds of thought. The world of meaning and the world ofexperience will[130] be obviously blended through the stimulation of the advent of theHierarchy and of its Head, the Christ. A tremendous growth of understanding andof relationships will be the major result.IV. The Dispelling of GlamourThe word “glamour,” the outstanding characteristic of the astral plane, hasnever been correctly employed and it is a pity that it was ever used in theearly days of the esoteric teachings. The so-called “astral plane” is simply thename given to that sum total of sentient reactions, of feeling-responsiveness,and of emotional substance which man has himself so powerfully created and sosuccessfully projected that he is today the victim of that which he has made.Eighty per cent of the teaching given about the astral plane is a part itself ofthe great delusion and a part also of that unreal world to which we refer whenwe pray the ancient prayer: “Lead us from the unreal to the Real.” What is saidabout it has little basis in fact; it has, however, served a useful purpose as afield of experience in which we can learn to differentiate between the true andthe untrue; it is an area also in which the aspirant can use the discriminatingfaculty of the mind—the great discloser of error and the eventual revealer oftruth.Once that “mind is in us which is also in Christ” (Phil. II.5), we shall findthat the control of this emotional nature and this sentient area ofconsciousness (the astral plane, if you prefer the term!) becomes complete. Thenthis past sentient control and its entire area of influence no longer exists. Ithas no reality, except as a field of service and a realm in which men wander indespair and bewilderment. The greatest service a man [131] can render hisfellowmen is to free himself from the control of that plane by himself directingits energies through the power of the Christ within. He will then find that theself-centred forces and the energies of personal desire and of emotional lovewill be superseded by a living energy which can be sensed in a large way, thoughit cannot as yet be appropriated in its pure essence; this energy, we call the“love of God.” It is that free-flowing, outgoing, magnetically attractive forcewhich leads each pilgrim back to the Father’s House. It is that force whichstirs in the heart of humanity and finds expression through the medium of suchgreat avatars as the Christ; which guides the mystical yearning found in eachhuman being, and works through all movements that have for their objective thewelfare of humanity, through philanthropic and educational tendencies of allkinds and through the instinctual motherhood found everywhere. But it isessentially a group sentiency, and only in the Aquarian Age, and as a result ofthe reappearance of the Christ, will its true nature reach correct understandingand the love of God be spread abroad in every human heart.Of this world of glamour and illusion, Christ knew much, and in Himselfdemonstrated that true love could control it. Part of the three greattemptations of the Christ in the wilderness was based upon the three aspects ofworld glamour: the illusions which the mind creates, the glamour of theemotional plane of experience and the maze of earthly circumstances. These allthreatened to bewilder Him; He met each of them in turn with the enunciation ofa clear-cut principle and not with the wordy arguments of an analytical mind;from that field of threefold experience He went forth to love, to teach and toheal. Christ is the great dispeller of world glamour when [132] He comes, and inthis work the Buddha has previously prepared the way. The possibility of such adispelling and dissipation is therefore definitely centred in the two Avatars,the Buddha and the Christ. One of the essential things at this time is to bringhome to humanity and to the nations of the world the nature of the workundertaken by the Buddha and the Christ, and to re-emphasise the truthsprojected by Them into the arena of world thought. The work of the Lord of Lightand of the Lord of Love must be presented anew to a needy world. In thisconnection, it might be said that some nations need to grasp the teaching of theBuddha which He enunciated in the Four Noble Truths ; they must be brought tothe realisation that the cause of all sorrow and woe is the misuse ofdesire—desire for that which is material and transitory. The United Nations needto learn to apply the Law of Love as enunciated in the life of Christ and toexpress the vitality of the truth that “no man liveth unto himself” (Rom. XIV.7)and no nation either; the goal of all human effort is loving understanding,prompted by a programme of love and right human relations for all mankind.If the lives of these two great Teachers can be comprehended and Their teachingsbe wrought out in the lives of men anew today, in the world of human affairs, inthe realm of human thinking and in the arena of political and economicintercourse, the present world order (which is so largely disorder) can be somodified and changed that a new world order and a new race of men can graduallycome into being. World glamour will be dissipated and world illusion bedispelled.Within the world of glamour—the world of the astral plane and of theemotions—appeared, centuries ago, a point of light; the Lord of Light, theBuddha, undertook [133] to focus in Himself the illumination which wouldeventually make possible the dissipation of glamour. Within the world ofillusion, the world of the mental plane, appeared the Christ, the Lord of LoveHimself. He undertook to dispel illusion by drawing to Himself (by theattractive potency of love) the hearts of all men, and stated this determinationin the words, “I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto Me.” (John XII.32.)The combined work of these two great Sons of God, concentrated through the worlddisciples and through Their initiates must and will inevitably shatter illusionand dispel glamour—the one by the intuitive recognition of reality by mindsattuned to it, and the other by the pouring in of the light of the reason. TheBuddha made the first planetary effort to dissipate world glamour; the Christmade the first planetary effort towards the dispelling of illusion. Their workmust now be intelligently carried forward by a humanity wise enough to recogniseits duty.Men are being rapidly disillusioned and will consequently see more clearly.World glamour is being steadily removed from the ways of men. Those twodevelopments have been brought about by the incoming new ideas, focussed throughthe world intuitives and released to the general public by the world thinkers.It is also largely aided by the unconscious, but none the less real, recognitionby the masses of the true meaning of these Four Noble Truths . Disillusioned anddeglamoured (if I may use such a term) humanity awaits the coming revelation.This revelation will be brought about by the combined efforts of the Buddha andthe Christ. All that we can foresee or foretell anent that revelation is thatsome potent and far-reaching results will be achieved by the merging of lightand love, and by the reaction of “lighted [134] substance” to “the attractivepower of love.” I have here given a clue to the true understanding of the workof these Avatars—a thing hitherto quite unrealised. It might be added that whenan appreciation of the meaning of the words “transfiguration of a human being”is gained, the realisation will come that when “the body is full of light” (LukeXI.36) then “in Thy light shall we see light .” (Ps. XXXVI.9.) This means thatwhen the personality has reached a point of purification, of dedication and ofillumination, then the attractive power of the soul, whose nature is love andunderstanding, can function, and fusion of these two will take place. This iswhat the Christ proved and demonstrated.When the work of the Buddha (or of the embodied wisdom principle) is consummatedin the aspiring disciple and his integrated personality, then the fullexpression of the work of the Christ (the embodied principle of love) can alsobe consummated then both of these potencies—Light and Love—will find radiantexpression in the transfigured disciple. What is true, therefore, of theindividual is true also of humanity as a whole; today humanity (having reachedmaturity) can “enter into realisation” and consciously take part in the work ofenlightenment and of spiritual, loving activity. The practical effects of thisprocess will be the dissipation of glamour and the release of the human spiritfrom the thraldom of matter; it will produce also the dispelling of illusion andthe recognition of the truth as it exists in the consciousness of those who arepolarised in the awareness of the Christ.This is necessarily no rapid process; it is an ordered and regulated procedure,sure in its eventual success but relatively slow also in its establishment andsequential process. This process was initiated upon the astral plane [135] bythe Buddha, and on the mental plane when Christ manifested on Earth. Itindicated the approaching maturity of humanity . The process has been slowlygathering momentum as these two great Beings have gathered around Them Theirdisciples and initiates, during the past two thousand years. It has reached apoint of intensive usefulness as the channel of communication between “theCentre where the Will of God is known,” and the Hierarchy where the Love of Goddemonstrates has been opened and enlarged, and the contact between these twogreat centres and humanity has been more firmly established.Thus thousands of intelligent men and women will be enabled to free themselvesfrom all delusion and emotional control. The moment that the hearts of men areactive, that moment sees the termination of emotional, solar plexus activity.That is a statement of fact; it is the hearts of men which respond to the callof Christ and it is those hearts which are becoming invocative today. Theagonising emotional cycle through which humanity has passed during the past onehundred years, and the emotional tension in which men today live are alsoplaying their part in fitting humanity to emerge into the realm of clearthought; this will mark a significant turning point in human history and will beone of the results of Christ’s future scientific work (if I may use this term)with the hearts of men, bringing them into rapport with the Heart of God.Because of the magnitude of this theme and the wide extent of the psychologicalarea in which the mass of men now live, I cannot further enlarge. This field ofexperience and of trial is well known to all aspirants and is the battlefield ofmillions. The Christ within, as the Controller of the individual life, can bringthat battle to [136] an end; the aspirant can emerge clear sighted and unafraid.The appearance of the Christ among men will do the same thing for humanity as awhole, not in any vicarious sense but through the livingness of His Presence,stimulating the Christ principle in every human heart."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIX - THE NEW WORLD RELIGION[137] The world today is more spiritually inclined than ever before. This issaid with a full realisation of the generally accepted idea that the world ofmen is on the rocks spiritually, and that at no time has the spiritual life ofthe race been at such a low ebb. This idea is largely due to the fact thathumanity is not excessively interested in the orthodox presentation of truth,and that our churches are relatively empty and are under public indictment ashaving failed to teach humanity to live rightly. These affirmations aredistressingly true, but the fact still remains that human beings everywhere aresearching for spiritual release and truth, and that the truly religious spiritis more fundamentally alive than at any previous time. This is especially trueof those countries which have suffered the most in the late world war(1914-1945). Countries, such as the United States and the neutral countriesshow, as yet, no sign of any real spiritual revival. The other countries arespiritually alive—not along orthodox lines but in a true search and a vitaldemand for light.The religious spirit of humanity is today more definitely focussed upon Realitythan has ever before been the case. The orthodox world religions are rapidlyfalling into the background of men’s minds even whilst we are undoubtedlyapproaching nearer to the central spiritual Reality. The theologies now taughtby the ecclesiastical organisation (both in the East and in the West) are [138]crystallised and of relatively little use. Priests and churchmen, orthodoxinstructors and fundamentalists (fanatical though sincere) are seeking toperpetuate that which is old and which sufficed in the past to satisfy theenquirer, but which now fails to do so. Sincere but unenlightened religious menare deploring the revolt of youth from doctrinal attitudes. At the same time,along with all seekers, they are demanding a new revelation. They seek somethingnew and arresting by which to attract the masses back to God; they fear thatsomething must be relinquished, that new interpretations of old truths must befound, but fail to realise that a new outlook upon the truth (as it is inChrist) must be attained; they sense the approach of new, impending spiritualrevelations but are apt to shrink back from their revolutionary effects. Theyask themselves many questions and are assailed by deep and disturbing doubts. Itis interesting here to note that the answers to these questions come (and willincreasingly come), from two sources: the thinking masses, whose growingintellectual perception is the cause of the revolt from orthodox religion, andfrom that overshadowing source of truth and light which has unfailingly broughtrevelation down the ages. The answers will not come, as far as one can see, fromany religious organisation, whether Asiatic or Western.Some of these questions can be expressed as follows:Why has the church been unable to arrest the overpowering expression of evil, asevidenced in the late world war?Why has religion proved inadequate to the need of humanity?Why have the so-called spiritual leaders of the religious world provedthemselves incompetent to aid in the solution of the world problems?[139] Why, as exponents of the God of Love, have Christian teachers been unableto arrest the unparalleled growth of hate in the world today?Why are the majority of such teachers so sectarian, separative anddenominational in their approaches to truth? There is, however, a spiritual,open-minded minority.Why do the young people refuse to go to church and lack interest to accept thedoctrines presented for their belief?Why is death and not life stalking the world today?Why do so many new cults arise and sidetrack the people away from orthodoxorganisations of a religious nature?Why does Mental Science, the Unity Movement and the New Thought presentationattract people away from the better established organisations? Note the use ofthe word “organisations”; it holds the key to the problem.Why is there a growing emphasis upon the Eastern theologies, upon the variousyogas, upon Buddhistic teachings and oriental faiths?Why do such teachings as astrology, numerology and various magical rituals findso many adherents whilst the churches remain empty or are only attended by oldpeople, the conservatives and reactionaries or by those who go there by force ofhabit, or desperate unhappiness?What is wrong, finally, with our presentation of the spiritual realities and thetruths of the ages?Many answers can be given. The most important one is that the presentation ofdivine truth , as given by the churches in the West and by the teachers in theEast, has not kept pace with the unfolding intellect of the human spirit . Thesame old forms of words and of ideas are still handed out to the enquirer andthey do not satisfy [140] his mind nor do they meet his practical need in a mostdifficult world. He is asked to give unquestioning belief but not to understand;he is told that it is not possible for him to comprehend and yet he is asked toaccept the interpretations and the affirmations of other human minds who claimthat they do understand and that they have the truth. He does not believe thattheir minds and their interpretations are any better than his. The same oldformulas, the same old theologies and the same old interpretations are deemedadequate to meet man’s modern needs and enquiries. They are not.The church today is the tomb of the Christ and the stone of theology has beenrolled to the door of the sepulchre .There is, however, no point in attacking Christianity. Christianity cannot beattacked; it is an expression—in essence, if not yet entirely factual—of thelove of God, immanent in His created universe. Churchianity has, however, laiditself wide open to attack, and the mass of thinking people are aware of this;unfortunately, these thinking people are still a small minority. Nevertheless,it is this thinking minority which (when it is a majority and it is today arapidly growing one) will spell the doom of the churches and endorse the spreadof the true teaching of the Christ. It is not possible that He has any pleasurein the great stone temples which churchmen have built, whilst His people areleft without guidance or reasonable light upon world affairs; surely, He mustfeel (with an aching heart) that the simplicity which He taught and the simpleway to God which He emphasised have disappeared into the fogs of theology(initiated by St. Paul) and in the discussions of churchmen throughout thecenturies. Men have travelled far from the simplicity of thought and from thesimple, spiritual life which the early [141] Christians lived. Is it notpossible that the Christ may regard the separative life of the churches and thearrogance of the theologians as wrong and undesirable—dividing (as they have)the world into believer and unbeliever, into Christian and heathen, into theso-called enlightened and the so-called benighted—and as contrary to all that HeHimself held and believed when He said, “Other sheep I have which are not ofthis fold.” (John X.16.)It is not the evil rampant in the world today which is hindering the revelationand hindering the unfoldment of the spiritual life. That evil is the result ofthe misapprehension and the wrong orientation of the human mind, of the emphasisupon material things which ages of competitive activity have brought about; itrests upon the failure of the religious organizations throughout the world topreserve the truth in its purity and to avoid the fanatical idea that anyone’sindividual interpretation of truth must necessarily be the only and correct one.Theologians have fought (and with sincerity of intention) for forms of wordswhich they believed were the only true and correct formulation of the divineidea, but Christ was forgotten behind the words; churchmen have expended effortand executive ability in raising funds for the building of stone edifices whilstGod’s children everywhere went hungry and unclothed and so lost their belief indivine love.How can the need of humanity for spiritual guidance be met when the leaders ofthe churches are occupied with temporal concerns, when the emphasis is laid inthe Roman Catholic, the Greek Orthodox and the Protestant Churches upon pomp andceremonies, on great churches and stone cathedrals, upon gold and silvercommunion sets, on scarlet birettas, on jewelled vestments, and upon all theparaphernalia so cherished by the ecclesiastically minded? How [142] can thestarving children of the world—and of Europe in particular—be salvaged whenpleas go out from Popes and Bishops for money to build cathedrals and erect morechurches when the existent churches now stand empty? How can light shine againin the minds of men when churchmen keep the people in a state of fear unlessthey accept the old theological interpretations and the old ways of approachingGod? How can the spiritual and intellectual needs of the people be met when thetheological seminaries teach nothing new or appropriate to the day and age, butsend out young men to guide humanity who are grounded only in the pastinterpretations. These young men enter upon their religious training andpreparation for the ministry with high hopes and vision; they emerge with littlehope, not much faith, but with a determination to “make good” and rise toprominence in the church.The question arises whether Christ would be at home in the churches if He walkedagain among men. The rituals and the ceremonies, the pomp and the vestments, thecandles and the gold and silver, the graded order of popes, cardinals,archbishops, canons and ordinary rectors, pastors and clergy would seeminglyhave small interest for the simple Son of God, Who—when on Earth—had not whereto lay His head.The presentation of religious truth in the past has blocked the growth of thereligious spirit; theology has brought mankind to the very gates of despair; thedelicate flower of the Christ life has been stunted and arrested in the darkcaves of man’s thinking; fanatical adherence to human interpretations has takenthe place of Christian living; millions of books have obliterated the livingwords of Christ; the arguments and discussions of priests have put out the lightwhich the Buddha brought, and the love of God as revealed by the life of Christhas been forgotten [143] whilst men have quarrelled over meanings, over phrasesand words. In the meantime, men have agonised, starved, suffered, demanded helpand instruction and, unsatisfied, have lost faith.Today everywhere people are ready for the light; they are expectant of a newrevelation and of a new dispensation, and humanity has advanced so far on theway of evolution that these demands and expectations are not couched in terms ofmaterial betterment only, but in terms of a spiritual vision, true values andright human relations. They are demanding teaching and spiritual help along withthe necessary requests for food, clothes and the opportunity to work and live infreedom; they face famine in large areas of the world and yet are registering(with equal dismay) the famine of the soul.We are surely not in error if we conclude that this spiritual dismay and thisspiritual demand have assumed a paramount place in the consciousness of theChrist. When He reappears and when His Church, hitherto invisible, appears withHim, what can They do to meet this demanding cry and this intensified attitudeof spiritual perception with which They will be greeted. They see the picturewhole. The cry of the Christian for spiritual help, the cry of the Buddhist forspiritual enlightenment, and the cry of the Hindu for spiritualunderstanding—along with the cries of all those who have faith or have nofaith—must be met. The demands of humanity are rising to Their ears and theChrist and His disciples have no sectarian scruples, of that we may be sure. Itis impossible to believe that They are interested in the views of theFundamentalists or in the theories of the theologians upon the Virgin Birth, theVicarious Atonement or the Infallibility of the Pope. Humanity is in desperateneed and that need must be met; only great and fundamental [144] principles ofliving, covering the past and the present and providing a platform for thefuture, will really meet that human invocation. The Christ and the spiritualHierarchy will not come to destroy all that humanity has hitherto found“necessary to salvation,” and all that has met its spiritual demand. When theChrist reappears, the non-essentials will surely disappear; the fundamentals offaith will remain, upon which He can build that new world religion for which allmen wait. That new world religion must be based upon those truths which havestood the test of ages and which have brought assurance and comfort to meneverywhere. These surely are:1. The Fact of God.First and foremost, there must be recognition of the fact of God. That centralReality can be called by any name that man may choose according to his mental oremotional bent, racial tradition and heritage, for it cannot be defined orconditioned by names. Human beings perforce always use names in order to expressthat which they sense, feel and know, both of the phenomenal and also of theintangible. Consciously or unconsciously, all men recognise God Transcendent andGod Immanent. They sense God to be the Creator and the Inspiration of all thatis.The Eastern faiths have ever emphasised God Immanent , deep within the humanheart, “nearer than hands and feet,” the Self, the One, the Atma, smaller thanthe small, yet all-comprehensive. The Western faiths have presented GodTranscendent , outside His universe, an Onlooker. God transcendent, first ofall, conditioned men’s concept of Deity, for the action of this transcendent Godappeared in the processes of nature; later, in the Jewish [145] dispensation,God appeared as the tribal Jehovah, as the soul (the rather unpleasant soul) ofa nation. Next, God was seen as a perfected man, and the divine God-man walkedthe Earth in the Person of Christ. Today we have a rapidly growing emphasis uponGod immanent in every human being and in every created form. Today, we shouldhave the churches presenting a synthesis of these two ideas which have beensummed up for us in the statement of Shri Krishna in The Bhagavad Gita : “Havingpervaded this whole Universe with a fragment of Myself, I remain.” God, greaterthan the created whole, yet God present also in the part; God Transcendentguarantees the plan for our world and is the Purpose, conditioning all livesfrom the minutest atom, up through all the kingdoms of nature, to man.2. Man’s Relationship to God.The second truth to which all give allegiance—no matter what the faith—is thatof man’s essential relationship to God. Inherent in the humanconsciousness—inchoate often and undefined—is a sense of divinity. “We are allthe children of God” (Gal. III.26); “One is our Father, even God,” says theChrist and so say all the world Teachers and Avatars down the ages. “As He is,so are we in this world” (1 John IV.17) is another Biblical statement. “Closeris He than breathing, nearer than hands and feet,” chants the Hindu. “Christ inus, the hope of glory” is the triumphant affirmation of St. Paul.3. The Fact of Immortality and of Eternal Persistence.Third, is the sense of persistence, of eternal life or of immortality. From thisrecognition, there seems to be [146] no escape; it is as much a part ofhumanity’s reaction as is the instinct of self-preservation. With that innerconviction, we face death and we know that we shall live again, that we come andwe go and that we persist because we are divine and the controllers of our owndestiny. We know that we have set ourselves a goal and that the goal is “Lifemore abundantly”—somewhere, here, there, and eventually everywhere.The spirit in man is undying; it forever endures, progressing from point topoint and stage to stage upon the Path of Evolution, unfolding steadily andsequentially the divine attributes and aspects. This truth involves necessarilythe recognition of two great natural laws; the Law of Rebirth and the Law ofCause and Effect. The churches in the West have refused officially to recognisethe Law of Rebirth and have thereby wandered into a theological impasse and intoa cul-de-sac from which there is no possible exit. The churches in the East haveover-emphasised these laws so that a negative, acquiescent attitude to life andits processes, based on continuously renewed opportunity, controls the people.Christianity has emphasised immortality but has made eternal happiness dependentupon the acceptance of a theological dogma: Be a true professing Christian andlive in a somewhat fatuous heaven or refuse to be an accepting Christian, or anegative professional Christian, and go to an impossible hell—a hell growing outof the theology of The Old Testament and its presentation of a God, full of hateand jealousy. Both concepts are today repudiated by all sane, sincere, thinkingpeople. No one of any true reasoning power or with any true belief in a God oflove accepts the heaven of the churchmen or has any desire to go there. Stillless do they accept the “lake that burneth with fire and brimstone” (Rev.XIX.20) or the everlasting [147] torture to which a God of love is supposed tocondemn all who do not believe in the theological interpretations of the MiddleAges, of the modern fundamentalists or of the unreasoning churchmen whoseek—through doctrine, fear and threat—to keep people in line with the obsoleteold teaching. The essential truth lies elsewhere. “Whatsoever a man soweth thatshall he also reap” (Gal. VI.7) is a truth which needs re-emphasising. In thesewords, St. Paul phrases for us the ancient and true teaching of the Law of Causeand Effect, called in the Orient the Law of Karma.The immortality of the human soul, and the innate ability of the spiritual,inner man to work out his own salvation under the Law of Rebirth, in response tothe Law of Cause and Effect, are the underlying factors governing all humanconduct and all human aspiration. These two laws no man can evade. Theycondition him at all times until he has achieved the desired and the designedperfection and can manifest on earth as a rightly functioning son of God.4. The Continuity of Revelation and the Divine Approaches.A fourth essential truth and one which clarifies all the planned work of theChrist is tied in with spiritual revelation and the need of man for God and ofGod for man. Never has Deity left Itself at any time without witness. Never hasman demanded light that the light has not been forthcoming. Never has there beena time, cycle or world period when there was not the giving out of the teachingand spiritual help which human need demanded. Never did the hearts and minds ofmen go out towards God, but that divinity itself came nearer to [148] man. Thehistory of mankind is, in reality, the history of man’s demand for light and forcontact with God, and then the giving of light and the approach of God to man.Always the Saviour, the Avatar or the World Teacher issued forth from the secretplace of the Most High and brought to man fresh revelation, fresh hope and afresh incentive towards fuller spiritual living.Some of these Approaches have been of a major nature, affecting humanity as awhole and some of them are of less importance, affecting only a relatively smallpart of mankind—a nation or a group. Those Who come as the Revealers of the loveof God come from that spiritual centre to which the Christ gave the name “theKingdom of God” (Matt. VI.33). Here dwell the “spirits of just men made perfect”(Heb. XII.23); here the spiritual Guides of the race are to be found and herethe spiritual Executives of God’s plan live and work and oversee human andplanetary affairs. It is called by many names by many people. It is spoken of asthe Spiritual Hierarchy, as the Abode of Light, as the Centre where the Mastersof the Wisdom are to be found, as the Great White Lodge. From it come those whoact as Messengers of the Wisdom of God, Custodians of the truth as it is inChrist, and Those Whose task is to save the world, to impart the nextrevelation, and to demonstrate divinity. All the world Scriptures bear witnessto the existence of this centre of spiritual energy. This spiritual Hierarchyhas been steadily drawing nearer to humanity as men have become more consciousof divinity and more fitted for contact with the divine.Another great Approach of divinity and another spiritual revelation are nowpossible. A new revelation is hovering over mankind and the One Who will bringit and implement it is drawing steadily nearer to us. What [149] this greatapproach will bring to mankind, we do not yet know. It will surely bring us asdefinite results as did all the earlier revelations and the missions of ThoseWho came in response to humanity’s earlier demands. The World War has purifiedmankind. A new heaven and a new earth are on their way. What does the orthodoxtheologian and churchman mean when he uses the words “a new heaven”? May thesewords not signify something entirely new and a new conception as to the world ofspiritual realities? May not the Coming One bring us a new revelation as to thevery nature of God Himself? Do we yet know all that can be known about God? Ifso, God is very limited. May it not be possible that our present ideas of God,as the Universal Mind, as Love and as Will may be enriched by some new idea orquality for which we have as yet no name or word, and of which we have noslightest understanding. Each of the three present concepts of divinity—of theTrinity—were entirely new when first sequentially presented to the mind orconsciousness of man.For some years now the spiritual Hierarchy of our planet has been drawing nearerto humanity and its approach is responsible for the great concepts of freedomwhich are so close to the hearts of men everywhere. The dream of brotherhood, offellowship, of world cooperation and of a peace, based on right human relations,is becoming clearer in our minds. We are also visioning a new and vital worldreligion, a universal faith which will have its roots in the past, but whichwill make clear the new dawning beauty and the coming vital revelation.Of one thing we can be sure, this approach will, in some way—deeply spiritual,yet wholly factual—prove the truth of the immanence of God. The churches haveemphasised and exploited the extra-territoriality of Deity [150] and haveposited the presence of a God Who is creating, sustaining and creatively active,but at the same time outside His Creation—an inscrutable onlooker. This type oftranscendent Creator must be shown to be false and this doctrine must becountered by the manifestation of God in man, the hope of glory. It is thissurely that the expected Approach will demonstrate; it will prove also the closerelationship between God Transcendent and that in “Him we live and move and haveour being,” because, “having pervaded this entire Universe with a fragment ofHimself, He remains .” God is immanent in the forms of all created things; theglory which shall be revealed is the expression of that innate divinity in allits attributes and aspects, its qualities and powers, through the medium ofhumanity.On the fact of God and of man’s relation to the divine, on the fact ofimmortality and of the continuity of divine revelation, and upon the fact of theconstant emergence of Messengers from the divine centre, the new world religionwill be based. To these facts must be added man’s assured, instinctive knowledgeof the existence of the Path to God and of his ability to tread it, when theevolutionary process has brought him to the point of a fresh orientation todivinity and to the acceptance of the fact of God Transcendent and of GodImmanent within every form of life.These are the foundational truths upon which the world religion of the futurewill rest. Its keynote will be Divine Approach . “Draw near to Him and He willdraw near to you” (James IV.8) is the great injunction, emanating in new andclear tones from Christ and the spiritual Hierarchy at this time.The great theme of the new world religion will be the recognition of the manydivine approaches and the continuity of revelation which each of them conveyed;the [151] task ahead of the spiritually minded people of the world today is toprepare humanity for the imminent and (perhaps) the greatest of all theApproaches. The method employed will be the scientific and intelligent use ofInvocation and Evocation and the recognition of their tremendous potency.Man invokes divine Approach in various ways: by means of the inchoate, voicelessappeal or invocative cry of the masses and also by the planned, definedinvocation of the spiritually oriented aspirants, the intelligently convincedworker, disciple and initiate—by all, in fact, who form the New Group of WorldServers.The science of invocation and evocation will take the place of what we now call“prayer” and “worship.” Be not disturbed by the use of the word “science.” It isnot the cold and heartless intellectual thing so oft depicted. It is in realitythe intelligent organisation of spiritual energy and of the forces of love, andthese, when effective, will evoke the response of spiritual Beings Who can againwalk openly among men, and thus establish a close relation and a constantcommunication between humanity and the spiritual Hierarchy.In order to clarify, it might be said that Invocation is of three kinds: thereis, as stated above, the massed demand, unconsciously voiced, and the cryingappeal, wrung from the hearts of men in all times of crisis such as the present.This invocative cry rises ceaselessly from all men living in the midst ofdisaster; it is addressed to that power outside themselves which they feel canand should come to their help in their moment of extremity. This great andwordless invocation is rising everywhere today. Then there is the invocationalspirit, evidenced by sincere men as they participate in the rites of theirreligion and take advantage of the opportunity of united worship [152] andprayer to lay their demands for help before God. This group, added to the massof men, creates a huge body of invocative applicants and at this time, theirmassed intent is in great evidence and their invocation is rising to the MostHigh. Then, lastly there are the trained disciples and aspirants of the worldwho use certain forms of words, certain carefully defined invocations and who—asthey do this—focus the invocative cry and the invocative appeal of the other twogroups, giving it right direction and power. All these three groups are,consciously or unconsciously, swinging into activity at this time and theirunited effort guarantees a resultant evocation.This new invocative work will be the keynote of the coming world religion andwill fall into two parts. There will be the invocative work of the masses of thepeople, everywhere, trained by the spiritually minded people of the world(working in the churches whenever possible under an enlightened clergy) toaccept the fact of the approaching spiritual energies, focussed through Christand His spiritual Hierarchy, and trained also to voice their demand for light,liberation and understanding. There will also be the skilled work of invocationas practised by those who have trained their minds through right meditation, whoknow the potency of formulas, mantrams and invocations and who work consciously.They will increasingly use certain great formulas of words which will later begiven to the race, just as the Lord’s Prayer was given by the Christ, and as theNew Invocation has been given out for use at this time by the Hierarchy.This new religious science for which prayer, meditation and ritual have preparedhumanity, will train its people to present—at stated periods throughout theyear—the voiced demand of the people of the world for relationship [153] withGod and for a closer spiritual relation to each other. This work, when rightlycarried forward, will evoke response from the waiting Hierarchy and from itsHead, the Christ. Through this response, the belief of the masses will graduallybe changed into the conviction of the knowers. In this way, the mass of men willbe transformed and spiritualised, and the two great divine centres of energy orgroups—the Hierarchy and Humanity itself—will begin to work in completeat-one-ment and unity. Then the Kingdom of God will indeed and in truth befunctioning on earth.It will be apparent to you that it is only possible to indicate the broadgeneral outlines of the new world religion. The expansion of the humanconsciousness which will take place as a result of the coming Great Approachwill enable humanity to grasp not only its relation to the spiritual life of ourplanet, the “One in Whom we live and move and have our being,” but will alsogive a glimpse of the relation of our planet to the circle of planetary lives,moving within the orbit of the Sun and the still greater circle of spiritualinfluences which contact our system as it pursues its orbit in the Heavens (thetwelve constellations of the zodiac). Astronomical and astrologicalinvestigation has demonstrated this relationship and the influences exerted butthere is still speculation and much foolish claiming and interpretation. Yet thechurches have ever recognized this and the Bible has testified to it. “The starsin their courses fought against Sisera” (Judges V.20). “Who can withstand thesweet influences of the Pleiades?” (Job XXXVIII.31). Many other passages bearout this contention of the Knowers. Many church festivals are fixed by referenceto the moon or a zodiacal constellation. Investigation will prove this to be thecase and when the ritual of the new world religion is universally [154]established, this will be one of the important factors considered.The establishing of certain major festivals in relation to the Moon and in alesser degree to the zodiac will bring about a strengthening of the spirit ofinvocation and the resultant inflow of evoked influences. The truth lying behindall invocation is based upon the power of thought, particularly in itstelepathic nature, rapport and aspect. The unified, invocative thought of themasses and the focussed, directed thought of the New Group of World Serversconstitute an outgoing stream of energy . This will reach telepathically thosespiritual Beings Who are sensitive and responsive to such impacts. Their evokedresponse, sent out as spiritual energy , will in turn reach humanity afterhaving been stepped down into thought energy and in that form will make its dueimpact upon the minds of men, convincing them and carrying inspiration andrevelation. Thus has it ever been in the history of the spiritual unfoldment ofthe world and the procedure followed in writing the world Scriptures.Secondly, the establishing of a certain uniformity in the world religiousrituals will aid men everywhere to strengthen each other’s work and enhancepowerfully the thought currents directed to the waiting spiritual Lives. Atpresent, the Christian religion has its great festivals, the Buddhist keeps hisdifferent set spiritual events, and the Hindu has still another list of holydays. In the future world, when organised, all men of spiritual inclination andintention everywhere will keep the same holy days. This will bring about apooling of spiritual resources, and a united spiritual effort, plus asimultaneous spiritual invocation. The potency of this will be apparent.Let me indicate the possibilities of such spiritual events, and attempt toprophesy the nature of the coming worldwide [155] Festivals. There will be threesuch major Festivals each year, concentrated in three consecutive months andleading, therefore, to a prolonged annual spiritual effort which will affect theremainder of the year. These will be:1. The Festival of Easter. This is the Festival of the risen, living Christ, theTeacher of all men and the Head of the Spiritual Hierarchy. He is the Expressionof the love of God. On this day the spiritual Hierarchy, which He guides anddirects, will be recognised and the nature of God’s love will be emphasised.This Festival is determined always by the date of the first Full Moon of springand is the great Western and Christian Festival.2. The Festival of Wesak . This is the Festival of the Buddha, the spiritualIntermediary between the highest spiritual centre, Shamballa, and the Hierarchy.The Buddha is the expression of the wisdom of God, the Embodiment of Light andthe Indicator of the divine purpose. This will be fixed annually in relation tothe Full Moon of May, as is at present the case. It is the great EasternFestival.3. The Festival of Goodwill . This will be the Festival of the spirit ofhumanity—aspiring towards God, seeking conformity with the will of God anddedicated to the expression of right human relation. This will be fixed annuallyin relation to the Full Moon of June. It will be a day whereon the spiritual anddivine nature of mankind will be recognised. On this Festival for two thousandyears the Christ has represented humanity and has [156] stood before theHierarchy and in the sight of Shamballa as the God-Man, the leader of His peopleand “the Eldest in a great family of brothers” (Romans VIII.29). Each year atthat time He has preached the last sermon of the Buddha, before the assembledHierarchy. This will, therefore, be a festival of deep invocation and appeal, ofa basic aspiration towards fellowship, of human and spiritual unity, and willrepresent the effect in the human consciousness of the work of the Buddha and ofthe Christ.These three Festivals are already being kept throughout the world, though theyare not as yet related to each other and are a part of the unified spiritualApproach of humanity. The time is coming when all three Festivals will be keptthroughout the world and by their means a great spiritual unity will be achievedand the effects of the Great Approach, so close to us at this time, will bestabilised by the united invocation of humanity throughout the planet.The remaining full moons will constitute lesser festivals but will be recognisedto be also of vital importance. They will establish the divine attributes in theconsciousness of man, just as the major festivals establish the three divineaspects. These aspects and qualities will be arrived at and determined by aclose study of the nature of a particular constellation or constellationsinfluencing those months. For instance, Capricorn will call attention to thefirst initiation, the birth of the Christ in the cave of the heart, and indicatethe training needed to bring about that great spiritual event in the life of theindividual man. I give this one instance to you in order to indicate thepossibilities for spiritual unfoldment that [157] could be given through anunderstanding of these influences and in order to revivify the ancient faiths byexpanding them into their larger undying relationships.Thus, the twelve annual festivals will constitute a revelation of divinity. Theywill present a means of bringing about relationship, first of all, during threemonths with the three great spiritual Centres, the three expressions of thedivine Trinity. The minor festivals will emphasise the inter-relation of theWhole, thus lifting the divine presentation out of the individual and thepersonal, into that of the universal divine Purpose; the relationship of theWhole to the part and of the part to that Whole will be thereby fully expressed.Humanity will, therefore, invoke the spiritual power of the Kingdom of God, theHierarchy; the Hierarchy will respond, and God’s plans will then be worked outon earth. The Hierarchy, on a higher turn of the spiral will invoke the “Centrewhere the Will of God is known,” thus invoking the Purpose of God. Thus will theWill of God be implemented by Love and manifested intelligently; for thismankind is ready, and for this the Earth waits.To sum up therefore: on the basis of the fundamental truth already recognisedthe new world religion will be built.The definition of religion which will in the future prove of greater accuracythan any yet formulated by the theologians might be expressed as follows:Religion is the name given to the invocative appeal of humanity and theevocative response of the greater Life to that cry.It is, in fact, the recognition by the part of its relationship [158] to theWhole, plus a constantly growing demand for increased awareness of thatrelation; it draws forth the recognition of the Whole that the demand has beenmade. It is the impact of the vibration of humanity—oriented specifically to theGreat Life of which it feels itself a part—upon that Life and the responsiveimpact of that “All-surrounding Love” upon the lesser vibration. It is only nowthat the impact of the human vibration can dimly be sensed in Shamballa;hitherto its most potent activity has only reached the Hierarchy. Religion, thescience of invocation and evocation as far as humanity is concerned, is theapproach (in the coming New Age) of a mentally polarised humanity. In the past,religion has had an entirely emotional appeal. It concerned the relation of theindividual to the world of reality, of the seeking aspirant to the sought-fordivinity. Its technique was the process of fitting oneself for the revelation ofthat divinity, of achieving a perfection which would warrant that revelation,and of developing a sensitivity and a loving response to the ideal Man,summarised, for present day humanity, in the Christ. Christ came to end thecycle of this emotional approach which had existed since Atlantean days; Hedemonstrated in Himself the visioned perfection and then presented to humanityan example—in full manifestation—of every possibility latent in man up to thattime . The achieving of the perfection of the Christ-consciousness became theemphasised goal of humanity.Today, slowly, the concept of a world religion and the need for its emergenceare widely desired and worked for. The fusion of faiths is now a field fordiscussion. Workers in the field of religion will formulate the universalplatform of the new world religion. It is a work of loving synthesis and willemphasise the unity and the fellowship of the spirit. This group is, in apronounced sense, a [159] channel for the activities of the Christ, the worldTeacher. The platform of the new world religion will be built by many groups,working under the inspiration of the Christ.Churchmen need to remember that the human spirit is greater than all thechurches and greater than their teaching. In the long run, that human spiritwill defeat them and proceed triumphantly into the Kingdom of God, leaving themfar behind unless they enter as a humble part of the mass of men. Nothing underheaven can arrest the progress of the human soul on its long pilgrimage fromdarkness to light, from the unreal to the real, from death to immortality andfrom ignorance to wisdom. If the great organised religious groups of churches inevery land, and composing all faiths do not offer spiritual guidance and help,humanity will find another way. Nothing can keep the spirit of man from God.The churches in the West need also to realise that basically there is only oneChurch, but it is not necessarily only the orthodox Christian institution. Godworks in many ways, through many faiths and religious agencies; this is onereason for the elimination of non-essential doctrines. By the emphasising of theessential doctrines and in their union will the fullness of truth be revealed.This, the new world religion will do and its implementation will proceed apace,after the reappearance of the Christ."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVEN - PREPARATION FOR THE REAPPEARANCE OF THE CHRISTThe Needed PreparationThe Work of the New Group of World Servers[160] If the general premise and theme of all that has been here written isaccepted, the question necessarily arises: What should be done to hasten thisreappearance of the Christ? and also: Is there anything that the individual cando, in the place where he is and with the equipment, opportunities and assets ofwhich he stands possessed? The opportunity is so great and the need for definiteand explicit spiritual help is so demanding that—whether we like it or not—weare faced with a challenge. We are confronted with the choice of acceptance andconsequent responsibility, or with rejection of the idea and the consequentrealisation that we are not concerned. What we decide, however, in this time andperiod, will definitely affect the remainder of our life activity, for we shalleither throw what weight or aid we can on the side of the invocation of theChrist and in preparation for His return, or we shall join the ranks of thosewho regard the whole proposition as an appeal to the gullible and the credulous,and possibly work to prevent men being deceived and taken in by what we havedecided is a fraud. Herein lies our challenge. It will take all that we have ofa sense of values and all that we can give to a specialised intuitive researchto meet it. We may then realise that this promised reappearance is in line withgeneral religious [161] belief and the major hope left in the minds of men whichcan bring true relief to suffering humanity.To those who accept the possibility of His reappearance and who are willing toadmit that history can again repeat itself, there are three questions which canbe asked—the answers to which are strictly individual. These are:1. How can I personally meet this challenge?2. What can I specifically do ?3. What are the steps which I should take and where are those who will take themwith me?What is written here and in the following pages is essentially for those whoaccept the fact of Christ, recognise the continuity of revelation and arewilling to admit the possibility of His return.The complexities and the difficulties of this post-war period are very great.The closer a man may be to the source of spiritual light and power, the moredifficult is his problem, for human affairs at this time seem so far away fromthis divine possibility. He will need all that he has of patience, understandingand goodwill. At the same time, the clearer will be his recognition of thefacts. There are inner and outer problems which must be solved; there are innerand outer possibilities which can be made factual. As the spiritually-minded manfaces both these inner and outer possibilities and events, it is easy toregister a sense of complete frustration; he longs to help but knows not what todo; his grasp of the menacing difficulties, his analysis of his resources and ofthose with whom he will have to work, and his clarity of perception as to theforces [162] ranged against him (and on a much larger scale against the Christ)will make him inclined to ask: “What is the use of any effort which I can make?Why not let the forces of good and evil fight it out alone? Why not permit thepressure of the evolutionary current—eventually and at long last—to bringcessation to the world fight and usher in the triumph of the good? Why attemptanything now ?”These are natural and wholesome reactions. The poverty and starvation of themillions in Europe and elsewhere, the fear of Russia (warranted or unwarranted),the greed of the capitalistic forces of the world, the selfishness of labour,the aggressiveness of the Zionists, claiming as their own a land which has notbeen theirs for more than fifteen hundred years, the plight of the Jews inEurope, the desperation of the little man in every country who sees no securityor hope anywhere, the work of the churches as they endeavour to restore the oldorder and rule which (over the centuries) has saved the world from little, andthe lack of any clear voice or leadership in any country—all these things makethe average man feel the futility of all effort. The problem seems too big, tooterrible, and he himself seems too small and helpless.Nevertheless, the mass of straight goodness and vision in the world is enormousand the amount of clear, humanitarian thinking is unbounded; it is in the handsof the masses of good little men and the millions of right thinking people inevery land that the salvation of the world lies and by them the preparatory workfor the Coming of the Christ will be done. Numerically, they are adequate to thetask and need only re-assurance and wise coordination to prepare them for theservice required, [163] before the reappearance of the Christ becomes possible.The problems confronting us should be faced with courage , with truth andunderstanding; as well as with the willingness to speak factually, withsimplicity and with love in the effort to expose the truth and clarify theproblems which must be solved. The opposing forces of entrenched evil must berouted before He for Whom all men wait, the Christ, can come.The knowledge that He is ready and anxious publicly to appear to His lovedHumanity only adds to the sense of general frustration, and another very vitalquestion arises: For what period of time must we endure, struggle and fight? Thereply comes with clarity: He will come unfailingly when a measure of peace hasbeen restored, when the principle of sharing is at least in process ofcontrolling economic affairs, and when churches and political groups have begunto clean house. Then He can and will come; then the Kingdom of God will bepublicly recognised and will no longer be a thing of dreams and of wishfulthinking and orthodox hope.People are prone to ask the question as to why the Christ does not come—in thepomp and ceremony which the churches ascribe to the event—and, by His coming,demonstrate His divine power, prove convincingly the authority and the potencyof God, and thus end the cycle of agony and distress. The answers to this aremany. It must be remembered that the main objective of the Christ will not be todemonstrate power but to make public the already existent Kingdom of God .Again, when He came before He was unrecognised, and is there any guarantee thatthis time it would be different? You may ask why would He not be recognised?Because men’s eyes are blinded with the tears of self-pity and not ofcontrition; because the hearts of men are still corroded with [164] aselfishness which the agony of war has not cured; because the standards of valueare the same as in the corrupt Roman Empire which saw His first appearance, onlythen these standards were localised and not universal as they are today; becausethose who could recognise Him and who hope and long for His coming are notwilling to make the needed sacrifices, and thus ensure the success of Hisadvent.The advanced thinking, the success of the many esoteric movements and above all,the marvels of science and the wonder of the many humanitarian movements,indicate no divine frustration but growth of spiritual understanding; the forcesof the spirit are unconquered. These aspects of human behaviour indicate thewonder of the divinity which is in man and the success of the divine plan forhumanity. Divinity, however, awaits the expression of man’s free will ; hisintelligence and his growth in goodwill are already being expressed.Therefore, another answer to the question posited is that Christ and thespiritual Hierarchy never—no matter how great the need or important theincentive—infringe upon the divine right of men to make their own decisions, toexert their own free will and to achieve freedom by fighting forfreedom—individually, nationally and internationally. When true freedom coversthe earth, we shall see the end of tyranny—politically, religiously andeconomically. I am not here referring to modern democracy as a condition whichmeets the need, for democracy is at present a philosophy of wishful thinking andan unachieved ideal. I refer to that period which will surely come in which anenlightened people will rule; these people will not tolerate authoritarianism inany church or totalitarianism in any political system; they will not accept orpermit the rule of any body of men who undertake [165] to tell them what theymust believe in order to be saved or what government they must accept. When thepeople are told the truth and when they can freely judge and decide forthemselves, we shall then see a much better world.It is not essential or necessary that all these desirable objectives should beaccomplished facts upon Earth before Christ again moves amongst us. It is,however, necessary that this attitude to religion and politics is generallyregarded as desirable and that steps have been successfully taken in thedirection of right human relations. It is along these lines that the New Groupof World Servers and all men of goodwill are working, and their first effortmust be to offset the widespread sense of frustration and individual futility.That which will offset the sense of frustration and futility and providelikewise the needed incentive towards the re-building of the new world will bethe belief in the essential divinity of humanity, in the evolutionary proof(which a little study quickly provides) that mankind has steadily moved onwardin wisdom and knowledge, and a wide inclusiveness, plus the development of thatstate of mind which will base itself upon belief in the veracity of thehistorical records which bear witness to the many advents at crucial times inhuman affairs, and to the many world Saviours—of Whom the Christ was thegreatest. A right and constructive attitude must also be based on an innaterecognition of the existence of the Christ and of His Presence with us at alltimes; it must be grounded in the knowledge that the war—with all itsunspeakable horrors, its cruelties and its cataclysmic disasters—was but thebroom of the Father of all, sweeping away all obstructions in the path of Hisreturning Son. It would have been well-nigh impossible to prepare [166] for thecoming in the face of the pre-war conditions. Upon these facts the New Group ofWorld Servers must, today, take their stand. They must recognise the obstructingfactors, but must also refuse to be frustrated by them; they must be aware ofthe hindrances (many of them financial and based on material greed, on ancienttradition and national prejudices). They must then employ such skill in actionand such business acumen that these hindrances will be overcome; they must walkclear-eyed through world difficulties and pass unscathed and successful throughthe midst of all frustrating factors.There are two major factors which condition the present opportunity; these canbe regarded as so completely hindering that unless they are removed, there willbe a long delay before Christ can return. They are:1. The inertia of the average Christian or spiritually-minded man in everycountry—Eastern or Western.2. The lack of money for the work of preparation.We will keep these themes simple and down on the level at which most people workand think today. Let us be intensely practical and force ourselves to look atconditions as they are , thus arriving at a better knowledge of ourselves and ofour motives.1. The Inertia of the Average Spiritually-Minded Man .The average spiritually-minded person, man of goodwill, or disciple isconstantly aware of the challenge of the times and the opportunity whichspiritual events may offer. The desire to do good and to accomplish spiritualends are ceaselessly gnawing away within his consciousness. No one who loves hisfellowmen, who has a dream [167] of seeing the Kingdom of God materialise onearth, or who is conscious of the awakening—slow though it may be—of the massesto the higher spiritual values but is thoroughly dissatisfied. He realises thatwhat he contributed of help to these desirable objectives is little indeed. Heknows that his spiritual life is a side issue; it is something which he keepscarefully to himself and which he is frequently afraid to mention to his nearestand his dearest; he tries to dovetail his spiritual efforts into his ordinary,outer life, struggling to find time and opportunity for it in a gentle, futileand innocuous manner. He finds himself helpless before the task of organisingand rearranging his affairs so that the spiritual way of living may dominate; hesearches for alibis for himself and eventually rationalises himself sosuccessfully that he ends by deciding that he is doing the best he can in thegiven circumstances. The truth is that he is doing so little that probably onehour out of the twenty-four (or perhaps two) would cover the time given to theMaster’s work; he hides behind the alibi that his home obligations prevent hisdoing more and does not realise that—given tact and loving understanding—hishome environment can and must be the field in which he triumphs; he forgets thatthere exist no circumstances in which the spirit of man can be defeated or inwhich the aspirant cannot meditate, think, talk and prepare the way for thecoming of the Christ, provided he cares enough and knows the meaning ofsacrifice and silence. Circumstances and environment offer no true obstacle tothe spiritual life.Perhaps he hides behind the alibi of poor health and frequently behind that ofimaginary ills. He gives so much time to the care of himself that the hourswhich could be given to the Master’s work are directly and [168] seriouslycurtailed; he is so pre-occupied with feeling tired, or tending a cold, or withfancied heart difficulties that his “body consciousness” steadily develops untilit eventually dominates his life; it is then too late to do anything. This isparticularly the case with people who have reached their fiftieth year or over.It is an alibi which it is hard not to use, for many feel tired and ailing andthis, as the years go by, is apt to get worse.The only cure for this creeping inertia is to ignore the body and take your joyin the livingness of service. I speak here not of definite disease or of seriousphysical liabilities; to these right care and attention must be duly given; Ispeak to the thousands of ailing men and women who are pre-occupied with takingcare of themselves, and so waste hours of the time which could be given to theservice of humanity. Those who are seeking to tread the Path of Discipleshipshould release those many hours spent in needless self-care into the service ofthe Hierarchy.Still another alibi, leading to inertia, is the fear people have of speakingabout the things of the kingdom of God to others; they are afraid of beingrebuffed, or of being thought peculiar, or of intruding. They, therefore,preserve silence, lose opportunity and never discover how ready people are forthe discussion of realities, for the comfort and hope which the thought ofChrist’s return can bring, or for the sharing of spiritual light. This isessentially a form of spiritual cowardice but is so widespread that it isresponsible for the loss of millions of hours of world service.There are other alibis, but those above noted are the most common; the releaseof the majority of people from these hindering conditions would bring to theservice of the Christ so many hours and so much overtime endeavour that the taskof those who admit no alibis would [169] be greatly lightened and the coming ofthe Christ would be much nearer than it is today. To the rhythm of life underwhich the Christ and the spiritual Hierarchy operate, and which vibrates inharmony with human need and spiritual response, we are not called. We are,however, called to demonstrate the quality of spiritual activity and to refuseto hide behind alibis. It is essential that all spiritual people recognise thatin the place where they now are, among the people who are their associates andwith the psychological and physical equipment with which they are endowed, theycan and must work . There is no possible coercion or undue pressure exerted inthe service of the Hierarchy. The situation is clear and simple.There are, at the present time, three great activities going on:-First, the activity to be felt in the “centre where the will of God is known,”that will-to-good which has carried all creation on toward a greater glory and asteadily deepening, intelligent responsiveness. This today is creativelyendeavouring to bring in the new world order, the order of the Kingdom of Godunder the physical supervision of the Christ. This might be regarded as theexternalisation of the spiritual Hierarchy of our planet. Of this, the return ofthe Christ to visible activity will be the sign and the symbol.Secondly, the critical activity which is conditioning the spiritual Hierarchy,from the Christ Himself down to the lowest aspirant to be found on the peripheryof that “centre where the love of God” has full play. There , it is fullyrealised that (in the words of St. Paul) “the whole creation groaneth andtravaileth in pain together until now, waiting for the manifestation of the Sonsof God” (Romans VIII.22). It is for that manifestation They now prepare, these“Sons of God Who are the Sons [170] of Men;” it is for this coming forth toouter active service that They are already—one by one—entering into outeractivity upon the physical plane. They are not recognised for what They are, butThey go about the Father’s business, demonstrating goodwill, seeking to enlargethe horizon of humanity, and thus prepare the way for the One Whom They serve,the Christ, the Master of all the Masters and the Teacher alike of angels and ofmen.Thirdly, there is humanity itself, “the centre which we call the race of men”—acentre at present full of chaos, turmoil and confusion, a humanity full of pain,bewilderment, disturbance, yet mentally aware of infinite possibilities,emotionally fighting for that plan which seems to them to be the best, but withno sense of coherency or any realisation that it must be the “one world for theone humanity.” They desire simply emotional peace, security in which to live andwork, and a vision of a future which will satisfy some inchoate sense of divinepersistence. They are physically ill, deprived for the most part of theessentials of normal wholesome living, wracked with the sense of financialinsecurity and—consciously or unconsciously—invoking the Father of all on behalfof themselves and of the rest of the world.The solution is to be found in the reappearance of the Christ . This is theascertained will of God, and to it the Scriptures of the world testify; it isthe desire of Christ Himself and of His disciples, the Masters of the Wisdom; itis the unrealised demand of peoples in all lands. Where there is thisunification of purpose, this uniformity of spiritual intention and of realiseddemand, then there is only one thing which can arrest His reappearance and thatis the failure of mankind to prepare the world stage for that stupendous event,to “prepare the Way of the Lord, make His paths straight” (Matthew III.3), to[171] familiarise the people everywhere with the idea of His coming, and bringabout the required measure of peace on earth—a peace based upon right humanrelations.It is surely needless here to deal with the theme of the preparation which theindividual should make within himself as he prepares for the work to be done.Men have had the principles of right spiritual conduct presented to them forcenturies, though largely because good conduct will lead them to a good heaven,the aim has been basically selfish. The little prayer which says, “Lord GodAlmighty! Let there be peace on earth and let it begin with me,” sums up all therequirements for those who seek to work in preparation for the coming of theChrist, if to it is added the development of a sound intelligence and thepractice of an organised life. But today the motive shifts from the concept ofpersonal salvation (which is assumed or taken for granted), and the preparationrequired is that of working, with strength and understanding, to bring aboutright human relations—a broader objective. There we have a motive which is notself-centred but which ranges each individual worker and humanitarian on theside of the spiritual Hierarchy, putting him in touch with all men of goodwill.We come now to the second of the major hindrances: the lack of financial supportfor the workers of the Christ.2. Lack of Financial Support for the Work of the Christ.This is perhaps the major difficulty, and it appears to many at times to be aninsuperable one. It involves the problem of true financial trusteeship and thedeflection of adequate sums of money into channels which will definitely aid inthe work of preparation for the return [172] of the Christ. It is closely tiedup with the problem of right human relations.The problem is, therefore, a peculiarly hard one, for the spiritual workers ofthe world have not only to train people to give (according to their means) but,in many cases, they have—first of all—to provide them with a motive so magneticin its appeal that they must perforce give. They have also to provide the trust,foundation or organisation through which the given money may be administered.This presents them with a most impressively difficult task. The impasse which atpresent exists is not based only upon the novelty of raising funds inpreparation for the return of the Christ, but it is based also upon the trainedselfishness of the majority who own the world’s wealth and who—even if they dogive—do so because it fosters prestige and indicates financial success.Necessarily, there are exceptions to this but they are relatively few.Generalising, therefore, and over-simplifying the subject, we can assume thatmoney finds its way into four main channels of expenditure:1. Into the myriad homes in the world in the form of wages, salaries orinherited wealth. All this is at present most unevenly balanced, producingextreme riches or extreme poverty.2. Into great capitalistic systems and monopolies which are found as toweringstructures in most lands. Whether this capital is owned by the government, or bya municipality, or by a handful of wealthy men or by the great labour unionsmatters not. Little of it is spent in the betterment of human living or for theinculcation of those values which lead to right human relations. [173]3. Into the churches and religious groups throughout the world. Here (againspeaking in general terms and at the same time recognising the existence of aspiritually-minded minority) the money is deflected into the material aspects ofthe work, into the multiplying and preservation of ecclesiastical structures,into salaries and general overhead, and only a percentage of it really goes intothe teaching of the people, into a living demonstration of the simplicity “as itis in Christ,” and into the spreading of the fact of His return—for centuries adefinite doctrine of the churches. That return has been anticipated down theages, and might have occurred ere now had the churches and religiousorganisations everywhere done their duty.4. Into philanthropic, educational and medical work. All of this has beenexceedingly good and greatly needed and the debt of the world to thepublic-spirited men who have made these institutions possible is great indeed.All of this has been a step in the right direction and an expression of thedivine will-to-good. It is, however, frequently money misused and misdirectedand the values developed have been largely institutional and concrete. They havebeen limited by the separative tenets of the donors, or the religious prejudicesof those who control the disbursement of the funds. In the quarrelling overideas, religious theories and ideologies, the true assistance of the OneHumanity is overlooked.The fact remains that had the directing agencies (through whose hands the moneyof the world is channelled) any true vision of the spiritual realities, of the[174] one humanity and the one world, and had their objective been thestimulation of right human relations, the mass of men everywhere would beresponding to a future possibility very different from the present one; we wouldnot be faced as we are today with the expenditures—running into countlessbillions—necessitated by the need to restore physically , not only the physicalbodies of countless millions of men, but entire cities, transportation systemsand centres responsible for the reorganisation of human living.Equally, it can be said that if the spiritual values and the spiritualresponsibilities attached to money (in large quantities or in small) had beenproperly appreciated and taught in homes and schools, we would not have had theappalling statistics of the money spent, prior to the war in every country inthe world (and spent today in the Western Hemisphere) on candy, liquor,cigarettes, recreation, unnecessary clothes and luxuries. These statistics runinto hundreds of millions of dollars every year. A fraction of this money,necessitating the minimum of sacrifice, would enable the disciples of the Christand the New Group of World Servers to prepare the way for His coming and toeducate the minds and hearts of men in every land in right human relations.Money—as with all else in human living—has been tainted by selfishness andgrabbed for selfish individual or national ends. Of this, the World War(1914-1945) is the proof, for, although there was much talk of “saving the worldfor democracy” and “fighting a war to end war,” the main motive wasself-protection and self-preservation, the hope of gain and the satisfaction ofancient hatreds, and the regaining of territory. The years which have elapsedsince the war have proved this to be so. The United Nations is unfortunatelyperforce occupied with rapacious demands from all sides, with the angling [175]of the nations for position and power, and for the possession of the naturalresources of the earth—coal, oil, etc., and also with the underground activitiesof the great Powers and of the capitalists which they all create.Yet all the time, the one humanity—no matter what the place of residence, whatthe colour of the skin, or what the religious belief—is clamouring for peace,justice and a sense of security. This, the right use of money and a realisationon the part of many of their financial responsibility (a responsibility based onthe spiritual values) would rapidly give them. With the exception of a few greatfar-sighted philanthropists and of a mere handful of enlightened statesmen,churchmen and educators, this sense of financial responsibility is to be foundnowhere.The time has now come when money must be revaluated and its usefulnesschannelled into new directions. The voice of the people must prevail, but itmust be a people educated in the true values, in the significances of a rightculture and in the need for right human relations. It is, therefore, essentiallya question of right education and correct training in world citizenship—a thingthat has not yet been undertaken. Who can give this training? Russia wouldgladly train the world in the ideals of communism, and would gather all themoney in the world into the coffers of the proletariat, eventually producing thegreatest capitalistic system the world has ever seen; Great Britain would gladlytrain the world in the British concepts of justice and fair play and worldtrade, and would do it more correctly than any other nation because of vastexperience but always too with an eye to profit. The United States would alsogladly undertake to force the American brand of democracy upon the world, usingher vast capital and resources in so doing, and gathering into her banks thefinancial results of her widespread financial [176] dealings, preserving themsafely by the threat of the atomic bomb and the shaking of the mailed fist overthe rest of the world. France will keep Europe in a state of unrest as she seeksto regain her lost prestige and garner all she can from the victory of the otherallied nations. Thus the story goes—each nation fighting for itself, and allrating each other in terms of resources and finance. In the meantime, humanitystarves, remains uneducated, and is brought up on false values and the wrong useof money. Until these things are in process of being righted, the return of theChrist is not possible.In the face of this disturbing financial situation—what is the answer to theproblem? There are men and women to be found in every land, every government,every church and religion, and every educational foundation who have the answer.What hope is there for them and for the work with which they have beenentrusted? How can the people of the world, the men of goodwill and of spiritualvision help? Is there anything they can do to change the thinking of the worldin regard to money, thus deflecting it into channels where it will be morecorrectly used? The answer must be found.There are two groups who can do much: those already using the financialresources of the world, if they will catch the new vision and also see thehandwriting on the wall which is bringing the old order down in destruction,and, secondly, the mass of the good, kindly, people in all classes and spheresof influence.Men of goodwill and of spiritual inclination must reject the thought of theirrelative uselessness, insignificance and futility, and realise that now (in thecritical and crucial moment that has come) they can work potently. The Forces ofEvil are defeated, though not yet “sealed” behind the door where humanity canput them [177] and which The New Testament foretold would happen. Evil isseeking every avenue available for a new approach but—and this we can say withconfidence and insistence—the little people of the world, enlightened andselfless in their viewpoint, exist in sufficient numbers to make their powerfelt —if they will. There are millions of spiritually-minded men and women inevery country who, when they come to the point of approaching in mass formationthis question of money, can permanently re-channel it . There are writers andthinkers in all lands who can add their powerful help, and who will, ifcorrectly approached. There are esoteric students and devoted church people towhom appeal can be made for aid in preparing the way for the return of Christ,particularly if the aid required is the expenditure of money and time for theestablishing of right human relations and the growth and spread of goodwill.A great campaign to raise money is not demanded, but the selfless work ofthousands of apparently unimportant people is required. I would say that themost needed quality is courage ; it takes courage to put aside diffidence,shyness and the dislike of presenting a point of view, particularly a point ofview connected with money. It is here that the majority fail. It is relativelyeasy today to raise money for the Red Cross, for hospitals and for educationalinstitutions. It is exceedingly difficult to raise money for the spread ofgoodwill, or to secure the right use of money for forward looking ideas, such asthe return of the Christ. Therefore, I say that the first prerequisite isCourage.The second requirement for the workers of the Christ is to make those sacrificesand arrangements which will enable them to give to the limit of their capacity;there must not be simply a trained ability to present the subject, [178] buteach worker must practise what he preaches. If, for instance, the millions ofpeople who love the Christ and seek to serve His cause gave at least a tiny sumof money each year, there would be adequate funds for His work; the neededtrusts and spiritually-minded trustees would then automatically appear. Thedifficulty is not with the organising of the money and work; it lies with theseeming inability of people to give. For one reason or another, they give littleor nothing, even when interested in such a cause as that of the return ofChrist; fear of the future or the love of purchasing, or the desire to givepresents, or failure to realise that many small sums mount up into very largesums—all these things militate against financial generosity and the reasonalways seems adequate. Therefore, the second prerequisite is for everyone togive as they can.Thirdly, the metaphysical schools and the esoteric groups have given muchthought to this business of directing money into channels which appeal to them.The question is often asked: Why do the Unity School of thought, the ChristianScience Church, and many New Thought movements always manage to accumulate therequired funds whilst other groups, and particularly the esoteric groups, donot? Why do truly spiritual workers seem unable to materialise what they need?The answer is a simple one. Those groups and workers who are the closest to thespiritual ideal are as a house divided against itself. Their main interest is onabstract, spiritual levels and they have not apparently grasped the fact thatthe physical plane, when motivated from the spiritual levels, is of equalimportance. The large metaphysical schools are focussed on making a materialdemonstration , and so great is their emphasis and so one-pointed is theirapproach that they get what they demand; they have to learn that [179] thedemand and its answer must be the result of spiritual purpose, and that thatwhich is demanded must not be for the use of the separated self or for aseparative organisation or church. In the new age which is upon us, prior to thereturn of the Christ, the demand for financial support must be for the bringingabout of right human relations and goodwill, and not for the growth of anyparticular organisation. The organisations so demanding must work with theminimum of overhead and central plant, and the workers for the minimum yetreasonable salary. Not many such organisations exist today, but the few nowfunctioning can set an example which will be rapidly followed, as the desire forthe return of Christ grows. Therefore the third prerequisite is the service ofthe one humanity.The fourth prerequisite must be the careful presentation of the cause for whichthe financial support is required. People may have the courage to speak, but anintelligent presentation is of equal importance. The major point to beemphasised in the preparatory work for the return of Christ is the establishingof right human relations. This has already been started by men of goodwill allover the world, under their many names.We come now to the fifth prerequisite: a vital and sure belief in humanity as awhole. There must be no pessimism as to the future of mankind or distress overthe disappearance of the old order. “The good, the true and the beautiful” is onits way, and for it mankind is responsible, and not some outer divineintervention. Humanity is sound and rapidly awakening. We are passing throughthe stage where everything is being proclaimed from the housetops—as Christstated would be the case—and as we listen to or read of the flood of filth,crime, and sensual pleasure or luxury buying, we are [180] apt to bediscouraged; it is wise to remember that it is wholesome for all this to come tothe surface and for us all to know about it. It is like the psychologicalcleansing of the subconscious to which individuals submit themselves; itpresages the inauguration of a new and better day.There is work to do and the men of goodwill, of spiritual instinct, and of trulyChristian training must do it. They must inaugurate the era of the use of moneyfor the spiritual Hierarchy, and carry that need into the realms of invocation.Invocation is the highest type of prayer there is, and a new form of divineappeal which a knowledge of meditation has now made possible.There is naught to add in the way of an appeal for funds, courage orunderstanding. If the courage of the Christ, as He faces return to thisphysical, outer world, if the need of humanity for right human relations and thesacrificing work of the disciples of the Christ are not enough to fire you andto energise you and those whom you can reach, there is nothing that can be saidwhich will be of any use.We have considered the need of preparation for the coming of the Christ and someof the basic requirements which will arise as people brace themselves for theneeded activity, including the raising of the necessary finances to carryforward the preparatory work. The individual worker has, first of all, to decideif his incentive and spiritual expectancy is adequate to the task ahead. Onlythat is of importance which provides a needed momentum for action, and only thatworker will be equal to the task who has a vision of sufficient clarity toenable him to work with understanding and sincerity. He must discover that it ispossible for him to play his part in the furthering of the divine Plan. The factof Christ and the genuine [181] possibility of His reappearance must becomeimportant motivating factors in his consciousness. He looks around for thosewith whom he may work, and who have the same spiritual objectives as he has. Inthis way and in due time, he finds that there exists on Earth a well organisedand integrated group to which can be given the name of the New Group of WorldServers. He finds that they are everywhere, and are functioning in every countryand in all the organised religious groups and all other groups, dedicated to thewell-being of humanity and to preparing the way for the return of the Christ.This is primarily a group which, while working on the outer plane of daily,physical living, yet preserves a close, inner, spiritual integration with thecentre of energy from which it can draw all that is needed for active, spiritualwork. The group provides a field of service for all who are seekingservice-expression; it also provides a rallying point for all who are willing tobe tried out, and a place where their motives and persistence can be tested,prior to a steady unfoldment of spiritual opportunity. He is thus freed for everenlarging areas of service.The New Group of World Servers provides essentially a training ground and afield of experience for those who hope to grow in spiritual stature and to fitthemselves to be the active, directed disciples of the Christ. The appearance ofthis group on Earth at this time is one of the indications of the success of theevolutionary process, as applied to humanity. This method of work—the use ofhuman beings as agents to carry forward the work of salvation and of worlduplift—was initiated by the Christ Himself; He worked with men very frequentlythrough others, reaching humanity through the medium of His twelve Apostles,regarding Paul as substituting for Judas Iscariot. The Buddha tried the samesystem but the [182] relation of His group was, in the first instance, to Himand not so much to the world of men. Christ sent His Apostles out into the worldto feed the sheep, to seek, to guide and to become “fishers of men.” Therelation of the disciples of the Christ was only secondarily to their Master butprimarily to a demanding world; that attitude still controls the Hierarchy, yetwith no loss of devotion to the Christ. What the Buddha had institutedsymbolically and in embryo became factual and existent under the demands of thePiscean Age.In the age into which we are now emerging, the Aquarian Age, this mode of groupwork will reach a very high point of development, and the world will be savedand reconstructed by groups far more than by individuals. In the past we havehad world saviours—Sons of God Who have given to men a message which brought anincrease of light to the people. Now, in the fullness of time, and through theprocesses of evolution, there is emerging a group who will bring salvation tothe world and who (embodying group ideas and emphasising the true meaning of theChurch of Christ) will so stimulate and energise the minds and souls of men thatthe new age will be ushered in by an outpouring of the Love, Knowledge andHarmony of God Himself, as well as by the reappearance of the Christ in Whom allthese three faculties of divinity will be embodied.Religions in the past have been founded by a great soul, by an Avatar, and by anoutstanding spiritual personality. The stamp of their lives and words andteaching has been set upon the race and has persisted for many centuries. Whatwill be the effect of the message of a group Avatar or world Saviour? What willbe the potency of the work of a group of knowers of God, enunciating truth andbanded together subjectively in the great work [183] of saving the world? Whatwill be the effect of the mission of a group of world Saviours, all Knowers ofGod in some degree, who supplement each other’s efforts, reinforce each other’smessage, and constitute an organism through which the spiritual energy andprinciple of spiritual life can make their presence felt in the world, under thedirection of the Christ in Visible Presence?Such a body now exists, with its members in every land. Relatively they are fewand far between, but steadily their numbers are increasing, and increasinglytheir message will be felt. In them is vested a spirit of construction; they arethe builders of the new age; to them is given the work of preserving the spiritof truth, and the reorganising of the thoughts of men so that the racial mind iscontrolled and brought into that meditative and reflective condition which willpermit it to recognise the next unfoldment of divinity, which Christ willinaugurate.For the last ten years, this New Group of World Servers has been reorganised andrevitalised; the knowledge of its existence is spreading all over the world. Itis today a group of men and women of every nation and race and of all religiousorganisations and humanitarian movements who are fundamentally oriented towardsthe Kingdom of God or who are in process of thus orienting themselves. They aredisciples of the Christ, working consciously and frequently unconsciously forHis reappearance; they are spiritual aspirants, seeking to serve and make realthe Kingdom of God on Earth; they are men of goodwill and intelligence who aretrying to increase understanding and right human relations among men. This groupis divided into two major divisions:1. A group composed of the disciples of the Christ who are consciously workingwith His plans, and [184] of those who, instructed by them, are consciously andvoluntarily cooperating. In this latter category we can find ourselves if we sodesire, and if we are willing to make the necessary sacrifices.2. A group composed of aspirants and world conscious men and women, who areworking unconsciously under the guidance of the spiritual Hierarchy. There aremany such, particularly in high places today, who are fulfilling the part ofdestroyers of the old form or of builders of the new. They are not conscious ofany inner synthetic plan, but are selflessly occupied in meeting world need asbest they may, with playing parts of importance in national dramas, or withworking persistently in the field of education.The first group is in touch with the spiritual Hierarchy to some extent and to alarge extent where true disciples are concerned; its members work underspiritual inspiration. The second group is in closer touch with the masses ofmen; it works more definitely under the inspiration of ideas. The first group isoccupied with the Plan of the Christ as far as its members can grasp itsessentiality, whilst the second group works with the new concepts and hopeswhich are emerging in the consciousness of mankind, as men begin subjectivelyand often unconsciously to respond to the preparations for the coming of theChrist. Steadily and as a result of the work of the New Group of World Servers,humanity is awakening to the possibilities ahead.The awakening of the intelligentsia in all countries to the recognition ofhumanity is a prelude to the establishment of brotherhood. The unity of thehuman family is recognised by man, but before that unity can take [185] form inconstructive measures, it is essential that more and more of the thinking menand women throughout the world should break down the mental barriers existingbetween races, nations and types; it is essential that the New Group of WorldServers should itself repeat in the outer world that type of activity which theHierarchy expressed when it developed and materialised the New Group of WorldServers. Through the impression and expression of certain great ideas, meneverywhere must be brought to the understanding of the fundamental ideals whichwill govern the new age. This is the major task of the New Group of WorldServers.As we study and learn to recognise the New Group of World Servers in all itsbranches and spheres of activity—scattered all over the world and embracing trueand earnest workers and humanitarian people in every nation, every religion andevery organisation of humanitarian intent—we shall awaken to the realisationthat there is on Earth today a body of men and women whose numbers and range ofactivities are entirely adequate to bring about the changes which will enablethe Christ to walk again amongst us. This will come about if they care enough,are ready enough to make the needed sacrifices and are willing to sink theirnational, religious and organisational differences in the carrying out of thoseforms of service which will reconstruct the world. They must educate the race ofmen in a few simple and basic essentials and familiarise humanity with thethought of the reappearance of the Christ and the externalisation of the Kingdomof God. Their work will be largely to summarise and make effective the work ofthe two Sons of God: the Buddha and the Christ.The success of the work of the New Group of World Servers is inevitable; theyhave made much headway [186] during the past ten years; the inner integration ofthat part of the group which works in close touch with Christ and the spiritualHierarchy is such that the outer success is guaranteed. They provide a channelthrough which the light, love and power of the Kingdom of God can reach the moreexoteric workers.Therefore, let us realise that all spiritually inclined men and women, all whoseek and work for the establishing of right human relations, all who practisegoodwill and truly endeavour to love their fellowmen are an integral part of theNew Group of World Servers and that their major task at this time is to preparethe way for the reappearance of the Christ.Let me emphatically here state that the major method with which we can concernourselves and the most potent instrument in the hands of the spiritual Hierarchyis the spreading of goodwill and its fusion into a united and working potency. Iprefer that expression to the words “the organisation of goodwill.” Goodwill istoday a dream, a theory, a negative force. It should be developed into a fact, afunctioning ideal, and a positive energy. This is our work and again we arecalled to cooperate.The task before the New Group of World Servers is great, but it is not animpossible task. It is engrossing, but as it constitutes an imposed lifepattern, it can be worked out in every aspect of a man or woman’s normal, dailylife. Yet at the same time, we are called to abnormal living, and to theshouldering of a definite responsibility."},{"pageContent":"CONCLUSION[187] The call for preparation for the reappearance of the Christ has gone out;the call to world salvage has sounded forth, and today spiritually-minded meneverywhere and disciples of the Christ are assembling all over the world. It isnot an assembling upon the physical plane but a profound subjective andspiritual happening. Even those with only a faint glimmer of understanding as towhat the call truly signifies are responding, and asking for the opportunity tohelp, and for guidance as to what they may do.Today, therefore, we wait for the new Appearing. The Christ is universallyexpected, and in this spirit of expectancy comes the antidote to the spirit offear and horror which has descended upon our unhappy planet. Humanity todaylooks in two directions: towards the devastated Earth and the agonised hearts ofmen; it also looks towards the Place from whence the Christ will come, whichthey symbolically call “heaven.” Where there is the same expectancy, where thereis uniformity of testimony and of prediction, and where all the indications of“the time of the end” are with us, is it not reasonable to believe that a greatevent is in process of taking place? If, in the midst of death and destruction,there is to be found a living faith (and there is such a faith everywhere) and aburning zeal which pierces through the darkness to the centre of light, doesthat not warrant the assumption that this faith and this zeal are founded on adeep intuitive knowledge. May it not be a divine fact that “faith is thesubstance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen?” (Hebrews XI.1.)[188] Humanity in all lands today awaits the Coming One—no matter by what namethey may call Him. The Christ is sensed as on His way. The second coming isimminent and, from the lips of disciples, mystics, aspirants, spiritually-mindedpeople and enlightened men and women, the cry goes up, “Let light and love andpower and death fulfil the purpose of the Coming One.” These words are a demand,a consecration, a sacrifice, a statement of belief and a challenge to theAvatar, the Christ, Who waits in His high place until the demand is adequate andthe cry clear enough to warrant His appearance.One thing it is most necessary to have in mind. It is not for us to set the datefor the appearing of the Christ or to expect any spectacular aid or curiousphenomena. If our work is rightly done, He will come at the set and appointedtime. How, where or when He will come is none of our concern. Our work is to doour utmost and on as large a scale as possible to bring about right humanrelations, for His coming depends upon our work.All of us can do something to bring the present terrible world situation to anend and to better conditions: the least of us can play our part in inauguratingthe new era of goodwill and understanding. It must be realised, however, that itis no millennium for which we work but that our main objective is, at this time,twofold:1. To break the ancient and evil rhythms and establish a new and better one. Itis here that time is a paramount factor. If we can delay the crystallisation ofthe ancient evils which produced the world war, and arrest the reactionaryforces in every nation, we shall be making way for that which is new and openingthe door to the activities [189] of the New Group of World Servers in everyland—that group which is the agent of the Christ.2. To fuse and blend the united aspiration and longing of the people everywhereso that the sound of humanity’s demand may be strong enough to reach thespiritual Hierarchy.This will require sacrifice, understanding and a deep love of our fellowmen. Itwill also require intelligence and wisdom and a practical grasp of worldaffairs. As the work goes forward in the establishing of right human relations(which is the basic world need) and as the method of so doing—goodwill— isdeveloped, the Christ and His disciples will steadily approach closer tomankind. If the initial premise is accepted that He is on His way, then allspiritually oriented people and the disciples and aspirants of the world willinevitably work—but the premise must be accepted if the incentive is to proveadequate. It is with this thought that we look into the future. The fiat of theLord has gone forth; Christ stands attentive to the demand of humanity. Thatdemand is rising and mounting every day and “in such an hour as you think not,He will come. ”The sons of men are one, and I am one with them.I seek to love, not hate;I seek to serve and not exact due service;I seek to heal, not hurt.~Let pain bring due reward of light and love.Let the soul control the outer form,And life, and all events,And bring to light the LoveThat underlies the happenings of the time.~Let vision come and insight.Let the future stand revealed.Let inner union demonstrate and outer cleavages be gone.Let love prevail.Let all men love."},{"pageContent":"THE ARCANE SCHOOLTraining for new age discipleshipis provided by the Arcane School.The principles of the Ageless Wisdomare presented through esoteric meditation,study and service as a way of life.Contact the publishers for information.www.lucistrust.org/arcaneschool [https://www.lucistrust.org/arcane_school]"},{"pageContent":"INDEXAAffirmation of Christ, 29Ancient of Days.
