I live in a physical body like other men, on theborders of Tibet, and at times (from the exoteric standpoint) preside over alarge group of Tibetan lamas, when my other duties permit. It is this fact thathas caused it to be reported that I am an abbot of this particular lamasery.Those associated with me in the work of the Hierarchy (and all true disciplesare associated in this work) know me by still another name and office. A.A.B.knows who I am and recognises me by two of my names.I am a brother of yours, who has travelled a little longer upon the Path thanhas the average student, and has therefore incurred greater responsibilities. Iam one who has wrestled and fought his way into a greater measure of light thanhas the aspirant who will read this article, and I must therefore act as atransmitter of the light, no matter what the cost. I am not an old man, as agecounts among the teachers, yet I am not young or inexperienced. My work is toteach and spread the knowledge of the Ageless Wisdom wherever I can find aresponse, and I have been doing this for many years. I seek also to help theMaster M. and the Master K.H. whenever opportunity offers, for I have been longconnected with Them and with Their work. In all the above, I have told you much;yet at the same time I have told you nothing which would lead you to offer methat blind obedience and the foolish devotion which the emotional aspirantoffers to the Guru and Master Whom he is as yet unable to contact. Nor will hemake that desired contact until he has transmuted emotional devotion intounselfish service to humanity-not to the Master.The books that I have written are sent out with no claim for their acceptance.They may, or may not, be correct, true and useful. It is for you to ascertaintheir truth by right practice and by the exercise of the intuition. Neither Inor A.A.B. is the least interested in having them acclaimed as inspiredwritings, or in having anyone speak of them (with bated breath) as being thework of one of the Masters. If they present truth in such a way that it followssequentially upon that already offered in the world teachings, if theinformation given raises the aspiration and the will-to-serve from the plane ofthe emotions to that of the mind (the plane whereon the Masters can be found)then they will have served their purpose. If the teaching conveyed calls forth aresponse from the illumined mind of the worker in the world, and brings aflashing forth of his intuition, then let that teaching be accepted. But nototherwise. If the statements meet with eventual corroboration, or are deemedtrue under the test of the Law of Correspondences, then that is well and good.But should this not be so, let not the student accept what is said.A UGUST 1934THE GREAT INVOCATIONFrom the point of Light within the Mind of GodLet light stream forth into the minds of men.Let Light descend on EarthFrom the point of Love within the Heart of GodLet love stream forth into the hearts of men.May Christ return to Earth.From the centre where the Will of God is knownLet purpose guide the little wills of men—The purpose which the Masters know and serve.From the centre which we call the race of menLet the Plan of Love and Light work out.And may it seal the door where evil dwells.Let Light and Love and Power restore the Plan on Earth> “The above Invocation or Prayer does not belong to any person or group but to> all Humanity. The beauty and the strength of this Invocation lies in its> simplicity, and in its expression of certain central truths which all men,> innately and normally, accept—the truth of the existence of a basic> Intelligence to Whom we vaguely give the name of God; the truth that behind> all outer seeming, the motivating power of the universe is Love; the truth> that a great Individuality came to earth, called by Christians, the Christ,> and embodied that love so that we could understand; the truth that both love> and intelligence are effects of what is called the Will of God; and finally> the self-evident truth that only through humanity itself can the Divine Plan> work out.”A LICE A B AILEYPART ONE - THE FOURTEEN RULES FOR GROUP INITIATIONPRELIMINARY REMARKS(3) It might be here of value, my brothers, if I again laid emphasis upon thefact that the formless world is only entered when the aspirant has acquiredsomewhat the capacity to center himself on the abstract levels of the mentalplane. This involves necessarily certain developments within the aspirant’s ownnature. The demanded contact would otherwise be impossible. What is needed isself-exertion, the resultant developments of which might be touched upon asfollows:I. The Repolarisation of the Entire Lower Man so that his attitude toward theaggregate of forms which make up his field of general contact has changed. He isno longer deluded by the things of the senses but has in his hand that thread orclue which will eventually guide him out of the maze of the lower lifeperceptions into the field of clear knowledge and the realm where daylight isfound; he will then no longer need to walk in the dark. This repolarisation isbrought about in four ways, each of which provides the next step forward, and intheir totality (and when definitely followed) will eventuate in the totalsubjugation of the personality. These four ways are:A constant and unfailing attempt to center the consciousness within the head .From this central position the real man, the directing agency will direct andguide all his members, imposing upon the “lunar lords” of the physical body anew rhythm and habit of response. Two factors are of value and helpful in theproduction of the necessary polarisation:> The reiterated appreciation of the words “I am the Self, the Self am I.”> The habit of early morning meditation wherein the Thinker centers himself in> the point of control and [4] starts upon his day’s experience and contacts> with the realisation that he is only the Observer, the Perceiver and Actor.A close consideration throughout the day as to the use and misuse of energy.Every man should realise that in the use of energy lies direction and thetreading of the Path. It produces eventually truthful manifestation and thedisplaying of one’s light in order that circumstances may be irradiated andfellow pilgrims helped. Students should familiarise themselves with the “energyconcept” and learn to regard themselves as energy units displaying certain typesof energy. In this connection it should be borne in mind that when spiritualenergy and material energy (the two opposite poles) are brought intorelationship, a third type of energy is produced, and the work of the fourth orhuman kingdom is to demonstrate this peculiar type. It might serve to clarifythought if students remembered that> Superhuman entities display spiritual energy.> Subhuman entities display the energy of matter.> Human entities display soul energy.In the perfect manifestation of these three will the plan of creation beconsummated. It should also be borne in mind that these three are nevertheless amanifestation of duality—spirit and matter—and that this is the manifestation ofa great Existence and of His appearing. Therefore, what are called the “threegunas” in Hindu philosophy are but the qualities He manifests through thesetypes of entities.Superhuman lives express sattva, the guna of rhythm and of harmonious responseto divine urge, of perfect display of coordinated cooperation with the purposeof manifestation.Human lives demonstrate the quality of rajas, of mobility, of constant andconscious change in order to ascertain what is the Real and through the mediumof experience demonstrate the true nature of rhythmic response.Subhuman lives express the guna of tamas or of inertia. They work blindly andhave no ability to respond consciously [5] to the plan. They are the sumtotal ofthe “units of inertia” just as the human units are called “the points of lightmoving within the square.” This may have its appeal to Masons.This subject of the use or misuse of energy is capable of infinite expansion,and in my other books where I give you more upon the centres I have enlargedupon it. I but seek at this time to give you that which can be of immediate useto students and thus lay the foundation for later work.A close study of the needed transmutation of astral and emotional energy intolove, the energy of love. This involves the sublimation of personal feeling intogroup realisation or consciousness, and when carried out successfully producesin time the construction of a higher and subtler body, the buddhic sheath. Whenthis sheath is thus materialised a very high stage of advancement is marked, butthe earlier stages can be intelligently approached by any earnest student andprobationer. To transmute emotion into love the following realisations will befound necessary:1. A realisation that all moods, all display of sorrow, of pain, or of happyexcitement are due to our identification with the objects of desire, with theform aspect, and with that which is material.2. An understanding of the emotional or astral body and the place it plays inthe student’s development. It should be recognised as the shadow of the monad,and a connection should be traced between> The Astral Sheath....6th Plane> The Buddhic Sheath...4th Plane> The Monadic Sheath...2nd Planeand the place the love petals in the egoic lotus play should also be carefullyconsidered.3. A comprehension of the potency of the astral sheath owing to its undividednature.4. A study of the purpose of the solar plexus, and the part it plays as an organof transference of energy from the three great centres below the diaphragm tothe three higher [6] centres. There is a very close analogy here to the solarlotus, the egoic body, occupying a midway point between the threefold Monad andthe threefold lower man. The more advanced should follow this.The development of the faculty of mind control , so that the Thinker grips andholds steady the mental processes and learns to regard the mind as theinterpreter of the states of consciousness, as the transmitter of egoic intentto the physical brain and as the window through which the Ego, the real Manlooks out upon vast and (to the majority) unknown fields of knowledge.II. An emergence into Manifestation of the Subjective Aspect in Man . One of theobjects of evolution is that the subjective reality should eventually be broughtforward into recognition. This can be expressed in several symbolic ways, all ofthem dealing with the same one fact in nature:> The bringing to the birth of the Christ within.> The shining forth of the inner radiance or glory.> The demonstration of the 2nd or the Love aspect.> The manifestation of the solar Angel.> The appearing of the Son of God, the Ego or the Soul within.> The full expression of buddhi, as it utilises manas.This emergence into manifestation is brought about through what is understood bythe following terms:> The refining of the bodies which form the casket or sheath hiding the reality.> The process of ‘unveiling’ so that one by one those bodies which veil the Self> are brought to a point where they are simply transparencies, permitting the> full shining forth of the divine nature.> An expansion of consciousness, which is brought about through the ability of> the self to identify with its real nature as the Onlooker, and no longer> regarding itself as the organ of perception. [7]III. A Re-alignment of the Lower Sheaths so that the contact with the Real Man,the Thinker, the Solar Angel, on the higher levels of the mental plane maybecome complete and continuous. This only becomes possible as the other twopoints are beginning to be grasped and the theory as to man’s constitution andpurpose is somewhat understood. As meditation is practiced, as the lower bodiesare painstakingly dominated, and as the nature of the Sutratma or Thread isbetter comprehended it will become increasingly possible to bring into the lowerpersonality on the physical plane that spiritual illumination and that divineenergy which is the soul’s heritage. Little by little the light will shineforth, year by year the strength of the higher contact will grow, gradually thedownpour of divine love and wisdom into the head centres will be increased untileventually the entire lower man will be transformed, his sheaths will berefined, controlled and used, and he will demonstrate upon earth the powers ofDirector, Teacher or Manipulator according to the major ray upon which his Monadmay be found.IV. A Series of Tests Leading to Initiation . When a man is beginning todemonstrate the qualities of his ray and to prove of gradually increasingimportance to his group, he will be prepared through tests, through trials, andthrough temptations for those final stages in development which will put intohis power:> The knowledge of certain laws governing matter and form.> The keys of the mysteries connected with energy, with polarity, and with group> relation.> Certain Words of Power which will give him control over the elemental forces> of nature.> Insight into the planetary plans.Upon these I need not enlarge, nor need I take up with you here the subject ofinitiation. (Discipleship in the New Age , Volumes I and II). The first work tobe done is the stimulating [8] of aspirants and the preparing of the few earnestones to tread the Path of Discipleship. The final point of our theme concerns:V. The Basic Essential of Pure Character . This is something more than justbeing good. It deals with the matter aspect and has relation to the hold orcontrol that the form has over the man. We might express it this way andtherefore give its more occult connotation. If one or other of the three lowerelementals (the physical, the astral and the mental) are the controlling factorsin the life of the man, he is—by that very fact—put into a position of dangerand should take steps to arrest that control prior to an attempt to enter intothe formless realm. The reason for this will be apparent. Under the governinglaw of matter, the law of Economy, the elemental life will attract to itselfsimilar lives and this will result in a dual danger. These dangers are:One: the gathering into the form, through the dominant note sounded by the formelemental, of matter with a synchronous vibration. This will tend to increasethe magnitude of the task before the Ego and sweep into increasing dominance thelower man. The “lunar lords” will become increasingly powerful and the solarLord correspondingly less august.Two: the man will find himself surrounded in time with thoughtforms of a lowerorder (from the standpoint of the soul) and before he can penetrate into theArcana of Wisdom and find his way into the Master’s world he will have to dispelthe clouds of thoughtforms which he has attracted to himself.Unless the disciple learns that aspiration and self-discipline must proceed sideby side, he will find that the spiritual energy he may appreciate and contactwill only serve to stimulate the latent seeds of evil in his nature and therebydemonstrate the exactitude of the truth that the great Lord taught when Hepictured the man who swept his house, cast out seven devils and eventually wasin a worse condition than ever. It is essential that aspirants should [9]understand the nature of the lower man and should grasp the fact that everycoherent system has its varying types of energy, and that perfection is achievedwhen the highest type of energy inherently possible dominates.If the lower energy of the aggregate of the form-atoms is the controlling factorthree things will take place:1. The form itself will grow by accretion and will become ever more potent,until the dominant voice of its ‘lunar lords’ will stifle all other voices andthe man be swept back into> Inertia> Blindness> Bondage2. Many people are not only under the control of some one or other of theirforms but are the captives of all the three. In studying the lower threefold manand the energies or lives that seek to control him it should be remembered thatthey fall into three categories:> a. The individual tiny lives which we call the atoms or cells of the body.> These exist in three groups and compose respectively the four types of bodies:> dense physical, etheric, astral and mental.> b. The aggregate of these lives which constitute in themselves four types of> elementals or separate coherent, though not self-conscious, existences. These> four lunar lords constitute what the Ageless Wisdom teaching calls “the four> sides of the square.” They are the “lower quaternary,” “the imprisoning> cubes,” or the cross upon which the inner spiritual Man is to be crucified.> These four elementals have an intelligence all their own, are upon the> involutionary arc, are following the law of their own being when they tend to> become powerful, and thereby fully express that which is in them.> c. A dominant controlling lunar lord who is that which we understand by the> term the ‘lower personality’; he (if the personal pronoun can be used) is the> sumtotal of the physical, astral and mental elementals, and it [10] is this> power which at present forces the ‘fiery energies’ of the body to feed the> lower three centres. The etheric body has a unique and curious position, being> simply the vehicle for prana or life and the centre which it uses exists in a> category by itself.3. All subhuman forms in their aggregate prove a powerful deterrent factor inthe progress towards emancipation of the Real Man. They form the opposite towhat we understand by the world of the Master and the two are in directopposition to each other from the standpoint of the aspirant.The adept can enter the world of form, can contact it, work in it and remainunaffected by it because there is nothing in him to respond to it. He seesthrough the illusion to the reality behind and, knowing where he stands himself,there is naught in the appeal and the demand of these lunar lords to attracthim. He stands midway between the pairs of opposites. In the realisation of thenature of this world of form, in a comprehension of the lives which compose it,and in an ability to hear the voice of the “formless One” above the strife ofall the lower voices, comes the opportunity for the aspirant to escape from thedominance of matter.This is the true magical work, my brothers, the understanding of the sounds ofall beings, and the ability to speak the language of the soul is the clue to thework. These faculties rightly used impose upon these lesser lives that controlwhich will lead to the final liberation, and which will in due time, lead theselives themselves into the realm of self-consciousness. This aspect of the matteris as yet but little comprehended by the sons of men. If they but realised thatby a disposition to fall under lunar control they drive the tiny lives in theirlittle system deeper into the darkness of ignorance, they might more rapidlyassume their just responsibilities; if they realised that by the constantattempt to impose the rhythm of the solar Lord upon the aggregate of the lunarlords, they were driving these lives onward to self-conscious unfoldment, theymight proceed more earnestly and more intelligently. This is the message thatmust [11] go forth, for all the varying aspects of the life of God areinterdependent and not one proceeds onward into fuller realisation withoutbenefitting the entire group.A few simple suggestions I will give you. These can be useful to all sincereaspirants.> In the ordered regulation of the life comes eventual synthesis and the right> control of time with all that eventuates therefrom.> In the right elimination of that which is secondary, and in a sense of rightly> adjusted proportion comes that accuracy and one-pointedness which is the> hallmark of the occultist.> In the right aspiration at the appointed time comes the necessary contact and> the inspiration for the work that has to be done.> In the steady adherence to self-appointed rules comes the gradual refining of> the instrument and the perfecting of the vehicles that will be—to the> Master—the medium of help among many little ones.I commend the above thought to you knowing that you will apprehend theimplications and will seriously consider the purport of my remarks.The world today is in the throes of agony. Just as in the evolving Ego, themoment of greatest development is oft the moment of greatest pain (ifapprehension measure up to opportunity) so in the evolving world. To those ofyou who have the inner sight and intuitive comprehension comes the opportunityto aid that apprehension and to lead a despairing world—deep cast into darknessand distress—one step nearer to the light. The work you have to do is to takethe knowledge which is yours and adjust its application to the world’s need sothat recognition of the truth may be rapid. In the heart of every man lies hidthe flower of the intuition. On that you can depend, and no eternal or cosmicfact clothed in a suitable form will fail to receive its meed of recognition andunderstanding.INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT[12] I have called you from refreshment to labour at this time (October 1942)because the coming few days are exceedingly busy ones for me as they are for allmembers of the Hierarchy. I seek to give you some further instructions anent theHierarchy itself. (This teaching is the continuation of that which appears in“Discipleship in the New Age”, Volume I, pp. 671 - 773.) Students at this timewould do well to remember that all basic and fundamental changes taking placeupon the physical plane are necessarily the result of inner subjective causes,emanating from some level of the divine consciousness, and therefore from someplane other than the physical. The fact that tremendous and unusual upheavalsare taking place in the kingdoms of nature is attributed by men to other men orto certain forces generated by human thinking, frailty and ambition.Is it not possible that these changes are being brought about as the result ofcertain profoundly important happenings upon inner planes of such advancedstates of consciousness that all the average disciple can know about them istheir word symbols and their much deleted effects—if I may use such a phrase todescribe the happenings which are rending humanity today. The evil that is beingwrought today on earth, by certain evil members of the human family, are effectsof their response to the inflaming energies and indicate their basic wickednessand their prompt reaction to that which is counter to the good. Wherever theconsciousness is focussed, there is the point of major emphasis and importance,and this is true of the individual man and of humanity as a whole. Thesignificance of the present happenings is interpreted (and necessarily so) interms of human awareness and responsiveness. This world war and its inevitableconsequences—good and bad—are looked upon as concerned primarily with humanity,whereas that is not [13] basically so. Humanity suffers and experiences as aresult of the inner occurrences and the meeting of subjective forces andinflaming energies.It is of course not possible for me to give you any true picture of the interiorevents and happenings in the life of our planetary Being. I can only indicateand point out that the world situation is simply an embodiment of the reactionand the response by mankind to great paralleling and originating happeningswhich involve the following groups:> 1. The emanating Avatar and His relationship to the Lord of the World, our> planetary Logos.> 2. The Lords of Liberation, focussed in Their high place, as They become> conscious of the invocation of humanity and become more closely related to the> three Buddhas of Activity.> 3. The Great Council at Shamballa and the planetary Hierarchy.> 4. The Buddha and His Arhats as They unitedly cooperate with the Christ and> His disciples, the Masters of the Wisdom.> 5. The Hierarchy, the embodiment of the fifth kingdom in nature, and its> magnetic attractive rapport with the human kingdom, the fourth.> 6. The effect of all these great groups of Lives upon humanity, and the> inherent consequences as they work out in the subhuman kingdoms.A study of the above in terms of forces and energy will give some idea of theunderlying synthesis of relationships and the unity of the whole.There is therefore a line of descending energy which has its origin outside ourplanetary life altogether; the inflow of this energy, its inevitable effectunder cyclic law and its consequences, as they work out upon the physical plane,has produced and is producing all the changes of which mankind is so terriblyaware at this time. This swings into immediate conflict the past and the future,and in this statement I have expressed the deepest esoteric truth which mankind[14] is competent to grasp; it brings into a culminating struggle the GreatWhite Lodge and the Black Lodge and opens the door to great contending energieswhich we can call spirit and matter, spirituality and materialism, or life anddeath. These words are, in the last analysis, as meaningless as the terms goodand evil, which have significance only in the human consciousness and itsinherent limitations.These descending energies, as they pass through any of the major levels ofconsciousness which we call planes, produce reactions and responses, dependentupon the state of the conditioning consciousness, and (strange as this may seemto you and well-nigh unintelligible) the effects upon the Hierarchy are evenmore compelling and transmuting than they are upon humanity. I would add alsothat the point of lowest descent of the energies has now been reached, and thenature of the present opportunity is therefore changing. These energies have nowpassed what we might call the turning point and have reached their point ofascension, with all that that phrase implies. As they descend, they producestimulation; as they ascend, they produce transmutation and abstraction, and theone effect is as unalterable as the other. It is upon this inevitability of theascending energies, and the effects which they will bring about, that the entirehope of the future depends; nothing can arrest their return or their progressthrough the planes and back again to their source. Upon this dual process ofdescent and ascension the whole cyclic panorama of manifestation rests, and uponthe inflow and activity of new and higher energies the whole fact of theevolutionary process depends.It will therefore be apparent to you that the descent of energy brings withit—under the cyclic law—certain new “inspirations,” certain new “seeds of hope”for the future, and certain active Agents as well, Who are and will beresponsible for the task of preparation, of fertilisation and of all the comingnew age enterprises. These descending energies evoke also the obstructingforces, and I would here remind you that these obstructing evil forces(so-called) are [15] met with upon the highest spiritual levels because theyare—in their turn—evoked by the impelling impact of the coming Avatar Whose“note is heard ahead of Him, and His energy spreads before Him.” This is a greatmystery and can only be understood (and then merely theoretically) if you bearin mind that all our planes—even the very highest—are the subplanes of thecosmic physical plane. When this fact is somewhat grasped there comes asimplification of thought.As a consequence of all this, great and fundamental readjustments are going onwithin the Hierarchy itself and within that intervening area of the divineconsciousness to which we give the name (as far as humanity is concerned) of theSpiritual Triad—an area covered by the higher mental planes, the buddhic and theatmic levels of awareness and of divine activity. The downpouring avataricstimulation is enabling certain of the Masters to take some of the majorinitiations, and to do so far earlier than would otherwise have been possible.Thus a great process of ascension and of spiritual attainment is under way,though as yet only its faint beginnings can be traced, owing to the intensity ofthe point of conflict. Hence also many probationary disciples are finding theirway into the ranks of accepted disciples, and many disciples are takinginitiation. To this fact of hierarchical upheaval—paralleling and intensifyingthe upheaval upon the physical plane—can be traced the process of preparationwhich I have instituted among some disciples, thus hastening the period andpoint of attainment, provided I receive due cooperation from them. (Discipleshipin the New Age , Vols. I and II.)As regards the Hierarchy itself, speaking esoterically and technically, itsMembers (many of Them) are “being abstracted from the middle point of holinessand absorbed into the Council of the Lord.” In other words, They are passingonward into higher work and are becoming custodians of the energy of the divinewill and not simply the custodians of the energy of love. They will workhenceforth as power-units, and not just as units of light. Their work [16]becomes dynamic instead of being attractive and magnetic, and is concerned withthe life aspect and not just with the soul or consciousness aspect. Their placesare being taken—under the Law of Ascension—by Their senior disciples, theinitiates in Their Ashrams, and (under the same great process) the place ofthese initiates, who are thus being “raised” to more important work, is beingtaken by disciples and probationers. It is this truth, misinterpreted andshockingly travestied, which lies behind the teaching anent the so-calledAscended Masters, put out by the leaders of the “I AM” movement, thusprostituting and bringing down almost into the realm of cheap comedy one of themost notable happenings which has ever taken place upon our planet.There is therefore, owing to the inflow of energy from extra-planetary sources,a general shifting of the focus of consciousness of embodied and disembodiedlives at this time; this shift is one of the prime factors producing the presentdisruption. Students today are searching for the causes in human motives, inpast history and in karmic relationships. To these they add the so-called factorof wickedness. All these factors of course exist, but are of lesser origin andare inherent in the life of the three worlds. They are themselves set in motionby far deeper-seated factors latent in the relationship between spirit andmatter and inherent in the dualism of the solar system, and not in itstriplicity. This dualism, as far as our planet is concerned, is profoundlyaffected by the will-purpose of the Lord of the World and by the intensity ofHis one-pointed thought. He has succeeded in achieving a point of tension,preparatory to bringing about stupendous changes in His life-expression, withinHis vehicle of manifestation, a planet. This point of invocation will beevocative of great happenings, and will involve every aspect of His nature,including the dense physical; this of necessity involves also all that concernsthe human family for “in Him we live and move and have our being.” Those threewords or phrases express the triplicity of manifestation, for “Being” connotesthe Spirit aspect, [17] “moving” the soul or consciousness aspect, and “living”signifies appearance upon the physical plane. Upon that outer plane the basicsynthesis of incarnated life is to be found.It will be apparent to you, therefore, that in this achievement of planetarytension it is not life in the three worlds that is the sphere of this tension,but the realm of hierarchical activity. The shift resulting from this point oftension, the “moving” which is its consequence, is in the realm of soulexperience and soul awareness. The secondary effect can be noted in the humanconsciousness by the awakening which has been going on among men—an awakening tothe higher spiritual values, to the trends and ideologies which are everywhereappearing, and to the clear lines of demarcation which have emerged in the realmof human determinations and objectives. These are all the results of greatchanges in the field of the higher consciousness and are conditioned by the soulof all things, lying largely in the realm of the anima mundi; of this greatsumtotal the human soul and the spiritual soul are but aspects or expressions.It is these changes in the “moving, shifting realities” of the soulconsciousness and spiritual awareness of the Members of the Hierarchy which areresponsible for the new trends in the life of the Spirit and the new methods intraining disciples—in such an experiment, for instance, as externalising theAshrams of the Masters. It is this new approach to life conditions, as a resultof the inflow of new energies, which is producing the universal trend towardsgroup awareness , and its highest result in the human family is the taking thefirst steps towards group initiation . Such a thing as group initiation wasnever heard of prior to the present time, except in connection with the higherinitiations emanating from the Shamballa centre. Group initiation is based upona uniform and united group will, consecrated towards the service of humanity andbased upon loyalty, cooperation and interdependence. In the past, the emphasiswas upon the individual, his training and approach to initiation, and hissolitary admittance to the Temple [18] of Initiation. But this individualconcentration will, in the future, give place to a group condition which willenable several disciples unitedly to move forward, unitedly to stand before theInitiator, and unitedly and simultaneously to achieve the great realisationwhich is the result and the reward of successful discipleship.In the first thesis which I presented to the public I outlined the Rules forApplicants, (Initiation, Human and Solar , pp. 192-208), summarising the pastpropositions and indicating the individual preparation and requirements. Thesewill now apply to the probationary groups of disciples, and not to accepteddisciples. They must and will still remain the character and purificatoryobjectives of the dedicated individual, but are regarded as adequately graspedby humanity; they have been proclaimed by all the great world religions down thecenturies and have been recognised as the main conditioning qualities of alldisciples.These same Rules or Formulas of Approach are the lower correspondences of higherrules to which groups of disciples are pledged to conform, and which they mustfollow and obey together. The Hierarchy into which they will enter when fullacceptance and demonstration have been shown will be the same Hierarchy,characterised by the same soul awareness, animated by the same spiritualactivity, functioning under the same laws, but conditioned by two progressiveand evolutionary developments:> 1. A much closer contact—invocative and evocative—with Shamballa, and> therefore a fuller responsiveness to the Will aspect of divinity.> 2. An invocative attitude on the part of humanity, based on a fundamental> decentralisation of the selfish human consciousness and a rapidly awakening> group consciousness.In reality, this means that the Hierarchy will be more closely related to theGreat Council at Shamballa, and very much more closely interrelated withhumanity, so that a dual fusion will be taking place. This will bring about thatintegrative [19] process which will be the quality of the New Age and willinaugurate the Aquarian phase of planetary history.I would now like to bring into a close relation the earlier imparted Rules forApplicants and the new Rules for Disciples , embodying the new group activityand group discipleship, resulting in group initiation.These Rules are fourteen in number. Today I will simply give you, first of allthe rule for the individual disciple, and then its higher corresponding rule forgroups in preparation for group initiation, reminding you that such groups areever composed of those who have taken the first initiation, and the name ofthese is legion. They are to be found in every country. There are not, however,so many who are ready for the new era of group initiation.Rule I.For Applicants: Let the disciple search within the heart’s deep cave. If therethe fire burns bright, warming his brother yet heating not himself, the hour hascome for making application to stand before the door.For Disciples and Initiates: Within the fire of mind, focussed within the head’sclear light, let the group stand. The burning ground has done its work. Theclear cold light shines forth and cold it is and yet the heat—evoked by thegroup love—permits the warmth of energetic moving out. Behind the group therestands the Door. Before them opens out the Way. Together let the band ofbrothers onward move—out of the fire, into the cold, and toward a newer tension.Rule II.For Applicants: When application has been made in triple form, then let thedisciple withdraw that application and forget it has been made.For Disciples and Initiates: The Word has now gone forth from the great point oftension: Accepted as a group. Withdraw not now your application. You could not,if you [20] would; but add to it three great demands and forward move. Let therebe no recollection and yet let memory rule. Work from the point of all that iswithin the content of the group’s united life.Rule III.For Applicants: Triple the call must be and long it takes to sound it forth. Letthe disciple sound the call across the desert, over all the seas and through thefires which separate him from the veiled and hidden door.For Disciples and Initiates: Dual the moving forward. The Door is left behind.That is a happening of the past. Let the cry of invocation issue forth from thedeep centre of the group’s clear cold light. Let it evoke response from thebright centre, lying far ahead. When the demand and the response are lost in onegreat SOUND, move outward from the desert, leave the seas behind and know thatGod is Fire.Rule IV.For Applicants: Let the disciple tend the evocation of the fire, nourish thelesser lives and thus keep the wheel revolving.For Disciples and Initiates: Let the group see that all the eighteen fires diedown and that the lesser lives return unto the reservoir of life. This they mustbring about through the evocation of the Will. The lesser wheels must not foraye revolve in time and space. Only the greater Wheel must onward move and turn.Rule V.For Applicants: Let the applicant see to it that the Solar Angel dims the lightof the lunar angels, remaining the sole luminary in the microcosmic sky.For Disciples and Initiates: In unison let the group perceive the Triad shiningforth, dimming the light of the soul and blotting out the light of form. Themacrocosmic Whole is all there is. Let the group perceive that Whole and then nolonger use the thought “My soul and thine.” [21]Rule VI.For Applicants: The purificatory fires burn dim and low when the third issacrificed to the fourth. Therefore let the disciple refrain from taking lifeand let him nourish that which is lowest with the produce of the second.For Disciples and Initiates: Let the group know that life is one and naught canever take or touch that life. Let the group know the vivid, flaming, drenchingLife that floods the fourth when the fifth is known. The fifth feeds on thefourth. Let then the group—merged in the fifth—be nourished by the sixth andseventh and realise that all the lesser rules are rules in time and space andcannot hold the group. It onward moves in life.Rule VII.For Applicants: Let the disciple turn his attention to the enunciating of thosesounds which echo in the hall where walks the Master. Let him not sound thelesser notes which awaken vibration within the halls of Maya.For Disciples and Initiates: Let the group life emit the Word of invocation andthus evoke response within those distant Ashrams where move the Chohans of therace of men. They are no longer men as are the Masters but having passed beyondthat lesser stage, have linked Themselves with the Great Council in the highestSecret Place. Let the group sound a dual chord, reverberating in the halls wheremove the Masters but finding pause and prolongation within those radiant hallswhere move the Lights which carry out the Will of God.Rule VIII.For Applicants: When the disciple nears the Portal, the greater seven mustawaken and bring forth response from the lesser seven upon the double circle.For Disciples and Initiates: Let the group find within itself response to thegreater seven groups which carry out the hierarchical will with love andunderstanding. The group contains all seven, the perfect group. The lesserseven, [22] the greater seven and the planetary seven form one great whole, andthese the group must know. When this is realised and the Law of theSupplementary Seven is understood let the group understand the Three and thenthe ONE. This they can do with the united breath and the unified rhythm.Rule IX.For Applicants: Let the disciple merge himself within the circle of the otherselves. Let but one colour blend them and their unity appear. Only when thegroup is known and sensed can energy be wisely emanated.For Disciples and Initiates: Let the group know there are no other selves. Letthe group know there is no colour, only light; and then let darkness take theplace of light, hiding all difference, blotting out all form. Then—at the placeof tension, and at that darkest point—let the group see a point of clear coldfire, and in the fire (right at its very heart) let the One Initiator appearWhose star shone forth when the Door first was passed.Rule X.For Applicants: The Army of the Voice, the devas in their serried ranks workceaselessly. Let the disciple apply himself to a consideration of their methods;let him learn the rules whereby the Army works within the veils of maya.For Disciples and Initiates: The rules for work within the veils of maya areknown and have been used. Let the group widen all the rents within those veilsand thus let in the light. Let the Army of the Voice be no more heard and letthe brothers onward move within the Sound. Then let them know the meaning of theO.M. and let them hear that O.M. as it is sounded forth by Him Who stands andwaits at the very centre of the Council Chamber of the Lord.Rule XI.For Applicants: Let the disciple transfer the fire from the lower triangle tothe higher and preserve that which is created through the fire at the midwaypoint.For Disciples and Initiates: Let the group together move the fire within theJewel in the Lotus into the Triad and [23] let them find the Word which willcarry out that task. Let them destroy by their dynamic Will that which has beencreated at the midway point. When the point of tension is reached by thebrothers at the fourth great cycle of attainment, then will this work be done.Rule XII.For Applicants: Let the disciple learn to use the hand in service; let him seekthe mark of the Messenger in his feet and let him learn to see with the eyewhich looks out from between the two.For Disciples and Initiates: Let the group serve as Aquarius indicates; letMercury speed the group upon the upward Way and let Taurus bring illuminationand the attainment of the vision; let the mark of the Saviour, as the grouptoils in Pisces, be seen above the aura of the group.Rule XIII.For Applicants: Four things the disciple must learn and comprehend before he canbe shown the inmost mystery: first, the laws of that which radiates; the fivemeanings of magnetisation make the second; the third is transmutation or thesecret lost of alchemy; and lastly, the first letter of the Word which has beenimparted, or the hidden name egoic.For Disciples and Initiates: Let the group get ready to reveal the hiddenmystery. Let the group demonstrate the higher meaning of the lessons learnt, andthese are four and yet are one. Let the group understand the Law of Synthesis,of unity and fusion; let the threefold mode of working with that which isdynamic carry the group together towards the Higher Three where the Will of Godholds sway; let Transfiguration follow Transformation and may Transmutationdisappear. Let the O.M. be heard right at the centre of the group, proclaimingGod is All.Rule XIV.For Applicants: Listen, touch, see, apply, know.For Disciples and Initiates: Know, express, reveal, destroy and resurrect.[24] These are the rules for group initiation and I am dealing with them to giveyou a fuller understanding of the Laws of Group Life with which I dealt in someof my other books.I will take these rules and expound for you somewhat of their meaning andindicate their significances as far as these can be grasped now. Theseinstructions are written for future disciples towards the end of this century.They form part of the last volume of A Treatise on the Seven Rays and will,therefore, go out to the general public who will not understand, but thus theneeded teaching will be preserved.RULE ONE[25] We now begin our study of the fourteen rules for those who are seekinginitiation, in one or other of its degrees. In Initiation, Human and Sola r Igave the rules for those proposing to enter the grades of discipleship. I wouldlike for a minute to deal with the significance of the word “Rule” and give yousome idea of its occult meaning. There is much difference between a Law, anOrder or Command, and a Rule, and these distinctions should be pondered withcare. The Laws of the universe are simply the modes of expression, the lifeimpulses and the way of existence or activity of the One in Whom we live andmove and have our being. There is no avoiding these laws in the last analysis,and there is no denying them, for we are eternally swept into activity by themand they govern and control (from the angle of the Eternal Now) all that happensin time and space. Orders and commands are the feeble interpretations which mengive to what they understand by law. In time and space, and at any given momentand in any given location, these commands are issued by those who are in aposition of authority or who seem to dominate or are in a position to enforcetheir wishes. Laws are occult and basic. Orders are indicative of human frailtyand limitation.Rules are, however, different. They are the result of tried experience and ofage-long undertakings and—assuming neither the form of laws nor the limitationsof a command—they are recognised by those for whom they exist and hence evokefrom them a prompt intuitive response. They need no enforcement but arevoluntarily accepted, and are put to trial in the belief that the witness of thepast and the testimony of the ages warrant the effort required for the expressedrequirements.This is true of the fourteen Rules which we are now going to study. I wouldremind you that only the initiate consciousness will truly comprehend theirsignificance, but [26] also that your effort so to do will develop in you thebeginning of that initiate consciousness, provided you seek to make practicaland voluntary application of these rules in your daily lives. They aresusceptible of three forms of application—physical, emotional and mental—and ofa fourth application which is best designated by the words “the response of theintegrated personality to soul interpretation and understanding.”Another point which I would call to your attention, prior to interpreting thisrule, is that your group endeavour must be to seek group application, groupmeaning and group light. I would emphatically emphasise the words “group light.”We are dealing, therefore, with something basically new in the field of occultteaching, and the difficulty of intelligent comprehension is consequently great.The true significances are not the simple ones which appear upon the surface.The words of these rules would seem to be almost tritely familiar. If they meantexactly what they appear to mean, there would be no need for me to be givinghints as to their underlying significances and ideas. But they are not sosimple.To sum up, therefore: these Rules are to be read with the aid of a developingesoteric sense; they are related to group initiation in spite of their havingindividual application; they are not what they appear to be on the surface—tritetruisms and spiritual platitudes; but they are rules for initiation which, iffollowed, will take the disciple and the group through a major spiritualexperience; they embody the techniques of the New Age, which necessitate groupactivity, group procedure and united action. Earlier I said that these rules arethe result of tried experience, and my use of the word “new” in this connotationis related to human knowledge but not to the initiatory procedure. That hasalways existed and always, at the great crises of initiation, disciples havemoved forward in groups, even though they have not been aware of so doing. Nowdisciples can become so aware, and the various ray ashrams will not only presenttheir groups (large or small) to the Initiator, but the personnel of [27] thesegroups will now be aware of the fact of group presentation. They will also haveto grasp the fact of the extent of their knowledge being dependent upon theirdecentralisation . I would ask you to ponder and reflect upon this laststatement.Let us now proceed to a consideration of Rule I.Rule I.> Within the fire of mind, focussed within the head’s clear light, let the group> stand. The burning ground has done its work. The clear cold light shines forth> and cold it is and yet the heat—evoked by the group love—permits the warmth of> energetic moving out. Behind the group there stands the Door. Before them> opens out the Way. Together let the band of brothers onward move—out of the> fire, into the cold, and toward a newer tension.It will be profitable if we take this Rule I sentence by sentence and try towrest from each its group significance.1. Within the fire of the mind, focussed within the head’s clear light, let thegroup stand.In this sentence, you have the idea of intellectual perception and of focussedunity. Intellectual perception is not mental understanding, but is in realitythe clear cold reason, the buddhic principle in action and the focussed attitudeof the Spiritual Triad in relation to the personality. I would call yourattention to the following analogies: Head Monad Atma Purpose Heart Soul Buddhi Pure reason Base of spine Personality Manas Spiritual activityIn these words you have, therefore, the position of the personality indicated asit stands at the penetrating point of the antahkarana as it contacts the manasor lower mind and is thus the agent of the purpose of the Monad, working throughthe Spiritual Triad which is—as you know—related to the personality by theantahkarana.The heart as an aspect of pure reason requires careful consideration. It isusually considered the organ of pure love [28] but—from the angle of theesoteric sciences—love and reason are synonymous terms, and I would have youreflect upon why this should be. Love is essentially a word for the underlyingmotive of creation. Motive, however, presupposes purpose leading to action, andhence in the group-life task of the incarnating Monad there comes a time whenmotive (heart and soul) becomes spiritually obsolete because purpose has reacheda point of fulfillment and the activity set in motion is such that purposecannot be arrested or stopped. The disciple cannot then be deterred, and nohindrance or difficulty is hard enough to prevent his moving forward. Then wehave eventual destruction of what Theosophists call the causal body and theestablishing of a direct relation between the Monad and its tangible expressionupon the physical plane. The head centre and the centre at the base of the spinewill be in direct unimpeded relation; monadic will and personality will likewisewill be in a similar unimpeded relation, via the antahkarana. I would have youremember that the will aspect is the final dominating principle.In the group application of these ideas the same basic and profound developmentmust take place, and a group of disciples must be distinguished by pure reason,which will steadily supersede motive, merging eventually into the will aspect ofthe Monad—its major aspect. It is, technically speaking, Shamballa in directrelation with humanity.What, therefore, is the group will in any ashram or Master’s group? Is itpresent in any form vital enough to condition the group relations and to uniteits members into a band of brothers—moving forward into the light? Is thespiritual will of the individual personalities of such strength that it negatesthe personality relation and leads to spiritual recognition, spiritual interplayand spiritual relation? It is only in consideration of these fundamental effectsof standing as a group in “the head’s clear light” that it is permissible fordisciples to bring into the picture personal sensitivities and thought, and thisonly because of a group temporary limitation.[29] What is it, therefore, which prevents a disciple—as an individual—fromhaving direct approach and direct contact with the Master without beingdependent upon an intermediary? Let me illustrate: In the group I have undertraining (Discipleship in the New Age , Vols. I and II) two or three have directapproach and others have it but know it not; still others are well intentionedand hard driving disciples, but never for a second do they forget themselves;one has had a problem of glamour but now is preoccupied with the problem ofspiritual ambition—a spiritual ambition which is working through a very smallpersonality; some could make rapid progress but are too prone to inertia—perhapsI could say that they do not care enough. Each of them (and every otherdisciple) can place himself. All of them desire to move forward and possess astrong inner spiritual life—hence my finding the time to work with them. But thegroup antahkarana is still incomplete and the aspect of pure reason and of theheart does not control. The evocative power of the Spiritual Triad is not,therefore, adequate to hold the personality steady and the invocative power ofthe personality is non-existent—speaking from the angle of the grouppersonalities which make up the personality aspect of the ashram. This is afactor with which they oft feel I have not to deal. It can only become a potentfactor if certain personality relations are adjusted and inertia is overcome.Then and only then can “the group stand.”2. The burning ground has done its work.Here there is quite apt to be misunderstanding. To most people the burningground stands for one of two things:> a. Either the fire of the mind, burning up those things in the lower nature of> which it becomes increasingly aware.> b. Or the burning ground of sorrow, agony, horror and pain which is the> characteristic quality of life in the three worlds, particularly at this time.But the burning ground referred to here is something [30] very different. Whenthe blazing light of the sun is correctly focussed on or through a glass it cancause ignition. When the blazing light of the Monad is focussed directly uponthe personality, via the antahkarana and not specifically through the soul, itproduces a blazing fire which burns up all hindrances in a steady, sequentialprocess. Wording it otherwise, when the will aspect streams from the Monad andfocusses through the personal will (as the mind can grasp and realise it) itdestroys as by fire all elements of self-will. As the energy of Shamballastreams out and makes a direct contact with humanity (omitting the transmissionvia the Hierarchy, which has hitherto been customary), you have what has beenseen in the world today, a destructive conflagration or a world burning ground.When the antahkarana of a group is rightly constructed, then the individualisedgroup-will will disappear in the full consciousness of the monadic purpose orclear directed will. These are points which the disciple preparing forinitiation has to consider as he prepares for the higher initiations, and theseare the points which any group or ashram in preparation for initiation has alsoto consider.The secret of the higher initiations lies in the trained use of the higher will.It does not lie in purification or in self-discipline or in any of theexpedients which have acted in the past as interceptors of the truth. This wholeproblem of the Shamballic will is in process of revelation, and will eventuallyalter the entire approach of the disciple in the New Age to initiation. Thetheme of “the Way into Shamballa” requires reflective study and esotericunderstanding. In this concept of the new and future section (if I may so callit) of the Way or Path with which the modern disciple is faced lies the secretof the coming revelation and of the spiritual dispensation which will emerge ashumanity constructs the new world civilisation and begins to formulate the newculture. The burning, purifying, destructive effects of the monadic will uponits distorted reflection, the individual will, deeply deserves consideration.For long, aspirants have noted and have been taught the effect of the will uponthe astral, or emotional body. It [31] is one of the primary and most elementaryof the initial tensions, and is taught upon the Probationary Path. It leads tothe purifying and the re-organising of the entire psychic and emotional life, asthe result of its destructive action. “If you will only think,” “if you willonly use a little will,” and “if you will only remember that you have a mind,”we say to the children of the race and to beginners upon the Path of consciousReturn. Little by little, then, the focus and the orientation shift out of theastral life and from the emotional level of consciousness into the mental, andconsequently into the reflection of the world of purpose, found in the threeworlds. When that stage has been somewhat developed, then there follows, uponthe Path of Discipleship and of preparation for initiation, an effort to graspand understand the higher aspects of this mental process, and the will aspect ofthe egoic life begins to influence the disciple. The “petals of sacrifice”unfold and the sacred sacrificial aspect of life is revealed in its beauty,purity, simplicity and in its revolutionising quality.Upon the Path of Initiation, the monadic will (of which the egoic will is thereflection and the individual self-will is the distortion) is graduallytransmitted, via the antahkarana, direct to the man upon the physical plane.This produces the higher correspondence of those qualities so glibly spoken ofby the well-trained but dense esotericist—transmutation and transformation. Theresult is the assimilation of the individual will and the egoic will into thepurpose of the Monad which is the purpose—undeviating and unalterable—of the Onein Whom we live and move and have our being. This is the field of the trueburning, for our “God is a consuming Fire.” This is the burning bush or theburning tree of life of Biblical symbolism. This highest of all the fires, thisdeeply spiritual and hitherto seldom recognised burning-ground, has its effectssummed up for us in the next phrase or sentence of Rule I.3. The clear cold light shines forth and cold it is and yet the heat—evoked bythe group love—permits the warmth of energetic moving out.[32] In these words you have the key to group initiation. The light of thehigher initiations can stream in when it is evoked by the group love. That lightis clear and cold, but produces the needed “heat,” which is a symbolic word usedin many of the world Scriptures to express living, spiritual energy. I said“spiritual energy” and not soul force, and herein lies a distinction which youwill some day have to grasp.This group love is based upon the egoic aspect of the will to which we give thename “sacrificial love.” This does not connote happy relationships betweenindividual members of the group. It might, presumably, lead to unhappy outer,superficial interplay, but basically it leads to an unalterably staunch loyalty,underlying the surface of the outer life. The Master’s influence, as He seeks toaid His disciple, always produces transitory turmoil—transitory from the angleof the soul, but frequently appalling from the angle of the personality.Similarly, the projection of the life and influence of any senior disciple intothe periphery or aura of the aspirant or lesser disciple is—in itsdegree—likewise disturbing and upsetting; this is a point which should becarefully borne in mind, both as regards the disciple’s own reactions andtraining, and as regards any effect which he may call forth in the life of aprobationary disciple or lesser disciple in his own sphere of influence. Theseintrusive influences and their consequent effects which are produced upon anindividual or a group by a Master or a senior disciple are usually interpretedin personality terms, and are very little understood. They are neverthelessaspects of the higher will in some higher disciple and are beating upon thepersonality will and evoking the sacrificial will of the Ego, and hence lead toa period of temporary discomfort. This the aspirant and the inexperienceddisciple resent and blame the evoking sources for their discomfort, instead oflearning the needed lesson of receiving and handling force.Where, however, real love exists, it will produce the lessening of thepersonality will, the evocation of the sacrificial egoic will, and a constantlygrowing capacity to identify [33] the group with the will or purpose of theMonad. The progress of the group is, therefore, from one burning ground toanother—each burning ground being colder and clearer than the preceding one butproducing sequentially the burning fire, the clear cold lighted fire, and theconsuming divine fire.Thus in parables the truth goes out, and gradually the initiate grasps the usesof heat, warmth, light and energy; he arrives at an understanding of self-will,sacrificial will and Shamballic purpose, and only Love (self-love, group love,and finally, divine love) can reveal the significance of these symbolic wordsand the occult paradoxes which confront the true aspirant as he attempts totread the Way.As we continue our studies of the rules to be followed by those receivinginitiate-training, I would remind you of certain things, some of them alreadytouched upon but requiring re-emphasis. Any usefulness which these Rules mayhave for you will be dependent upon your grasping a few basic ideas and thenproceeding to make them factual as far as in you lies.First, I would call your attention to what should be the basic attitude of thewould-be initiate: It should be one of purpose, governed by pure reason andworking out in spiritual activity . That is a sentence easily written, but whatspecifically does it convey to you? Let me enlarge upon it somewhat. Theattitude of the initiate-in-training should be one of right spiritual motive—themotive being the intelligent fulfillment of the will aspect of divinity, or ofthe Monad. This involves the merging of his personality self-will into that ofthe sacrificial will of the soul; and this, when accomplished, will lead to therevelation of the divine Will. Of this Will, no one who is not an initiate hasany conception. It means, secondly, the release of the faculty of spiritualperception and of intuitive understanding, which involves the negation of theactivity of the lower or concrete mind, of the lower personal self, and thesubordination of the knowledge aspect of the soul to the clear pure light of thedivine understanding. When these two factors are beginning to be [34] active,you will have the emergence of true spiritual activity upon the physical plane,motivated from the high source of the Monad, and implemented by the pure reasonof the intuition.It will be apparent to you, therefore, that these higher spiritual faculties canonly be brought into play when the bridging antahkarana is beginning to play itspart. Hence the teaching which I am giving on the construction of the rainbowbridge.These Rules are in reality great Formulas of Approach, but they indicateapproach to a specific section of the Path and not approach to the Initiator. Iwould have you reflect upon this distinction. The “Way of the Higher Evolution”lies open to the aspirant to the Greater Mysteries, but he is oft bewildered inthe beginning and frequently questions in his mind the difference between theprogress or evolution of the personality towards soul consciousness and thenature of the progress which lies ahead and which is essentially different tothe unfoldment of pure consciousness. Had you grasped the fact that after thethird initiation, the initiate is not concerned with consciousness at all, butwith the fusion of his individual will with the divine will. He is not thenoccupied with increasing his sensitivity to contact, or with his consciousresponse to environing conditions, but is becoming increasingly aware of thedynamics of the Science of the Service of the Plan. This distinctive realisationcan only come when his fused and blended personality and soul expression of willhas disappeared in the blazing light of the divine Purpose—a purpose whichcannot be frustrated even if at times delayed, as it has been during the pastfifty-five years. (Written in February, 1943.)Much of what I have said above will seem meaningless to you because the finishedcontact between soul and personality has not been brought about and the willaspect in manifestation is not yet understood in its three phases: Personality,Egoic and Monadic. But, as I have earlier told you, I write for those disciplesand initiates who are now coming into incarnation and who will be in the fullflower of their [35] consciousness and service at the latter end of thiscentury. But the effort you make to understand will have its effect, even if thebrain registers it not.In the last analysis, these Rules or Formulas of Approach are primarilyconcerned with the Shamballa or life aspect. They are the only Formulas orembodied techniques at present extant which have in them the quality which willenable the aspirant to understand and eventually express the significance of thewords of Christ, “Life more abundantly.” These words relate to contact withShamballa; the result will be the expression of the will aspect. The wholeprocess of invocation and evocation is tied up with the idea. The lesser aspectis ever the invoking factor, and this constitutes an unalterable law lyingbehind the entire evolutionary process. It is necessarily a reciprocal process,but in time and space it might be broadly said that the lesser ever invokes thehigher, and higher factors are then evoked and respond according to the measureof understanding and the dynamic tension displayed by the invoking element. Thismany fail to realise. You do not work at the evocative process. That word simplyconnotes the response of that which has been reached. The task of the lesseraspect or group is invocative, and the success of the invocative rite is calledevocation.When, therefore, your life is fundamentally invocative, then there will come theevocation of the will. It is only truly invocative when personality and soul arefused and functioning as a consciously blended and focussed unit.The next point which I seek to make is that these Formulas of Approach or Rulesdeal with the unfoldment of group consciousness, because it is only in groupformation that, as yet, the Shamballa force of the will can be tapped. They areuseless to the individual under the new initiatory dispensation. Only the group,under the proposed new mode of working and of group initiation, is capable ofinvoking Shamballa. That is why Hitler, the exponent of the reversed reaction toShamballa (and consequently the evil reaction) had to gather around him a groupof like-minded people or [36] personalities. On the upper arc of the evocativecycle (Hitler being the expression of the invocative arc of the Shamballa force)it requires a group to bring about evocation.We now come to my third point in relation to the Rules or Formulas and theirobjective. They are concerned—above everything else—with group initiation. Theyhave other applications, but for the present here lies their usefulness. What,you may ask, is group initiation? Does it involve the taking of initiation byevery member in the group? Can one person have so extensive an influence that hecan hold up or delay or even prevent (in time and space) the group initiation?The group need not necessarily contain members who have all taken the sameinitiation. By this I mean that the necessary initiation of all the memberssimultaneously into the same group development is not required. Basically, whatI am endeavouring to say anent these Rules has relation to the thirdinitiation—the initiation of the integrated personality. They necessarily,however, have a correspondence to the second initiation, and are consequently ofmore general interest, for it is that initiation which faces so many aspirantstoday—the demonstration of the control of the formidable emotional nature.I would ask you to think much about this point which I have just made. Groupinitiation means that the bulk of the members are correctly oriented; that theyare proposing to accept the discipline which will prepare them for the nextgreat expansion of consciousness, and that none of them can possibly be deviatedfrom their purpose (note that word with its first ray or Shamballicimplications), no matter what is happening in their environment or theirpersonal life. You need to reflect on this if you desire to make the neededprogress.In these short instructions, which aim only at a “tentative indication” (notethat phrase), it is not necessary to enter into explicit details. In any case,if the Formulas or Rules are not intuitively clear to your minds, anything Icould say would only hinder and frustrate my purpose.Finally, these Formulas or Rules are susceptible of [37] three forms ofapplication or interpretation and I would have you remember this, because youcan thereby discover where your individual focus of attention is and if you areconsequently functioning as an integrated personality. Remember always that onlyan integrated personality can achieve the needed soul focus. This is afundamental requirement. These three forms of application are physical,emotional and mental in nature. But those words in their simplest connotationhave true reference to the task of achieving one or other of the higherinitiations. The only way their significance can truly appear is by grasping thefollowing meanings:1. The physical application refers to the usage by the group of the givenknowledge and intuitively perceived information in such a way that the needs ofthe larger group, of which the group itself is a part, are constructivelyserved. The consummation of this ideal is to be found in the activity of theHierarchy itself which, from progressive point to progressive point, findsitself in the position of intuitive interpreter and force transmitter betweenthe centre of Shamballa and Humanity. The individual initiate, on the way to oneor other of the higher initiations, has in his lesser degree to achieve the samedual function and thereby fit himself for the wider cooperation.2. The emotional application has definite reference to the world of meaning,interpreted in a group sense. At present, well-meaning aspirants are satisfiedif they are able to interpret their personality conditions, events andhappenings in terms of their real meaning. But that still remains an individualreaction. The aspirant who is seeking to comprehend these Rules is moreinterested in seeing the situations which he contacts in terms of a world whole,and in searching for their meaning in terms of their group significance. Thisserves to decentralise him and to convey into his consciousness some aspect ofthat larger whole, and this in its turn contributes to the expansion of theconsciousness of humanity as a whole. [38]3. The mental application has to be grasped and considered in terms of the“great light.” It must be remembered that the mind is the organ of illumination.Therefore it might be asked: Do the united mental processes of the group as awhole tend to throw light on human problems and situations? How much does thelight of the individual group member aid in this process? How much light do you,as an individual, register and therefore contribute to the greater light? Is thegroup light a dim flicker or a blazing sun?Such are some of the implications lying behind the use of these familiar words,and the careful consideration of their meaning might bring about a definiteexpansion of consciousness. This expansion normally follows certain clear anddefinite stages:> 1. A recognition of the goal. This goal is often expressed under the word “the> door.” A door permits entrance into some place larger than the area covered by> the standing room of the would-be initiate. This statement refers to the “door> of incarnation” through which the incarnating soul enters into life—limited> and restricted from the angle of the soul. The door of initiation admits “into> a larger room” or sphere of extended expression.> 2. The approach, under regulated and imposed and well-tried rules, of the> entering one towards a visioned goal. This involves conformity to that which> has been tried, known and demonstrated by all previous initiates.> 3. The arresting of the steps of the initiate before the door in order that he> may “prove himself to be initiate” prior to entry.> 4. The passing of certain tests in order to demonstrate fitness.> 5. Then comes the stage of entrance—under due and set rules and yet with full> freedom of action. You will see, therefore, why ever the need for> understanding is emphasised.Before proceeding to study the final phrases of Rule [39] One, I would call yourattention to the fact that the initiate has faced two major tests, symbolicallydescribed as “the burning ground” and the “clear cold light.” Only after he hassuccessfully passed these can he—or the group, when considering groupinitiation—move forward and outward into the wider reaches of the divineconsciousness. These tests are applied when the soul grips the personality andthe fire of divine love destroys the loves and desires of the integratedpersonality. Two factors tend to bring this about: the slow moving forward ofthe innate conscience into greater control, and the steady development of the“fiery aspiration” to which Patanjali (The Light of the Soul (Book II, Sutra 1)page 119.) makes reference. These two factors, when brought into livingactivity, bring the disciple into the centre of the burning ground whichseparates the Angel of the Presence from the Dweller on the Threshold. Theburning ground is found upon the threshold of every new advance, until the thirdinitiation has been taken.The “clear cold light” is the light of pure reason, of infallible intuitiveperception and its unremitting, intensive and revealing light constitutes amajor test in its effects. The initiate discovers the depths of evil, and at thesame time is enticed forward by the heights of a growing sense of divinity. Theclear cold light reveals two things:A. The omnipresence of God throughout nature, and therefore throughout theentire personality life of the initiate or of the initiate group. The scalesfall from the eyes, bringing about—paradoxically—the “dark night of the soul”and the sense of being alone and bereft of all help. This led (in the case ofthe Christ, for instance) to that appalling moment in the Garden of Gethsemane,and which was consummated on the Cross, when the will of personality-soulclashed with the divine will of the Monad. The revelation to the initiate of theages of severance from the Central Reality, and of all its attendantimplications, descends upon the one who is attempting to stand “in isolatedUnity,” as Patanjali (to quote him a second time) calls the experience. (TheLight of the Soul (Book IV, Sutras 25.34) pages 420, 428) *[40] The omnipresence of divinity within all forms pours in upon theconsciousness of the initiate, and the mystery of time, space and electricitystands revealed. The major effect of this revelation (prior to the thirdinitiation) is to bring to the disciple a realisation of the “great heresy ofseparateness,” as it focusses in him, the separated fully consciousindividual—aware of his past, conscious now of his ray and its conditioningpower, focussed in his own aspiration, and yet part of the great whole ofnature. From that moment onward he knows that divinity is all there is, and thishe learns through the revelation of the inherent separativeness of the formlife, through the processes of “the dark night of the soul” and its culminatinglesson of the significance of isolation and the freeing process which bringsabout the merging into unity through the emission of the sound, the cry, theinvocation, such as the cry of the Christ upon the Cross symbolised. His exactwords have not been transmitted to us. They vary for each ray, but all bringabout the recognition of divine merging, in which all separating veils are “rentfrom the top to the bottom” (as The New Testament expresses it).B. The omniscience of the divine Whole is also brought home to the initiatethrough the medium of the clear cold light, and the phases of “isolatedexperience,” as it is sometimes occultly called, is forever ended. I would haveyou realise what this can mean in so far as possible to your presentconsciousness. Up till the present, the initiate-disciple has been functioningas a duality and as a fusion of soul-energy and personality-force. Now theseforms of life stand exposed to him for what they essentially are, and he knowsthat—as directing agencies and as transitory gods—they no longer have any holdover him. He is being gradually translated into another divine aspect, takingwith him all that he has received during the ages of close relation andidentification with the third aspect, form, and the second aspect,consciousness. A sense of being bereft, deserted and alone descends upon him ashe realises that the control of form and soul must also disappear. Here lies theagony [41] of isolation and the overpowering sense of loneliness. But the truthsrevealed by the clear cold light of the divine reason leave him no choice. Hemust relinquish all that holds him away from the Central Reality; he must gainlife and “life more abundantly.” This constitutes the supreme test in the lifecycle of the incarnating Monad; and “when the very heart of this experienceenters into the heart of the initiate, then he moves outward through that heartinto full life expression.” Such is the way that the Old Commentary expressesthis. I know no other way in which to bring the idea before you. The experienceundergone is not related to form, nor is it connected with consciousness or witheven the higher psychic sensitivity. It consists of pure identification withdivine purpose. This is made possible because the self-will of the personalityand the enlightened will of the soul have both equally been relinquished.4. Behind the group there stands the Door. Before them opens out the Way.Note how this passage reverses the usual presentation. Hitherto, in the occultbooks, the Door of Initiation has been presented as ever moving forward ahead ofthe initiate. He passes through door after door into a wider experience andexpansion of consciousness. But in the initiate consciousness, after the firsttwo initiations, this is not the realisation. It is simply the adhering to anold form of symbolism with the implied limitations of the truth. I would hereremind you that the third initiation is regarded by the Hierarchy as the firstmajor initiation, and that the first and second initiations are initiations ofthe Threshold. For the bulk of humanity, these first two initiations will for avery long time constitute major initiatory experiences, but in the life andrealisation of the initiate-soul, they are not. After the two initiations of thethreshold have been undergone the attitude of the initiate changes and he seespossibilities and factors and revelations which have hitherto [42] been totallyunrealised and unknown, even to his consciousness at his highest moments.The door of initiation looms large in the consciousness of the neophyte; thehigher Way is the determining factor in the life of the initiate of the thirddegree. It is the Transfiguration; and a new glory pours through thetransfigured initiate who has been released from every type of grip by eitherthe personality or the soul. For the first time, the goal of the higher Way andthe attainment of Nirvana (as the Oriental calls it) appears before him, and heknows that no forms and no spiritual complexes and no pull by either soul orform, or by both united, can have any effect upon his attaining his finaldestination.I would like for a moment to refer here to the door symbology as the initiatebegins to grasp the inner meaning of those simple words. For long the teaching,given in the clear cold light, anent the door and the emphasis put upon thepresentation of the door lying ahead of the aspirant has been made familiar, butthat has been working with the lower aspects of the symbolism, even if aspirantsdid not realise it; they have been taught the fact of the light in the head,which is the personality correspondence to the clear cold light to which Irefer. At the very centre of that light, as many aspirants know theoretically orfactually by inconstant experience, is a centre or point of dark indigoblue—midnight blue. Note the significance of this in view of what I have beensaying anent the “dark night,” the midnight hour, the zero hour in the life ofthe soul. That centre is in reality an opening, a door leading somewhere, a wayof escape, a place through which the soul imprisoned in the body can emerge andpass into higher states of consciousness, untrammelled by form limitations; ithas also been called “the funnel or the channel for the sound”; it has beennamed the “trumpet through which the escaping A.U.M. can pass.” The ability touse this door or channel is brought about by the practice of alignment; hencethe emphasis laid upon this exercise in the attempt to train aspirants anddisciples.Once alignment has been achieved, it will be realised [43] (remembering thesymbolism of the head, the light and the central opening) that many occasionsarise in meditation when “behind the group there stands the door; before themopens out the Way.” This is the lower correspondence of the higherinitiate-experience with which our rule is dealing.Again, this time in relation to the soul, comes the repetition of the discoveryof the Door, its use and its appearance, finally, behind the initiate. This timethe door must be found upon the mental plane, and not as earlier upon theetheric level; this is brought about by the aid of the soul and of the lowermind and through the revealing power of the clear cold light of the reason. Whendiscovered, the “revelation of a terrible though beautiful experiment” faces theinitiate. He finds that this time alignment is not his need, but the definiteundertaking of a creative work—the building of a bridge between the door whichlies behind and the door which lies ahead. This involves the construction ofwhat is technically the antahkarana, the rainbow bridge. This is built by thedisciple-in-training upon the basis of his past experience; it is anchored inthe past and firmly grounded in the highest, rightly oriented aspect of thepersonality. As the disciple then creatively works, he finds that there is areciprocal action on the part of the Presence, the Monad—the unity which standsbehind the Door. He discovers that one span of the bridge (if I might so callit) is being built or pushed forward from the other side of the gulf separatinghim from experience in the life of the Spiritual Triad. This Spiritual Triad isessentially, to the initiate, what the threefold personality is to the man inphysical incarnation.I wonder if I have succeeded in giving you at least a general idea of thepossibilities lying ahead of the disciple, and incited you to definite consciousresponse to those possibilities. I cannot do other than speak in terms ofconsciousness, even though the life of the Triad—leading in its turn toidentification with the Monad, as the personality life leads eventually to soulcontrol and expression—has naught to do with consciousness or sensitivity asthose terms are [44] commonly understood. Yet remember how, in all my teachingsupon occult unfoldment, I have used the word IDENTIFICATION. This is the onlyword I have found which can in any way convey the complete unity which isfinally achieved by those who develop a sense of unity, and who refuse to acceptisolation; separateness then fades out entirely. The isolated unity achieved isunity with the Whole, with Being in its totality (and this cannot as yet conveymuch to you).5. Together let the band of brothers onward move—out of the fire, into the cold,and toward a newer tension.Here, in very brief form, certain basic instructions are given. Each of themindicates the new attitudes imposed upon all who have taken initiation. Theycannot be interpreted in terms of the Path of Discipleship or of Probation. Theordinary and easily-arrived-at significances mean little to the initiate mind.Let me briefly consider them so that clarity of concept, though not of detail,may prevail.a. Out of the fire. This is a symbolic way of indicating that the personalitylife is definitely and finally left behind. It is this phrase which gives theclue to the initiation which is referred to in this Rule. Each of these Rulescontains within itself the clue to the particular initiation to which referenceis being made. The Rules are not placed in their right order, having sequentialreference to the seven initiations. The intuition of the aspirant must beinvoked if he is to arrive at right knowledge. I shall sometimes indicate theinitiation involved, but not always, as it would profit not. The clue to theseventh initiation which lies ahead for such high Beings as the Christ would beof no service to you at all. The clue to the initiation of the Transfigurationcan be of importance, as it involves the personality, and many of you in the notso distant future (from the angle of the aeonial life cycle of the soul) willface that. The secret of the third initiation is the demonstration of completefreedom from the claims and demands of the personality. It does not involve theachievement of [45] a completely perfect expression of the spiritual life, butit does indicate that the service of the initiate and his lifedemonstration—regarded in a broad and general way, from the angle of thelife-tendency and of entire dedication to humanity—remains untouched by thelimitations, still existent, of the personal lower self.b. Into the cold. This means that the focus of the life is now in the realm ofclear truth and of pure reason. The life of the initiate is being rapidlytransferred out of the egoic centre, the soul vehicle, on to the level of thebuddhic life or state of being. Note, I do not say “of consciousness.” This isformless, but preserves the fruitage of form experience. It is being orientedtowards a realised unity and identification with the life aspect of divinity,and yet preserves its own recognised and achieved identity. On this level ofpure impersonality and of right orientation the group stands, obedient to therule which governs this particular stage of development.c. Toward a newer tension. The interpretation of the phrase presents difficulty.This is owing to the false impression which the word “tension” conveys at thistime. It is associated in the minds of the reading public with the thought ofnerves, with points of crisis, with courage and with fatigue. Is this not so?But in reality tension, occultly understood, is not associated with theseaspects of personality reaction at all. The esoteric significance of tension (asfar as I can explain it by limiting words) is “focussed immovable Will.” Righttension is the identification of brain and soul with the will aspect, and thepreservation of that identification—unchanged and immovable—no matter what thecircumstances and the difficulties.You can see, therefore, how far ahead of present attitudes and goals thisteaching is. Identification with the soul and with the Hierarchy is dependentupon the ability of the disciple rightly to love. It is the emergence of thesecond divine aspect, for love is the expression of group life, and [46] that israre indeed to find in these days. Right tension indicates the emergence of thefirst aspect, of the will, and this is seldom to be found as yet, save among themore advanced disciples and initiate members of the Hierarchy.Love governs the Way into the life of the Hierarchy and is the foundation forall approach to, and appreciation and acceptance of truth.Will governs the Way into Shamballa and is the foundation for all approach to,appreciation of and identification with, Being.This developed will expresses itself as tension, esoterically understood. Itembodies the ideas of orientation, implacable determination, ability to wait andto preserve intention and orientation unmoved by aught which may occur. It alsoinvolves the determination to take the intended action (always of a creativenature and based on loving understanding) at the psychological moment (righttiming), or that exact moment which the psyche or soul determines to be correct.Here you have one of the interesting transferences of meaning and ofrelationship which occur in the Ageless Wisdom. The Son or soul emerges intomanifestation with the concurrence and aid of the Mother or of the matteraspect. This is to you a most familiar truth. In the next stage, that ofinitiate-development, the Son, in its turn, becomes the feminine or negativeaspect and, demonstrating as the Psyche, enables the initiate to bring intoexpression another divine aspect—that of the will. Until the fourth initiationis undergone, it is the soul as a “focal point for descending light and forascending radiance.” This dual activity reveals the nature of the will. Note howthis phrase from an ancient writing describes the antahkarana.It is not possible in these brief instructions to deal adequately with the willaspect of divinity, nor would it profit at this time. Aspirants have to learnthe nature of the will by the power of inner illumination and by certainintelligent recognitions. They learn the nature of the self through the aid ofthe personality, the shadow or distortion of the divine will. They pass from theexpression of the will which [47] is purely selfish, self-sufficient andself-focussed, to the grasp of the group will and to the effort to embody thatgroup will. This group will is always concerned with that which is not the willof the separated self.As this ability to be selflessly decentralised grows and develops, the aspirantreaches a point where the group life and the group good is seen as an integralpart of a much greater Whole. This greater Whole is Being Itself, divorced fromform but ever working through form whilst in manifestation, and working withplanned purpose. The realisation then grows that intelligence and love are notenough, but that they must be supplemented and implemented by will, which isactive intelligent purpose, lovingly applied.The difficulty of this subject is inherent in the fact that basically (no matterhow strange this may seem) love is the line of least resistance for thedeveloped human being. It is the governing principle of the present solarsystem. Will is the governing principle of the next or coming solar system,which will be brought into manifestation through the agency of those humanbeings who—in this solar system—arrive at the full expression of the willaspect. Then, in the coming consummating manifestation, love will be to the willaspect what intelligence is, in this solar system, to love.RULE TWOIn our study of Rule One on Initiation, we gained (or perhaps fixed more clearlyin our minds) three major thoughts:> 1. That the Path of Initiation is one on which we develop the Will aspect of> divinity.> 2. We learn also to use consciousness as a jumping off place for the> recognition of a new state of realisation, which is not consciousness at all,> as we understand that term.> 3. We undergo, prior to each initiation, two major tests—that of the burning> ground and that of the clear cold light.[48] We closed our discussion with the thought of Tension and I defined it asthe identification of the brain and soul with the will aspect and thepreservation of that identification—unchanged and immovable—in all circumstancesand difficulties. I mention this as the “tension” concept or point of attainmentunderlies the teaching of the rule which we are now going to consider.Rule II.> The WORD has now gone forth from the great point of tension: Accepted as a> group. Withdraw not now your application. You could not, if you would; but add> to it three great demands and forward move. Let there be no recollection and> yet let memory rule. Work from the point of all that is within the content of> the group’s united life.A close analysis of this rule will convey to the intuition far more than appearsupon the surface, and that is rich enough. Each of these rules holds in it theseed of that understanding which must be evoked before the next rule can bemastered. All that is given is ever based on that which has gone before. The“three great demands” of the initiate are based upon the “triple call” found inRule Two for aspirants and disciples. The triple call was earlier sounded forth.Now its higher significances must be comprehended.There are only four parts to this rule, which is one of prime importance becauseit contains the motivating force, the conditioning factors and the place oftriumph—all these are indicated. We will, as is our usual custom, study eachseparate part sequentially and as far as possible in detail bearing in mind thatinitiation deals with factors in latent manifestation for which our languageshave no words, and with ideas which are not yet to be found among the “raincloudof knowable things” (as Patanjali calls it)—that is, knowable to the masses ofmen. The initiate is, however, dealing with a world of meaning and of affairswhich are not yet manifesting in any way. The task of the Master [49] (and ofThose higher than He) is to take those steps and precipitate those “waitingevents” which will eventually bring them into manifestation. This, I wouldremind you, is always done by the use of the will and from a point of tension.1. The Word has now gone forth from the great point of tension: Accepted as agroup.I would like here to call your attention to the progressive nature of theesoteric science; it is nowhere better illustrated than in this phrase; nowhereis it more clearly shown and yet, unless the intuition and the sense ofcorrelation are functioning, the idea might escape recognition.In all the teaching given to the aspirant and to the disciple in the earlystages of their training, the emphasis has been upon the “point of light” whichmust be discovered, brought into full illumination, and then so used that theone in whom the light shines becomes a light-bearer in a dark world. This, theaspirant is taught, becomes possible when contact with the soul has been madeand the light is found. This is familiar teaching to many and is the essence ofthe progress to be made by aspirants and disciples in the first part of theirtraining.We now, however, pass on to another expression and to the next development inthe life of the initiate, which is learning to work from a “point of tension.”Here lies the new emphasis, and I am bringing it to the attention of humanity asmankind nears the close, the terrible but liberating finale, of his great testin this modern burning-ground. Now men can pass on into the clear cold light,and from there begin to hold that point of tension which will be evocative ofthe needed “understanding will-to-move forward” along the line of humanwill-to-good—the first phase of the development of the will aspect. It is thehigher sublimation of the aspirational stage which precedes the attainment ofthe “point of light” through contact with the soul.The point of tension is found when the dedicated will [50] of the personality isbrought into touch with the will of the Spiritual Triad. This takes place inthree clearly defined stages:1. The stage wherein the lower will aspect which is focussed in the mentalbody—the will-to-activity of the personality—is brought into contact with thehigher abstract mind; this latter is the interpreting agent for the Monad andthe lowest aspect of the Triad. Two things can be noted in this respect:> a. This contact becomes possible from the moment that the first thin strand of> the antahkarana, the rainbow bridge, is completed between the mental unit and> the manasic permanent atom.> b. This demonstrates in an absorbing devotion to the Plan and is an effort, at> any cost, to serve that Plan as it is progressively understood and grasped.This expresses itself in the cultivation of goodwill, as understood by theaverage intelligent human being and put into action as a way of life.2. The stage wherein the love aspect of the soul is brought into touch with thecorresponding aspect of the Triad, to which we give the inadequate name of theintuition. This is in reality divine insight and comprehension, as expressedthrough the formulation of ideas. Here you have an instance of the inadequacy ofmodern language; ideas are formless and are in effect points of energy, outwardmoving in order eventually to express some “intention” of the divine creatingLogos. When the initiate grasps this and identifies himself with it, hisgoodwill expands into the will-to-good. Plan and quality give place to purposeand method. Plans are fallible and tentative and serve a temporary need.Purpose, as expressed by the initiate is permanent, farsighted, unalterable, andserves the Eternal Idea.3. The stage wherein—after the fourth initiation—there is direct unbrokenrelation between the Monad, via the Triad, and the form which the Master isusing to do His [51] work among men. This form may be either His temporarypersonality, arrived at along the normal lines of incarnation, or the speciallycreated form to which Theosophists give the technical but cumbersome word“mayavirupa.” It is the “true mask, hiding the radiant light and the dynamicenergy of a revealed Son of God.” This is the esoteric definition which I offeryou. This stage can be called the attainment of the will-to-be, not Being as anindividual expression but Being as an expression of the Whole—all-inclusive,nonseparative, motivated by goodness, beauty and truth and intelligentlyexpressed as pure love.All these stages are achieved by the attainment of one point of tension afteranother, and the work thus carried forward into the realm of the dynamicsteadfast will. This will, as it is progressively developed, works ever from aconstant point of tension.We come now to the consideration of a subject which always proves exceedinglydifficult to students: The nature of the WORD, the A.U.M., and its laterdevelopments, the O.M. and the Sound. Much confusion exists as to itssignificance or the necessity for its use. The phase of its recognition throughwhich we are now passing is a purely exoteric one of accustoming the generalpublic to the fact of its existence. This has been brought about in three ways:1. Through the constant use in all the Christian Churches of the word “Amen,”which is a western corruption of the A.U.M. The A.U.M. is here the lowest aspectof the originating Sound.2. Through the emphasis laid in Masonry upon the Lost Word, thus subtly drawingthe attention of humanity to the O.M., the Sound of the second aspect, the Soul.3. Through the growing emphasis laid by the many occult groups throughout theworld upon the use of the O.M., its frequent use by these groups in public, andby those intent upon meditation.The soundest approach is that of the Masonic tradition, because it dealsprimarily with the world of meaning and [52] with a phase of the esotericteaching. The use of the Amen in the ritual of the Christian Church willeventually be discouraged, because it is basically a materialistic affirmation,being usually regarded by the average churchgoer as setting the seal of divineapproval upon his demand to the Almighty for protection, or for the supply ofhis physical necessities; all this is, therefore, related to the life of desire,of aspiration, of dualism and of request. It involves the attitude of giver andrecipient.The A.U.M. and the Amen are both of them an expression in sound of the principleof active intelligent substance in the divine manifestation, the third aspect,and have served human need in that phase of material and form development. Irefer here also to the development of mind or of the mental form. Thepersonality as a whole, when perfected and brought under control of the soul, isthe “Word made flesh.”The mass of aspirants and of disciples are today learning the meaning of theO.M., which is not the Word made flesh, but the Word released from form, andexpressing itself as soul-spirit and not as body-soul-spirit. It might,therefore, be said that:1. The A.U.M. (note that I separate each aspect of this triple sound) brings thesoul-spirit aspect down on to the physical plane and anchors it there by theforce of its outgoing vibration. Using a symbol to make my meaning clear, it islike “a strong wind that pins a man against a wall and makes free effortdifficult.” It vivifies form; it intensifies the hold of matter upon the soul;it builds around the soul a confining prison—a prison of the senses. It is the“sound of enchantment,” the sound that is the source of glamour and of maya; itis the great beguiling and deceptive energy, the note of the involutionary arc.In it are hid the secret of evil or matter, the uses of form, first as a prison,then as a training ground and as a field of experience, and finally as theexpression for the manifestation of a Son of God.2. The O.M. rightly sounded, releases the soul from the realm of glamour and ofenchantment. It is the sound of [53] liberation, the great note of resurrectionand of the raising of humanity to the Secret Place of the Most High when allother Words and sounds have failed. It is not a triple sound as is the A.U.M.,but a dual sound, significant of the relation of spirit and soul, and of lifeand consciousness. This lost Word, symbolic of the loss in the three worlds(typified by the degrees of the Blue Lodges in Masonry) must be recovered and isin process of discovery today. The mystics have sought after it; the Masons havepreserved the tradition of its existence; the disciples and initiates of theworld must demonstrate its possession.3. The SOUND is the sole expression of the Ineffable Name, the secretappellation of the One in Whom we live and move and have our being, and Who isknown to the Great White Lodge through this name. Remember always that name andform are synonymous terms in the occult teaching, and these two words hold thesecret of manifestation. The goal of the initiate is identification with allforms of the divine life, so that he can know himself to be an integral part ofthat Whole and can tune in on all states of divine awareness, knowing forhimself (and not just theoretically) that they are also his own states ofawareness. He can then penetrate into the divine arcana of knowledge, share inthe divine omnipresence and—at will—express the divine omniscience and preparehimself to manifest in full consciousness the divine omnipotence.I am using words which are futile to convey the underlying meaning of the Word.Understanding can only be arrived at when a man lives the Word , hearing itssoundless Sound and breathing it forth in a vital life-giving breath to others.The masses are hearing the sound of the A.U.M. and, in their higher brackets,are finding that A.U.M. the expression of something from which they seekrelease. The aspirants and disciples of the World are hearing the O.M. and intheir personal lives the A.U.M. and the O.M. are in conflict. This may representa new idea to you, but it conveys an idea of an eternal fact. It may help you togain an understanding [54] of this phase if I point out for you that for thisfirst group the O.M. can be portrayed in the following symbol as expressing thematerial M nature whereas the second group can be portrayed by the symbol mexpressive of the soul enveloped in matter. You will see, therefore, how theteaching leads man progressively onward and how the occult science brings man intouch with great mental reversals and divine paradoxes. For aeons the Word ofthe soul and the Sound of spiritual reality are lost. Today, the Word of thesoul is being found again, and with that finding the little self is lost in theglory and the radiance of the divine Self.This discovery is consummated at the time of the third initiation. The initiateand the Master, along with those of higher rank who are approachingidentification with Shamballa, are steadily and ever more clearly hearing theSound emanating from the Central Spiritual Sun and penetrating all forms ofdivine life upon our planet—via our Planetary Logos Who hears it with clarityand with understanding—the Sound of the lowest syllable of the Ineffable Name ofthe One in Whom all the Planetary Logoi live and move and have Their Being, forThey are centres in the LIFE which is expressing itself through the medium of asolar system.You can see how little use there is in my enlarging further upon this. Its soleusefulness is to give an expanding impulse to the consciousness of the discipleand to stir his imagination (the seed of the intuition), so that even whilstoccupied in expressing the M and then the m , he will be reaching out after theSound.Earlier I pointed out that the sound of the A.U.M., the sound of the O.M. andthe SOUND itself are all related to vibration and to its differing and variedeffects. The secret of the Law of Vibration is progressively revealed as peoplelearn to sound forth the Word in its three aspects. Students would also do wellto ponder on the distinction between the breath and the Sound, between theprocess of breathing and of creating directed vibratory activity. The one isrelated to Time and the other to Space and they are distinct from each other;and (as the Old Commentary puts it) “the Sound, the [55] final and yetinitiating Sound, concerns that which is neither Time nor Space; it lies outsidethe manifested ALL, the Source of all that is and yet is naught.” (No thing .A.A.B.)There are, therefore, great points of tension from which the Sacred Word, in itsmajor aspects, goes forth. Let me list them for you:1. The creative point of tension—a tension achieved by a planetary Logos when Heresponds to the Sound of the Ineffable Name and breathes it forth in His turn inthree great Sounds which made one Sound on His Own plane of expression, thuscreating the manifested world, the impulse towards the unfoldment ofconsciousness, and the influence of life itself. This is the Sound.2. Seven points of tension on the downward or involutionary arc; these producethe seven planets, the seven states of consciousness, and the expression of theseven ray impulses. This constitutes the sevenfold A.U.M. of which the AgelessWisdom takes note. It is related to the effect of spirit or life upon substance,thus originating form and creating the prison of the divine life.3. The A.U.M. itself or the Word made flesh; this creates finally a point oftension in the fourth kingdom in nature, at which point the evolutionary cyclebecomes possible and the first dim note of the O.M. can be faintly heard. In theindividual man this point is reached when the personality is an integrated andfunctioning whole and the soul is beginning to control it. It is an accumulativetension arrived at through many lives. This process is expressed in the Masters’Archives as follows:> [Image00012.jpg]You must remember that these symbols are an attempt on my part to translateancient signatures in modern occidental type. The only one which is the same inall languages is, esoterically, the A.U.M. [56]4. Then comes a point of tension from which the man eventually achievesliberation from the three worlds and stands as a free soul; he is then a pointwithin the circle—the point indicating the point of tension from which he nowworks, and the circle the sphere of his self-initiated activity.I need not carry the story further; from tension to tension the initiate passesjust as do all human beings, aspirants, disciples and the lower grades ofinitiates; from one expansion of consciousness to another they go until thethird initiation is undergone and points of tension (qualified by intension andpurpose) supersede all previous efforts and the will aspect begins to control.Here, briefly, is a fresh slant upon the familiar theme of the Word—a themepreserved in some form by all the world religions but a theme which, like allelse, has been so materialised that it is the task of the Hierarchy to restorethe knowledge of its meaning, of its threefold application and its involutionaryand evolutionary significances. Students would do well to remember that itssounding forth vocally upon the physical plane means little. The importantfactors are to sound it silently, inaudibly and within the head; then, havingdone so, to hear it reverberate there and to recognise that this self-initiatedSound—breathed forth from a point of tension—is a part of the original SOUND asit takes form as a Word. When a man perfectly empresses the A.U.M., he can thensound the O.M. with effectiveness from progressive points of tension, until thethird initiation. Then the effect of the O.M. is such that the personality as aseparate identity disappears, the soul emerges in all its glory, and the firstfaint sound of the originating SOUND breaks upon the ear of the transfiguredinitiate. This is the Voice referred to in the Biblical account of theTransfiguration. This Voice says, “This is my beloved Son.” The initiateregisters the fact that he has been accepted by Shamballa and has made his firstcontact with the Planetary Logos, the Hierophant, the Initiator at the thirdinitiation, just as the Christ, the Master of all the Masters, is the Initiatorand the Hierophant at the first two initiations.[57] The Word, however, with which we are now dealing is not the Sacred Worditself, but a signal or sound of acceptance. It is translated in this Rule bythe phrase: Accepted as a group. This refers to aggregates and blendedcombinations through which the Soul in relation to personalities, the Monad inrelation to the Spiritual Triad, the Master in relation to His Ashram, andShamballa in relation to the Hierarchy, can work, expressing plan in the initialstages of contact, and purpose in the final stages. Bear in mind that theanalogy holds true all the way through. A personality is an aggregate of formsand of substantial lives which, when fused and blended, present a unifiedsumtotal, animated by desire or aspiration, by plan or purpose, and functioningin its place under the inspiration of a self-initiated inner programme.Progress, from the larger angle and from the standpoint of Those Who see life interms of ever enlarging Wholes, is from group to group.This pronouncement, issuing from a point of tension, is the Word of the soul asit integrates with the threefold personality when that personality isconsciously ready for such a fusion. The hold of the soul upon its instrumentsof expression, the network of the seven centres and the subsidiary centres,becomes intensified and energy pours in, forcing the acquiescent personalityfully to express the ray type of the soul, and therefore subordinating the rayof the personality (and its three subsidiary rays) to the dominating soulenergy. This first great integration is a fusion of force with energy . Here isa statement of deep import, embodying one of the first lessons an initiate hasto master. It is one which can only be properly comprehended through lifeexperience, subject to interpretation in the world of meaning. Someunderstanding of what this implies will come as the disciple masters thedistinction between soul activity and the action of matter, between emotion andlove, between the intelligent will and the mind, between plan and purpose. In sodoing he acquires the capacity to find his point of tension at any given moment,and this growing capacity eventually brings him consciously to recognise groupafter [58] group as units with which identification must be sought.He finds his soul through the fusion of soul and personality; he finds his groupthrough the absorption of this fusing soul-form with a Master’s group, andfinally he is absorbed into the Master’s Ashram; there he, in concert with hisgroup brothers in that Ashram, is fused and blended with the Hierarchy and hearsthe extension of the Word, spoken originally by his soul: Accepted as a group.Later, much later, he participates at that august recognition which comes whenthe Voice issues forth—as annually it does—from the centre at Shamballa and theseal is set on the acceptance of the Hierarchy, with all its new associates, bythe Lord of the World. This acceptance involves those initiates of the thirddegree who have been integrated more closely into the hierarchical life thanever before. This is the signal to them (and to their Seniors Who have heard ityear after year) that they are part of the instrument whose purpose is tofulfill the plan. Thus the great syntheses are slowly taking place. It has takenmany aeons, for evolution (especially in the earlier stages) moves slowly.In the post-war period and when the new structure of the coming world order istaking shape, the process will be speeded considerably; this will not, however,be for a hundred years, which is but a brief moment in the eternal history ofhumanity. From synthesis to synthesis the life of God passes. First thesynthesis of the atomic lives into ever more perfect forms until the threekingdoms of nature appear; then the synthesis in consciousness, enabling thehuman being to enter into the larger awareness of the Whole and finally to enterinto that mysterious event which is the result of the effect of all precedingdevelopments and to which we give the name of Identification. From the firstidentification, which is the higher correspondence of the stage ofindividualisation, progressive absorption into ever larger wholes takes place,and each time the Word goes forth: Accepted as a group.Have I succeeded in giving you a somewhat wider vision of the significance ofinitiation in these brief expositions? [59] Do you see more clearly the growingbeauty of the Whole and the goodness of the Purpose and the wisdom of the Plan?Do you realise more deeply that beauty, goodness and wisdom are not qualities,as their inadequate nomenclature would imply, but are great facts inmanifestation? Do you grasp the truth that they are not descriptive of Deity butare the names of Lives of a potency and activity of which men can as yet knownothing?Some understanding of this must slowly seep into the mind and consciousness ofeach disciple as that mind becomes irradiated by soul light in the earlierstages, and later responds to the impact of energy coming from the SpiritualTriad. Only when this is visioned, even if not understood, will the realisationcome to the struggling disciple that the words:2. Withdraw not now your application. You could not if you would; but add to itthree great demands and forward moveare a living command conditioning him whether he will or not. The inability towithdraw from the position taken is one of the first true results of hearing theWord spoken after passing the two tests. There is an inevitability in living thelife of the Spirit which is at once its horror and its joy. I mean just that.The symbol or first expression of this (for all in the three worlds is but thesymbol of an inner reality) is the driving urge to betterment which is theoutstanding characteristic of the human animal. From discontent to discontent hepasses, driven by an inner something which constantly reveals to him an enticingvision of that which is more desirable than his present state and experience. Atfirst this is interpreted by him in terms of material welfare; then this divinediscontent drives him into a phase of the struggle which is emotional in nature;he craves emotional satisfaction and later intellectual pursuits. All the timethis struggle to attain something ever on ahead creates the instruments ofattainment, gradually perfecting them until the threefold personality is readyfor a vision of the soul. From that point of tension the urge and the strugglebecome more [60] acute, until Rule One for Applicants is understood by him andhe steps upon the Path.Once he is an accepted disciple and has definitely undertaken the work inpreparation for initiation, there is for him no turning back. He could not if hewould, and the Ashram protects him.In this Rule for accepted disciples and initiates we are faced with a similarcondition on a higher turn of the spiral, but with this difference (one whichyou can hardly grasp unless at the point where the Word goes forth to you): thatthe initiate stands alone in “isolated unity,” aware of his mysterious onenesswith all that is. The urge which distinguished his progress in arriving atpersonality-soul fusion is transmuted into fixity of intention, ability to moveforward into the clear cold light of the undimmed reason, free from all glamourand illusion and having now the power to voice the three demands. This he cannow do consciously and by the use of the dynamic will instead of making“application in triple form” as was the case before. This distinction is vitaland significant of tremendous growth and development.The initiate has heard the Word which came forth to him when he was irrevocablycommitted to hierarchical purpose. He has heard the Voice from Shamballa just ashe earlier heard the Voice of the Silence and the voice of his Master. Occultobedience gives place to enlightened will. He can now be trusted to walk andwork alone because he is unalterably one with his group, with the Hierarchy, andfinally with Shamballa.The key to this whole Rule lies in the injunction to the initiate that he add tohis application three demands, and only after they have been voiced andcorrectly expressed and motivated by the dynamic will, does the furtherinjunction come that he move forward. What are these three demands, and by whatright does the initiate make them? Hitherto the note of his expandingconsciousness has been vision, effort, attainment and again vision. He hastherefore been occupied with becoming aware of the field—an ever-increasing [61]and expanding area—of the divine revelation. In terms of practical occultism, heis recognising an ever widening sphere wherein he can serve with purpose andforward the Plan, once he has succeeded in identifying himself with thatrevelation. Until this revelation is an integral part of his life it is notpossible for the initiate to comprehend the significance of these simple words.Identification is realisation, plus esoteric experience, plus again anabsorption into the Whole, and for all of this (as I have earlier pointed out)we have no terminology. Now a master of that which has been seen andappropriated, and being conscious of and sensing that which lies ahead, thedisciple “stands on his occult rights and makes his clear demands.”What these demands are can be ascertained by remembering that all that theinitiate undergoes and all that he enacts is the higher and esotericcorrespondence of the triple manifestation of spirit-energy which distinguishedthe first and earliest phase of his unfoldment. That is the personality. I wouldlike to call attention to the word “unfoldment,” for it is perhaps the mostexplicit and correct word to use anent the evolutionary process. There is nobetter in your language. The initiate has ever been. The divine Son of God hasever known himself for what he is. An initiate is not the result of theevolutionary process. He is the cause of the evolutionary process, and by meansof it he perfects his vehicles of expression until he becomes initiate in thethree worlds of consciousness and the three worlds of identification.According to ray type this unfoldment proceeds, and each triple stage of thelower unfoldment makes possible later (in time and space) the higher unfoldmentin the world of the Spiritual Triad. What I am doing in these instructions is toindicate the relation between the threefold personality and the Spiritual Triad,linked and brought together by the antahkarana. Each of these three loweraspects has its own note and it is these notes which produce the sounding forthof the three demands which evoke response from the Spiritual Triad and thusreach the Monad in its high place of waiting in Shamballa.[62] In 1922, in my book Letters on Occult Meditation I laid the foundation inmy first chapter for the more advanced teaching which I am now giving. There Iwas dealing with the alignment of the ego with the personality, and this was thefirst time that the entire theme of alignment was brought definitely into focus,for alignment is the first step towards fusion, and later towards the mysteriesof identification. Let me quote:> “As time progresses, and later with the aid of the Master, harmony of colour> and tone is produced (a synonymous matter) until eventually you will have the> basic note of matter, the major third of the aligned personality, the dominant> fifth of the ego, followed by the full chord of the Monad or Spirit. It is the> dominant we seek at adeptship, and earlier the perfected third of the> personality. During our various incarnations we strike and ring the changes on> all the intervening notes, and sometimes our lives are major and sometimes> minor, but always they tend to flexibility and greater beauty. In due time> each note fits into its chord, the chord of the Spirit; each chord forms part> of a phrase, the phrase or group to which the chord belongs; and the phrase> goes to the completion of one seventh of the whole. The entire seven sections,> then, complete the sonata of this solar system—a part of the threefold> masterpiece of the Logos or God, the Master-Musician.” (Page 4).We now arrive at a point which it is difficult for disciples to grasp. Theinitiate or disciple has reached a point in his evolution in which triplicitygives place to duality, prior to the attainment of complete unity. Only twofactors are of concern to him as he “stands at the midway point,” and these areSpirit and Matter. Their complete identification within his consciousnessbecomes his major goal, but only in reference to the whole creative process andnot now in reference to the separated self. It is this thought which motivatesthe service of the initiate, and it is this concept of wholeness graduallycreeping into the world consciousness [63] which is indicating that humanity ison the verge of initiation. Therefore, it is the material aspect, “the perfectedthird of the Personality,” which makes possible the activity of the initiate ashe sounds out his three demands. The “dominant fifth of the ego” makes itselfheard at the third initiation, marking the attainment of at-one-ment, and thisfades out at the fourth initiation. At that time the egoic vehicle, the causalbody, disappears. Then only two divine aspects remain; the perfected, radiant,organised and active substance through which the initiate can work in fullcontrol, the matter aspect, and the dynamic life principle, the spirit aspect,with which that “substantial divine Reality” still awaits identification. It isthis thought which underlies the initiate’s three demands which (according tothe Rule earlier given to aspirants and disciples) must sound forth “across thedesert, over all the seas and through the fires.”It is not possible for me explicitly to give an understanding of the nature ofthese demands. I can only give you certain symbolic phrases which, intuitivelyinterpreted, will give you a clue.The first demand is made possible because “the desert life is passed; itflourished and it flowered, and then the drought arrived and man removedhimself. That which had nourished and contained his life became an arid wasteand naught was left but bones and dust and a deep thirst which naught in sightcould satisfy.” Yet to the initiate consciousness it remains clear that thedesert land must be made anew to flourish like a rose and that his task is therestoration (by the distribution of the waters of life) of its pristine beauty,and not the beauty of its false flowering. He demands, therefore, upon the noteof the lower aspect of the personality (I am talking in symbols), that thisflowering forth should take place according to the Plan. This involves upon hispart a vision of that plan, identification with the underlying purpose, and theability—through the medium of the higher mind, which is the lowest aspect of theSpiritual Triad—to work in the world of ideas and to create those forms ofthought which will aid in the materialising of the [64] Plan in conformity withthe Purpose. This is the creative work of thoughtform building and that is why,we are told, that the first great demand “sounds forth within the world of God’sideas and towards the desert, a long time left behind. Upon that great demandthe initiate who has pledged himself to serve the world returns into thatdesert, bringing with him the seed and water for which the desert cries.”The second demand is related to the earlier cry of the disciple, which wassounded forth “over the seas.” It refers to the world of glamour in whichhumanity struggles, and to the emotional world in which mankind is sunk as ifdrowning in the ocean. We are told in the Bible, and the thought is based oninformation to be found in the Archives of the Masters, that “there shall be nomore sea”; I told you that a time comes when the initiate knows that the astralplane no longer exists. For ever it has vanished and has gone. But when theinitiate has freed himself from the realm of delusion, of fog, of mist and ofglamour, and stands in the “clear cold light” of the buddhic or intuitionalplane (the second or middle aspect of the Spiritual Triad), he arrives at agreat and basic realisation. He knows that he must return (if such a foolishword can suffice) to the “seas” which he has left behind, and there dissipatethe glamour. But he works now from “the air above and in the full light of day.”No longer does he struggle in the waves or sink immersed in the deep waters.Above the sea he hovers within the ocean of light, and pours that light into thedepths. He carries thus the waters to the desert and the light divine into theworld of fog.Yet he never leaves the place of identification, and all that he now does iscarried forward from the levels attained at any particular initiation. All thathe does “upon the desert, and over the seas” is undertaken through the power ofthought, which directs the needed energy and certain destined and chosen forcesso that the Plan (let me repeat myself) may go forward according to divinepurpose through the power of the dynamic spiritual will. When you can [65]appreciate that the initiate of high degree works with monadic energy and notsoul force, you can understand why he finds it necessary ever to work behind thescenes. He works with the soul aspect and through the power of monadic energy,using the antahkarana as a distributing agency. The disciples and initiates ofthe first two degrees work with soul force and through the medium of thecentres. The personality works with forces.The third great demand has in it a different implication, and sounds forth, weare told, “through the fires.” In this solar system there is no evading thefire. It is found at all levels of divine expression as we well know from ourstudy of the three fires—fire by friction, solar fire and electric fire, withtheir differentiations, the forty-nine fires—of the seven planes. Always,therefore, whether it is the cry of the disciple or the demand of the initiate,the sound goes forth “through the fire, to the fire, and from the fire.” Of thistechnique, underlying the potent demand, there is little that I may say. Fromthe highest plane of the spiritual will, what is technically called “the atmicplane,” the demand goes forth and the result of that demand will work out onmental levels, just as the earlier two demands worked out on the physical andastral levels. I would interject here that even though there is no astral plane,from the standpoint of the Master, yet thousands of millions recognise it andlabour in its delusive sphere and are there aided by the initiated discipleworking from the higher corresponding levels. This is true of all the planetarywork, whether accomplished by initiates and Masters, working directly in thethree worlds, or from higher levels, as work the Nirmanakayas (the creativeContemplatives of the planet), or from Shamballa from the Council Chamber of theLord of the World. All the efforts of the Hierarchy or of the “conditioningLives” (as They are sometimes called) of Shamballa are dedicated to thefurthering of the evolutionary plan which will finally embody divine purpose. Ikeep emphasising this distinction between plan and purpose with deliberation,[66] because it indicates the next phase of the working of the intelligent willin the consciousness of humanity.More anent these three demands I may not imply. I have told you much, had youthe awakened intuition to read the significance of some of my comments. Thesedemands refer not only to the evolution of humanity, but to all forms of lifewithin the consciousness of the planetary Logos. The directing mind of theinitiate indicates within the three worlds the goal of attainment.3. Let there be no recollection and yet let memory rule.This is not a contradictory statement. Perhaps I can convey to you the rightidea as follows: The initiate wastes no time in looking backward towards thelessons learned; he works from the angle of developed habit, instinctively doingthe right and needed thing. Instinctual response to environing forms builds, aswe well know, patterns of behaviour, of conduct and of reaction. Thisestablishes what might be called unconscious memory, and this memory ruleswithout any effort at recollection.The habit of goodness, or right reaction and of instinctual understanding isdistinctive of the trained initiate. He has no need to remember rules, theories,planes or activities. These are as much an established part of his nature as theinstinct of self-preservation is an instinctive part of the equipment of anormal human being. Think this out and endeavour to build up the right spiritualhabits. In this way the Master wastes no time on soul or personal plans. He hasthe habit—based on divine instinctual memory—of right activity, rightunderstanding and right purpose. He needs not to recollect.4. Work from the point of all that is within the content of the group’s unitedlife.This is not, as might appear, the effort to do the work for humanity as it isplanned or desired by the group with which the initiate finds himselfassociated. The mode of working covers an earlier phase and one in which theaccepted [67] disciple learns much. First, he finds a group upon the physicalplane whose ideals and plans for service conform to his idea of correctactivity, and with this group he affiliates himself, works, learns, and inlearning, suffers much. Later he finds his way into a Master’s Ashram, where hiseffort is increasingly to learn to use the will in carrying out the Plan and toaccommodate himself to the group methods and plans, working under the law ofoccult obedience for the welfare of humanity.The initiate, however, works in neither of these ways, though he has acquiredthe habit of right contact with organisations in the three worlds and rightcooperation with the Hierarchy. He works now under the inspiration of andidentification with the life aspect—the united life aspect of his ray group andof all groups. This means that the significance of the involutionary life andthe evolutionary life is fully understood by him. His service is invoked by thegroup or groups needing his help. His response is an occult evocation given inunison with the group of servers with which he is affiliated on the inner side.This is a very different thing to the mode of service generally understood.RULE THREEThe next Rule continues the above theme and gives some instructions in tersephrases and symbols on the Science of Invocation and Evocation and itssignificant ritual or programme.This programme is, in reality, an expression or a human formulation of theScience of Sound, just in so far—as yet—as Sound affects humanity and humanaffairs. Forget not my earlier teaching upon the Word; remember also that theSound is the sound or note of Life Itself, embodying its dynamic impulse, itscreative power, and its responsive sensitivity to all contacts.Rule III.> Dual the moving forward. The Door is left behind. That is a happening of the> past. Let the cry of invocation [68] issue forth from the deep centre of the> group’s clear cold light. Let it evoke response from the bright centre, lying> far ahead. When the demand and the response are lost in one great Sound, move> outward from the desert, leave the seas behind, and know that God is Fire.This is perhaps one of the two most occult rules which the initiate has tomaster, whether as an individual or in conjunction with his group. The grouprecognises and works under the pervasive influence of the purpose; theindividual initiate works with the plan. The group expression, as far as in itlies at any given moment in time and space, is in line with the will of the Onein Whom we live and move and have our being, the Life of all that is. Theindividual initiate uses the attractive force (to which we give the oftmisleading name of love) of that fundamental Life to gather together that whichwill give body to form and so manifest the will. The group can be, andfrequently is, responsive to the “bright centre,” Shamballa, where the initiateby himself and in his own essential identity cannot so respond. The individualmust be protected by the group from the terrific potencies which emanate fromShamballa. These must be stepped down for him by the process of distribution, sothat their impact is not focussed in any one or all of his centres but is sharedby all the group members. Here is the clue to the significance of group work.One of its major functions, esoterically speaking, is to absorb, share,circulate, and then distribute energy.This process of protection and of distribution is one of the functions of thegreat meeting of all the Hierarchy, under the aegis of the three Great Lords(the Manu, the Mahachohan and the Christ) in that high and sacred valley in theHimalayas where annually—after due preparation—the Hierarchy makes contact withShamballa and a relationship is then set up between the “bright and livingcentre” and the “radiating and magnetic centre,” in order that the “acquiescentwaiting centre” may be stimulated to move forward upon the ladder of evolution.Even the Hierarchy [69] itself needs the protection of its full membership inorder rightly to absorb the incoming energies, and later wisely to distributethe forces of the divine will in the three worlds where lies Their majorresponsibility. The focussed will of God, in its immediate implications andapplication, constitutes the point of tension from which Shamballa works inorder to bring about the eventual fruition of the divine Purpose.There is a definite distinction between Purpose and Will; it is subtle indeed,but quite definite to the advanced initiate, and therefore the dualistic natureof our planetary manifestation and our solar Expression appear even in this. TheMembers of the Council at Shamballa recognise this distinction and thereforedivide Themselves into two groups which are called in the ancient parlance,Registrants of the Purpose and Custodians of the Will. Will is active. Purposeis passive, waiting for the results of the activity of the will. These twogroups are reflected in hierarchical circles by the Nirmanakayas or thePlanetary Contemplatives, and the Custodians of the Plan. The function of theRegistrants of the Purpose is to keep the channel open between our Earth, theplanet Venus and the Central Spiritual Sun. The function of the Custodians ofthe Will is to relate the Council, the Hierarchy and Humanity, thus creating abasic triangle of force between the three major centres of the planetary Life.This is the higher expression (symbolic, if you like) of the six-pointed star,formed of two interlaced triangles. A replica of this fundamental triangle andof this symbol of energy, with its inflow and distribution, is to be found inthe relation of the three higher centres in the human being—head, heart andthroat—to the three lower centres—solar plexus, sacral centre and the centre atthe base of the spine. The Science of Invocation and Evocation is also seen tobe symbolically proceeding along evolutionary lines. Worship, the attitude ofthe mystic, must give place to Invocation in the man who knows he is divine.This symbolic revelation is to be seen in the lifting up of the three lowerenergies and their evocative response to the three higher, thus producing [70]an eventual unity at the point of tension. I realise that this is a hard thingto comprehend because it embodies truths which are difficult for the disciple tograsp. But they will be grasped and mastered by each one as he proceeds alongthe Path of Discipleship and submits to the needed training for initiation. Theywill also be mastered, later in this century and in the next, by the rapidlydeveloping humanity, thus demonstrating that the initiation of the momentbecomes the past achievement of the masses eventually. This enhanced liberationwill later appear as a definite result of the war. The Atlantic Charter and theFour Freedoms, formulated in the tension produced by the world agony and strain,are the reflections of this, and embody all that it is possible for averagematerially-minded man to grasp of the present will of Shamballa as it conditionsthe plans of the Hierarchy and is impulsed by the Registrants of the Purpose.This is as far as the two groups of Custodians have been able to convey thisrevelation to the best human intellects—the first group dealing with the seniormembers of the Hierarchy and the latter with those initiates and disciples whoare closely related to humanity.Here again we come up against the fact that the Science of Invocation andEvocation, with which this Rule fundamentally deals, is primarily a great andscientific activity of which modern humanity knows practically nothing, butwhich is related to thought power and to thoughtform building. Only initiates ofthe highest degree—such as the three Great Lords—have the right to invoke aloneand unaccompanied by any protective agency, such as a group, and the reason forthat is that They Themselves are members of the Council at Shamballa and areindividually Registrants of the Purpose. The annual appearance of the LordBuddha is the outer demonstration or symbol of the emergence of this Science ofInvocation and Evocation in the waking consciousness of humanity. Prayer is thedim, faint and inadequate expression of this; affirmation of divinity in orderto gain material well-being is a distortion of this truth. This needs to beremembered. The true significance of this [71] emerging science is that, in theearly or first stages, it embodies the seed concept of the new world religion.In the great invocations which I have given out, the first one Rule III.Dual the moving forward. The Door is left behind. That is a happening of thepast. Let the cry of invocation [68] issue forth from the deep centre of thegroup’s clear cold light. Let it evoke response from the bright centre, lyingfar ahead. When the demand and the response are lost in one great Sound, moveoutward from the desert, leave the seas behind, and know that God is Fire.This is perhaps one of the two most occult rules which the initiate has tomaster, whether as an individual or in conjunction with his group. The grouprecognises and works under the pervasive influence of the purpose; theindividual initiate works with the plan. The group expression, as far as in itlies at any given moment in time and space, is in line with the will of the Onein Whom we live and move and have our being, the Life of all that is. Theindividual initiate uses the attractive force (to which we give the oftmisleading name of love) of that fundamental Life to gather together that whichwill give body to form and so manifest the will. The group can be, andfrequently is, responsive to the “bright centre,” Shamballa, where the initiateby himself and in his own essential identity cannot so respond. The individualmust be protected by the group from the terrific potencies which emanate fromShamballa. These must be stepped down for him by the process of distribution, sothat their impact is not focussed in any one or all of his centres but is sharedby all the group members.

The true significance of this [71] emerging science is that, in theearly or first stages, it embodies the seed concept of the new world religion.In the great invocations which I have given out, the first one (“TheExternalisation of the Hierarchy,” Page v) (“Let the Forces of Light bringillumination to mankind...”) was an effort on my part to put into words theinvocative cry of mankind and of all men and women of goodwill throughout theworld. Its success was indicative of the strength of that goodwill. The second(“The Externalisation of the Hierarchy,” Page v) (“Let the Lords of Liberationissue forth...”) can, in reality, only be used with any measure or hope ofsuccess by aspirants, disciples and initiates, and hence was not nearly sopopular with the general public, though in reality much more powerful andpotentially effective. It was essential, however, that a fusion of the twogroups should take place before the invocative cry of humanity as a whole couldbe powerful and effective in evoking response.Prior to taking up the study, phrase by phrase, of Rule III, I would call yourattention to the relation between this Rule and the earlier one given toapplicants. The applicant sends out his cry—across the desert, over all the seasand through the fires. His entire personality, integrated and oriented, isfocussed at a point of tension; then he utters his cry (symbolic of a voicelessexpression) and this cry beats against the door which separates him from thesoul, in the first instance, and from the Hierarchy, in the second. The door isonly a symbol of separation; it divides one place from another location, onesphere of activity from another, and one state of consciousness from another. Itfosters in the aspirant a sense of duality. It is a word descriptive of themystic attitude. This attitude embraces the concepts of here and there, of souland body, of God and man, of Hierarchy and humanity. But Rule III, as voiced forinitiates, demonstrates that this mystical realisation finally goes; the senseof separation disappears, and the door is left behind.1. Dual the moving forward. The Door is left behind. That is a happening of thepast.[72] The first point which should be noted is that we have here the definitionof an initiate. He is one who, in his two-fold nature (soul and personality),moves forward. No longer is his point of tension that of the personality. He hasfused and blended two divine aspects in himself, and they now constitute oneintegrated unit. This fusion produces its own point of tension. He has movedforward through the door. A point of tension again ensues in which a Word goesforth in response to the invocative cry of the new initiate. A Word is returnedto him: Accepted as a group. Then he, with the group of which he is now arecognised part, moves forward. For the initiate (as I have earlier pointed out)the past is left behind: “Let there be no recollection”; the present embodies apoint of tension; the future indicates a moving forward from that point oftension as a result of its effective action. The door closes behind theinitiate, who is now an accepted member of his group, and as the Old Commentaryputs it, “its sound in closing informs the watching world that the initiate haspassed into a secret place and that to reach him in the real sense they too mustpass that door.” This conveys the thought of individual self-initiation, towhich all must be subjected, and indicates also the loneliness of the initiateas he moves forward. He does not yet understand all that his group as a wholegrasps; he is himself not understood by those on the other side of the door. Hehas sensed for some time the group with which he is now affiliated, and isbecoming increasingly aware of their spiritual impersonality, which seems to himto be almost a form of aloofness and which in no way feeds in him those elementswhich are of a personality nature; he therefore suffers. Those left behind as apart of his old life in no way comprehend his basic (even if undeveloped)impersonality. This attitude of theirs evokes in him, when sensed, a resentmentand a criticism which he realises is not right but which at this stage he seemsunable to avoid, whilst those he criticises endeavour to tear him down or (atthe least) to make him feel despised and uncomfortable.In the early stages he takes refuge from those left [73] behind by withdrawinghimself and by much unnecessary and almost obtrusive silence. He learns topenetrate into the consciousness of his new group by strenuously endeavouring todevelop their capacity for spiritual impersonality. He knows it is somethingwhich he must achieve and—as he achieves it—he discovers that this impersonalityis not based on indifference or upon preoccupation, as he had thought, but upona deep understanding, upon a dynamic focus on world service, upon a sense ofproportion and upon a detachment which makes true help possible. Thus the doorand the past are left behind. St. Paul attempted to express this idea when hesaid: “Forgetting the things which are behind, press forward towards the prizeof your high calling in Christ.” I would ask your attention to the word“calling.”2. Let the cry of invocation issue forth from the deep centre of the group’sclear cold light.We are not here dealing with the light in the head or with soul light as it isperceived by the attuned and aligned personality. That too is left behind, andthe initiate is aware of the light of the Ashram and the all-including light ofthe Hierarchy. These are two aspects of soul light which the individual light inthe head has revealed. That soul light which the initiate has been aware of fromthe first moment of soul contact, and at rapidly decreasing intervals, iscreated by the fusion of the light of the soul with the light of substanceitself, and is the inevitable and automatic consequence of the purification ofthe three vehicles and of creative meditation. We are told in the worldScriptures that “in that light shall we see Light”; and it is to this otherLight that I now refer—a light which is only to be perceived when the door isshut behind the initiate. That light is itself composed of the light of buddhiand the light of atma, and these are (to interpret these Sanskrit termsesoterically) the light of the pure reason, which is the sublimation of theintellect, and the light of the spiritual will, which is the revelation of theenfolding purpose. The first [74] is focussed in the Ashram, and the second inthe Hierarchy as a whole, and both of them are the expression of the activity ofthe Spiritual Triad.Let me make myself clearly understood, if possible. You have, therefore, threegreat lights, all of them focussed upon the mental plane, for beyond that planethe symbolism of light is not used; divinity is known as life, where the Monadand its expression, the Spiritual Triad, are concerned. All the lights arefinally focussed upon the mental plane:> 1. The blended light of soul and personality.> 2. The light of the egoic group which, when forming a recognised group in the> consciousness of the illumined initiate, is called an Ashram, embodying the> light of buddhi or pure reason.> 3. The light of the Hierarchy as a centre of radiance in the planetary body> and embodying the light which understanding of the plan and cooperation with> that plan produce, and which comes from identification—upon mental levels—with> the spiritual will.All these three aspects of light can be described as:> 1. The light which is thrown upward. This is the lesser light, from the angle> of the Monad.> 2. The light which the Spiritual Triad reflects upon the mental plane.> 3. The focussed light which is produced by the meeting of the two lights, the> higher and the lower.These are the higher correspondence of the blazing forth of the light in thehead, when the light of the personality and the light of the soul make contact.Beyond the mental plane, the initiatory impulse or emphasis is upon the lifeaspect, upon dynamic energy, and upon the cause of manifestation, and thisincentive to progress is not based on revelation, which is ever incident to orrelated to the significance of light. Light and revelation are cause and effect.The coming revelation for which all men wait, and which will come when worldadjustment has [75] reached an already determined point, is concerned with theimpartation to the human consciousness of the meaning and purpose of life; thiswill take place in a gradually unfolding series of spiritual events. I cannotand must not put these truths more clearly, even if the necessary words wereavailable to express what is not as yet even dimly sensed by disciples of thefirst and second degrees of initiation. What will come through that series ofspiritual happenings and their inevitable reaction upon the whole body ofhumanity is in no way related to consciousness, to revelation or to light. Therewill come to humanity at some moment still a long way ahead a period ofrealisation, constituting both a point of crisis and a point of tension. Thatrealisation will summarise, in effective conditioning consciousness, all thatthe quality of sensitivity has conveyed to mankind throughout the ages. It isthe consummation of the activity of the Christ-consciousness, and is the statereferred to when it is said of the Christ: “He shall see of the travail of hissoul and be satisfied.” At the crisis of that revelation, at its highest pointof tension, humanity as with one voice will say: “Behold! All things are becomenew.” This is the apotheosis of vision and the prelude to an unfoldment in thegeneral massed human consciousness (from that point in time slowly broughtabout) of certain powers and capacities of which the race is today totallyunaware. The immediate revelation ahead will be only the first step towards thisdistant related point, and its significance will not be apparent to the presentgeneration, or even to the next; it will, however, be steadily though graduallyappreciated as the new world religion with its emphasis upon the invocation ofenergies and the evocation of “life more abundantly” is developed and has itsinevitable effect. Students would do well to bear in mind that the impact ofenergies upon forms produces results which are dependent upon the quality of theforms receiving the impression. This is a statement of occult law.One of the purposes lying behind the present holocaust (World War II) has beenthe necessity for the [76] destruction of inadequate forms. This destructioncould have been brought about by an act of God, such as a great naturalcatastrophe or a universal epidemic, and such had been the original intention.Humanity was, however, swept by forces that carried in themselves the seeds ofdestruction, and there was that in humanity which responded to those forces.Therefore the Law of destruction was permitted to work through humanity itself,and men are now destroying the forms through which many masses of men arefunctioning. This is both a good and a bad thing, viewed from the evolutionaryangle. It is nevertheless a fact which cannot be gainsaid, and the problem,therefore, confronting the Custodians of the Will, working through theCustodians of the Plan, is to bring good out of the evil which man has wrought,and thus gear events to the larger issues.That is one of the objectives before the Hierarchy at this time (written April,1943) as it prepares for participation in the May and June Full Moons. Can theforces be so organised and the energies so distributed that the full measure ofgood may be evoked from humanity by the invocation sounded forth by Shamballa?Can this evocation of a new cycle of spiritual contact and of liberation bebrought about by the invocation of the men and women of good-will? Can thewill-to-good of the spiritual Forces and the goodwill of humanity be broughttogether and produce those conditions in which the new world order may function?These are the important questions which the Hierarchy is attempting to solve.It must be remembered that the Science of Invocation and Evocation is areciprocal effort. Humanity could not be invocative were it not that theSpiritual Hierarchy (and by that term I include both Shamballa and the planetaryHierarchy) is evoking the spirit of man. The invocative cry of humanity isevoked by the invocation or Sound of the spiritual hierarchies. Man’sresponsibility, however, is to invoke at this time the Lords of Liberation andthe Spirit of Peace. These are the Beings which have the power to raisehumanity, once the race of men has assumed the right [77] attitude. Theycorrespond to the group, in the third degree of Masonry, who raise the Master.Their response to the cry of mankind is largely, but not wholly, dependent uponthe quality of that cry.I wonder if I could make the problem of invocation clearer to you if I were tosuggest that the words, “issue forth from the deep centre of the group’s clearcold light,” have a meaning both for the individual initiate and for all groupsof disciples and all Ashrams? The use of the words, “clear cold light,” isdeeply symbolical. The clarity of that light indicates the function of the soul,as its great light enables the initiate to see light. The coldness of that lightrefers to the light of substance, which cannot be warmed into a glow by desireor by the heat of passion, but is now and at last only responsive to the lightof the soul. It is therefore cold to all that limits and hinders, and this stateof personality consciousness has to be realised at the very centre of man’sbeing; there the clear light of the soul and the cold light of the personalityare united in the deepest conscious point of the disciple’s nature, at theextreme point of withdrawal (for which all concentration exercises andmeditation processes have been a scientific preparation). Then, through theproduced tension, the invocative cry can go forth with power and effectiveness.The same is true of the disciple’s group or of any group of true and selflessaspirants. There can come a moment in the life of the group when the blendedcold light of the contributing personalities and the clear light of their soulscan so function that united invocative cry will evoke a response. That cry willever be concerned with the selfless service of the group—a service which, underthe Plan, they are seeking to render to humanity.As we continue our study of Rule III, I am myself struck with the appositenessof its words in connection with this particular historical cycle and in relationto the truths which are slowly taking form in the consciousness of humanity. Newtruths (and by that I mean truths which are new to the most advanced thinkersand which are only [78] dimly sensed by the most advanced esotericist) arehovering on the horizon of the human mind. The ground is being prepared for thesowing of this new seed and the stage set for the emergence of new Actors in thegreat drama of the unfolding revelation of Deity.Certain great concepts are firmly grasped by man. Certain great hopes are takingform and will become the pattern of man’s living. Certain great speculationswill become experimental theories and later prove demonstrated facts. Behind allthis, two things are happening: Men are being stimulated and brought to thatpoint of necessary tension which (as a result of a crisis) must precede a greatmoving forward upon the Path of Evolution. Secondly, a process of reorientationis going on which will eventually enable the mass of men to present a unitedfront upon views hitherto regarded as the vague visions of intelligent andoptimistic dreamers. A great stirring and moving is going on. The world of menis seething in response to the inflow of spiritual energy. This energy has beenevoked by the unrealised and inaudible cry of humanity itself. Humanity hasbecome—for the first time in its history—spiritually invocative.Let us now consider briefly the nature of that which is being evoked, and thusgain an insight into the interrelation which exists between the three greatplanetary centres: The human centre, the hierarchical centre, and Shamballa.Each of these is evocative to the one functioning at a slower or lesser speed(if I might use such inappropriate terms) and invocative to the one aboveit—again using a form of words which is misleading in the extreme; there is nohigher or lower and no greater or lesser in our universe of reality. There isonly the interpenetration of substances which are all basically expressions ofmatter, and their vitalisation and organisation into forms of expression of theunknown Real. This essential Reality, we call spirit or life.As a result of the interplay of these two, humanity eventually appears in timeand space. Humanity is the result of all sub-human forms of expression andexperience and of the activity of superhuman Beings. These superhuman [79]Beings are the product of past evolutionary systems and are in Themselves thesum total of the great Divine Sacrifice as it focusses itself in our planetarylife. Having passed through all previous phases of existence and perfected theconsciousness aspect in Themselves through human experiences, They havetranscended all that men can know and all states of consciousness with which heis or may be in the future familiar, and are now expressing a phase of divinityof which he can know naught. They LIVE. They are energy itself, and in Theirtotality They form the “bright centre lying far ahead.”3. Let it evoke response from the bright centre, lying far ahead.To this centre we give the name Shamballa, the component letters of which arenumerically: S.H.A.M.B.A.L.L.A. or 1.8.1.4.2.1.3.3.1. This word equals thenumber 24 which in its turn equals 6. I would call your attention to the factthat the word has in it nine letters, and—as you know—nine is the number ofinitiation. The goal of all the initiatory process is to admit mankind intorealisation of and identification with the will or purpose of Deity. The number6 is the number of form or of manifestation, which is the agent or mediumthrough which this realisation comes and by which the consciousness is unfoldedso that it can become the foundation of the higher process which is institutedat the third initiation. That initiation is closely related to the third majorcentre, Shamballa; it is the third, from the angle of man’s perception andunderstanding, but the first from the angle of Deity Itself. Again, 6 being thenumber of the sixth ray, it is therefore the number of idealism and of thatdriving force which makes mankind move forward upon the path and in response tothe vision and press upward towards the light. It is in reality devotion to anunseen goal, ever on ahead, and an unswerving recognition of the objective. Likeall other divine qualities, it has its material counterpart, and that is why 666is regarded as the number of the Beast or of materialism, the number of the [80]dominance of the three worlds prior to the process of reorientation and theexpression of developed idealism and purpose. The third aspect expresses itselfthrough pure materialism, and hence the three sixes. In an ancient book onnumbers the initiate is defined as “the one who has experienced and expressed666 and found it naught; who has dropped the 6 and become the 66, and thus hasfound himself upon the WAY; later, again, he drops the 6 and becomes theperfected 6—form, the instrument and expression of spirit.”The number 24 is of deep interest, expressing as it does the double 12—thegreater and the lesser zodiac. Just as the number 6 expresses space , so thenumber 24 expresses time , and is the key to the great cycle of manifestation.It is the clue to all cyclic appearance or incarnation. Its two figures definethe method of evolution; 2 equals the quality of love-wisdom, working under theLaw of Attraction and drawing man from one point of attainment to another;whilst 4 indicates the technique of conflict and the achieving of harmonythrough that conflict; 4 is also the number of the human hierarchy, and 2 is thenumber of the spiritual hierarchy. Technically speaking, until the thirdinitiation, the initiate is “occupied with the relationship of the 2 and the 4;these, when placed side by side, connote relation; and when placed the one abovethe other, the initiate passes from the 4 into the 2.” Needless to say, there ismuch more to say anent these figures, but the above will suffice to show thesatisfactory nature of esoteric numerology—not numerology as understood today.I would have you note that the sounds which compose the word “Shamballa” arepredominantly along the line of will or power or of first ray energy. Of thenine letters, six are on the first ray line of force. 1.1.1.3.3.1.—spirit andmatter, will and intelligence. Two of them are along the second line of force, 4and 2. The number 8 inaugurates ever a new cycle, following after the number 7,which is that of a relative perfection. It is the number of theChrist-consciousness; just as 7 is the number of man, 8 is the [81] number ofthe Hierarchy, and 9 is the number of initiation or of Shamballa. Forget notthat, from the angle of the Hierarchy, the third initiation is regarded as thefirst major initiation.These preliminary remarks are intended to convey much esoteric information tothose who realise that number gives the clue to the form and purpose of the lifewhich the form veils. At the third major initiation, the third planetaryinitiation (which is in fact the first solar initiation), the liberated disciplefor the first time—alone and unaided—invokes the highest spiritual centre on ourplanet, Shamballa. This he does because, for the first time, consciously andwith understanding, he registers the life aspect (which has brought his soulinto action through the medium of form) and vibrates to the Monad. Thatregistration enables him to contact “the bright centre, lying far ahead,” toblend his individual will with the divine will, and to cooperate with thepurpose aspect of manifestation. He has learnt to function through form; he hasbecome aware, as a soul, of the divine form in its many aspects anddifferentiations; he now starts off upon the way of the higher unfoldment, ofwhich the first step is contact with Shamballa, involving the fusion of hisself-will and his spiritual will with the Will of God.At the third initiation he stands before the One Initiator, the Lord of theWorld, and “sees His star shine forth” and hears the sound which—to quote theOld Commentary :> “...pours forth from that central point of power where substance and the outer> life have met together, where spirit utters loud the cry which drew the form> to meet the highest need; where energy comes forth and blends with force and> (in the blending) music had its start within the sphere of blending and of> being thus created.> “Man only hears the distant sound and knows it not for what it is. The> disciple hears the sound and sees its form. The one who stands for the third> time upon the mountain top hears a clear note and [82] knows it as his own, as> ours, as yours, and yet the note which none have sounded forth.”4. When the demand and the response are lost in one great Sound, move outwardfrom the desert, leave the seas behind and know that God is Fire.This means more than its obvious significance. Superficially it can mean thatwhen the initiate hears the Sound, he leaves behind the desert life of physicalincarnation, the emotional life of the astral plane, seething and unstable asthe sea, and functions on the plane of mind, of which the symbol is fire. Thatis the most elementary and obvious meaning, and as this section of A Treatise onthe Seven Rays is written for those with initiate understanding, the obviousinterpretation will not prove satisfactory. The meaning must be broader anddeeper. The words “outward from the desert” have application for the entire lifeof the incarnated Monad in the three worlds of human endeavour and enterprise.“Leaving the sea behind” has reference to the withdrawal of the initiate fromall sensuous experience because, as I have pointed out, the state ofconsciousness or awareness is superseded when the higher initiations are takenand their place is filled by a state of being for which we have no word but theunsatisfactory one of identification. This state of being is something verydifferent to consciousness as you understand it. The phrase therefore means (ifsuch a misleading form of words can be justifiably used) that the initiateleaves consciousness itself behind and the five worlds of life expression aretranscended; at the third initiation the initiate grasps what is meant when theOne in Whom we live and move and have our being (note that expression) isreferred to as Fire. I elaborated this theme in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire —abook which evades understanding by all except those with initiate consciousness.Fire is the sumtotal of that which destroys form, produces complete purity inthat which is not itself, generates the warmth which lies behind all growth, andis vitality itself.[83] This initiate realisation is all brought about by the sudden appreciationor apprehension of sound, by the awakening of the inner ear to the significanceof the Voice, just as the disciple in the earlier stage awakened to thesignificance of vision. That is why, at the third initiation, the initiate seesthe star and hears the sound. At the first two initiations, he sees the lightand hears the Word; but this is something different and is the highercorrespondence to the earlier experience. It will be obvious that I can say nomore upon this subject.It is essential, however, that some knowledge begin to reach the public anentthe highest spiritual centre to which (as the Gospel story intimates) ChristHimself was attentive. Frequently we read in the New Testament that “the Fatherspoke to Him,” that “He heard a voice,” and that the seal of affirmation (as itis occultly called) was given to Him. Only the Father, the planetary Logos, theLord of the World, enunciates the final affirmative sound. This has noreference—when it occurs—to the earlier initiations, but only to the final ones.There are five obvious crises of initiation which concern the Master Jesus asstep by step He took or re-enacted the five initiations. But lying behind thisobvious and practical teaching, lies an undercurrent or thread of higherrevelation. This is concerned with the realisations of the overshadowing Christas He registered the Voice which is heard at the third, fifth, sixth and seventhinitiations. The Gospel story gives us the five Initiations of the Master Jesus,beginning with the first and ending with the fifth. But it also gives theinitiations of the Christ, starting from the second and ending with the seventh.The latter is left incomplete, and the Voice is not recorded, because at theResurrection and Ascension we are not told of the hearing of the affirmativesound. That will be heard when the Christ completes His work at the time of theSecond Coming. Then the great seventh initiation, which is a dual one(love-wisdom in full manifestation motivated by power and will), will beconsummated, and the Buddha and the Christ will together pass before the Lord ofthe [84] World, together see the glory of the Lord, and together pass to higherservice of a nature and calibre unknown to us.In this connection it is wise to remember that three great energies are focussedin Shamballa, the seat of fire:1. The Energy of Purification: This is the power, innate in the manifesteduniverse, which gradually and steadily adapts the substance aspect to thespiritual by a process which we call purification, where humanity is concerned.It involves the elimination of all that hinders the nature of divinity from fullexpression, and this again from inherent or latent capacity. This necessitatesthe leaving behind, stage after stage, cycle after cycle, life after life, andplane after plane, of every tendency in the form nature which veils or hides theglory of God. It is essentially the energy which substitutes good for evil.Human thinking has debased this concept so that purification is related mainlyto physical phenomena and physical plane life and to a selfish idealism which islargely based on the thought of the sanitary care of substance. An enforcedcelibacy and a rigid vegetarianism are familiar instances of this, and thesephysical disciplines have been put in the place of emotional loveliness, mentalclarity, intuitional illumination, and the thoughts of the aspirant becomefocussed downwards into matter and not outwards and upwards into light.2. The Energy of Destruction: This is a destruction which removes the formswhich are imprisoning the inner spiritual life, and hiding the inner soul light.This energy is therefore one of the major aspects of the purificatory nature ofthe divine Life, and that is the reason why I have put purification ahead ofdestruction. It is the destroying aspect of life itself, just as there is adestructive agency in matter itself. Two things must be borne in mind inconnection with the destroyer aspect of Deity and with those responsible for itsappearance:> a. The destructive activity is set in motion through the will of Those Who> constitute the Council at Shamballa and Who are instrumental in bringing the> forms in all the subhuman kingdoms into line with the [85] evolving purpose.> Under cyclic law, this destructive energy comes into play and destroys the> forms of life which prevent divine expression.> b. It is also brought into activity through the determinations of humanity> itself which—under the Law of Karma—makes man the master of his own destiny,> leading him to initiate those causes which are responsible for the cyclic> events and consequences in human affairs.There is naturally a close connection between the first Ray of Will or Power,the energies concentrated at Shamballa and the Law of Karma, particularly in itsplanetary potency and in relation to advanced humanity. It will be apparent,therefore, that the more rapidly the individual aspirant approaches the thirdinitiation, the more rapidly and directly will the individual’s karma be workedout. Monadic relation, as it becomes established, lets loose the destructiveaspect of the basic energy, and all hindrances are destroyed with expedition.This is true also of humanity as a whole. Two factors have, subjectively andspiritually, precipitated this world crisis: The growth and development of thehuman family and (as you have been told) the inflow of the Shamballa force atthis particular time, both as a result of Karmic law and the planned decision ofthe Great Council.3. The Energy of Organisation: This is the energy which set in motion theactivity of the great Ray Lives and started the motivation and impulse of thatwhich produced manifestation. Thus were the seven ray qualities brought intoexpression. The relation of spirit and matter produced this ordered processwhich again, cyclically and under law, creates the manifested world as a fieldfor soul development and as an area wherein divine purpose is wrought outthrough the medium of the plan. Again I call your attention to the distinctionexisting between purpose and plan. This is the aspect, emanating from Shamballa,and inherent also in form (as are the other two), which eventually relates thehuman will, through the right use of the mind, to the organised planning of hisseparate and individual life in the [86] three worlds, and which eventuallyrelates and reorients that will to the Will of God.These three energies are faintly symbolised for us in the life of Christ whenovershadowing the Master Jesus, two thousand years ago.The purificatory aspect of the monadic force is indicated at the Baptismepisode; secondly, the destroyer aspect can be seen expressing itself at thetime of the Crucifixion, when it rent the veil of the Temple from the top to thebottom. The episode which indicates the energy of organisation and the relationof the spiritual will of the Christ to the purpose and the will of the Fatherappears when He said, in the Garden of Gethsemane, “Not my will but Thine bedone.” This final episode is closely related to the consciously expressed willof the Christ Child when He realised in the Temple that He must be about HisFather’s business and that His will was to do the will and fulfill the purposeof the Father, the Monad and the One of Whom the Monad is the expression.It is these three energies which have precipitated the world crisis, and it ishelpful for us to recognise the factual nature of the Shamballa forces as theyplay upon our planetary life and work out human destiny. The great energy ofpurification is regenerating humanity, and of this the widespread fires whichhave been such an outstanding characteristic of this war (1914-1945) are theoutward and visible sign. Much evil is being burnt out through the revelation ofthe appalling character of that evil, and through this, unity is being produced.Mankind has looked upon evil in every land and known it to be wrought by men.Men have seen, and that sight will never be forgotten, and the horror thusengendered will aid in stiffening the will of humanity to betterment. The energyof destruction has its side of beauty when the spiritual values are grasped.That which has so grossly imprisoned the human spirit is disappearing; the rockygrave of humanity is breaking open and releasing men to a life of resurrection.Forget not that in the interim between the tomb experience and the appearance inliving [87] form to His disciples, the Master Jesus went down into hell(figuratively speaking), carrying release for those to be found there. Therewill be an interim between the darkness of the war with the evil history of thepast, and the appearance of a living civilisation and culture based on thespiritual values and intelligently developing the divine purpose. The stage isnow being set for this.The Crucifixion and the tomb experience lead eventually to resurrection and tolife. The destruction is appalling, but it is only the destruction of the formside of manifestation in this particular cycle, and (a point which I would begyou not to forget) it is the destruction of much planetary evil, focussed foraeons in humanity as a whole and brought to the surface and precipitated intoviolent activity by a group of evil men whose destiny it was. This destiny wasthe result of their own deliberate choice, and of prolonged cycles of purelymaterial selfishness.I would ask all aspirants and disciples to ponder upon the destructive purposeof God—a purpose which is motivated by love, guided by a balanced judgment as toform, and which cherishes and fosters the life and its resultant spiritualvalues.There is an inherent destructive energy in matter itself and an energy of verygreat potency; it is with this energy that the Axis Powers are working. Thedestructive energy, emanating from “the bright centre,” Shamballa, is somethingvery different, and I would ask you to remember this. The destroying power ofspirit is not the same as that of matter. A human being destroys his own formagain and again through the evil which he does and by the material focus of hisdesires; the following of a life of vice will breed disease, as is well known.The disciple can also destroy his form nature through selfless service anddevotion to a cause. In both cases the form is destroyed, but the motivatingimpulse is different and the energy of destruction comes from different sources.The death of a Master Jesus or of a Father Damien, and [88] the death of aHitler or of a murderer, are not the result of the same essential energies.When the din of battle and the smoke and fire of bombing and the cruel effectson human bodies have faded into the past, it will be apparent to theunderstanding aspirant that much evil has been destroyed in all fields of humanactivity—in the field of theological religion, in the field of politics, and inthe field of selfish economic competition. It will be for humanity then toprecipitate and stabilise the appearing good, and this they will learn to dothrough the utilisation of the third Shamballa energy—the energy oforganisation. The new world will be built upon the ruins of the old. The newstructure will rise. Men of goodwill everywhere, under the guidance of the NewGroup of World Servers, will organise themselves into battalions of life, andtheir first major task must be the development of right human relations, throughthe education of the masses. This means the paralleling development of anenlightened public opinion, which is (speaking esoterically) right response tothe sound which conveys the will of God to the ears of the attentive. Thenhumanity will indeed move outward from the desert, leave the seas behind, andknow that God is Fire."},{"pageContent":"RULE FOURAt the time of the June Full Moon, each year, the love of God, the spiritualessence of solar fire, reaches its highest point of expression. This it achievesthrough the instrumentality of the Hierarchy, that great group of souls whichhas ever been the custodian of the principle of light, of enlightened love, andwhich always—down the ages—focusses its attention upon the race of men when thespiritual influence is at its height. This it does through one of the great Sonsof God. The Full Moon of June of 1943 saw this outpouring of divine love reachits highest expression for all time, and at the point of attainment which is,for that particular Son of God, His highest also. Such is the Law. When anembodied Christ in time and space reaches [89] His goal of achievement,recognition of this comes to Him at the time of the June Full Moon, for in thatsign of Gemini the complete victory of life over form, and of spirit overmatter, is consummated and celebrated.The love of God, focussed in the Christ, seeks to express itself in some act ofpeculiarly useful service to humanity. This service has taken different formsdown through the ages, but it has always expressed itself through two episodes:One of them, the first, reveals the Christ in His capacity of the God-Saviour,sacrificing Himself through pure love for His fellowmen. The annals of theHierarchy contain many such histories of sacrifice and service, dating far backinto the very night of time. The saving principle of pure love finds itsexpression at the hour of humanity’s greatest need in the work of a WorldSaviour and “for the salvation of His people, He comes forth.” He thus meets theneed, and at the same time strengthens the link which relates the Hierarchy toHumanity. The task of the Christ (as the expression in time and space of thesecond divine aspect) is to establish relationships . Every cyclicRepresentative of Deity furthers the approach of the Hierarchy to mankind, andseals this service by some final act which becomes the historical nucleuswhereby later generations remember Him.That accomplished, He stays with His people as Head of the Hierarchy until Hissecond opportunity comes, in which as Representative both of Humanity and theHierarchy, He can relate them both to Shamballa. This He does through a greatact of evocation, seeking to bring about a closer relationship between all thethree great planetary centres: Shamballa, the Hierarchy, and Humanity. He can dothis because the development of the Wisdom aspect in His nature makes itpossible. The major linking agent in the universe is the energy of Love-Wisdom.Love relates the Hierarchy to Humanity, and Wisdom relates the Hierarchy toShamballa. Only when Humanity and the Hierarchy are working together in apractical synthesis, can the Shamballa energy be permitted complete inflowthrough the medium of the two other centres.[90] To aid in this process of gradual perfecting and an eventual bringing aboutof a complete alignment, the help of the Buddha must be invoked and accepted.The work of the Christ as God-Saviour can be carried forward by Him alone andunaided. The work of the Christ as God the Preserver needs the united work, asyet, of the two highest Representatives of the second divine aspect when presenttogether upon the Earth, as is the case today of both the Buddha and the Christ.This is the first cycle in the history of humanity when this has been the case.One or the other has been present down the ages, but not the two simultaneously.The reason for this is that the time has now been reached when Shamballa can becontacted and its energy evoked. Hence we have the activity of the Buddha at theMay Full Moon and that of the Christ at the following June Full Moon. Theirunited activity serves to bring about a much closer approach between the Lord ofthe World and the Hierarchy, via His four Representatives: the Buddha, theChrist, the Manu, and the Mahachohan—the five points of energy which arecreating the five-pointed star of Humanity at this time.An ancient rule—Rule IV for Applicants gives us in perfect wording the nature ofthe urge which prompts the present activity of the Christ. He has accomplishedHis task as God the Saviour. The fourth Rule, as it is given to all applicantsand probationary disciples, gives His work the following definition:> Let the disciple tend the evocation of the fire, nourish the lesser lives and> thus keep the wheel revolving.It is given in this short form to all who are approaching the Path, in order toconvey to them with the utmost brevity and beauty the nature of the life of theHead of the Hierarchy, the Initiator Whom they must face at the time of thefirst and second initiations, and upon Whose activities they—as individualaspirants—must learn to model their lives. Only today is it possible to presentthat work in other terms than those which emphasise the part the Christ plays inthe salvaging of man.[91] It is now possible, however, to present His true and wider task, becauseman’s sense of proportion, his recognition of others, his growing sense ofresponsibility, his power to suffer for the good, the beautiful and true, hisappropriation of the vision, and his point in evolution warrant a truer picturewhich—if adequately grasped—will enable the disciple to comprehend therequirements of Rule IV as given for disciples and initiates. Only as they graspthe nature of the work of Christ, after His final act of service as God-Saviour,can they understand the nature of group service and begin to pattern their livesand natures so as to meet similar requirements in group formation.This has become possible because of the point in the evolutionary process whichthe Hierarchy has attained. The attitude and position of the members of theHierarchy are not static. All are moving forward. The Christ Who came twothousand years ago embodied in Himself not only the principle of love in theplanetary sense (a thing which Shri Krishna had achieved), but a cosmicprinciple of love also, and this for the first time in human history. Hisachievement was made possible by the fact that the human family had reached apoint at which it could produce the perfect Man, Christ, the “eldest in a greatfamily of brothers,” a Son of God, the Word made flesh. The future progress ofhumanity is also aided and hastened because of the attainment and activity ofthe Christ, and because He remains with us as God the Preserver.His task today is threefold, and the Rule states in very simple language thesethree aspects of His divine activity or phases of His work. These are:1. He “tends the evocation of the fire.” His major task as Head of the Hierarchyis to evoke the electric fire of Shamballa, the energy of the divine Will, andthis in such a form that the Hierarchy can be drawn nearer to the source ofLife, and Humanity can consequently profit by this hierarchical Approach andknow eventually the meaning of the words “life more abundantly.” Christ’sevocation of the fire of the will was initiated symbolically in the Garden of[92] Gethsemane. He has twice symbolically shown His individual response to theShamballa energy: Once in the Temple of Jerusalem as a child, and again in theGarden as a full grown man at the close of His earthly career. His third andfinal response (which climaxes His work from our human angle) covers nine years,from the Full Moon of June, 1936, to the Full Moon of June, 1945. This period,in reality, constitutes one event to Him Who lives now free in His Own world andfree from the limitations of time and space. Having related Humanity to theHierarchy (which in the case of individual man means relating the personality tothe soul), He now seeks to relate more closely, with the aid of the Buddha, theHierarchy to Shamballa, love to will, electric fire to solar fire.2. He “nourishes the lesser lives.” This refers to the task of the Christ whichproceeds day by day, in His capacity of God the Preserver. He “tends the littleones.” The work here referred to concerns His activity as Initiator and Hisresponsibility as Head of the Hierarchy. The nourishing of the little livesrefers primarily to His task as World Teacher and to His responsibility to leadhumanity on into the light, with the aid of all the Masters, working, each ofThem through His Own Ashram.3. He “keeps the wheel revolving.” This has a specific relation to His work asthe Word of God, which manifests as the Word made flesh. This refersspecifically to the great Wheel of Rebirth whereby, upon that turning wheel,souls are carried down into incarnation and then up and out of the soul’sprison; through the turning of the wheel, human beings learn their neededlessons, create cyclically their vehicles of expression (the response apparatusof the soul in the three worlds) and in this way, under soul guidance, and aidedby the Hierarchy and its schools of instruction, they arrive at perfection. Thisentire process is under the control of the Christ, assisted by the Manu and theLord of Civilisation. These three Great Lords thus represent the three divineAspects in the Hierarchy; They, with the four Lords of Karma, form the seven Whocontrol the whole [93] process of incarnation. The subject is too vast andintricate to be adequately considered here. The above truth does, however, giveus a clue as to why the Christ made no specific reference to the work ofincarnation in His spoken utterances whilst on Earth. He was then occupied withHis task of World Saviour.His work as Preserver and as Head of the Hierarchy had not then begun. It was atthat time dependent upon the experience in the Garden of Gethsemane and upon theResurrection initiation. Some day the gold and the silver threads of the Gospelstory will be disentangled, and men will know the two interpretations which canbe put upon the events and episodes in the career of Jesus the Christ. Theunderlying true events give us great steps and developments in the work of theChrist as He “enveloped humanity in the mantle of love, grasped the rod ofinitiation on behalf of His brothers, and faced the Lord of Life Himself,unattended, unafraid and in His Own right.” The episodes refer to happenings inthe life of Jesus.At the present time, and at the immediate point of tension, Christ has added toHis two immediate and constant tasks that of hastening the coming of the AvatarWho waits for the perfected work of the Hierarchy, focussed in the Christ, andthe powerful work of Shamballa, focussed in the Lord of the World. When theexact moment has arrived, the work of the Buddha, representing Shamballa, and ofthe Christ, representing the Hierarchy, plus the sincere demand of Humanity,will bring about an arrangement or an alignment which will release an evocativeSound which will be extra-planetary, and then the Avatar will come.Ask me not for the date or the hour, brother of mine, for I know it not. It isdependent upon the appeal—the voiceless appeal—of all who stand with massedintent; it is dependent also upon the hour of exact alignment and upon certainaspects of work being done at this time by the senior Members of the Hierarchy,and also upon the steadfastness of the disciples in the world and theinitiates—working in their various Ashrams. To this must be added [94] whatChristians call the “inscrutable will of God,” the unrecognised purpose of theLord of the World Who “knows His Own Mind, radiates the highest quality of Love,and focusses His Will in His Own high Place outside the Council Chamber ofShamballa.”That the Avatar will come is a predictable certainty. That His forerunner willbe the Christ is equally sure. When Christ comes it will be for the advancedunits of the human family; they will recognise Him because He has always beenwith us, whilst His advent will evoke a responsive vibration from the masses,but not straight recognition. In connection with the Avatar, it will be aprocess of hierarchical recognition of an overshadowing Presence within Whoseaura the planetary Logos will take His stand as the planetary Representative.Then from Shamballa will descend a stream of spiritual potency, qualified by thewill-to-good, and this will reach the attentive Hierarchy. The Members of thisGroup will, through the medium of the Christ, pour light and healing energy uponthe Earth and peculiarly into the consciousness of men. I am not able to expressthe effect of the outpouring from Shamballa in clearer terms. We are told in theBible that Christ will come in the air, and that He will bring the “healing ofthe nations” in His wings. I would call your attention to this thought and toits appositeness to this day and generation. I make no prophetical predictions,I only indicate possibility.When the Avatar has made His appearance, then will the> “Sons of men who are now the Sons of God withdraw Their faces from the shining> light and radiate that light upon the sons of men who know not yet they are> the Sons of God. Then shall the Coming One appear, His footsteps hastened> through the valley of the shadow by the One of awful power Who stands upon the> mountain top, breathing out love eternal, light supernal and peaceful silent> Will.> “Then will the sons of men respond. Then will a newer light shine forth into> the dismal weary vale of [95] earth. Then will new life course through the> veins of men, and then will their vision compass all the ways of what may be.> “So peace will come again on earth, but a peace unlike aught known before.> Then will the will-to-good flower forth as understanding, and understanding> blossom as goodwill in men.”So speaks a prophetic passage in the ancient Archives of the Hierarchy whichdeals with the present cycle of distress (written in June, 1943). For this timemen must prepare. You will know when the Avatar links up with the planetaryLogos because I will then give you the final Stanza of the Great Invocation(given out in April, 1945). Its use will serve to bring the Coming One torecognition and enable Him to draw upon the resources of the Avatar in the taskof world reorganisation and regeneration. He will again come as the WorldSaviour, but owing to the stupendous nature of the work ahead, He will befortified and buttressed by the “silent Avatar” Who (occultly speaking) will“keep His eye upon Him, His hand beneath, and His heart in unison with His.”The keynote of Christ’s mission will be to evoke from humanity a response tothat influence, and an unfoldment on a large scale of intuitive perception. WhenHe came before, He evoked from humanity a gradual response to truth, and mentalunderstanding. That is why at the end of the cycle, which He inaugurated, wehave formulated doctrine and mental development.The work now being done by Shamballa and the Hierarchy on behalf of humanitywill tend also to develop group consciousness and the formation of many groupswhich will be living organisms and not organisations; it will make groupinitiation possible and will enable certain aspects of the will to flower forthcorrectly and with safety. The tendency to overlook the distinction betweengroups and organisations is still very deep-seated; the coming of the Christwill throw much light upon this problem. A study of Rule IV as given todisciples and initiates will also serve [96] to clarify this matter, and withthat we shall now concern ourselves.Rule IV.> Let the group see that all the eighteen fires die down and that the lesser> lives return unto the reservoir of life. This they must bring about through> the evocation of the Will. The lesser wheels must not for aye revolve in time> and space. Only the greater Wheel must onward move and turn.This is a rule peculiarly related to the fourth Creative Hierarchy, embodyingits goal as the Aryan rootrace can sense and approximate it. It is peculiarlyrelated also to the quaternary to which we give the name “personality,” composedof a vital or etheric body, a sumtotal of emotional states and a mind, plus thatintegrated something which we call the whole man. Rightly understood andfollowed, this rule reveals the nature of the fourth plane or fourth state ofconsciousness, that of buddhi or the plane of pure reason, the intuition. Fromthe angle of the higher initiate, this rule is related to the activity of Monad,Soul and body within the planetary Life, and covers a great mystery and anentire system of relationships of which man in the three worlds is a dim anduncertain shadow. Some clue to the higher quaternary dealt with in this rulewill emerge dimly in your consciousness (more is not yet possible) if you willattempt to realise the following:> 1. The Monad relates the initiate to the Will of God, to the Council at> Shamballa, to forces active on the planet Pluto, and on another planet which> must remain nameless, and also to the Central Spiritual Sun.> 2. The Soul relates the initiate to the Love of God, to the consciousness> aspect of Deity, to the Hierarchy as a whole, entering it through the Ashram> of the Master Who has aided him to take initiation, to the planets Venus and> Mercury, to the Sun Sirius, and to the Heart of the Sun.> 3. The Personality relates the initiate to the Mind [97] of God, to the> intelligence principle of the planetary Life, to humanity as a whole, to> Saturn and Mars, and to the physical Sun through its pranic aspect.> 4. The Life aspect of the planet, or that great ocean of forces in which all> these three aspects live and move and have their being, relates the initiate> to that Life which works out through Shamballa, through the Hierarchy and> through Humanity, thus forming part of the great sumtotal of manifestation.It is to these major quaternaries that Rule IV refers, and their relationshipsonly emerge as the initiate keeps the rules. Let us now take this rule stanza bystanza, and so get some understanding of its basic significances.1. Let the group see that all the eighteen fires die down and that the lesserlives return unto the reservoir of life.A very casual consideration will show the student that this rule contains foursentences which refer to one or other of the four aspects we have beenconsidering. Bear this in mind as we study significances, interpretations andcarry our thoughts into the world of meaning.A very cursory reading of the Rule leads one to the surmise that one of the mostimportant hints concerns the effect of the group life and radiation upon theindividual in the group. “Let the group see that all the eighteen fires die downand that the lesser lives return unto the reservoir of life.” These words dealwith the group personality, composed of all the personalities of its members. Itshould be borne in mind that a group is in itself an entity, having form,substance, soul and purpose or objective, and that none of these is better orgreater, or more developed than the aggregate of group lives which compose it.Though individuals of varying points in evolution form the group, none of themis below the level of disciples upon the evolutionary ladder. A Master’s Ashramhas in it disciples and initiates of all degrees, but no probationary disciplesat all. No one below the rank of disciples—accepted and dedicated—is admitted.This is one of the first Rules given to an accepted [98] disciple when firstadmitted into the Ashram, and it is from that angle that we should now considerit.The three Rules we have earlier considered are general in nature and relate tocertain broad themes or demanded hypotheses which must govern the consciousnessof the disciple in the future. In this particular Rule we enter the realm of thespecific, and are presented with certain “intentional” activities which mustgovern the disciple’s life now that he is an integral part of the Ashram. He isfaced with the proposition of making his life of such a nature that it furthersthe group purpose, enhances the group strength, eliminates all that might hindergroup usefulness, and brings closer the objective for which the group wasformed—the carrying out of the Master’s plans. It was the disciple’s innate,instinctual and individual response to this ray objective, and his effort tosubordinate his personality to the dimly sensed soul dedication, which led theMaster in the first instance to recognise him and incorporate him into hisAshram. The moment that happened, the disciple came not only under an increasedimpact of egoic force and egoic impulsive intention (using those words in theiroccult sense), but the group radiation began its beneficent work upon him. Themagnetic “pulling” power which had hitherto led him forward is now superseded bya radiating stimulating potency; this effects great changes in him, and producesboth eliminating and substituting results. The effect of the life of the Ashram,as far as the group which forms it is concerned and apart from the Master’s Ownpotency, can be described as follows:> 1. The life of the personality is steadily weakened, and its grip upon the> soul is definitely loosened. The soul begins to dominate in a very real sense.> 2. The necessity of incarnation becomes appreciably less, and finally life in> the three worlds of human manifestation becomes needless. All the lessons have> been learnt and the soul objective has been attained.> 3. The Will of the Monad begins to be sensed; the will aspect blends with the> love aspect and makes the [99] intelligence aspect fruitful and effective for> the carrying out of divine purpose, focussed for the disciple through the> Ashram.> 4. The purposes of time and space, of events and extension, of matter and> consciousness have been achieved and are eventually superseded by something> for which we have as yet no term and of which we have no conception. It is> that which begins to express itself after the third initiation, when the> Father aspect “comes into view”—I know not how else to word it.> 5. The whole is seen to be of more vital importance than the part, and this> not as a dream, a vision, a theory, a process of wishful thinking, an> hypothesis or an urge. It is realised as an innate necessity and as> inevitable. It connotes death, but death as beauty, as joy, as spirit in> action, as the consummation of all good.It will be obvious, therefore, that the interpretation of these Rules mustinvolve capacity to pass beyond the usual attitudes and what one might call theusual metaphysical and theosophical platitudes, and to see life as the Hierarchysees it. This means that life is approached from the angle of the Observer andnot from that of a participator in actual experiment and experience in the threeworlds. This Observer is different to the Observer on the probationary Path.Most of the experiment and experience has been left behind, and a neworientation to a world of values, higher than even the world of meaning, has setin. This attitude might well be described as the mode of approach of all whoform a part of an Ashram. Those who form the Ashram are living in the threeworlds of experience if they are accepted disciples, but the focus of theirattention is not there. If they are initiated disciples, they are increasinglyunaware of the activities and reactions of their personalities, because certainaspects of the lower nature are now so controlled and purified that they havedropped below the threshold of consciousness and have entered the world ofinstinct; therefore there is no more awareness of them than a man asleep isconscious of the rhythmic functioning of his sleeping [100] physical vehicle.This is a deep and largely unrealised truth. It is related to the entire processof death and might be regarded as one of the definitions of death; it holds theclue to the mysterious words “the reservoir of life.” Death is in realityunconsciousness of that which may be functioning in some form or another, but ina form of which the spiritual entity is totally unaware. The reservoir of lifeis the place of death, and this is the first lesson the disciple learns.The eighteen fires refer to the eighteen states of matter which constitute thepersonality. They are: seven physical states of matter, seven emotional states,enabling the astral body to function on the seven subplanes of the astral plane,and four states of matter for each of the four conditions of the concretemind—(7, 7, 4, = 18). These are eighteen grades of substance, eighteen vibratorygroups of atoms, and eighteen aggregates of life which form the bodies of thelunar lords (as The Secret Doctrine calls them) which in their totality, formthe body of the Lunar Lord, the Personality. The above is the very a b c ofoccultism and a familiar truth to all of you. What is referred to here has,however, no reference to processes of purification, of control or of discipline.These have been much earlier considered and are regarded as the necessaryprocesses instituted upon the probationary path, and should have reached a pointprior to the stage of accepted discipleship where—rapid or slow inexpression—they are nevertheless automatic in action, sure and inevitable.The first sentence in this fourth rule refers to Detachment—the detachment ofthe soul from the body or the institution of those activities which bring aboutwhat is called in the Bible “the second death.” It is not detachment as theaspirant practices it. It is the scientific breaking of all links and the ending(through completed use) of all contacts which are now regarded as militatingagainst liberation. It is in reality a scientific process of ending karma; it isindividual and national karma which brings a man back into a physical vehicleand clothes him with the qualities and aspects of substance. This must endwhilst he is a member [101] of the Master’s Ashram and is preparing himself forthe triumph of the fourth initiation. This is brought about by the automatic,ceaseless and unquestioning fulfillment of duty, from the angle of recognisedservice.It might be stated that an intelligent understanding of this sentence will leadto those actions which “produce the death and dissipation and final dissolutionof the personality through the ending of karma.” It must be remembered that aMaster has no personality at all. His divine nature is all that He has. The formthrough which He works (if he is working through and living in a physicalvehicle) is a created image, the product of a focussed will and the creativeimagination; it is not the product of desire, as in the case of a human being.This is an important distinction and one which warrants careful thinking. Thelesser lives (which are governed by the Moon) have been dispersed. They nolonger respond to the ancient call of the reincarnating soul, which again andagain has gathered to itself the lives which it has touched and coloured by itsquality in the past. The soul and the causal body no longer exist by the timethe fourth initiation is undergone. What is left is the Monad and the thread,the antahkarana which it has spun out of its own life and consciousness down theages and which it can focus at will upon the physical plane, where it can createa body of pure substance and radiant light for all that the Master may require.This will be a perfect body, utterly adapted to the need, the plan and thepurpose of the Master. None of the lesser lives (as we understand the term) formpart of it, for they can only be summoned by desire. In the Master there is nodesire left, and this is the thought held before the disciple as he begins tomaster the significance of the fourth Rule.In this Rule two main ideas are to be found, both of them connected with thefirst divine aspect: the thought of Death and the nature of the Will. In thecoming century, death and the will inevitably will be seen to have new meaningsfor humanity, and many of the old ideas will vanish. Death, to the averagethinking man, is a point of [102] catastrophic crisis. It is the cessation andthe ending of all that has been loved, all that is familiar and to be desired;it is a crashing entrance into the unknown, into uncertainty, and the abruptconclusion of all plans and projects. No matter how much true faith in thespiritual values may be present, no matter how clear the rationalising of themind may be anent immortality, no matter how conclusive the evidence ofpersistence and eternity, there still remains a questioning, a recognition ofthe possibility of complete finality and negation and an end to all activity, ofall heart reactions, of all thought, emotion, desire, aspiration, and theintentions which focus around the central core of a man’s being. The longing andthe determination to persist and the sense of continuity still rest, even to themost determined believer, upon probability, upon an unstable foundation, andupon the testimony of others—who have never in reality returned to tell thetruth. The emphasis of all thought on this subject concerns the central “I” orthe integrity of Deity.You will note that in this Rule, the emphasis shifts from the “I” to theconstituent parts which form the garment of the Self, and this is a point worthnoting. The information given to the disciple is to work for the dissipation ofthis garment and for the return of the lesser lives to the general reservoir ofliving substance. The ocean of Being is nowhere referred to. Careful thoughtwill here show that this ordered process of detachment, which the group lifemakes effective in the case of the individual, is one of the strongest argumentsfor the fact of continuity and for individual identifiable persistence. Notethose words. The focus of activity shifts from the active body to the activeentity within that body, the master of his surroundings, the director of hispossessions, and the one who is the breath itself, despatching the lives to thereservoir of substance, or recalling them at will to resume their relation tohim.Putting it this way, you will note how the disciple is really enjoined torecognise (with the assistance of his group) that he is essentially the Fatheraspect himself, the first cause, the creative will and the breath of life withinthe [103] form. This is a somewhat new attitude which he is asked to take,because hitherto the emphasis upon his focus has been to regard himself as thesoul, reincarnating when desire calls and withdrawing when need arises. Thegroup life as a whole is here needed to make possible this shift in realisationaway from form and consciousness to the will and life aspect or principle. Whenthis has begun to take place, one of the first recognitions of theinitiate-disciple is that form, and his consciousness of form and its contacts(which we call knowledge), have in themselves produced a great thought-formwhich has summed up in itself his entire relation to form, to existence andexperience in the three worlds, to matter, to desire and to all that incarnationhas brought him. The whole matter looms, therefore, over-large in hisconsciousness. The detaching of himself from this ancient thoughtform—the finalform which the Dweller on the Threshold takes—is called by him Death. Only atthe fourth initiation does he realise that death is nothing but the severing ofa thread which links him to the ring-pass-not within which he has chosen tocircumscribe himself. He discovers that the “last enemy to be destroyed” isbrought to that final destruction by the first aspect in himself, the Father orMonad (which moved originally to create that form), the Life, the Breath, thedirecting energising Will. It is the will that, in the last analysis, producesorientation, focus, emphasis, the world of form , and above all else (because ofits relation to the world of cause), the world of meaning.Average man lives and has his being in the world of meaning; the initiate andthe Master have their focus in the world of Being. They are then naught butwill, illumined by love which links them with the world of meaning, and capableof intelligent activity which links them with the world of form, and is theindication of life. But the desire of the initiate is not now for activity, oreven for the expression of love. These qualities are integral parts of hisequipment and expression but have dropped below the threshold of consciousness(a higher correspondence of the automatic [104] activities of the physical bodywhich proceed upon their work without any realised consciousness on the part ofthe man). His effort is towards something which means little as yet to those ofyou who read these words; it is for the realisation of Being, immovable,immutable, living and only to be comprehended in terms which embody the conceptof “It is not this; it is not that.” It is No-Thing; it is not thought ordesire. It is life, Being, the whole, the One. It is not expressed by the words“I am” or by the words “I am not.” It is expressed by the words “I am that Iam.” Having said that, know you what I mean? It is the will-to-be which hasfound itself through the will-to-good.Therefore, the eighteen fires must die down; the lesser lives (embodying theprinciple of form, of desire and of thought, the sum total of creativity, basedupon magnetic love) must return to the reservoir of life and naught be left butthat which caused them to be, the central will which is known by the effects ofits radiation or breath. This dispersal, death or dissolution is in reality agreat effect produced by the central Cause, and the injunction is consequently:2. This they must bring about through the evocation of the Will.This type of death is ever brought about by a group, because it is from theearliest moment the one unmistakable expression of soul activity—as influencedconsciously by the Monad or Father—and this activity is a group activity whichwills the return of the lesser lives to the general reservoir from the veryfirst moment that it has become apparent that the form experience has served itspurpose and that the form has reached a point of such resilience and capacitythat perfection has been practically achieved. This is definitely consummated atthe fourth initiation. Now, at the end of the great life cycle of the soul,persisting for aeons, the time is nearing when form-taking and experience in thethree worlds must end. The disciple finds his group in the Master’s Ashram, andconsciously and with full understanding, [105] masters death—the long-fearedenemy of existence. He discovers that death is simply an effect produced by lifeand by his conscious will, and is a mode whereby he directs substance andcontrols matter. This becomes consciously possible because, having developedawareness of two divine aspects—creative activity and love—he is now focussed inthe highest aspect and knows himself to be the Will, the Life, the Father, theMonad, the One.In concluding our study of Rule IV, we are to consider two things:> The method of evoking the Will aspect.> The process of recognising the Life aspect,> the Monad, the Father in Heaven.The result of these two is given in the two closing phrases of this rule:3. The lesser wheels must not for aye revolve in time and space. Only thegreater Wheel must onward move and turn.There is one point here that I should like to make because it opens the door tonew concepts, even if it is not yet possible for these concepts to be defined sothat the mass can understand; even the disciples who read these words will failtruly to comprehend. Only those who have taken the third initiation will rightlyinterpret. Constantly in all esoteric literature reference is made to thefactors of time and space as if there were a basic distinction between theworlds in which these two hold sway and in which the aspirants and initiates ofall degrees freely move. Constantly the aspirant is reminded that time is cyclicin nature and manifestation, and that “space is an entity.” It is necessary thatthere should be some comprehension of these terms if that which the willcontrols (when evoked) is to penetrate into the knowing consciousness of thethinker.Space and substance are synonymous terms; substance is the aggregate of atomiclives out of which all forms are built. With this the Treatise on Cosmic Firelargely dealt. [106] This is both an occult and a scientific truism. Substanceis, however, a soul concept, and is only truly known to the soul. Therefore,after the fourth initiation, when the work of the soul is accomplished and thesoul body fades out of the picture, only the quality which it has imparted insubstance is left as its contribution—individual, group or planetary—to thesumtotal of manifestation. All that remains is a point of light. This point isconscious, immutable and aware of the two extremes of the divine expression: thesense of individual identity and the sense of universality. These are fused andblended in the ONE. Of this ONE the divine Hermaphrodite is the concretesymbol—the union in one of the pairs of opposites, negative and positive, maleand female. In the state of being which we call the monadic, no difference isrecognised between these two because (if I can bring such ideas down to thelevel of the intelligence of the aspirant) it is realised that there is noidentity apart from universality and no appreciation of the universal apart fromthe individual realisation, and this realisation of identification with both thepart and the whole finds its point of tension in the will-to-be, which isqualified by the will-to-good and developed (from the consciousness angle) bythe will-to-know. These are in truth three aspects of the divine will whichexists in its perfection in the solar Logos and finds a medium of expressionthrough the planetary Logos. This will is therefore working out in seven ways,via the living qualities of the seven planetary Logoi Who express Themselvesthrough the seven sacred planets; They are preoccupied with the endeavour ofbringing all the forms of life within the orbit of Their influence up to thesame measure of recorded recognition and of registered existence. It will beobvious to you, consequently, that on each of the seven sacred planets oneaspect of the divine Will will be dominant.This is the significance of Space—the field wherein states of Being are broughtto the stage of recognition. When that stage has been reached and the Knower,the Soul, is fully aware and fully conscious, then there enters [107] in a newfactor which also affects space—though in a different way—but which is relatedto the monadic Life. That factor is Time. Time is related to the will aspect andis dependent upon the dynamic life, self-directed, which produces persistenceand which demonstrates persistence in that dynamic focus of intention byperiodic or cyclic appearance.From the angle of the Will or the Father, these appearances in time and throughspace are so small a part of the experience of the living Entity Whose life islived on planes other than the physical, emotional or mental, that they areregarded as no life. To understand this, I would remind you again that we mustseek to understand the sum total in the light of the part, the Macrocosm in thelight of the Microcosm. That is no easy task and is necessarily most limited.The disciple knows or is learning to know that he is not this or that, but LifeItself. He is not the physical body or its emotional nature; he is not, in thelast analysis (a most occult phrase) the mind or that by which he knows. He islearning that that too must be transcended and superseded by intelligent love(only truly possible after the mind has been developed), and he begins torealise himself as the soul. Then, later, comes the awful “moment in time” when,pendant in space, he discovers that he is not the soul. What then is he? A pointof divine dynamic will, focussed in the soul and arriving at awareness of Beingthrough the use of form. He is Will, the ruler of time and the organiser, intime, of space. This he does, but ever with the reservation that time and spaceare the “divine playthings” and can be used or not at will.We could paraphrase the last two sentences of this fourth rule as follows: Theevocation of the will involves identity with the larger purpose. The little willof the little lives must be merged in the larger will of the whole. Individualpurpose must be identified with group purpose, which is as much of the purposeof the Whole or the One Life as the little life can grasp at any given point intime [108] and space. It is in this sense, esoterically understood, that time isan event—which philosophy now points out, groping towards an expression of theinitiate consciousness.In the long run, literally when the path of evolution is trodden to its end,what remains will be the divine purpose and the all-enveloping Life as itmaterialises the plan in time and space. This is the result of the turning ofthe greater Wheel of life, causing all the lesser wheels—in time and space—alsoto turn. In the meantime, the human being is first of all driven by desire, thenby aspiration towards some visioned goal, then by his selfish will, whichreveals to him the nature of the will: persistent application to some purpose,seen as desirable and to which every power is bent. Having exhausted alltangible goals, the inner life forces the man on towards the intangible, and thequality of his will begins to change. He discovers a larger will than his ownand begins slowly to identify himself with it, proceeding stage by stage fromone realised purpose to another higher one, each step removing him further fromhis own so-called will and bringing him nearer to an appreciation of thesignificance of the divine will or purpose.It might be stated, in an effort to clarify the method whereby this is done,that by the carrying out of the plan the disciple learns the nature of thepurpose, but that the purpose itself can only be grasped by one who isdeveloping monadic consciousness. Monadic consciousness is not consciousness ashuman beings understand it, but is that state of apprehension which is notconsciousness or realisation, as the mystic feels it, or identification, as theoccultist terms it, but something that appears when all of these three areappreciated and registered in a moment of time within the orbit of space.Now, having said this, I would ask you if you are much the wiser, or of whatprofit it is for me to write these words if you understand them not? For tworeasons I write. One of my functions and duties (as a Master of the Wisdom) isto anchor ideas in the mind of man and carry down into the realm of wordscertain emerging concepts so that they may [109] begin to influence the higherlevel of thinkers. These latter are responsible for precipitating the ideas deepinto the human consciousness. Secondly, I write for the generation which willcome into active thought expression at the end of this century; they willinaugurate the framework, structure and fabric of the New Age which will startwith certain premises which today are the dream of the more exalted dreamers andwhich will develop the civilisation of the Aquarian Age. This coming age will beas predominantly the age of group interplay, group idealism and groupconsciousness as the Piscean Age has been one of personality unfoldment andemphasis, personality focus and personality consciousness. Selfishness, as wenow understand it, will gradually disappear, for the will of the individual willvoluntarily be blended into the group will. It will be obvious to you,therefore, that this could well bring about a still more dangerous situation,because a group would be a combination of focussed energies, and unless theseenergies are directed towards the fulfillment of the Plan (which coordinates andmakes possible the divine purpose) we shall have the gradual consolidation ofthe forces of evil or of materialism on Earth. I am not speaking lightly, but amendeavouring to show the necessity for the steadfast consecration of thespiritually minded to the task of developing the will-to-good on Earth and theabsolute importance of fostering goodwill among the masses. If this is not doneafter the terrific global housecleaning that has gone on, the last state will beworse than the first. We shall have individual selfishness superseded by groupselfishness, which will be consequently still more potent in its evildedication, focus and results. The little wheels can continue to revolve in timeand space, hindering the onward progress of the great Wheel which—again in timeand space—is the wheel of humanity. The Heavenly Man and the human being uponthat Wheel are developing divine qualities and attributes.The will aspect of divinity can find expression only through humanity, for thefourth kingdom in nature is intended to be the agent of the will to the threesubhuman [110] kingdoms. It was therefore essential that the spirit ofinclusiveness and the tendency to spiritual identification should be developedin humanity as a step preparatory to the development of response to divinepurpose. It is absolutely essential that the will-to-good be unfolded by thedisciples of the world so that goodwill can be expressed by the rank and file ofmankind. The will-to-good of the world knowers is the magnetic seed of thefuture. The will-to-good is the Father aspect, whilst goodwill is the Motheraspect, and from the relation of these two the new civilisation, based on soundspiritual (but utterly different) lines, can be founded. I would commend thisthought to your consciousness, for it means that two aspects of spiritual workmust be nurtured in the immediate future, for on them the more distant hope ofhappiness and of world peace depends. The New Group of World Servers must bereached and the will-to-good developed in them, and the masses simultaneouslymust be reached with the message of goodwill. The will-to-good is dynamic,powerful and effective; it is based on realisation of the plan and on reactionto the purpose as sensed by those who are either initiate, and consciously intouch with Shamballa, or disciples who are likewise a part of the Hierarchy butare not yet able to contact the central Purpose or Life. Not yet having takenthe third initiation, the monadic vibration is to them largely unknown. It wouldbe just as dangerous for them to be able to reach Shamballa (prior to the thirdinitiation when all personality tendencies are obliterated) as it would be toteach the masses of men today techniques of will which would render their stillselfish will effective. The main difficulty would be that the disciples woulddestroy themselves, whilst the ordinary man would damage himself.This exegesis of Rule IV is necessarily brief because it is of such deepsignificance that it requires careful study, sentence by sentence, and even soit is very largely beyond the grasp of the majority of readers. It will,however, be useful for disciples to reflect upon the various meanings (there areseveral) and upon the esoteric implications.RULE FIVE[111] Rule V, which we are now purposing to consider, is one of great interestand practicality. I would remind you that one of the new things which the comingera of spiritual expansion will see is the inauguration of something entirelynew: Group Initiation . Hitherto, one by one, units of the human family havefound their way through the Door of Initiation. If this system is to persist,and considering the vast numbers of souls in and out of incarnation who musteventually achieve the goal—two-thirds of the total in this world cycle—even thegreater cycles which include many world cycles would prove too short a time. Thespace-time schedule of the planetary Logos Himself would be upset, for He hassuch a schedule for the cycle of His present incarnation. There is a term setfor the appearance of His body of manifestation, our planet, just as there isfor the human body. He therefore has to work out His plans within a certain timelimit, and this factor conditions the experience of all the lives that movewithin the radius of His expression, including the human kingdom.It must be remembered also that as humanity develops and more and more peoplebegin to function as souls, the nature of the soul (which is relationship )begins to have an effect; men become larger in their outlook and their vision.The outlook of the separated self vanishes, and group relationship and groupinterest supersede that intense personal and interior relationship and interestwhich have made evolving man what he is: first of all an integrated personality,and then a disciple—a candidate for initiation. As more and more disciples comeinto group realisation it will become increasingly possible for the Hierarchy toadmit such disciples in group formation. That is one reason necessitating there-establishing of the Ancient Mysteries on Earth. That group relation has to bedemonstrated in the three worlds and expressed by disciples in their group lifeupon the physical plane. Hence the new experiment being undertaken by theHierarchy of externalising Their Ashrams. This process [112] involves immensedifficulty, owing to the astralism, the ambitions and the growing personalityinfluence of so many people. Many groups, under self-seeking leaders, will reactto this experiment and will proclaim themselves as Masters with Ashrams and asoccupied with training people for initiation. Signs of this can already be seen.The Hierarchy has been confronted with definite difficulty in this matter, foron the one hand the Masters were faced with the glamour-making tendency andastralism of the majority of people and, secondly, with the rapid advance of thehuman consciousness into the realm of group relationship, group life, groupreactions and group activity. This has brought about the intention of theHierarchy to train such ready minds and hearts for a united moving forwardthrough the Door of Light onto the Lighted Way. That externalisation has not yettaken place. Tentative experiments are being made with some success and somediscouragement.Two things have therefore been decided upon by the Masters as They face thefuture of humanity and prepare to take the required steps to meet man’sadvancing aspiration . I have chosen these two words with care. These tworequirements have been demanded of the Hierarchy by Shamballa in order tosafeguard the Mysteries and prevent a too premature precipitation of thehierarchical life upon the Earth. Both these requirements are expressed in thisfifth Rule.Rule V.> In unison let the group perceive the Triad shining forth, dimming the light of> the soul and blotting out the light of form. The macrocosmic Whole is all> there is. Let the group perceive that Whole and then no longer use the> thought, “My soul and thine.”The first demand made by Shamballa is that the groups being prepared forinitiation should consist only of those who are in process of building theantahkarana, the bridge between the Triad and the personality; the second demandis that those being prepared should show some signs of the sense of synthesis.[113] You will note, therefore, some of the factors that have controlled thepresentation of the truth which I have sought to give, down the years. Theteaching on the Antahkarana (briefly hinted at by H.P.B.) has been expanded byme in the book, Education in the New Age and in this fifth volume of A Treatiseon the Seven Rays (Part II), and has already been given to a number of senioraspirants in the hope that they would profit thereby; the need for synthesis hasalso been emphasised by me, and is closely related to the will-aspect, the firstdivine aspect. In the past, during the cycle of mysticism through which allaspirants very properly pass, they were taught to “see the vision”—a vision ofthe goal, of the beauty to be sought, of the loved one to be known, ofliberation to be achieved, of spiritual satisfaction and an opened door togreater wonders. In the occult age which has now definitely dawned, the neophytewill be taught to see the picture whole, to think in the larger terms, to emergeout of the normal separative consciousness into the broad state of awarenessthat “sees no difference.” The goal, or rather the result of the mystic andoccult way, is the merging of the vertical way of life with the horizontal wayof service, and it is this merging which Shamballa demands should condition theattempt now in process of training those who will together seek initiation ,will together pass through the Portal on to the Way, and who can together bepresented to the One Initiator as a “unit of Light.” This sense of synthesis(which must be increasingly demonstrated as each initiation is taken in groupformation) is possible only to those who have bridged the gap between theconcrete lower mind and the higher mind or—to word it technically and in thelanguage of academic occult science—between the mental unit and the manasicpermanent atom.The goal of the Probationary Path is made beautifully clear in the fifth Rule asgiven earlier in Initiation, Human and Solar . It says:Let the applicant see to it that the solar Angel dims the light of the lunarangels, remaining the sole luminary in the microcosmic sky.[114] The soul must be seen by the probationer as the sun of the life. Alllesser lights must be put out by the light of the central luminary; all littlefires must be obliterated by solar fire. The solar Angel controls thepersonality life and its forces. This, in the New Age, is the goal of theprobationary path and of the applicant for discipleship. Hitherto it has beenthe goal of all the teaching given anent the Path of Discipleship, but thehigher rate of intelligence of the modern applicant warrants a change, and astime goes on the present requirements for disciples, up to and including thesecond initiation, will be the requirements for the Probationary Path.This will necessitate a clearer understanding of the Path of Discipleship. Onthat path, the major teaching given in the future will concern:> 1. The building of the rainbow bridge, the antahkarana.> 2. The nature of the intuition and its development, as it supersedes the mind> in its two aspects: concrete and abstract, lower and higher.> 3. The nature of life as the Monad expresses it.In these three approaches to truth the new revelation lies hid; it will take theplace of the teaching upon the soul for the neophytes and disciples of theworld, and the emphasis will be laid—for them—on the life aspect and not so muchon the love aspect. The reason for this is that more and more people will beliving as souls and therefore expressing love, and for them the nature of lifeand of monadic experience will constitute the normal next revelation—one thatis, however, possible only to those who do attempt to live as souls, whocultivate love or the sense of non-separateness, and who are at least dwellingupon the periphery of the hierarchical world. It would therefore be inevitablethat—to those so dwelling or treading the Path of Discipleship—the factors whichinspire all hierarchical effort would begin to be dimly apparent and that,slowly, these factors would also assume for them the outlines of a dim anddistant goal.[115] The two parts of this rule are consequently expressive of the new demandsfor disciples—not applicants. This becomes apparent when you study the tworules: one for applicants and one for disciples. The applicant is referred tothe microcosm. The Macrocosm is held before the vision of the disciple.The two demands are expressed in Rule V as follows:1. In unison let the group receive the Triad shining forth, dimming the light ofthe soul and blotting out the light of form.This is the demand for the building of the antahkarana which relates thedisciple in his personality to the Triad.2. The Macrocosmic Whole is all there is. Let the group perceive that Whole andthen no longer use the thought, “My soul and thine.”This is the demand for a sense of synthesis which is occult vision and notmystic vision. These two demands will be the two basic requirements for the newschools of occultism.In view of all the instructions given earlier in this volume, and in view alsoof the clarity of the statement made above, there is little that it will benecessary for me to say anent this first demand. The word “demand” which hasbeen used perhaps requires explanation. In considering this subject it should beremembered that admittance to Shamballa and a divine expression in life andservice of the first great divine aspect, the will aspect, is the goal heldbefore the members of the Hierarchy. They too are on the way of evolution, andTheir goal is to pass through the “eye of the needle,” on Their way to thehigher evolution. This higher evolution is that which opens up before a Masterof the Wisdom. The use of this esoteric term by Christ in The New Testamentstory gives us a hint as to the nature of the exalted consciousness which Heexpressed. Faced by the rich young man who possessed so much, Christ indicatedthat he needed to prepare himself for a great negation and for a step forward.The true significance of this has never [116] been grasped and lies in the factthat the phrase “rich young man” is in reality a technical term which isfrequently applied to an initiate of the third degree, just as the words “littleones” or “little child” apply to an initiate of the first or second degree. Thisrich young man was rich in his range of awareness, rich in his personalityequipment, rich in his aspiration and in his recognition; he was rich as theresult of age-long experience and evolutionary development. He is told by theChrist that he must now prepare himself for what is called in Rule V “the Triadshining forth”; he must now prepare for the unfoldment of the monadicconsciousness and for the fourth initiation. In that initiation, the causalbody, the body wherein the soul experiences and reaps the fruit of experience,must be and will be destroyed. This has to take place before the initiate canenter into the Council Chamber of the Most High and express the will-to-good andthe will of God in fulfillment of the purposes of God. The will of thisparticular “rich young man,” initiate though he was, was not yet adequate to therequirements, so he went sadly away; he had to prepare himself for the fourthinitiation, the Great Renunciation, the Crucifixion, and thus fit himself topass through the needle’s eye.There is a symbolic utterance in the Old Commentary which throws light upon thegreat opportunities which are found in the critical moments in the life of thesoul as it experiences incarnation and becomes enriched thereby:> “Within the womb of time and circumscribed by space and limited by> darkness—though sustained always by warmth—the life evolves. It develops> faculty. It becomes in miniature that which it is. It takes on form and knows> the divinity of separation. Such is its goal. Reflect. Knowledge will come.> “Beyond the door is greater light and life. It knows itself for what it is. It> suffices not unto itself and knows that it is That—part of the Whole, divinely> one with others. Reflect. Union will come.> “Before the rampart of the place of God Himself, a [117] Son Of God comes> forth. He stands before the needle’s eye and seeks to pass the hindering wall.> He is not circumscribed by time or space, but light and life are his. He> realises beauty and he knows that That exists. Instead of time and space and> all the rich inducements of the form, he knows himself as rich in love, in> knowledge, wisdom, insight, and all the panoply of God (as he can grasp it),> except one thing. Reflect. Purpose will reveal itself; the Whole will stand> revealed and then the soul—loaded with riches and the fruits of labour> long—will vanish as the mist and only God, the living One, be left.”There is still another set of phrases dealing with that through which theperfected Sons of God in Their high place must pass when Their work is done onEarth and a greater glory reveals itself ahead. But this I give not. I give onlythree symbols, which are:The womb . . . individualisation . . . separation.> Leading to personality integration and self-realisation.> Climaxing on the Path of Initiation . . . the birth of the Christ.> > Producing intelligent activity.> > Initiation.The two-leaved door . . . initiation . . . group consciousness.> Leading to soul expression.> Climaxing in the third initiation.> > Producing loving living.> > The third initiation.The eye of the needle . . higher evolution . . monadic consciousness.> Leading to life expression.> Climaxing in the fifth initiation.> > Producing purposeful life.> > Consummation.Such are the three points of entrance to the three planetary centres: Humanity,Hierarchy and Shamballa.This first demand is, curiously enough, the first expression ofrecognition—directly accorded—that the Great [118] Lives at Shamballa are now indirect relation with humanity. Hitherto that contact has not been direct, andThey have not been in touch with current developments. Hitherto, all contactsand spiritual impulses from this highest centre have reached humanity via theHierarchy, and vice versa. This demand concerns the negation, the obliteration,the absorption, the putting out or the synthesis of the lesser lights by thegreater. All the words which I have employed are efforts to express the truthand all are entirely inadequate.The moment the initiate or the disciple sees, even dimly, the light of theSpiritual Triad which veils and hides the Central Spiritual Sun, he realisesthat all other lights—that of the atom of matter, that of the form and that ofthe soul itself—must inevitably fade out in the stupendous glory and brilliancewhich emanate from God Himself and which he senses as in process of revelation.He becomes absorbed—intellectually, intuitively, spiritually and finallyfactually—in that Light. Here I would remind you that just as the light of thesoul revealed to the struggling aspirant a new vision, set for him new goals,enhanced all qualities present in his equipment, and revealed the past, thepresent and the future of the individual, so this still greater light reveals tothe initiate a horizon so vast that it has hitherto escaped his capacity and isyet but possible to vision by an initiate of the third degree, endows him withan occult perception hitherto not realised as existing—a perception whichpermits him to penetrate increasingly and to cooperate understandingly in thepurpose of the Lord of the World. It enables him later to develop theequipment—qualities and gifts of a divine nature—which will eventually enablehim to take his place in the Council Chamber at Shamballa and work in fullunanimity with the Lords of Karma.These qualities and gifts concern divine attributes and capacities for which wehave as yet no words as they lie beyond the scope of human consciousness, beingutterly unknown even to advanced human beings. They only begin to manifest astendencies between the second and the third [119] initiations, in the same wayas the instincts in a small child are, in reality, the germs of laterintellectual attitudes and activities. It is needless, therefore, for me toenlarge upon them; unless you are an initiate of the third degree, my wordswould be meaningless to you and would convey naught. The clue lies for you inunderstanding the three words—Happiness, Joy, Bliss. Do you, as you speak ofbliss, understand wherein it differs from happiness and joy? Bliss is associatedwith complete Being; it concerns the interior attitude of the Whole.As the individual disciple builds the rainbow bridge, the antahkarana, and as agroup of disciples build the group antahkarana, they make possible the “Triadalperception” referred to above. When the disciple has flung one strand of livinglight (through the power of magnetic love) across the space separating the Triadand the personality, he discovers that he is a part of a group. This grouprecognition—faulty and unintelligently expressed at first—is the factor whichenables him to pass, along the anchored thread, into the Ashram of a Master.From the angle of the old teaching, the Ashram of the Master and the focus ofthe Hierarchy were on the higher levels of the mental plane. Today, that is notso. They are on the plane of spiritual love, of the intuition and of buddhi. TheHierarchy is both retreating towards the higher centre of Shamballa, and at thesame time advancing towards the lower centre, Humanity. Both these activitieshave been made possible by man himself; the growing intuitive perception ofhumanity, in its higher brackets, enables him to function upon the Path ofDiscipleship and on higher levels than ever before. This the Hierarchyrecognises. The growing aspiration of the masses is also drawing the Masterscloser to humanity than ever before. This is an instance of the ability of theinitiate consciousness to function on initiate levels and also in the threeworlds simultaneously. Of this the dual activity of the mind is a symbol, actingas it does as the common sense and so dealing with all matters in the threeworlds, and as the spiritual [120] mind at the same time, dealing with allmatters connected with the soul, with light and illumination.The second demand, that the sense of synthesis should be the goal of thetraining given to applicants in the New Age, is a direct evidence of the newShamballa contact, because synthesis is an attribute of the divine will and theoutstanding quality of Deity. It was inevitable that intelligence and loveshould be evolutionary objectives on the planet and the first two divine aspectsto be developed, for they are qualities of the will; they make the manifestationof the divine will possible; they guarantee its intelligent application and itsmagnetic power to draw to itself all that is needed for the expression or themanifestation of the divine envisaged purpose, visualised synthetically, andmotivated, implemented, engineered and made possible by the dynamic aspect ofthe same will.It is interesting to note that there is every evidence in the world today thatthe Shamballa energy is directly impinging upon the human consciousness anddirectly producing results. The destroyer aspect of the first Ray of Will orPower is producing worldwide destruction through the use of the first kingdom innature, the mineral kingdom. That which is made of metals and chemicals isbringing catastrophe and destruction on earth, primarily in the human kingdom.At the same time the second attribute of the will, synthesis, is evoking anequally widespread response. This sense of synthesis has a mass effect earlierthan it has an individual effect, and this is a thing of interest and importanceto note at this time. Later, the dynamism inherent in the will, wielded by theNew Group of World Servers and by the disciples and initiates of the world, willturn that instinctive mass response into factual experience and produce the“appearance” on earth of the new, developed “quality” which “life” seeks in theNew Age to demonstrate. In the first volume of this Treatise, I called attentionto the three divine aspects: Life, Quality and Appearance. They are now inprocess of making their appearance in final form for this particular cycle.[121] Synthesis dictates the trend of all the evolutionary processes today; allis working towards larger unified blocs, towards amalgamations, internationalrelationships, global planning, brotherhood, economic fusion, the free flow ofcommodities everywhere, interdependence, fellowship of faiths, movements basedupon the welfare of humanity as a whole, and ideological concepts which dealwith wholes and which militate against division, separation and isolation.Little as people realise it, these concepts are relatively new factors in thehuman consciousness, and the fact that they are the result of a new and directrelation between Those Who implement the will of God and humanity everywhere isthe guarantee of the inevitability of their expression in the future. It is onlyin the immediate interim—a period of one hundred fifty years—that delay may seemthe rule. Such, however, will not really be the case. The forms through whichthese new and impending ideas must take shape and manifest have yet to becreated, and that takes time, for they are built by the power of thought and dueprocess of educating the public consciousness until that consciousness becomesconfirmed conviction and demonstrates as an immovable public opinion.This sense of synthesis is one of the things which the new esoteric schools willdevelop in their students and neophytes, for it will be the people trainedinteriorly in these schools who will be the builders of the new world and thetrainers of future public opinion. The labels and the names whereby theseschools may call themselves mean but little. Many will proclaim themselves asesoteric schools and will communicate nothing of a truly esoteric nature. Theywill but attract to themselves the gullible and the foolish. There are many suchfunctioning in this manner today. Others may refrain from all outer indicationof esoteric and occult training, and yet convey the needed teaching. They willseek to relate the One, the Monad, to the personality, and to evoke in theirstudents a true sense of synthesis.It is the sense of synthesis, putting it very simply, which will be the goal ofall the educational movements, once the [122] New Age idealism is firmlyestablished. Physical coordination, personal integrity (which involves primarilythe control and later the negation of the astral body), and personalityintegration will be the essential first steps. To this will succeed processeswhereby the fusion of the personality with the soul, of the lower self with thehigher Self, and of form with the divine Dweller in the form will follow next.Then the truly esoteric phase of the educational process will be attempted whenthe earlier steps or stages have been satisfactorily grasped and there isindication of some measure of real success. By that time the school of theMysteries and the Halls of preparation for initiation will be generallyrecognised by the thinking people and believed in by the expectant masses.In those schools, those who are beginning to function as souls will be led on totake their next step. Their developed soul nature will be expressing itselfthrough intelligent love and a sense of group fellowship; these two divinequalities will form a basis or foundation from which the next unfoldment canemerge and on which a more spiritual superstructure can be built. The Science ofMeditation and the conscious building of the antahkarana will be the first twopreliminary stages in the esoteric curriculum. Today, the true teaching ofmeditation and the construction of the bridge of light between the Triad and thepersonality are the most advanced teaching given anywhere.Humanity is, however, ready for exceedingly rapid development and this readinesswill demonstrate increasingly in the postwar period, and for it the disciples ofthe world must make ready. Two factors will bring this about: the first is thetremendous stimulation which the war, its demands and its consequences havegiven to the human consciousness and, secondly, the coming in of very advancedsouls ever since the year 1925. These souls will be ready to give the neededtraining and instruction when the right time comes, having brought it over withthem when they came into incarnation, and knowing normally and naturally [123]what the modern esoteric student is struggling to grasp and understand.A study of what I have here outlined as basic requirements will show that theesoteric schools about which I wrote in Letters on Occult Meditation lie farahead in the distant future. The work of the preparatory schools must comefirst, and their work will proceed until such time that the work of the Ashramsof the Masters is recognised as forming part of an outer hierarchical activity.This in due time will lead to the giving of the first initiation publicly, as apart of the great service ritual of the then prevalent universal religion. Therace of men will then—in its most advanced brackets and groups in every countryin the world—be normally clairvoyant, and will therefore see for themselves thelight within the candidates; they will know then that the first initiation isjustifiably undergone, and they will also see the same light in thousands who inprevious incarnations have taken that initiation.One thing only will I add to the above and to the elucidation of thesignificance of Rule V. The clue to all this esoteric work demanded by Shamballais to be found in the development of the Art of Visualisation. Throughvisualisation, three expressions of the human consciousness will becomepossible:1. The antahkarana can be built and the shining of the Triad be definitely seen. Such will be the new vision—an outcome of the development of the sense ofvision .2. Groups, large wholes and major syntheses will also be visualised, and thiswill lead to a definite expansion of consciousness. Thus the sense of synthesiswill be unfolded.3. All creative art will be fostered by this training, and the new art of thefuture in all departments of creativity will be rapidly developed as thetraining proceeds. The unfoldment of the sense of vision and of the sense ofsynthesis, through visualisation, will lead to a sense of livingness in form .RULE SIX[124] A superficial reading of Rule VI would give the impression that it is asimple statement as to the universality of Life, and also that it embodies anenunciation of the basic fact of hylozoism. The Rule runs as follows:Rule VI.> Let the group know that life is one and naught can ever take or touch that> life. Let the group know the vivid, flaming, drenching life that floods the> fourth when the fifth is known. The fifth feeds on the fourth. Let then the> group—merged in the fifth—be nourished by the sixth and seventh, and realise> that all the lesser rules are rules in time and space and cannot hold the> group. It onward moves in life.I find it extremely difficult to express the significance of this Rule in such away that it will convey meaning to you, and this for two reasons: First, theidea of the One Life is so prevalent, and so customary and trite an unrealisedtruth, that it registers on ears with very little effect. Secondly, the wholestory of life—which is purpose, divine will, and absolute determination—and theeternal planning of the Lord of the World is so hard of comprehension that wehave as yet no words in the language of any nation which can express it.What I am now writing is a series of instructions for disciples in process oftraining for initiation. I did not say in training for the higher initiations,for these are given in a different manner and the teaching is imparted in theinner Ashram. Therefore, as you have not taken the third initiation, monadiccomprehension lies far beyond you; and only this highest state of understandingsuffices for the clear perception of the fundamental divine intent lying behindall world phenomena, all evolutionary development, all unfoldment within thecapacity of the four kingdoms in nature, and all preparatory extensions andexpansions of consciousness.All I can therefore do is to touch upon the inner significance [125] of theobvious and seek to express certain ideas which will strain your mentalperception, evoke your intuition and institute that process of recognition andregistration which leads eventually to the initiate-consciousness.This sixth Rule is the polar opposite of the rule as it was given to applicants.There, if you will refer to my exegesis upon that rule in Initiation, Human andSolar , you will find that the objective of that rule was physical purificationwith the emphasis upon the need for a vegetarian diet at a certain stage of thepreparatory process. The reasons for such a discipline were two in number:purification and the necessity for the applicant (at that stage) to refrain fromsharing in the benefits incident to the so-called “taking of life.” But, can onetake life? I think not. Life IS. Naught in heaven or on earth can touch oraffect it. This is a point oft forgotten. The rule as given to applicantsconsequently concerns their ability to accept and adhere to a self-imposeddiscipline. Through the means of that discipline, the control of the physicaland astral natures are demonstrated by the applicant to himself , and the effectof the discipline is to reveal to him certain inevitable and basic weaknesses,such as control of the animal nature, the powerful imposition of desire, a senseof superiority, of pride and separativeness. His ability to sustain thediscipline and his appreciation of himself for so doing, plus a sense ofsuperiority to those who are not so disciplined, are all indicative of essentialweaknesses. His fanaticism, latent or expressed, emerges in his consciousnesswith clarity, and—when he is sincere—he is conscious of having brought about ameasure of physical purity; but at the same time, he is left with the awarenessthat he perhaps may be starting with the outer and the obvious when he should bebeginning with the inner and with that which is not so easily contacted orexpressed. This is a great and most important lesson.It is also an interesting illustration of the technique of the Masters, wherebyThey permit a fallacy to remain uncorrected (because it is originated by thedisciple himself [126] and must be dissipated by him also) and the use oflanguage which conveys a wrong impression. By so doing, the user of the languagediscovers eventually his erroneous approach to truth. Life cannot be taken inthe spiritual sense. This error or mistake in the approach of truth enables menand women upon the Probationary Path to demonstrate the earnestness andsincerity of their aspiration by the discipline of substituting the produce “ofthe second,” and to refrain from sustaining life on the produce “of the third.”By sacrificing the life of the second kingdom in nature (to use the applicant’sown misstatements) and by nourishing the physical body thereby, the probationarydisciple does succeed in ending the grip or potency of the physical nature, andthat is always helpful. He as yet does not know that he is adhering to lesser“rules in time and space,” and that once he has demonstrated to himself that hecan hold them and obey them, he is then freed from them and needs them no more.The disciple and the candidate for initiation knows that life is one, whether ittakes form in the second kingdom or in the third or the fourth; he knows thatthe life in him is one with the life in the first kingdom, the mineral; helearns too that life is impregnable; that it cannot be taken or destroyed but“passes on” from form to form, from experience to experience, until the perfectwill of God is expressed through life.The true disciple does not need vegetarianism or any of the physicaldisciplines, for the reason that none of the fleshly appetites have any controlover him. His problem lies elsewhere, and it is a waste of his time and energyto keep his eye focussed on “doing the right things physically,” because he doesthem automatically and his spiritual habits offset all the lower physicaltendencies; automatically these developed habits enable him to surmount theappeal of those desires which work out in the fulfillment of lower desire. Noone is accepted into the circle of the Ashram (which is the technical name givento the status of those who are on the eve of initiation or who are beingprepared for initiation) whose physical appetites are in any danger [127] ofcontrolling him. This is a statement of fact. This applies particularly andspecifically to those preparing for the first initiation. Those preparing forthe second initiation have to demonstrate their freedom from the slavery ofideas, from a fanatical reaction to any truth or spiritual leader, and from thecontrol of their aspiration which—through the intensity of its application—wouldsacrifice time, people and life itself to the call of the Initiator—or rather,to be correct, to what they believe to be His call.I would point out that the third initiation is approached from a level tablelandof experience and of consciousness, and not from the heights of aspiration, orfrom fanatical sacrifice, or from the standpoint of a devotion which handicapsthe service of the devotee and of the Master he seeks to serve. He knows, as acandidate for initiation, that:1. Life is one and naught can ever take or touch that life.His sense of proportion as to form becomes adjusted. He is forward-lookingtowards the soul, and not backward-looking towards the form nature. Some verysincere devotees and promising applicants are so preoccupied with form and itsdisciplining that they have no real time to give to soul expansion. They are sointerested in their reactions to their self-imposed discipline or to theircapacity to conform or their failure to accept the discipline, that thespiritual truths—seeking entrance into their hearts—fail to make such anentrance. Temperance in all things, the wise use of all sustaining forms andself-forgetfulness are the hallmark of the disciple, but not of the beginner.Many disciples today who should be functioning in the Hall of Wisdom are stillfanatically working in the Hall of Knowledge and are still so earnest over thephysical disciplines that the disciplines of the soul are ignored. I would askyou to reflect on this. Applicants have to learn the significance of the wordsof Rule VI for disciples, “the lesser rules are rules in time and space andcannot hold the group.”I wonder if you can grasp the type of consciousness which distinguishes theHierarchy, even if you are only able [128] to do so imaginatively andtheoretically. They “onward move in life.” They work in the realm of lifeenergy; the form seems to Them something which They have definitely left behind,and the consciousness of appeal or rejection of the form nature and hold is toThem only a memory of a distant battle ground where the victory then won hasbeen forgotten and the gains of victory are so far behind that they lie wellbelow the threshold of consciousness. Broadly and generally speaking, workers inthe ranks of the Hierarchy (I did not say “with the Hierarchy”) are divided intotwo main groups: those who are working with the unfoldment of the initiateconsciousness in the disciples of the world, and those of a more advanced degreewho are working with the life aspect and its expression in the lives of theworld initiates. Working disciples (who are working in cooperation with theHierarchy) are also working in two major divisions: Those who are dealing withapplicants and are seeking to see the imposition of the physical disciplines,and with the impartation of certain minor values so that beginners may grasp thepoint that they have reached. There are those also who are working to substituteunderstanding and service for physical discipline and the earlier, inevitable,selfish ends.Let me repeat: the physical disciplines are of value in the beginning stage andimpart a sense of proportion and an awareness of defects and of limitations.These have their place in time and space, and that is all. Once the world of thesoul is entered, the disciple uses all forms wisely, with understanding of theirpurpose and with freedom from excess; he is not preoccupied with them orfundamentally interested in them. His eyes are off himself and are fixed on theworld of true values. He has no sense of self-interest, because a groupawareness is rapidly superseding his individual consciousness. The words:2. Let the group know the vivid, flaming, drenching life that floods the fourthwhen the fifth is knownare of prime importance to those who would and can profit [129] by what I amseeking to convey, as I interpret—as far as may be—these Rules. The knowing ofthe fifth kingdom in nature through the medium of the consciousness of thefourth and the sacrifice of the fourth kingdom to the fifth, of the human beingto the soul and of humanity to the kingdom of God, is the parallel (on a higherturn of the spiral) of the sacrifice of the third kingdom, the animal kingdom,to the fourth, the human kingdom. Thus it proceeds down the scale—sacrificealways of the lower to the higher.It therefore behooves the individual disciple to decide whether he is anapplicant, and consequently to be controlled by the “rules in time and space,”or a candidate for initiation who knows that life is one and that the form is ofno material significance, except as a field of experience for the soul.We now come to the most important part of this particular rule; it conveys thekey to the immediate goal for those who have attained a certain measure ofunderstanding. The words of importance are:3. Let then the group—merged in the fifth—be nourished by the sixth and seventh.In other words: “Then let the group—which is identified with the soul—find itssustenance and vitality by the inflow of the intuition and of the spiritualwill, emanating from the Spiritual Triad.” There are, of course, other meanings,but this is the most practical for disciples. A larger but similar concept liesin the realisation that the human family, the fourth kingdom in nature, isabsorbed by the fifth or by the kingdom of God and (when this is the case) canbecome increasingly en rapport with the sixth and seventh kingdoms. To thesekingdoms no names have as yet been given, because the possibility of theirexistence is only now just beginning faintly to penetrate into the consciousnessof the disciple and the initiate. The sixth kingdom is that of the“overshadowing Triads”—that aggregation of liberated Lives of which the higherinitiates in the Hierarchy [130] are a part; They are to that spiritual groupwhat the New Group of World Servers is to Humanity. I know not how else toexpress this truth to you.The seventh kingdom in nature is that of the Lives Who participate in fullcapacity of understanding with the group of Beings Who are the nucleus of theCouncil at Shamballa. Around the Lord of the World this group pivots; Theirconsciousness and state of being is only dimly understood by the most advancedMembers of the Hierarchy, and the relation of these Lives to the Lord of theWorld is similar, and yet fundamentally different, to the relation of theMembers of the Hierarchy to the three Great Lords—the Christ, the Manu and theMahachohan. Through these three Lords pours the energy which streams fromShamballa, transmitting the purpose and motivating the plan of Sanat Kumara—HisLife Plan. What you call “the Plan” is the response of the Hierarchy to theinflaming purposeful will of the Lord of the World. Through Sanat Kumara, theAncient of Days (as He is called in the Bible), flows the unknown energy ofwhich the three divine Aspects are the expression. He is the Custodian of thewill of the Great White Lodge on Sirius, and the burden of this “cosmicintention” is shared by the Buddhas of Activity and those Members of the GreatCouncil Who are of so elevated a consciousness and vibration that only once ayear (through Their emissary, the Buddha) is it safe for Them to contact theHierarchy.I am seeking only to point to a wider horizon than that usually registered bydisciples and I use these broad analogies to expand your point of view. By sodoing I can convey to the enlightened person a sense of synthesis, of purposefulplanning and of planetary integrity. This great spiritual structure of Being, ofLife and of Direction is something that the disciples and initiates of the worldneed—at this time—in their effort to stand steady under the pressure of worldevents, and in their determination to cooperate unwaveringly with the moves andplans made by the world Directors, that “Society of illumined and organised[131] Minds” which is known under the name of the Hierarchy. It is illuminationand consequent organisation which is needed profoundly at this time.You will see, therefore, the significance of the teaching now being given outanent the building of the antahkarana. It is only through this bridge, thisthread, that the disciple can mount on to that stage of the ladder of evolutionwhich will lead him out of the three worlds, which will bring the personalityinto rapport with the Spiritual Triad, and which will finally lead the Membersof the Hierarchy (when Their term of service is completed) on to the Path of theHigher Evolution. The antahkarana is built by aspirants and disciples andinitiates of the seven ray types, and is therefore a sevenfold woven thread; itconstitutes the first stage of the Path of the Higher Evolution. It is to thatPath what experience in the mineral kingdom of the Life of God is to that sameLife when it reaches the fourth or human kingdom. You can see, therefore, howsignificant is the coming Science of Comparison; not yet has this science ofcomparative analysis been turned into a definitely recognised line of approachto truth. The Law of Analogy is the key which unlocks the understanding.Something of the quality and the revelatory power of the intuition is known byall disciples; it constitutes at times (from its very rarity) a major “spiritualexcitement.” It produces effects and stimulation; it indicates futurereceptivity to dimly sensed truths and is allied—if you could but realiseit—with the entire phenomena of prevision. A registration of some aspect ofintuitional understanding is an event of major importance in the life of thedisciple who is beginning to tread the Path to the Hierarchy. It providestestimony, which he can recognise, of the existence of knowledges, wisdom andsignificances of which the intelligentsia of humanity are not yet aware; itguarantees to him the unfolding possibility of his own higher nature, arealisation of his divine connections and the possibility of his ultimatehighest spiritual attainment; it steadily supersedes soul knowledge, and theenergy pouring in to his consciousness [132] from the SpiritualTriad—particularly the energy of the sixth and seventh spheres of activity—isthe specific and particular energy which finally brings about the destruction ofthe causal body, the annihilation of the Temple of Solomon, and the liberationof the Life.Then that which in time and space has been termed the soul can “onward move inlife.” Evolution as we now understand it ceases; yet evolutionary unfoldmentproceeds along new lines which are based upon the past but which produce verydifferent results to those sensed even by the advanced disciple in his highestmoments. A new life-expression appears which moves onward freed from all formyet subject still to limitations “within the circle of influence of the greaterLife,” but not limited by life within the many forms which progress, surroundedby that circle, that divine ring-pass-not. There is still the broad confiningsweep of the purpose and the life-intent of the planetary Logos, but within thatperiphery and sphere of activity the Triads move with perfect freedom. Theironward push towards the higher states of Being is carried out in conformity withthe life urge of the One in Whom they live and move and have their being. Youwill note, therefore, that these words in reality cover or deal with lifeprocesses and not with form building or the experience in forms, as usuallyunderstood.A consideration of these at present inaccessible truths may serve to inspireyour minds, evoke your intuition and give you vision and increased spiritualperception.RULE SEVENThe Rule which is our theme for consideration at this time is one of deepsignificance and esoteric interest; it is concerned with the life of Shamballaand with the purposes of the Great Council. This rule is also one of rare beautyand extraordinary implications, and it offers me the opportunity to enlarge upona subject little known or understood by any esotericist in the average esotericgroup. The [133] reason for this is that it is only as the new cycle drawscloser—as it is drawing today—that the new and fuller teaching, the greatlyextended horizon and the tremendously enhanced perception of the spiritualobserver and worker become possible and apparent. Much, very much, has beengiven out during the past one hundred years anent the Masters, and (as we areconsidering the subject of initiation and of preparation for that greattransitional experience) it is necessary to understand somewhat the nature ofThose with Whom the disciple has to associate, and the kind of world and ofconsciousness in which They live and move and have Their being. The fact of theHierarchy is to many thinkers an established fact; the hypothesis that there maybe a Hierarchy is a widespread recognition. Information concerning its grades,its modes of working and its objectives are now common property; much has beenaccepted and much proved by those who believe this teaching.Before proceeding to a discussion of Rule VII, however, I would like to spend amoment studying some of the effects of this steadily growing fund of knowledge.It has become the possession of the many and not only of the rare and discreetesotericist and occult student; this teaching has now seeped down into theconsciousness of the masses and is there producing curiosity, relief and hope,speculation and cynical laughter, conscious spiritual effort or sustainedridicule—according to the type of mind, the sensitivity to truth or the crasscredulity of the recipient. But the knowledge, belief and hope in the existenceof a planetary Hierarchy has today leavened the entire mass of human thinking ina far wider and deeper manner than perhaps the most optimistic suspect; hereinlies the hope of the world, and here is to be found also a fertile field forspiritual work during the coming decades. For this all disciples must prepare.The rules whereby the Hierarchy may be reached are already well known to theaspirants of the world; they must become equally well known to the averageperson; the objectives of the hierarchical work must be emphasised and [134] thenature of the divine Plan unfolded so that purpose and goal may be presented tohumanity; the synthesis of the chain of hierarchical Existences—from thesmallest atom of matter up to and including the Lord of Life Himself—must beunfolded; the essential and spiritual interdependence of all and theinterrelation of every unit of divine life must be proved. This will eventuallylead to that established unity of effort which will express itself in themerging of the fourth and the fifth kingdoms in nature, and to the establishmentof that brotherhood which will constitute the germ or the seed of the comingmanifestation of the Hierarchy as the Heart of God (directly related to theHeart of the Sun) in physical expression. This is necessarily an ambiguousphrase; but is as close an expression, in words, of hierarchical purpose as Ifind it possible to make.The entire field of the world—meaning by that phrase all the kingdoms in naturein united inner and outer relationship—will be the medium of recognisedspiritual experience and also the field of expression of certain divinequalities and aspects which have hitherto been in quiescent abeyance. What thesequalities are, what divine aspects are awaiting precipitation, and which divinepurposes are latent in that field of waiting expectancy, I cannot yet reveal oreven indicate. The times are not yet ripe.A great upheaval in all the kingdoms in nature has characterised this day andgeneration; a stupendous destruction of all forms of divine life and in everykingdom has been the outstanding note of this upheaval. Our modern civilisationhas received a death blow from which it will never recover, but which will berecognised some day as the “blow of release” and as the signal for that which isbetter, new and more suitable for the evolving spirit, to make its appearance.Great and penetrating energies and their evoked forces have met in a conflictwhich has, figuratively speaking, elevated the mineral kingdom into the skiesand which has brought down fire from heaven. I am talking to you factually andnot just symbolically. The bodies of men, women and children, as well as ofanimals, have been [135] destroyed; the forms of the vegetable kingdom and thepotencies of the mineral kingdom have been disintegrated, distributed anddevastated. The coherent life of all the planetary forms has been temporarilyrendered incoherent. As an ancient prophecy has put it: “No true united Soundgoes out from form to form, from life to life. Only a cry of pain, a demand forrestitution and an invocation for relief from agony, despair and fruitlesseffort goes out from here to There.”All this upheaval of the “soil” of the world—spiritual, psychological andphysical—all this disruption of the forms and of the familiar contours of ourplanetary life had to take place before there could come the emergence of theHierarchy into the public consciousness; all this had to do its work upon thesouls of men before the New Age could come in, bringing with it the Restorationof the Mysteries, and the rehabilitation of the peoples of the earth. The two gotogether. This is one of the major points which I am seeking to make. Thedisruption, disintegration and the completely chaotic conditions existing forthe past five hundred years within all the kingdoms of nature have at lastworked their way out into paralleling physical conditions. This is good anddesirable; it marks the prelude to a better building of a better world, theconstruction of more adequate forms of life and of more correct human attitudes,plus a sounder orientation to reality. The best is yet to be.Everything is being rapidly brought to the surface—the good and the bad, thedesirable and the undesirable, the past and the future (for the two are one);the plough of God has nearly accomplished its work; the sword of the spirit hassevered an evil past from the radiant future, and both are seen as contributoryin the Eye of God; our material civilisation will be seen as giving placerapidly to a more spiritual culture; our church organisations, with theirlimiting and confusing theologies, will soon give place to the Hierarchy, withits emerging teaching—clear, factual, intuitive and non-dogmatic.The Hierarchy has been invoked and its Members are [136] ready for a great “actof evocation,” of response to the invoking sound of humanity and of a definite(though relatively temporary) “act of orientation.” This will force theHierarchy, of its own freewill, to turn towards a new and more intimate type ofrelation with humanity. That period of orientation will end when a powerful,earthly Hierarchy will factually, externally and in reality hold sway on earth,working in all the kingdoms of nature and thus bringing about (in truth) theexpression of the divine Plan. This plan is implemented through the medium ofthe senior Members of the Hierarchy, Who invoke the “Lights which carry out theWill of God”; They are Themselves invoked by the Light-Bearers, the Masters;They again, in Their turn, are invoked by the aspirants and disciples of theworld. Thus is the chain of Hierarchy only a life line, along which travel thelove and life of God, from Him to us and from us to Him.This dual thought of the relationship between humanity and the Hierarchy, andbetween the Hierarchy and the highest Centre, Shamballa, is completely coveredin Rule VII in its two forms—for applicants, and for disciples and initiates.Rule VII.> For Applicants: Let the disciple turn his attention to the enunciating of> those sounds which echo in the hall where walks the Master. Let him not sound> the lesser notes which awaken vibration within the halls of Maya.> For Disciples and Initiates: Let the group life emit the Word of invocation> and thus evoke response within those distant Ashrams where move the Chohans of> the race of men. They are no longer men as are the Masters, but, having passed> beyond that lesser stage, have linked themselves with the Great Council in the> highest Secret Place. Let the group sound a dual chord, reverberating in the> halls where move the Masters but finding pause and prolongation within those> radiant halls where move the “Lights which carry out the Will of God. ”[137] Of real importance, though relatively small, are two contrasts. Theseemerge with clarity if you compare the instructions given to applicants fordiscipleship and those given to initiates. The applicant (or young disciple) isaddressed as an individual and is told to give forth “those sounds” which willbe heard by the Master in His Ashram—for that is the true significance of thewords. The initiate functions in a group (always in a group) and has developedor is rapidly developing group consciousness; in unison with his group and as anintegral conscious part of it, the Word must be enunciated; this is not a medleyof sounds, but is one clear Word of invocation. You need to remember that thedisciple is occupied in resolving the many sounds into the Word; when he hasdone this, his individual approach to reality terminates, and he begins to actwith his group where all activity is concerned. This is a point of majorimportance for the newer type of disciple to grasp. In the past, the emphasishas been on what the individual initiate had to do in order to fit himself totake initiation, and so become a Master of the Wisdom and a member of theplanetary Hierarchy. In the coming new cycle the emphasis will be upon groupwork and activity, upon group initiation and group approach to the Center ofLife. The required mode of life and the needed individual eliminations andadjustments are now so well known (theoretically, at least) that they shouldhave dropped below the threshold of consciousness and should consequently beautomatic in their effects. This should also provide a steady inducement tothought which will make the initiate what he ought to be, because his consciousmind is free for group functioning. This is a concept which must be increasinglycultivated; “As a man thinketh in his heart, so he is.” The lower mind should bethe organ of heart expression and be as unconscious in its functioning as is therhythm of the heart itself—the physical heart. The higher mind is intended tobecome increasingly the field of the initiate’s effort, and hence the constantneed for him to build the antahkarana.In this Rule we are therefore dealing with the work [138] to be done by a groupof pledged disciples and initiates; they are learning together to make anapproach to Shamballa (involving the Will element); this is as much a goal ofthe Hierarchy as approach to the Hierarchy is the goal of advanced humanity. Itconcerns the interrelation of great centres of force. This is a point whichesoteric students should attempt to grasp for it completes the planetary chainof Hierarchy and throws a light upon the Way of the Higher Evolution.Great movements and progressions have always taken place upon the subjectiveside of life; it is these subjective activities which have made it hard fordisciples to grasp the truth and arrive at some true realisation of thesubjective situation which ever exists between the Hierarchy and Shamballa. Theenergies concerned are so subtle, and the Beings involved are so advanced and sohighly developed (even from the angle of the initiate of the third degree), thatit is well-nigh impossible for the teachings (which I seek to give) to be wordedin such a manner that they become comprehensible. All that I can do is to makecertain statements which (from the standpoint of those I teach) are notverifiable; they have to be accepted on trust and with the reservation that timeand the point of view of the individual disciple will later prove their truth—ortheir non-truth.The objective of all training given to the disciple is to shift his consciousawareness from the point where he is to levels which are higher than those inthe three worlds of definitely human evolution; the intention is to teach him tofunction on those planes of conscious contact which are as yet so subjectivethat he only accepts them as existent in theory. The trained initiate knows thatthey have to become his natural habitat, and that eventually he has to relegatethe ordinary and normal human experience to the three worlds of dailyexpression. These become eventually the worlds that exist below the threshold ofconsciousness; they are relegated to the realm of the subconscious—recoverableconsciously, if necessary for right service of humanity, [139] but as much belowthe threshold of consciousness as are the ordinary emotional reactions of theaverage man. These are always recoverable (as modern psychoanalysis hasdemonstrated) and can become capable of expression and of formulation intoconditioning concepts—thus actuating mental perception if deemed of adequateimportance. However, it should be borne in mind that the greater part of theemotional life of the disciple must become increasingly subconscious, just asthe physical plane life of the normal, healthy human being is entirely automaticand thus subconscious. When the disciple has striven to expand hisconsciousness, when he has learnt to stabilise his consciousness in theSpiritual Triad, then he becomes part of a great and constant hierarchicaleffort which strives upwards towards the “Place of Clear Electric Light,” towhich the clear cold light of the reason is the first key to the first door.There are three doors into Shamballa, speaking figuratively:1. There is the door of the reason , of pure perception of truth. Christ gavethe clue to this teaching when He said “I am the Way, the Truth and the Life.”Of that Way we know much, because upon the Way a vast body of teaching has beengiven, and that teaching, if followed, brings a man into the Hierarchy. He thenbecomes a factual part of the hierarchical membership. Of that Truth , we know(as aspirants) relatively very little. Truth—as we understand it during theearly treading of the Path of Discipleship—is concerned with great veritieswhich are (from the insight of the Enlightened Ones) only the a b c of life.These truths are:> The manifestation of divinity on the physical plane.> The doctrine of Avatars. This religious history reveals.> The nature of consciousness, through the development of psychology.> The doctrine of the Trinity, as it expresses itself through the aspects and> the attributes.These four expressions of truth will be found to convey all the knowledge withwhich the initiate must stand equipped [140] when he climbs the Mount ofTransfiguration at the time of the third initiation. They have given him aspiritual perception of the Plan.Of that Life , we know nothing whatsoever. The contemplation of its significancebelongs to Those Who can move at will within the “precincts of the Lord ofLife”—in Shamballa itself. All we can know about it is its lowest step. Thisenables us to study the impulse or instinct which enables all forms of life tofunction, which embodies the principles of responsiveness to contacts and toenvironment, and which embodies itself in the breath of life; this is alsorelated to the air in some mysterious manner, and also to fire. More anent thissubject it would be useless for me to say.2. There is also the door of the will. This is a penetrating power which relatesPlan to Purpose and which has in it the faculty of coherent persistence. Thereason for this persistence is that it is not dependent upon the content of theform—whether it is the form of an atom, of a man or of a planet—but upon a vitaldynamic and immutable purpose, latent in the consciousness of the planetaryBeing Who, “having pervaded this entire universe with a fragment” of Himself,REMAINS—greater, more inscrutable and “firmer in intent” than any of Hiscreations, even the most advanced and the closest to Him. Only those have clearperception of His divine purpose who do not belong to our earth humanity at all;these are the Lives who came with Him to this planet when He came, and Whoremain with Him as “the prisoners of loving intention” until the last “wearypilgrim has found his way home.”This spiritual will is something of which humanity knows nothing; it is hiddenand veiled by the self-will of the individual and the group will of the soul.Through both of these experiences the human being moves until his individualwill is developed and grounded, focussed and reoriented, and his group will isunfolded so that it includes and swallows up the dedicated, conscious,individual will. When this fusion has taken place (at the third initiation) a[141] great revelation unfolds itself, and for the first time the initiatesenses and then contacts the universal will; from that moment the initiate says,“Father, not my will but Thine be done.” Just a little of what that willincludes may emerge as we study this seventh rule and some of the succeedingrules.3. I can find no words to express the nature of the third door. Let us, indefault of a better term, call it the door of the monadic sense of essentialduality. Body and life, soul and personality, the Spiritual Triad and itsexpression, the Christ in incarnation—all these dualities have played theirpart. Man has passed from one expansion of consciousness to another. Now hecomes to the final duality of spirit and matter, prior to their resolution intosomething to which the terms “isolated unity” and “universal synthesis” giveonly faint and inadequate clues. To the development of this system ofidentification the initiate of the degree of Master of the Wisdom, and also (ona higher turn of the spiral) of the degree of the Christ, are focussing allTheir efforts. Up to the fourth initiation, the term “system of expansions”would seem illuminating; after that great initiation, the term “system ofidentification” would appear more appropriate.When the initiate has passed through the three doors, symbolically speaking, hethen faces all life, all events, all pre-determinations, all wisdom, allactivity and all that the future may hold of service and progress from the angleof the pure reason (infallible and immutable), of true spiritual will(completely identified with the purpose of the planetary Logos), and of thehighest possible focussed relation. The mystery of relationship becomes revealedto him. Then the entire scheme of evolution and of the intention of the One inWhom he lives and moves and has his being becomes clear to him; he has no moreto learn within this planetary scheme; he has become universal in his attitudeto all forms of life, and is also identified with the “isolated unity” of SanatKumara. Few of the great Lives Who form the inner group of the Council Chamberat Shamballa are now of [142] greater advancement than he; the “Supernal Three,”the “Radiant Seven,” the “Lives embodying the forty-nine Fires,” the “Buddhas ofActivity,” and certain “Eternal Spirits” from such centres of dynamic spirituallife as Sirius, or from the constellation which at any one time forms a trianglewith our Sun and Sirius” and a Representative from Venus are of greater—fargreater—advancement. Otherwise, all initiates of the sixth degree, and a few ofthe Masters Who have undergone specialised training because They are upon thefirst Ray of Will or Power (the ray conditioning Shamballa itself), form part ofthe Great Council. Many Masters and Chohans, however, after serving upon theplanet in various capacities, working with the Law of Evolution, pass out of ourplanetary life altogether.All the above information concerning the Lives which are far in advance of thedisciples of the world contains little of moment for you, except in so far as itfalls into a diagrammatic pattern of our planetary life and purpose, andenabling you, therefore, to get a faint glimpse of a synthetic theme and purposeto which all evolving lives must and will eventually conform.It must ever be borne in mind that the great theme of LIGHT underlies our entireplanetary purpose. The full expression of perfect LIGHT, occultly understood, isthe engrossing life-purpose of our planetary Logos. Light is the great andobsessing enterprise in the three worlds of human evolution; everywhere men ratethe light of the sun as essential to healthy living; some idea of the human urgeto light can be grasped if you consider the brilliance of the physicallyengendered light in which we live when night arrives, and compare it with themode of lighting the streets and homes of the world prior to the discovery ofgas, and later of electricity. The light of knowledge, as the reward ofeducational processes, is the incentive behind all our great schools of learningin every country in the world and is the goal of much of our world organisation;the terminology of light controls even our computation of time. The mystery ofelectricity is unfolding gradually before our rapt [143] eyes and the electricalnature of man is being slowly proven and will later demonstrate that, throughoutthe human structure and form, man is composed primarily of light atoms, and thatthe light in the head (so familiar to esotericists) is no fiction or figment ofwishful thinking or of a hallucinated imagination, but is definitely broughtabout by the junction or fusion of the light inherent in substance itself andthe light of the soul.It will be found that this will be capable of scientific proof. It will also beshown that the soul itself is light, and that the entire Hierarchy is a greatcentre of light, causing the symbology of light to govern our thinking, ourapproach to God, and enabling us to understand somewhat the meaning of the wordsof Christ “I am the Light of the world.” These words carry meaning to all truedisciples and present them with an analogous goal which they define tothemselves as that of finding the light, appropriating the light, and themselvesbecoming light-bearers. The theme of light runs through all the worldScriptures; the idea of enlightenment conditions all the training given to theyouth of the world (limited though the application of this idea may be), and thethought of more light governs all the inchoate yearnings of the human spirit.We have not yet carried the concept up to the Centre of Life where dwells theAncient of Days, the Eternal Youth, the Lord of the World, Sanat Kumara,Melchizedek—God. Yet from that Centre streams what has been called the Light ofLife, the Light Supernal. These are empty words as yet until we know, as trainedinitiates, that light is a symptom and an expression of Life, and thatessentially, occultly and in a most mysterious way the terms, Light and Life,are interchangeable within the limits of the planetary ring-pass-not. Beyondthose limits—who knows? Light can be regarded as a symptom, a reaction to themeeting and consequent fusion of spirit and matter.Therefore, where that great point of fusion and of solar crisis (for that iswhat it is, even when producing a planetary crisis) appears in time and space,light also immediately [144] appears and of such intensity that only those whoknow the light of the soul, and who can bear the hierarchical light can betrained to enter into and form part of the light of Shamballa and walk in those“radiant halls where move the Lights which carry out the Will of God.”To carry the concept a little nearer home: only when the will of the personalityand the will of the soul come together—evoked by love—does the light of the souldominate the material light of the personality. This is a statement ofimportance. Only when the will of the Monad and the will of the Hierarchy ofsouls meet and blend in the “upper brackets” (if I may use such a modernbusiness phrase) can the radiant light of Life dominate the blended lights ofHumanity and of the Hierarchy. Faintly this group fusion and junction can beseen to be taking place.It is also the first touch of the radiance of Shamballa which is bringing theuniversal revelation of evil, a radiance which is now producing the world unrestand which has brought about the lining up of good and evil; this touch ofradiance is the conditioning factor behind what is called post-war planning andthe ideas of reconstruction and of world rebuilding which are dominating thebest human thinking at this time.It should be carefully borne in mind that evil (cosmic evil or the source ofplanetary evil) is much closer to Shamballa than it is to Humanity. The GreatLives there move entirely free from glamour; Their vision is one of extremesimplicity; They are concerned only with the great and simple duality of spiritand matter, and not with the many forms which the fusion of these two bringsinto being. The domination of spirit (and its reflection, soul) by matter iswhat constitutes evil and this is true whether the statement is applied to thedevelopment of the individual or of the group. The “Lights which carry out thewill of God” move free from the spell of evil. The Light in which They movesafeguards Them, and Their Own innate and inherent radiance repels evil. ButThey “move alongside the evil to which all lesser forms are prone”; They arepart of a great [145] observing Group which “moves forward in time and space”;its members watch the great war and conflict proceed on Earth between the Forcesof Light and the Forces of Evil. They have let loose upon Earth the Forces ofLight, whilst the Forces of Evil are inherent in substance itself—of which allthe many forms of life are constructed.At this time, the work of the Great Council at Shamballa, working until nowthrough the Hierarchy, is with the life within the form; They have to proceedwith the utmost caution as They thus work, because these Lights know that thedanger of premature direct contact with humanity, and of consequentoverstimulation, are great. One of the causes of the present cataclysm is thefact that humanity was deemed capable of taking and receiving a “touch fromShamballa,” without stepping it down via the Hierarchy, as has hitherto been thecustom. The determination to apply this touch (which is in the nature of a greatexperiment) was made in 1825, when the Great Council had its usual centennialmeeting. The results you know; they are working out before your eyes. Theindustrial movement began to take shape one hundred years ago and received agreat impetus from this touch. The evil in nations—aggression, greed,intolerance and hate—was aroused as never before, and two world wars occurred,one of which is still raging (written October 1943). Paralleling this was anuprising of good, again in response to the divine “touch,” resulting in thegrowth of understanding, the spread of idealism, the purification of oureducational systems and the inauguration of reforms in every department of humanlife. All has been speeded up and little such growth was seen on a worldwidescale prior to 1825. The knowledge of the Hierarchy is also spreading over theearth; the facts anent discipleship and initiation are becoming common property;humanity has consequently moved onward into a greater measure of light. Good andevil stand out in clearer focus; light and dark are in a more brilliantjuxtaposition; issues of right and wrong are appearing with cleared definition,and humanity as a whole sees the great problems of righteousness [146] and love,of sin and separateness upon a worldwide scale.The old age and the coming new age, old rhythms of thought and new approaches totruth and consequent new and better ways of life are presented with clarity tothe minds of men. The guarantee of the success of the experiment started morethan a century ago is the fact that (in spite of much that is undesirable) somany nations have ranged themselves upon the side of right, and only twodefinitely and altogether upon the side of evil. The evil is more concentrated,and therefore more powerful temporarily upon the physical plane; the good ismore diffused and not so pure in its concentrated essence being coloured by manyundesirable aspects; the good, however, is concentrating rapidly and willtriumph. The “Lights that carry out the will of God” now wait to give anothertouch which will enable the reconstruction work to move forward along rightlines, but They wait for the invocative cry of humanity and for the dust ofbattle and of conflict to die down.The next two rules will reveal the issues still more clearly and will outlinefor you when better understood, explained and amplified, the processes andmethods of hierarchical work, carried on in conjunction with the Great Councilof Shamballa. To this must be added the cooperation—as far as may be—of allenlightened men, working under the Lightbearers, the Masters, and under theinspiration of the Lights which carry out the will of God.In the foregoing I have endeavoured to give some faint idea of the relationexisting between the Hierarchy and Shamballa. I did this in order that you mightgrasp some measure of the synthesis underlying the entire planetary life; inorder also that this rule for initiates could be interpreted as intended, as faras is possible, to the uninitiate consciousness; and finally, in order that theentire concept of Shamballa and its immense reservoir of energy, which we callthe will or the life of God, may take its rightful place in the occultpresentation of truth. The will of God and the life of God are esotericallysynonymous terms, and when the life aspect of an individual and his spiritual,selfless will [147] are completely synchronised, then you have—in a humanbeing—the full expression of divinity or what has been called esoterically,“Shamballa is consummated in him.”This again is, of course, only relative but the expression of this relationshipmay elucidate the problem somewhat, and the aspirant or disciple needs toremember that it is only through the analogies existing in the microcosm to theMacrocosm that enlightenment can come. And how, I ask you, will he understandthe relation existing between the three great planetary centres (Shamballa, theHierarchy and Humanity) when as yet he scarcely knows himself as a human being?How can he grasp these fundamental and advanced truths when he is only justbeginning to learn the nature of the hierarchical quality of love and when hisspiritual will (which links him to Shamballa) is as yet totally unawakened? AndI mean, totally. But the dim outlines of the general picture must be grasped,and each decade in the future will see the aspirant and the disciple morecapable of grasping it.RULE EIGHTRule VIII now comes up for consideration. The previous seven rules have been ofa wide and general connotation. They have been largely postulates, emphasisinggroup life, group planetary relationships, and the fundamental Science ofInvocation and Evocation which underlies all world processes, which is theinspiring energy behind all evolutionary unfoldment, and which creates themedium or channel of related communication between the great centres in ourplanet, through which the life of our Logos flows and His purposes are workedout. I would remind you that the creative process was initiated by Sound, and inthat Sound the Logos both invoked and evoked. He issued the call and Heengineered and implemented the response and thus the “Army of the Voice” (as TheSecret Doctrine calls it) came into being.[148] The Head (the idea ), the Heart (the ideal ) and the Throat (the creativeagent of the resulting idol , the temporary and fleeting expression of theideal, inspired by the idea) came into being; three great Centres emerged intime and space and—at this point in the evolutionary cycle —we call themShamballa, the Hierarchy and Humanity.With these fundamental factors the first seven rules have been occupied, and Ihave tried to help you to see their significance somewhat, from the angle of theinitiate-consciousness.We come now to a close consideration of this Rule VIII, where it might be saidthat the specific rules for the training of initiates begin. These remainingseven rules must be studied most carefully from that angle. They are notsusceptible of casual and superficial analysis. I realise that only those whohave taken initiation will be in a position to grasp the esoteric significanceof the words I use and of much that I may say, but it is for them I write; theirnumbers are even today more than are suspected, and their ranks will be steadilyincreased in the post-war period, both through the strenuous effort of disciplesin training to “make the grade,” and through the coming into incarnation ofinitiates of all degrees—some of whom are the children of today.Rule VIII.> For Applicants: When the disciple nears the Portal, the greater seven must> awaken and bring forth response from the lesser seven upon the double circle.> For Disciples and Initiates: Let the group and within itself response to the> greater seven groups which carry out the hierarchical will with love and> understanding. The group contains all seven, the perfect group. The lesser> seven, the greater seven and the planetary seven form one great whole, and> these the group must know. When this is realised and the Law of the> Supplementary Seven is understood, let the group understand the Three and then> the ONE. This they can do with the united breath and the united rhythm.On the surface, this rules appears to be one of surprising [149] complexity andimmense difficulty. It deals with so many groups and septenates and this seemsto complicate understanding considerably. Yet every person in the world isdealing with the multiplicity of units and combinations of forces which make uphis entire daily life and which create his environment and his lifecircumstances. Life would be simple indeed if the average man had only sevenfactors to consider, with which to conform, to work with and to use. Advanceinto the world of spiritual values and into the realm of triadal existence (inwhich the initiate moves) is definitely an advance into simplicity. It is anadvance from the complications of the multiplication table and its resultantarithmetic into the simplicity of the symbolic formulas as used in the highermathematics; it is a moving out of the world of kaleidoscopic figures inconstant movement, into the world of meaning; it is a process of getting behindthe world of effects into the world of causes, realising that one simple causeor directed movement of energy can set in motion a myriad of effects. The way ofthe initiate is not a complicated one, once he has grasped the fact that he mustrelease himself from the world of seeming and of illusion and stand free in theworld of light, where all stand clearly revealed. Then he can begin to face thelessons and take the training which will enable him to handle energy—havingreleased himself from the control of forces—and begin to direct energy inconformity with the great Plan. The complexity lies in the thinking of theneophyte. The initiate knows it not.First let us clearly define the various septenates referred to in this rule. Iwill first tabulate them in the order of their appearance and define them, andthen I will enlarge upon them in order to point out where the training entersin, where the rule applies, and how the embodied rule is in the nature of a Lawwhich the initiate may not evade.I would ask you here to refer to what I earlier said anent rules, laws andorders when starting with you this particular study. [150]1. The seven greater groups . . . The seven groups or Ashrams within theHierarchy.THE HIERARCHY> These carry out the hierarchical will, which is love.> They work through love and understanding.> Each is presided over by a Chohan and a group is called an Ashram.> These major Ashrams have many affiliated Ashrams, presided over by a Master on> the same ray as the Chohan, and are capable at any moment of being absorbed> into the primary Ashram.> The perfect or complete group is the Hierarchy itself, containing all the> seven major Ashrams and their affiliates.2. The Planetary seven groups . . . the seven rays, the central septenate ofenergy.SHAMBALLA> These embody the will of Shamballa, which is divine purpose.> They work as life energy, as quality, and produce appearance.> Each is presided over by one of the seven Spirits before the Throne; by one of> the seven Ray Lords.> Each of these rays has its seven subrays which relate it to all the other> rays.> These seven rays can, under divine purpose, be re-absorbed into the Three and> then into the One.3. The lesser seven . . . the seven types of men and also the seven root races.HUMANITY> These embody the intelligence of the Logos as it expresses itself through> creativity.> They are learning to work intelligently with matter in order to develop love> in response to divine purpose—which is will or life.> Each of the seven types, responsive to one or [151] other of the seven rays,> is conditioned or ruled by its prototype, the soul on its own plane.> These major types or races of men have many subraces and subsidiary types,> developed during the evolutionary process; all will eventually demonstrate the> seven major types.> The perfect type is the Christ, the Heavenly Man, Who expresses all the major> types and Who is the “pattern of things as they are .”4. The supplementary seven . . . the seven centres of energy in the individualman.HUMANITY> These together embody the combined forces of the planetary life as registered> by the perfected individual. They will eventually enable the man to achieve> perfection.> They enable the individual to respond to material forces, to soul energy and> spiritual life, and they constitute a complete response apparatus to the> planetary life, purpose, intent and form.> Each of the seven centres is responsive to one or other of the seven rays and> their qualities under the conditioning energy of the soul ray and the forces,> emanating from the environment.> These centres develop progressively and under the impact of circumstances and> the Law of the Supplementary Seven, but all will eventually express in some> measure the seven types of ray energy.The Law of the Supplementary Seven can be worded as follows:> “The Law demands the entrance of that which can effect a change.> The Law demands that right direction should then guide the entering forces.> The Law demands that the changes thus effected remove the form, bring quality> to light and lay the emphasis upon life. [152]> The Law demands that this is brought about by the One, working through the> Three, energising the Seven and creating the straight line from there to here,> and ending in a point which ignores the Three.”When, the rule goes on, this is understood and applied, then four things happen:> 1. The group must understand the nature of the Three.> 2. The nature of the One must be grasped and comprehended.> 3. The group must work through the medium of the united breath.> 4. The group must attain a unified rhythm.Here you have a relatively simple analysis (on the face of it, though not inreality) of a complex rule which the initiate has to apply to himself once hehas grasped the significance of the seven basic postulates. The first sevenrules provide the framework within which his work has to be done. The last sevenrules concern various significant matters which, step by step, are revealed tothe initiate as his consciousness is expanded. They relate to:> 1. The work which the initiate must accomplish within himself.> 2. The group relations of the initiate and his absolute need to work with his> group and as an integrated and conscious part of it.> 3. The place which invocation and evocation must take as instruments in his> pledged intelligent service.> 4. The blending of the four lessons which the applicant has to master and the> four lessons which the initiate has to complete in order that a complete> fusion of personality and Monad can be brought about.> 5. The significance of resurrection and ascension, particularly the latter,> because little has been given out to date anent ascension.There are certain major frameworks (if I may continue to use this phrase) withinwhich the initiate has to learn [153] consciously to work, recognising them forwhat they are; once he has learnt to master that which lies within someparticular framework, he finds that it is only a part, a small fraction, of astill greater whole, within which he must also learn to function and play hispart.First he, as a disciple, has to learn to work within the framework of hisblending soul-personality . This task at first takes the form of characterbuilding and disciplining (whilst upon the Probationary Path), of a struggle tosee, of an endeavour to make a continuity of his soul contact. Finally, thisleads to the beginning of the stage of soul and personality merging and at thispoint he steps upon the Path of Discipleship, technically understood. From thenon his problem is to know himself as he truly is, to direct energy to the neededcentres which are awaiting scientific attention, to superintend consciously thefitting of himself, as a personality, to act as the instrument of the soul andlater of the Hierarchy, to learn to contact energy, to handle and direct it.This entails a comprehension of the mechanism within himself—the seven centreswithin the vital body—through which the contacted energy must flow under souldirection, and it also means the perfecting of the response apparatus and thenewly constructed spiritual mechanism which exoterically enables him to contactthe outside world, and esoterically enables him to contact the world of souls.It implies a steady process of interior perfecting until nothing further remainsto be done within that individual framework. The bulk of this work has beencovered by the time the fourth initiation has been taken, and has beencompletely covered when the fifth initiation is undergone.This all takes much time, but when a certain measure of success has beenachieved, when the initiate’s understanding is somewhat enlightened and hisenergy-use and his power of direction are becoming intelligently applied, he canthen begin to work within the framework of the greater seven groups , that is,within the Hierarchy. This he does first upon the periphery of the hierarchicalaura and later as a conscious, accepted and pledged worker in some [154]Ashram—the Ashram being dependent upon his ray type. He then is in a position todiscover the close interlocking that exists between the supplementary seven (hisown seven centres) and the seven great groups within the Hierarchy; he comes torealise that only when his centres are somewhat awakened and attuned is itpossible for him to work within the larger framework of the Hierarchy, and thisbecause the quality of the greater groups and the life expression of the sevenplanetary groups, the seven rays, are being slowly developed by him under theinfluence of hierarchical supervision through the medium of his own sevencentres—the supplementary seven.Thus, from a new angle which is practical and not simply theoretical, it beginsto dawn on him that he is an inalienable part of a group whole and that thisincontrovertible fact involves responsibilities and duties. He discovers thathis major responsibility—spiritually speaking—is to permit no hindrance, on thepart of the supplementary seven, to the free flow of love from the greaterseven, and later the free flow of life (inspired by purpose) from the planetaryseven. He knows now that all form a great interlocking directorate through whichthe will of God is working out. He now knows himself to be a minute part of thatgreat interlocking Whole, a responsible conscious atom within its periphery.Then as he goes on and learns to submit to the Law of the Supplementary Seven,he finds that from the life angle and through his own conscious direction,gradually developed, all the potencies of divinity are his to use, once he canbe trusted, as the advanced initiate can ever be trusted. He is then set freefor complete cooperation with the purpose lying behind the Plan. He has passedout of the human kingdom into the Hierarchy; later he will pass out of thehierarchical group into Shamballa, or out of our planetary life altogether, andeither here or there will begin a greater and more extended service.Coming down to the immediate practical issues, the initiate is confronted withthe problem of work within the individual framework, for I am not here dealingwith the [155] requirements for the initiations above or beyond the third. Herethe initiate has reached the point where he grasps the significant fact that theway into the innermost Centre is most securely guarded; no one can pass onwardand take those more advanced steps which admit into the higher worlds of beingand of unparalleled potency until he has demonstrated within the framework ofhis own life a definite control of energy (and this the black adept alsopossesses), purity of motive (which the black adept can likewise have, if bypurity of motive you mean single-hearted and one-pointed intent), deep love ofhumanity (which the black adept never has), selflessness, willingness to followthe light wherever it may lead, ability to begin work within the largerframework the moment such an attempt becomes possible, clear vision andspiritual insight, a developed intuition, and an undeviating intention andstrong faith in the future. When these qualities begin to show themselves, itthen becomes possible to admit the initiate to further advancement upon the Way.It is believed to be safe for him now to move on a few more steps into greaterlight, and then—having reached his next point of testing—he must there againdemonstrate the rightness of his work within the individual framework and hisability to work within the greater framework in group formation. He mustappreciate the fact that as he passes upon the upward way he may not safely sodo without the safeguards which protect the Way from him until he knows more; hemust learn also that the group protects him and that only with the group can heproceed with security; he begins to realise that the group is not only aprotection but also his chosen and destined field of service. He begins to learnwith his group the meaning of the “united breath” referred to in the rule, andalso to work with the group in “unified rhythm.”Thus he goes from strength to strength. All the time the Hierarchy is aiding inhis development and at the same time protecting the Way from him until such timeas glamour cannot reach him. This individual security of his [156] i s onlyreached between the time of taking the second initiation and the third. Prior tothat, he is still regarded as a potential hazard and as unstable. After that, hemay suffer from illusion, but there is then no fear of his permanently turningback and reaching the left-hand path and so perhaps, in rare cases, finding hisway into the Black Lodge. The major liability of the average initiate is slothor lack of speed. Ponder on that.I would have you grasp clearly the highly condensed presentation I have givenyou. Some of it you know already but it is the synthetic presentation which Iwould have you appreciate and appropriate. We can then take up the work to bedone within the individual framework by the initiate; I will endeavour to helpyou to understand somewhat more clearly what the initiate-consciousness wouldread into the Law of the Supplementary Seven.Beginning with this eighth rule which we are now studying, we enter upon theconsideration of certain major unfoldments, major spiritual happenings and aseries of major awakenings in consciousness which are in the nature of events.These involve likewise certain major recognitions and appreciations which willaffect the initiate increasingly and bring about his eventual attainment. Theseare the factors which condition the date of his achievement and not thecharacter undertakings and the soul contacts which are so necessary upon thePath of Probation and upon the Path of Discipleship.We are principally concerned at this point with the interpretation of the Law ofthe Supplementary Seven. It must be remembered that the Laws of Nature areimposed upon the mass of men, and cannot be avoided. If these laws are broken,infringed or evaded, they carry their own penalty within themselves, and thisalso cannot be avoided. These great protective laws are intended to guard thepersonalities through which the soul incarnates and eventually to cement andfurther all the great and possible relationships. The man passes from the stageof antagonism (as an individual) to the control of these natural though divine[157] laws, to a recognition of their inevitability and of their wisdom. Theyautomatically then control him.When this control by the Laws of Nature has become complete, the man becomes anaspirant and begins to come under the Laws of the Soul, which are laws concernedprimarily with the establishing of the great Fellowship of the Universe. Therehas been much confusion among esotericists upon these points. They confuse thediscipline to which the personality has to submit when coming under soulinfluence, with the Laws of the Soul which have naught to do with the pettylittle affairs of the personality—unimportant and unnoticed by the soul on itsown plane—but with the growing recognition of right group relations; these arebased upon a growing understanding of the hierarchical mode of work and ofinter-hierarchical relationships. The Laws of Nature, therefore, concern theactivities of the soul in form and are mandatory and accepted by the formnature. The Laws of the Soul concern the life of the soul upon its own plane,and the relation which the blending soul and personality learn to establish withother souls and with the Hierarchy. These are consciously and voluntarilyobeyed, and are not just accepted as mandatory and as forced upon the man byforce of circumstances, experience and evolution. They tend to bring aboutincreasing relation between the Hierarchy of Souls and Humanity as a whole,between the great planetary centre which is the custodian of the principle oflove and the planetary centre, humanity, which nurtures and distributes theenergy of mind.The Law of the Supplementary Seven is the great synthetic Law of Life or ofSpirit and is the law with which the initiate works; it is this law he wields.From acceptance of the laws of nature and obedience to the laws of the soul, hepasses into the positive phase of understanding and wielding the Law of Life.Because this is a governing law for all initiates, and because we know that thenature of life-energy or of spirit cannot be grasped until after the thirdinitiation, it is exceedingly difficult for me to write in explanation of thislaw. You have not yet the initiate consciousness. [158] I have therefore had toexpress this law in terms of form, whereas the initiate understands it from itsformless angle.This law is concerned with the wielding of energy in the world of the SpiritualTriad and not with the distribution or the transmission of this energy to thethree worlds in which average humanity habitually dwells. Right wielding of thislaw (controlling energy in the initiatory world of causes) automatically bringsabout activity, movement, force expression, and right distribution of theseforces in the lower three worlds. These are, under the evolutionary law, directreflections of the three higher worlds of the triadal light and life.Motivation, the use of the eye of vision (turned this time by the initiatefunctioning in the world of causes upon the worlds of human living), and thecorrect direction of force in cooperation with the hierarchical Plan conditionall the activities of the initiate working with this law. Clearer than this Icannot be.This Law of the Supplementary Seven is concerned with the inflow of energy fromthe seven planetary centres to the seven groups or types of men, via the sevengroups within the Hierarchy. In this work of transmission the seven centres ofthe initiate are used as agencies; their work, therefore, is not theinterrelated work of right transmission of energy within the septenaryconstitution of the etheric body of the individual initiate, implementing hislife expression, but is the task of being responsive to the seven types ofplanetary energy which are received in a pure state. It is then channeledthrough the seven centres in the initiate’s etheric vehicle and out into theworld of men as regenerative and constructive forces. These living spiritualenergies—transmitted by the individual initiate from the planetary centres—arehandled by him under a great uniform plan and are the means whereby salvation(to use an old familiar word) can come to the aid of humanity. This is the“saving force” in its various aspects, of which the Great Invocation speaks:“The hour of service of the Saving Force has now arrived”. (The Externalisationof the Hierarchy, page 249.) [159] The high Initiates (Those above the rank ofMaster) work with the energies coming from the seven planets of the solar systemat this time active; these feed or implement the seven planetary centres. Butthe Law of the Supplementary Seven is applied by initiates below the rank ofMaster, and they are therefore working solely with the seven centres within theForm of the One in Whom we live and move and have our being.One of their first tasks is to bring about a free flow and right energyrelations between the three major centres in our planet which correspond to thehead, heart and throat centres in man. They are occupied with the circulation ofenergy between Shamballa, the Hierarchy and Humanity. This circulation, whichfor the first time in planetary history includes the highest centre, Shamballa,is not yet completely established. Shamballa has been in touch with the centrecalled Humanity by impact several times in the history of the race. But therehas been no reciprocal action and no free flow. Humanity has taken the impact ofenergy and this impact has wrought changes in the activity of the centre, butthere has been no “responsive return,” as it is esoterically called, and henceno circulation. The Shamballa force has hitherto been transmitted via theHierarchy. For the first time, and in this century there has been direct impact.The diagram on page 160 may make this clearer.We shall eventually have a free circulation and a veritable vortex of force setup between the three centres; it will be of such an increasing radiatoryactivity that—moving in both directions around the three centres—it willeventually contact the radiations emanating from the other four centres of theplanetary Life, thus completing the interplay and the interrelation between allseven. These four include the three lower kingdoms of nature and a certain basiccentre (corresponding to the centre at the base of the spine in man) about whichnothing is as yet known nor will be known for ages to come. [160]> [Image00003.jpg]The importance, therefore, of the centre which we call Humanity will beapparent. The Secret Doctrine has ever taught that mankind has a specialfunction in saving and regenerating nature. The “saving force”—a circulatorycombination of the three major energies—is radiated by humanity as agroup-creative impulse, and this gradually sweeps all forms of life into thefield of its magnetic potency, thus relating them (or rather the soul of eachkingdom) to the Hierarchy and to Shamballa. This involves a great mystery whichis closely tied up—little as you may realise it—with the doctrine of Avatars orof World Saviours.It is in this connection that the words I gave you previously are pertinent:[161]> 1. “The group must understand the nature of the Three.” This will be seen to> refer to the three major centres and the nature of their relationship, and not> specifically to the Trinity.> 2. “The nature of the One must be grasped and comprehended.” This has> reference to the fact that our planetary Life is Itself a centre within a> still greater Life, and is today one of the three planetary centres (even if> not yet one of the seven sacred planets) which are the custodians of the> force, in process of transmission, which will be to the greater Life what> Shamballa, the Hierarchy and Humanity are to Our planetary Logos.> 3. “The group must work through the medium of the united breath.” This deals> with the processes of circulation, for the breath is the life and pours> through all the centres.> 4. “The group must attain a unified rhythm.” This has no reference in reality> to the work of a group of disciples, but to a group of centres of life, such> as the three major centres or the entire group of seven centres.A study of these ideas may carry illumination, but I would again remind you thatI write for initiates, living at a later period in this century and in the next.In considering this Law of the Supplementary Seven, I would like to point outthat the word “supplementary” is of real significance. It brings in a factor ofgreat interest, from the angle of initiation. You must bear in mind that whenthe antahkarana is constructed and in use, there is consequently a free play ofenergy in a direct line between the Spiritual Triad and the personality; i.e.,between the Monad and its “earthly anchor.” You will also remember that the soulbody, the form on the higher levels of the mental plane which has “shrouded” thesoul, eventually disappears. This, as you know, takes place at the fourthinitiation and is one of the best recognised facts in the occult teaching. Inthe three worlds, the correspondence to this disappearance of the form of thesecond divine aspect, the soul, is the dissolution of the astral body—the secondaspect [162] of the personality. Then the personality stands free from itscontrol. Sensitivity and reaction to contact in the three worlds has beenperfectly developed, but it no longer holds the disciple a prisoner.Then, at a later stage upon the Path of Initiation, the causal body alsodisappears and the initiate stands free in the three worlds. The astral body andthe causal or soul body are—in the language of esotericism—supplementary toreality. They have had a temporary reality during the evolutionary process, but(having served their purpose and having endowed man with certain requiredassets—consciousness, feeling, sensitivity, the ability to establish andregister contact) they pass away and the initiate remains, possessed of powerover form and a fully awakened consciousness. He is a soul and the fusion iscomplete.What is true of the individual is true too of the Heavenly Man, the planetaryLogos. In the long period of a world cycle there comes a time when the Hierarchyitself, as a body organised and functioning in order to implement certainevolutionary ends, is no longer needed. It is then regarded as “supplementary,”and under the Law its life, its potency and its entire consciousness areabsorbed into the planetary head centre, Shamballa. A great process ofabstraction or of withdrawal takes place, covering necessarily a long period oftime, and which is consummated only when evolution—as we know it—comes to an endand the planetary Life (again as we know it) also comes to an end. This processof abstraction is always going on. Men become disciples and then initiates. Somestay as hierarchical workers, choosing to work with the planetary forces ofevolution. Others pass on into the great Council Chamber of the Lord of theWorld, and still others pass out of our planetary ring-pass-not altogether.Thus the Law of the Supplementary Seven is ever in force. It functions in theprocesses going on in the seven centres of the individual man, gathering energyfrom one centre into another until all are centred, controlled and directed inthe head. In the stage of what the Hindus call [163] “samadhi” the vitalenergies from all the centres are concentrated in the highest head centre in theetheric body, in the area just above the physical head. Thus the analogy iscomplete. The processes of abstraction are (as you may thus see) connected withthe life aspect, are set in motion by an act of the spiritual will, andconstitute the “resurrection principle which lies hidden in the work of theDestroyer,” as an old esoteric saying expresses it. The lowest manifestation ofthis principle is to be seen in the process of what we call Death—which is inreality a means of abstracting the life principle, informed by consciousness,from the form or the bodies in the three worlds.Thus, the great synthesis emerges, and destruction, death, and dissolution arein reality naught but life processes. Abstraction is indicative of process,progress and development.It is this aspect of the Law of Life (or the Law of Synthesis as it is called incertain larger connotations) with which the initiate specifically deals whenwielding the Law of the Supplementary Seven. The group angle of the matter canbe seen if you remember that the individual initiate, when wielding this law,draws upon the united energy of the Will as the group is expressing it in“unified rhythm.” It is by the use of the “united breath” of the entire group(as much of it as his individual will can assimilate, focus, use and direct)that he augments his own will and its directed force. The breath, as we wellknow, is the life; this Law is the one wielded by the living or risen Christ, inperfect harmony with the will of Shamballa. Herein lies one of the mysteries ofthe resurrection initiation about which so little has been told, and it is thevery heart of the mystery of the ascension initiation. In this latter initiationthe living risen Christ withdraws or abstracts Himself and enters consciouslyand permanently into the great centre, Shamballa. The resurrection and theascension are the results of the death or destruction of the causal body. It canbe seen, therefore, how true the Gospel story is to the purposes of Shamballa.Let us now briefly interpret or rather paraphrase the [164] four sentences bymeans of which I have sought to embody this law, or as much of it as it ispossible to put into words, for the enlightenment of the initiates of thefuture.1. The Law demands the entrance of that which can effect a change.Bearing in mind what I have elsewhere given, it is obvious that that which mustfind entrance is that vital concentrated will which, when set in motion in anindividual, in a group, in a nation, in a kingdom of nature (a planetarycentre), and in the planet as a whole, i.e., in all the planetary centressimultaneously, will cause a stirring, a changed measure, a new movement andmomentum, an uprising and a consequent abstraction. The changes wrought in thecentres when the death of the physical body is taking place have never yet beenobserved or recorded; they are, however, definitely present to the eye of theinitiate and prove most interesting and informative. It is the recognition ofthe condition of the centres which enables the initiate to know—when in processof bestowing healing—whether the physical healing of the body is permissible ornot. He can see whether the will principle of abstraction to which I have beenreferring is actively present or not. The same process can be seen taking placein organisations and in civilisations in which the form aspect is beingdestroyed in order that the life may be abstracted and later again rebuild foritself a more adequate form. It is the same under the great processes ofinitiation, which are not only processes of expanding the consciousness but arerooted in the death or the abstraction process, leading to resurrection andascension.That which effects a change is a discharge (to use a totally inadequate phrase)of directed and focussed will-energy. This is so magnetic in quality that itdraws to itself the life of the centres, bringing about the dissolution of theform and the release of the life. Death comes to the individual man, in theordinary sense of the term, when the will-to-live in a physical body goes andthe will-to-abstract [165] takes its place. This we call death. In cases ofdeath in war, for instance, it is not then a case of the individualwill-to-withdraw, but an enforced participation in a great group abstraction.From its own place, the soul of the individual man recognises the end of a cycleof incarnation and recalls its life. This it does through a discharge of thewill-energy that is strong enough to bring about the change.2. The Law demands that right direction should then guide the entering forces.The entering forces, working under this law, are directed first of all to thehead centre, from thence to the ajna centre and then to that centre which hasbeen the governing and most active centre during the incarnation of the lifeprinciple. This varies according to the point reached upon the ladder ofevolution, and according to the personality ray, with later the soul raybringing about a major conditioning and change. In the work of the initiate whois consciously wielding this law, the principle of abstraction (when enteringthe body) is held focussed in the head and is of such a magnetic potency thatthe energy of the remaining centres is rapidly gathered up and withdrawn. Whatis true of the individual process of abstracting the life principle, under theLaw of the Supplementary Seven, is equally true of the process in all forms andin all groups of forms. Christ referred to this work of abstraction, as regardsthe third great planetary centre, Humanity, when He said (and He was speaking asthe Representative of the Hierarchy, the second planetary centre into which allhuman beings achieving initiation are “withdrawn” esoterically), “I, if I belifted up will draw all men unto me.” A different word to this word of His willbe spoken at the end of the age when the Lord of the World will speak fromShamballa, will abstract the life principle from the Hierarchy, and all life andconsciousness will then be focussed in the planetary head centre—the greatCouncil Chamber at Shamballa.3. The Law demands that the changes thus effected remove the form, bring qualityto light, and lay the emphasis upon life.[166] Here the three great aspects—form, quality and life—are brought intorelation and the point of the evolutionary objective is seen in its truelight—LIFE. Note this phrasing. Form or appearance, having served its purpose,disappears. Death of the form takes place. Quality, the major divine attributebeing developed in this planet, becomes dominant and is “conscious of itself“—as the ancient writings put it. It is identified and individual but has noimplementing form, except that of the greater whole in which it finds its place.Neither form nor quality (body nor consciousness) are paramount in the new stateof Being, but only the life aspect, the spirit on its own plane, becomes thedominating factor. Some faint dim light on the significance of this may come ifyou bear in mind that our seven planes are only the seven subplanes of thecosmic physical plane. The process of developing sensitivity in this sevenfoldevolution has been undergone in order to enable the initiate to function uponthe cosmic astral plane, when withdrawn or abstracted after the higherinitiations. He is abstracted from our planetary life altogether. Only onefactor could prevent this, and that might be his pledge to serve temporarilywithin the planetary ring-pass-not. Such Members of the Hierarchy Who pledgeThemselves to this work are stated to have the Buddhic consciousness, and theline of Their descent (occultly understood) is from the Eternal Pilgrim, theLord of the World, then the Buddha, and then the Christ. They remain identifiedthrough the free choice with the “quality seen within the light,” and for theterm of Their freely rendered service They work with the consciousness aspect inorder to lay the emphasis later upon the life aspect.4. The Law demands that this is brought about by the One, working through theThree, energising the Seven and creating the straight line from there to here,and ending in a point which ignores the Three.Let me paraphrase this, for detailed comment is not possible or permissible. TheOne directed will (of the individual, [167] of humanity, of the Hierarchy) andthe great Lords of Shamballa, working through the three major centres (head,heart and throat; Humanity, the Hierarchy and Shamballa), thereby energise allthe seven centres (to the point of abstraction), using the straight line of theantahkarana from above downwards (from the centre of power, the head orShamballa), and gather all upwards into a point which is neither of the Three(Shamballa, the Hierarchy and Humanity) and ignores them, for they must nolonger limit the life. This point lies outside manifestation altogether.Abstraction is complete.Ponder, therefore, upon this doctrine of abstraction. It covers all lifeprocesses, and will convey to you the eternally lovely secret of Death, which isentrance into life.RULE NINEAs we proceed with the study of these rules the difficulty of interpreting andexplaining them becomes increasingly great. We have arrived at a section of therules which requires initiate-consciousness for right and true comprehension; weare studying ideas for which we have, as yet, no adequate language. Briefly, wehave considered certain of the lower aspects of the Laws of Life as they appearto the initiate and are interpreted by him within the sphere of his normalconsciousness—that of the Spiritual Triad. The presentation which I gave you hadto be confined within the area of consciousness which we call “manasicawareness,” which is that of the abstract mind. Just in so far as that abstractmind is developed in you and the antahkarana tenuously constructed will be yourunderstanding of my words.The difficulty becomes still greater as we arrive at the study of Rule IX. Itwas of real difficulty when presented in its lower form to applicants. Thatrule, as you may remember, ran as follows: [168]Let the disciple merge himself within the circle of the other selves. Let butone colour blend them and their unity appear. Only when the group is known andsensed can energy be wisely emanated.Three major ideas appear in this easier rule:> 1. The idea of complete identity with all other selves.> 2. The idea of the uniformity of their spiritual presentation to the world> when unity is established.> 3. The idea that—as a result of the two above achievements—the group force, as> a real and focussed energy, can then be used.Glibly the neophyte talks of identifying himself with others, and eagerly heendeavours to ascertain his group and merge with it; yet in so doing theconstant concept of duality is ever present—himself and all other selves,himself and the group, himself and the group energy which he may now wield. Yetthis is not so in reality. Where true identity is achieved, there is no sense ofthis and that; where the merging is complete, there is no recognition ofindividual activity within the group, because the will of the merged soul isidentical with that of the group and automatic in its working; where true unityis present, the individual applicant becomes only a channel for the group willand activity, and this with no effort of his own but simply as a spontaneousreaction.I have emphasised the above because in the rule for disciples and initiates,this will be found to be still more the case and the results are brought aboutby a conscious use of the will which is divine synthesis in action; also, thegroup referred to is not the Ashram of some particular Master, but that of allAshrams as they in their entirety reflect the purpose of Shamballa and work outthe Plan within the active sphere of the hierarchical consciousness.The Ashrams of the Masters are to be found on every level of consciousness inthe threefold world of the Spiritual Triad. Some Masters pre-eminently occupythemselves with the mind aspect within all forms, and therefore their Ashramsare conditioned by the manasic consciousness; they are [169] the Ashrams ofthose initiates who have taken the fourth initiation but who are not yetMasters. They are largely adepts upon the third and fifth rays, and work withthe manas or mind as it is developing in all forms. They do foundational work ofgreat importance, but are little understood and their lives are consequentlylives of great sacrifice and the term of their service in this particularconnection is relatively short. Certain aspects of their developed consciousnesshave to be kept in abeyance and must remain temporarily unexpressed in order topermit them to work with substance and specifically with the consciousness ofthe atoms which constitute the forms in all the subhuman kingdoms of nature.They do very little work with humanity, except with certain advanced members ofhumanity who are on the scientific line, drawing to their Ashrams only those whoare on the third and fifth rays and who can continue with the work, beingtrained along peculiar and special lines.The Ashrams of the Masters (to be found on all the rays) Who work in particularwith humanity, are mostly to be found upon the buddhic levels of the triadalconsciousness. There the note of “loving understanding” predominates, but eventhese words must be interpreted esoterically and not according to their usualand obvious meaning. It is not a case of “I understand because I love,” or that“this,” with love, understands “that.” It is something far deeper, involving theidea of identification, of participation, and of synthetic realisation—lovelyeuphonious words, but meaning little to the non-initiates.On atmic levels, the levels of the spiritual will, are to be found the Ashramsof those Masters Who are interpreting the will of Shamballa and to Whom iscommitted the task of transmitting the purpose and organising the plans wherebythat purpose can be fulfilled. As on manasic levels the Ashrams as a whole arepresided over by the Master R., the Lord of Civilisation, so on buddhic levelsall Ashrams are supervised by the Master K.H., with the aid of myself (theMaster D.K.) and three senior and initiated [170] disciples; the objective isthe unfoldment of group awareness and of loving understanding, in order that theforms prepared and conditioned under the supervision of the Master R. may besensitised and become increasingly conscious of reality through the developmentof an inner mechanism of light which—in its turn—will condition and develop theouter mechanism of contact. Ashrams on atmic levels are under the control of theMaster M., Who fosters the will aspect within the developed forms and Who (asthe Old Commentary expresses it) “adds darkness unto light so that the starsappear, for in the light the stars shine not, but in the darkness light diffusedis not, but only focussed points of radiance.” The symbolism will be obvious toyou though not the full significance.Embracing, fusing and unifying the endeavour of all these groups of Ashrams,stands the living Christ, the Head of all Ashrams and the Master of the Masters,the Mediator between Shamballa and the Hierarchy and between the Hierarchy andHumanity. Will you gain some insight into the all-pervading conditions if Istate that His work of mediating between humanity and the Hierarchy wasperfected by Him and carried to a conclusion when He was last on Earth, and thatHe is now achieving facility in the higher mediatorship which will bring about acloser relation of the Hierarchy with Shamballa at this time. This mediatorywork, based on the blending of the spiritual will (which He has alreadydeveloped) with the universal will (which He is developing), marks for Him agoal which will be consummated when He takes the ninth initiation. These aregreat mysteries and I only indicate them in order to convey to you a sense ofthe synthesis of the whole scheme and a recognition of the urge-to-good whichpervades every aspect of the planetary Life from the smallest atom of substance,through all the intermediate living forms, on and up to the planetary LogosHimself.The will is too often regarded as a power by means of which things are done,activities are instituted and plans worked out. This general definition is theeasiest for men [171] to formulate because it is understood by them in terms oftheir own self-will, the will to individual self-betterment—selfish andmisunderstood at first but tending eventually to selflessness as evolutioncarries out its beneficent task. Then the will is interpreted in terms of thehierarchical plan, and the effort of the individual man becomes that of negatinghis self-will and seeking to merge his will with that of the group, the groupbeing itself an aspect of the hierarchical effort. This is a great step onwardin orientation and will lead to a change in consciousness eventually. This lastsentence is of importance.It is at this stage that most aspirants today find themselves. However, the willis in reality something very different to these expressions of it which exist inthe human consciousness as men attempt to interpret the divine will in terms oftheir present point in evolution. The clue to understanding (the clue which willbe the easiest for you to understand) is to be found in the words “blotting outall form.” When the lure of substance is overcome and desire dies, then theattractive power of the soul becomes dominant and the emphasis for so long laidupon individual form and individual living and activity gives place to groupform and group purpose. Then the attractive power of the Hierarchy and of theAshrams of the Masters supersedes the lower attractions and the lesser focalpoints of interest. When these, in their turn, assume their rightful place inconsciousness then the dynamic “pull” of Shamballa can be felt, entirelyunrelated to form or forms, to a group or groups. Only a group sense of“well-Being,” esoterically understood is realised, for it is comprehended as thewill-to-good. No forms can then hold; no group or Ashram can then confine theconsciousness of the initiate, and all differences of every kind disappear. Thispreamble is given in an effort to clarify your minds before we study Rule IXcare-fully and arrive at its essential meaning.Rule IX.> Let the group know there are no other selves. Let the group know there is no> colour, only light; and then let [172] darkness take the place of light,> hiding all difference, blotting out all form. Then—at the place of tension,> and at that darkest point—let the group see a point of clear cold fire, and in> the fire (right at its very heart) let the One Initiator appear Whose star> shone forth when first the Door was passed.The greatest problem facing aspirants and disciples prior to the thirdinitiation is that of comprehending the nature of identification. This concerns(in the first instance) the relation of the self to the Self and of all selvesto the all-inclusive SELF. It involves the mystery of duality with which theyare occupied, and the very moment that theory as to essential unity becomesdefinite realisation, then the realm of synthesis is entered. For that type ofrealisation, language as we now have it has no words, and it is thereforeimpossible to formulate concepts to interpret the consequent and resultant stateof being. “Identification with” is the phrase which approaches the closest tothe initial idea, and until man has grasped his identical at-one-ness with evenone human being, it is not possible for him even to think about it in any trulyconstructive manner. The complete fusion of the negative and the positiveaspects in marriage, at the moment that life is transmitted and transferred, isthe only tangible though unsatisfactory symbol of this life-sharing processwhich takes place when an individual or a group knows actually and not simplytheoretically that “there are no other selves.”Identification (to use the only word available for our purpose) is connectedwith dynamic life, with conscious enhancement, with completion and with creativesharing, plus process. It is a process of participation—consciously andconstructively undertaken—in the life actions and reactions of the One in Whomwe live and move and have our being; it is related to the network of lifechannels which keep the form aspect of the planetary Logos functioning as a“Divine Representation.” Note that wording. It is connected with the circulationof that “life more abundantly” to which the Christ referred when dealing withthe true nature of His [173] mission. It might be said that as He uttered thisphrase this mission dawned on Him and He made a preliminary effort to serveShamballa, instead of the Hierarchy of which He was even then the Head. Later,He enunciated as best He could the extent of this realisation, in the words sofamiliar to Christians, “I and the Father are One.” This He also attempted toelucidate in the seventeenth chapter of St. John’s Gospel. There is no otherpassage in the literature of the world which has exactly the same quality.Oneness, unity, synthesis and identification exist today as words related toconsciousness and as expressing what is at present unattainable to the mass ofmen. This manifesto or declaration of the Christ constitutes the first attemptto convey reaction to contact with Shamballa, and can be correctly interpretedonly by initiates of some standing and experience. A concept of unity, leadingto cooperation, to impersonality, to group work and to realisation, plus agrowing absorption in the Plan are some of the terms which can be used toexpress soul awareness in relation to the Hierarchy. These reactions to theunited Ashrams which constitute the Hierarchy are steadily increasing and arebeneficently conditioning the consciousness of the leading members of theforefront of the human wave at present in process of evolution.Beyond this state of awareness there lies a state of being which is as farremoved from the consciousness of Members of the Hierarchy as that is, in itsturn, removed from the consciousness of the mass of men. Endeavour to graspthis, even if your brain and your power to formulate thought rejects thepossibility of this exalted livingness. Be not discouraged at this inability tounderstand; remember that this state of being embraces the goal towards whichthe Masters strive, and which the Christ Himself is only now attaining.It is for this reason that the symbolism of light and darkness is used in thewords: Let the group know there is no colour, only light; and then let darknesstake the place of light.Just as the individual has to pass through the stage wherein all “colour” goesout of life as he emerges out of [174] the glamour which conditions the astralplane, so groups in preparation for initiation must go through the samedevastating process. Glamour disappears, and for the first time the group (as isthe case with the individual) walks in the light. As the group thus walks,unitedly its units learn a lesson (one clearly enunciated by modern science)that light and substance are synonymous terms; the true nature of substance as afield and medium of activity becomes clear to the initiate-members of the group.To this H.P.B. referred when he said that the true occultist works entirely inthe field of forces and energies.The next lesson which the group unitedly apprehends is the significance of thewords that “darkness is pure spirit.” This recognition, realisation,apprehensive, comprehensive (call it what you will) is so overwhelming andall-embracing that distinctions and differences disappear. The disciple realisesthat they are only the result of the activity of substance in its form-makingcapacity and are consequently illusion and non-existent, from the angle of thespirit at rest in its own centre. The only realisation left is that of pureBeing Itself.This realisation necessarily comes to the disciple through the means of gradedrevelation and in balanced sequence; each contact with the Initiator leads theinitiate closer to the centre of pure darkness—a darkness which is the veryantithesis of darkness as the non-initiate and the unenlightened understand. Itis a centre or point of such intense brilliance that everything fades out and atthe place of tension, and at that darkest point, let the group see a point ofclear cold fire.It is a tension and a point of attainment that is only possible in groupformation. Even in the earlier initiations, and when the initiate has proved hisright to be initiated, the process is still a group proceeding; it is undergonein the protective presence of initiates of the same standing and unfoldment. Itis their united focus that enables the candidate for initiation to see the pointof clear cold light and their united will that “brings him upright, [175]standing, unafraid, with open eye before the One Who from the very first hasconferred on him the gifts of life and light, and Who now—with lifted rod,surrounded by the fire, reveals to him the significance of life and the purposeof the light.” It is that of which the minds of men know naught, and which eventhe highest intellect is unable to grasp or even sense.In the familiar words (familiar to all esotericists) which are so often said orchanted at moments of highest spiritual aspiration, the neophyte refers to thetime when “we stand where the One Initiator is invoked, when we see His starshine forth.” Two ideas then stand forth: the idea of invocation and of theresult of that invocation, which is the sudden and unexpected shining forth ofthe Star. This star is simply a point of vivid light. This invocation, thoughused as the affirmation of a fixed objective by the aspirant to initiation, isnevertheless a mantram definitely appropriate to the third initiation. It isonly effective in its invocative appeal when used in conjunction with a Word ofPower. This Word of Power is communicated to the candidate (ever an initiate ofthe second degree) by the Christ Who has initiated him in the first twoinitiations but Whose protective aura (in conjunction with the initiate’s Masterand another Master or an adept of the fourth initiation) is required before thestar can shine forth—the focussed light of the One Initiator. For the first timethe expanded consciousness of the initiate can contact Shamballa and the One Whorules there, the Lord of the World. For the first time, the focussed purposewhich brought Sanat Kumara into incarnation makes an impact upon the enlightenedbrain of the initiate, bringing something new and different into his equipment,into his nature and his consciousness. I know not how else to express theseideas. It is a blinding conviction of an unalterable will, carrying all beforeit, oblivious of time and space, aware only of intensity of direction, andcarrying with it two major qualifications or basic recognitions to the initiate:a sense of essential being which obliterates all the actions and reactions oftime and [176] space, and a focussed will-to-good which is so dynamic in itseffect that evil disappears. Evil is after all only an impelling sense ofdifference, leading inevitably to separative action.The dualities are then resolved in synthesis and, again for the first time, theinitiate comprehends the meaning of the ancient words, so inappropriatelytranslated “isolated unity.” To him, in the future, there is no light or dark,no good or evil, no difference or separation. The star that has shone forth,veiling and standing between him and the Lord of the World, the Ancient of Days,is seen as the entrance or doorway and as the admitting agency into somethingother and larger than simply the planetary life. In the earlier two initiations,the Angel of the Presence stood between the disciple-candidate and the Presence.At the later initiations, the Angel of the Presence is the Christ Himself, onewith the soul of the candidate (the individual Angel of the Presence). Throughthe heart of Christ passes the dynamic power of the One Initiator, as a streamof light, stepped down or toned down by the Christ in order that the candidatecan appropriate its potency without risk or danger.After the third initiation, the candidate must face the One Initiator alone,with no protective Individual standing between him and the eternal source ofall-power. The Christ is present, supporting and attentive. He stands directlybehind the initiate so as to arrest and distribute the potency passing throughthe initiate’s body and centres; the candidate is also flanked on either side bya Master. Nevertheless, he faces the Initiator alone and unprotected. Even now,at this much later initiation, he cannot see “eye to eye”—as the phrase goes. Hebecomes aware of a growing point of light which, from a pin-point of intensestbrilliance develops before him into a five-pointed star. At the fourthinitiation, it is not a star which shines forth before him, but a triangle; andwithin that triangle he will perceive an eye regarding him, and for the firsttime he does see the Most High “eye to eye.” At the fifth initiation no [177]symbol or light substance separates or protects him, but he stands before theInitiator face to face, and the freedom of the City of God is his. He is not yeta Member of the Great Council, but he has the right of entrance into Shamballa,and from that point he passes on to a more intimate relation, if that is hischosen destiny. He may not even finally become a Member of the Great Council;that is reserved for relatively few and for Those Who can take even still higherinitiations within the ring-pass-not of our planet—a task of profounddifficulty. There are other and interesting alternatives, as I have elsewheretold you. The initiate may pass out of this planetary life altogether along oneor other of the various Paths by means of which a Master can start upon the Pathof the Higher Evolution and for which all that has transpired in the past willhave prepared Him. Whichever Way He goes, the Master remains a part of thepurpose; He knows forever the secret of the darkness which brings light, and the“inscrutable will of God” is no longer a mystery to Him. He comprehends thedivine idea and can now cooperate with it; He has reached a point of realisationwhich enables Him to fathom what lies behind the Plan for which the Hierarchyhas worked for aeons.Just as the disciple enters the world of meaning and so can interpret events,just as the Hierarchy works in the world of mediation , applying the Plan whichthe world of meaning has revealed, so the higher initiate works consciously inthe world of purpose which the Plan implements, the world of meaning interprets,and the world of events expresses in sequential order and under the evolutionaryLaw.The symbol which expresses the door of evolution is the crescent moon; that ofthe process of evolution—as it affects the material or substantial life of theman—is the waxing and the waning moon—the symbol of growing desire and of thedying out of desire. The symbol of the world of meaning is Light—the light whichshines upon the ways of men, interpreting events and bestowing revelation. The[178] symbol of the world of mediation is the revolving Cross, whilst the symbolof the world of purpose is a twofold one: the five-pointed star and then theradiant heart of the Sun. Remember that when we talk and think in symbols, weare placing something between ourselves and reality—something protective,interpretive and significant, but something nevertheless veiling and hiding.After the fifth initiation all veils are rent and naught stands between theinitiate and Essential Being."},{"pageContent":"RULE TENWe now come to one of the most abstruse and difficult of all the rules forinitiates; yet at the same time it is one of the most practical in applicationand of the greatest usefulness. It concerns the etheric levels of activity. Iwould have you note that I did not say the etheric levels of consciousness, forthere is no such thing as consciousness upon the etheric planes. The four planeswhich constitute the etheric levels of the physical plane are the lowestcorrespondence to the four planes whereon the Monad and the Spiritual Triad areactive, and—as I have oft told you—upon those levels there is no such thing asconsciousness as we understand it. There is only a state of being and ofactivity for which we have no adequate or illustrative words. The four higherplanes of our solar system are the four cosmic etheric planes, and one of thelines of development (confronting the initiate) is to function adequately inresponse to the life of the planetary Logos upon those planes. That, in the lastanalysis, constitutes the main field of unfoldment and of acquired wisdom forall initiates above the third degree.In the above paragraph I have presented you with a new concept re initiation—onethat has always been implicit in the teaching but one entirely and completelyuntouched as yet in any discussions on initiate-training.In the rule as given to applicants, the disciple is cautioned to work withinthose levels according to the methods [179] of the deva or angel evolution. Therule runs as follows:The Army of the Voice, the devas in their serried ranks, work ceaselessly. Letthe disciple apply himself to a consideration of their methods; let him learnthe rules whereby the Army works within the veils of maya.These particular devas in “their serried ranks” are the directive agents of thedivine energy which implements the purposes of Deity upon the physical plane.They work only on etheric levels—either upon our physical plane or on the cosmicetheric levels. They are therefore active in the realm of maya, which is theetheric plane as we usually understand it, or upon the planes of the SpiritualTriad. They are not active on the three gross physical levels or upon the astralor mental planes, nor are they active upon the highest or logoic plane. Therethey are implicit or latent but not active. They are the great “impulsivefactors” in manifestation, organising substance, directing the multiplicity oflives and beings who constitute the forms through which God expresses divinity.In a peculiar sense, they are the embodiment of the divine purpose upon theplanes of the Monad and of the Triad, just as the aggregate of energies in man’setheric body is the result of his inner direction and the cause of his outermanifestation. To understand more fully the function of the deva forces, a manmust arrive at some understanding of the forces in his etheric body which, intheir turn, are the consequence of his point of attainment—an attainmentdemonstrated by his astral (emotional) and mental natures and activities. Theseindicate his point of development.The devas are the agents of the divine will because they are a consequence ofthe point of attainment of our planetary Logos as He exists outside the sevenplanes of our sphere of existence, the cosmic physical plane. They areconditioned by His cosmic astral and mental vehicles. In a definite sense, theyare the agents of the Universal Mind, even though they are not mental as weunderstand that term . They are sometimes regarded as blind forces, but that isonly because they get their inspiration from levels of [180] divine awarenessoutside the range of the human consciousness, no matter how high, or when usedin its widest connotation.Their controlling Agent in manifestation is the Triangle of Energy to which wegive the name the “Three Buddhas of Activity.” They are therefore closelyconnected with the third aspect of divinity. They are essentially the “eyewithin the Triangle”—a most familiar symbol to many today. They are theexpression, in activity, of the “All-Seeing Eye”; through their agency God sees, and through them and the energy directed through them, He directs the creativeprocess. They are under the complete control of the three Buddhas of Activity,Who are the cosmic Prototypes of the Lords of the three major rays, but not inthe sense usually understood when the rays are considered in their relation toman. They are the correspondence of these three rays and are responsible for theentire manifested universe, but only within the orbit of the third aspect, theexpression of the Universal Mind.They come from the cosmic mental plane, just as the energy—distinctive of thesecond aspect—comes from the cosmic astral plane. God is mind. God isintelligent functioning. God is creative activity. These are the qualities ofthe deva evolution . God is love. God is relationship. God is consciousness.These are the three qualities of the Christ evolution . This latter evolution iscarried on within the created sphere of influence of the third aspect. God islife. God is fire. God is pure being. These are the qualities of the spiritaspect, the omnipotent aspect of Deity . All these three aspects focusthemselves and find an outlet for expression upon the levels of the cosmicetheric planes and upon the levels of the etheric planes known to humanity inthe three worlds. The Law of Correspondences is infallible, if rightlyapproached and applied.This broad and general presentation must be rightly grasped if the rule, asgiven to disciples and initiates, is to be correctly understood.You have been taught that illusion is the characteristic [181] which must bemastered by the initiate as he “escapes” occultly from the three worlds via themental plane. (Glamour: A World Problem.) Glamour, you are told, is thecharacteristic of the astral plane, and must be dissipated by the disciple as he“escapes” mystically on to the Path of Initiation, just as the initiate findshimself (after mastering illusion) on the Path of the Higher Evolution. Maya isthe conditioning factor on etheric levels, and must be evaded and overcome bythe probationary disciple as he “escapes” from the thralldom of the physicalplane. Thus he learns to tread the Path of Discipleship. These characteristicsare, however, only the reaction of humanity to the activities of the devaevolution, rightly and divinely proceeding with their task of implementing thedivine will. When the sphere of their activity comes into contact with the humanintelligence, the effect upon humanity (before mastery is gained) is to compelmen “to wander in the fields of maya, to drown in the sea of glamour, and torespond to the pull of illusion.”In this teaching, you have presented to you, though in a somewhat differentform, the ancient problem of duality, involving as it does the immense potencyof the deva evolution. It definitely affects humanity; this is due to the factthat it is an expression of the will aspect of Shamballa. As man develops thewill aspect, he learns to break loose from the aura of the deva evolution, andthe major task of the Hierarchy (as far as basic essentials are concerned) is to“provide sanctuary” to those who have liberated themselves from the ocean ofdeva energies in which their vehicles must perforce move and live and have theirbeing, but with which they have otherwise no point of contact, once liberated bytheir own effort and will “from the angels.” Let us now study Rule Ten.Rule X.> The rules for work within the veils of maya are known and have been used. Let> the group widen all the rents within those veils and thus let in the light.> Let the Army of the Voice be no more heard, and let the brothers onward move> within the Sound. Then let them [182] know the meaning of the O.M. and let> them hear that O.M. as it is sounded forth by Him Who stands and waits at the> very centre of the Council Chamber of the Lord.I would here remind you that we are considering work that the initiate mustaccomplish, and are not considering the usual effort of struggling aspirants todeal with and handle those forces which have worked through into physicalexpression. These, from the levels of the forty-eight subplanes are waiting toprecipitate themselves into the dense physical manifested world. The aspirantmust ever work from the outside to the within and must endeavour to direct hislife from above downwards, if these forces are to be dominated by him and arenot to control him. The initiate, however, works “from within the circle,” thatis the circle or field of maya. His activity must therefore be carried forwardfrom the very heart of the mystery of these forces; this he can do because he isin a position to know the type of energy with which he has to contend, tounderstand the nature of the forces with which he can and must manipulate the“mayavic energies,” and thus to dominate the etheric planes he is also awarewhere one veil ends and another begins, and from what level he can successfullybring the swirling and living energies into conformity with the divine pattern.It should also be noted here that the energies projected by the initiate intothe world of maya are directed by him from the various centres in his own bodyand from the central point of energy in each particular centre employed. It isthe central “jewel in the lotus” from which the initiate works, and these sevencentral focal points, these seven jewels, so-called, are the correspondence ofthe jewel in the egoic lotus. This means, therefore, that successful work“within the veils of maya” involves ever the use of the will aspect and theconscious employment of that quota of the Shamballa force which the initiate isable to appropriate and to use because he has begun to work as a focussing agentof the Spiritual Triad and is no longer working as a [183] soul or as apersonality under soul control. This is an important point to remember.It is along the antahkarana that the force used by the initiate must pour, andaccording to the nature of the work to be done will be the particular strand orthread of the rainbow bridge which the initiate employs. There are four veils ofmaya, constructed necessarily of seven forces, and these produce the factual andphenomenal aspect (in time and space) of the Great Illusion, in its three formsof illusion, glamour and maya . There are seven points of energy through whichdifferent aspects of the force needed to produce the desired effects within theveils of maya can flow, and these correspond to the seven ray types orqualities. But the major type of energy with which the initiate works upon thephysical plane is the seventh, the ray or energy of ritual, of ceremony, oforder and of law. The work done within the veils is one of rearrangement and theordination and coordination of the forces, present as existent maya; this mustprovide, in time and space, the forms through which the plans of the Hierarchycan materialise, the souls of all forms can be subjected to the neededexperience, and so progress towards the fulfillment of the will of God.Maya is not something to be destroyed, dissipated, dissolved or negated. Maya isin reality an aspect of time, and connotes to the initiate the mass of creativeforces with which he must work; these are swept into form generation andactivity, and embody in the transitional, ephemeral, present moment thephenomenal point in evolution reached by the life of God. The work of theinitiate, acting under hierarchical inspiration, is to change the present formsinto the more adequate forms demanded by the descending life and its dynamicactivity. We are therefore dealing with the precipitated aspect of divineevolutionary process. We are concerned with the relation of the Army of theVoice to the SOUND which conditions evolution, and with the supervisory work ofthe Hierarchy as it sustains the work of the [184] soul to be found within allforms—built by the Army of the Voice and by the devas in their serried ranks.The supervisory, directive work of the Hierarchy, carried forward by the Mastersand Their groups and by the initiates within those groups, is seldom considered;it is, however, a work of major importance and is one definitely referred to inthis rule. Fundamentally, the task set before the Hierarchy is to “let in thelight”; but this time not in the sense of revelation, of vision or ofillumination. These latter are all aspects of soul light; the work of theinitiate is to aid in the construction of the planetary body of light—substancewhich will finally reveal the nature of Deity and the glory of the Lord. It isthe planetary correspondence to the light-body through which Christ and all theSons of God Who have reached perfection finally manifest. It is a vehiclecreated by the energy of Will, and it is implemented and “held in being” by theWill. It expresses itself exoterically by the projection of this will energy,via the central point in each of the seven chakras or lotuses.In studying these rules for the initiate, it must ever be remembered that theyconcern primarily the use of the will or first aspect. This is the energy of theMonad, utilised via the Spiritual Triad and related to the personality via theantahkarana. Secondary interpretations and tertiary correspondences are alwayspossible, but the main significance of these rules is related to the firstdivine aspect. You have therefore, as you reflect, think, study and correlate,to bear constantly in mind:> 1. The seven ray types.> 2. The Monad, the Spiritual Triad and the threefold personality; these> constitute another septenate.> 3. The seven groups of Masters.> 4. The seven centres and their seven central points, or jewels.> 5. The four veils of maya.Various other septenates could also be related, but such relationship is notrequired by the initiate who has consciously discarded all these lowerseptenates and works now [185] with the seven major energies, the sevenfoldfield of their activity and the septenary aspect of the implementing instrument,whether planetary or individual.Simplification proceeds rapidly as one nears the goal of the spirit. Will everconcerns itself with the essentials and not with the details of manifestation.Love concerns itself with transitional, evolutionary fundamentals, whilstintelligence concerns itself with the detail and its coherent coordination inresponse to the impulse and attractive force of divine love and the dynamicimpulse of the spirit.Let us now proceed, after these few preliminary remarks, to take this tenth rulesentence by sentence. These are five in number, and the first which we willconsider is:1. The rules for work within the veils of Maya are known and have been used.Students should remember that the work of the Hierarchy is constantlyconditioned by the point in evolution of the human hierarchy. In the early daysof human history, thinking, and progress had practically no place, and thereforelittle or no effect upon the forces and energies which were active upon ethericlevels. At that period, they were left in a relatively quiescent state or elsewere swept into activity by definite and planned impression from the Hierarchy;any effect coming from the human kingdom was due solely to mass impulse orimpression. This was very little, owing to the lack of coordinated relationbetween units and groups within the human family. Later, as family units massedtogether and formed tribes, and then tribe united with tribe to form largertribes or embryonic nations, this mass effect increased, but there was still butlittle thinking or direction connected with it; it was largely instinctiveand—if I might so express it—the etheric plane was in reality more in the natureof a matrix surrounding a valuable creation, and was essentially protective,separating and slightly energising.In Atlantean days, the plane whereon humanity received its major direction orunfoldment was such that the [186] emotional, impulsive nature and the field ofmaturing desire became dominantly active. Then the real difficulty within therealm of maya started. Hitherto only two energies had been felt upon the ethericplane: the energy of life itself, via the sutratma, as it passed through theetheric plane in order to produce exoteric livingness upon the physical plane,and secondly, the energy of the Hierarchy as a whole, producing a slow, broad,though somewhat negative organisation of the prevalent forces. But then a thirdand most potent force, generated by humanity, was beginning to make an impactupon the etheric forces. Men were beginning, at this early period of humanhistory, to desire, and this desire was not, as hitherto, of a purely animalnature and hence an emanation from dense physical substance (and, therefore, notrelated to a principle), but it embodied a new type of energy and was—inreality—man’s first expression of the highest divine aspect. Desire is thelowest reflection within the human consciousness of the will aspect.This potent vibration of desire was evoked by men who were as yet without anyspiritual vision of any kind; they were purely material in their instinctivereactions (and rightly so at that particular time), and these reactionsattracted the attention of certain purely evil energies or Beings. These Beingsavailed themselves of the situation in order to satisfy their desire forpower—again a distortion of the will or first aspect. Thus the Black Lodge wasfounded. It fed upon human desire and resembled a vast overshadowing vampire. Itvitiated human living and increased the growth of desire far beyond normalexpectancy or hierarchical planning, thus creating false goals and standards,building a barrier between the lowest planetary centre, Humanity, and the“middle point” or centre, the Hierarchy. It will be apparent, therefore, thatthe following energies were let loose within the realm of maya:> 1. The instinctive force of animal desire. This was not wrong in itself and is> subject to negation in time, and normally is controlled. [187]> 2. The stream of descending life, and this in two aspects:> a. The life aspect, as it bestows being.> b. The life aspect, as it preserves form.> 3. The steady impact of the attractive power of the soul, implemented by the> Hierarchy and increasing in potency as time elapses.> 4. The impelling power of material desire, focussed in the Black Lodge, both> feeding human desire and drawing a form of life from the massed desire of> humanity.> 5. Human development along astral lines, expressing itself as certain> well-defined energies or force directions:> a. Material desire for possessions.> b. Desire for that which is owned by others. To this the commandment “Thou> shalt not steal” has reference.> c. Personality aims and ambitions; these constitute a form of focussed desire> of a compelling, life-determining nature.> d. Aspiration, leading to vision and to the mystic Way.> e. Purification, the conscious handling of desire upon the Probationary Path.> f. Initiation. The first two initiations are taken, as you know, upon the> astral plane, and bring complete release both from that plane of glamour and> from the realm of maya.All throughout this period, the organisation of the etheric plane has been goingon, subject to the impact of energies and forces as listed above, plus certainother energies (latent or potent) with which we have no immediate concern. Boththe great White Lodge and its opponent, the Black Lodge, increased steadily inpotency. Gradually the forces took organised form and the four “veils of maya”or the seven separating energies became well-defined. When this differentiationwas complete, two great planetary events (if I might call them so) wereconsummated: [188]> 1. The seven centres in the human body (five up the spine and two in the head)> were esoterically “in shape.” The seven lotuses or chakras were functioning,> some powerfully, whilst others remained unawakened. These seven were now> visible to clairvoyant vision.> 2. The seven Ashrams of the Masters in Their seven groups (conditioned by the> seven Rays) appeared, motivated from Shamballa, organised at this time upon> the higher levels of the mental plane, and gradually supplied with personnel> from the ranks of humanity itself, as one by one men achieved initiation.Paralleling this activity and implemented, fed and sustained by the Black Lodge,was the appearance of glamour upon the astral plane, and to this thickeningglamour humanity steadily contributed and responded. Then as evolutionprogressed and the human intellect began to make itself felt, “the four veils ofmaya” and the great “curtain of glamour” began to condition the mental plane.Illusion then appeared, and the distinction between truth and falsehood, betweengood and evil, and between the left hand Path and the Path of Initiation becameapparent to the advanced humanity of the time. These distinctions had alwaysbeen known to the Hierarchy, but now human beings were faced with them andrecognised them: the great potency of intellectual choice confronted humanityand the Aryan race (as that name is correctly used to denote modern intelligenthumanity) came into being.As the ages slipped away, men contributed more and more both to the problem andto the solution of maya, of glamour and of illusion. The potency of humanthought began to make itself felt; men in increasing numbers sought the Path ofLiberation and so passed on into the Hierarchy; they became active andinstructed opponents of the Black Lodge and intelligent wielders of energy as itcan be projected downwards and used to destroy the four veils, to dissipateglamour and to dispel illusion. Humanity responded more and more sensitively toimpacts—both subjective and objective—and their cooperation began to be [189]effective and useful to the Hierarchy, necessitating some changes inhierarchical techniques, releasing hierarchical workers for other and differentactivities, and greatly complicating the problem and menacing the safety and thestatus of the Black Lodge.One of the results of this mental development was the sending of the disciplesout into the world of men; they issued forth in large numbers, and whilstpreserving their conscious link with the Ashram with which they were affiliated,they could be trusted to live among men as men and to bring their potency tobear upon the problem of maya and glamour, doing so from below upwards. Thiswork had to be done by disciples who could stand under pressure, who would, inspite of all difficulties, live nobly and prepare for and take the initiationwhich was for them their next step. Several hundred years ago, only a few couldbe so trusted. Today (1944) there are many in every land, though there are veryfew in Germany, owing to the concentration in that unhappy land of the power ofthe Black Lodge and also to the misuse of the Shamballa force. This force hasbeen isolated and its destructive aspect utilised in Germany, and this has beendone without the paralleling activity of the love energy of the Hierarchy. It isthis fact that has made it impossible (since 1933) for disciples of the WhiteLodge to enter. Elsewhere, however, the concentration of active disciples isgreater than at any other time in human history.I have emphasised this point because our second phrase, “let the group widen allthe rents within those veils,” has reference here to disciples and the groupswhich they have everywhere gathered around themselves. It is these groups, manyin number and differing in ray potency, which will lead the world through thepost-war period into the New Age. It is their pressure upon the physical planewhich has precipitated the crisis between the great White Lodge and the BlackLodge. Their work is to let in the light, and where the light goes the BlackLodge must fade out and disappear. It feeds on glamour and illusion and uses the[190] veils of maya as a protection. Students would do well to avoid naming anddifferentiating the four veils. The veils themselves are transient and variable.They differ as they come under the impact of the seven rays. It is not possibleor practical to distinguish them one from the other, except from the angle ofthe Hierarchy, and their destruction today (though it was not so earlier) has tocome from the dense physical plane, and the attack must be made by personalitiesand individualities dwelling in physical bodies. This is a somewhat new mode ofapproach, for hitherto only a very few disciples and initiates have been able soto work. Today, hundreds and thousands of disciples are working, and thuslearning to use the ancient rules for work within the veils of maya. Let me heregive you some of these rules or formulas as they are to be found in The Masters’Book of Rules and as I can translate them. Some are untranslatable:> 1. Focus the force at the jewel’s point and find the veil that it can touch.> 2. Carry the force from point to point and then project.> 3. Look for the energy in form behind the veil attacked. A rent within the> veil exists. Find it and see.> 4. A path lies through the veils, giving access to the several courts. Walk on> that path, wielding destruction and clearing out the refuse in the court. The> court of the money changers is the last.> 5. Meet the descending forces and find the current which is yours.> 6. Watch for the evil stream of force which seeks to mend the rents. Project> upon that stream the energy of which you know. It led you from the Ashram into> the veils. Use it and drive the evil back unto the astral plane.> 7. Work with the Sound and know it as the source of power. Use first the> Voice; then use the O.M., and later use the Sound. All three together will> suffice.There are other rules, but these will give you the [191] major recognitionsneeded to do this type of work; these are the rules which the adventuringdisciple needs to know. They have been used, and should not be interpreted bythe lower mind, but with the aid of the initiate consciousness.The second phrase runs as follows:2. Let the group widen all the rents within those veils and thus let in thelight.We come now to a definite group injunction or instruction. The aid of the groupis invoked almost in the form of an order. The point of this formulatedinjunction is that in the new era and in the interlude between the past (whereinprominent disciples worked within the veils of maya) and the New Age (whereinhumanity itself will consciously function upon the etheric plane), the work ofthe esoteric groups, under the direction of the New Group of World Servers, isneeded. They will have the capacity to recognise the distinction between thevarious veils. This is the next needed development. The groups must focus theenergy at the very centre of the group being; the group must carry the forcefrom point to point and from veil to veil; the group must project the destroyingenergy and become unitedly aware of what each veil hides; the group must performthe activities (seven in all) of purification; the group must meet, accept anddistribute the descending spiritual energy which will finally consummate thework done. The group—through the use of that descending current—will drive theforces of evil back on to the astral plane and will together work with the threeaspects of the first ray. These are typified by the Voice, the O.M. and theSound.In the above you have in reality a great formula for group activity and also apotent method (once the group can unitedly work together) for the cleansing andthe re-organisation of the forces active in the world today. These forces arenow raging and running wild; their effect is almost tangible (being in ethericsubstance) and factually and visibly present under the control of the BlackLodge. This [192] Lodge uses the voices of lying propaganda, the Word of death(which I shall not give to you for the O.M., the Word of Life, suffices), andthe Sound of the densest aspect in manifestation—the sound of power in themineral kingdom. This constitutes an unparalleled condition and creates a uniqueconcentration of the Forces of Good and the forces of evil upon the ethericplane. The task of all groups which are working under the Masters of the Wisdomis to let in the light, utilising those rents which already exist within theVeils of maya.Three major rents within these Veils might here be noted. They are symbolicallyreferred to in The Bible, though their essential meaning has not been noted orcomprehended.The first major rent was made by the establishment of the Law of God, and thisis portrayed for us symbolically in The Old Testament in the story of Moses. Hewent up into the Mount of God and there received the Ten Commandments. This isthe expression of divine law as adapted for humanity and as needed in theprojection of those forces which will destroy, purify and reorganise. Moses, theLawgiver, penetrated to one of the halls within the Veils of maya, and thereencountered the glory of the Lord. This was of such a radiance that, as the OldCommentary puts it:> “He who entered among the first to penetrate within the veils absorbed the> light and knew not how to pass it on. Neither he nor they were ready, but the> light was there and likewise the two directing eyes. But only one can use,> project and send the light upon its mission. The other must be blinded, and of> this fact the Lawgiver was aware. He therefore veiled the light, assuming> towards this end a fragment of that which he had helped destroy, and so> descended from the mountain top, back to the darkness of the earth.”The second, and much the most important rent, was made by the power of thesecond aspect when the Christ subjected the Master Jesus to the fourthinitiation and Their joint influence was triumphant over death. Then we read[193] that the veil of the Temple was split in twain from the top to the bottom.The lawgiver assisted at the first rending as the climax to the thirdinitiation, and there was a somewhat similar process of glorification. A similarevent took place at the Transfiguration of the Christ, overshadowing or ratherworking through the Master Jesus. But at the triumph over death and through theGreat Renunciation or Crucifixion episode, a great and major rending took place.The Law, when rightly kept and interpreted, defines man’s attitude upon themental plane and serves to make a rent in the etheric veil, separating theetheric vehicle in its fourfold aspect from the dense physical form. The rendingof the second veil at the time of the Crucifixion let in light on to the secondlevel of the etheric plane, and a new type of illumination was spread abroadupon the earth. Law and Love could now penetrate into the consciousness ofhumanity in a new and direct manner, as the brain of man became involved throughthe substance of the etheric counterpart of the physical brain; the instinct toself-preservation (one of the lowest aspects of Law) and the tendency tosensitivity (feeling or emotion, one of the lowest forms of Love) could beexpressed in a more comprehensive manner.Another rending of the veil, and one of relatively minor importance, took placewhen Saul of Tarsus saw the glory of the Lord and was changed into Paul theApostle. His forward moving and potent directness and sincerity, pushing along“the road to Damascus,” forced him to penetrate through one of the separatingveils. The Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it byforce. This force, working in Saul, drove him through the veil which preventedvision, and the rent thereby made brought him a new revelation. He was, we aretold, completely blinded for three days, and this the esoteric recordscorroborate. This is a well-known correspondence to the three days in the tomband one recognised by esotericists; it corresponds also to the penetration intothe third heaven to which Paul testified later in his life. He realised thenature of the Law, as his later epistles demonstrate; he was brought [194] tothe feet of the Initiator through the effect of love, and thus he availedhimself of the two earlier rents in the veil. Whilst thus reaching out to thelight, he wrote that epistle about which so much controversy has raged—TheEpistle to the Hebrews. In it the results of the rending of the third veilprovide the keynote and express the first and highest aspect, as the two earlierrents lead to the revelation of the third and second divine qualities. Thisfirst aspect is seen as synthesis, as the Communion of Saints, and as related tothe Lord of the World, Melchizedek. Read that epistle in the light of theseremarks, and note how a great initiate endeavoured to reveal some facts,inherent in the will or power aspect. These were, however, far beyond the ken ofthe disciples and aspirants of the time, but can today form a true part of therealisation of humanity. Law, Love, Union or Synthesis—all these great energieshave seeped into the human consciousness and now provide the platform upon whichthe new civilisation can be founded, the new approach to God be taken, and newhuman relations be implemented.Three great rents, therefore, now exist, as well as numerous smaller and lessimportant ones, to which no reference has been or need be made. Three great Sonsof God at the moment of initiation made a major contribution to the humanconsciousness through their determined will-to-law, will-to-love andwill-to-synthesis. Mankind was thereby aided to move forward more easily alongthe “lighted Way,” to pass through the halls of maya, aided by the light pouringthrough the rents made in the separating veils by perfected divine Men at thevery moment of Their triumph. A fourth great rent still remains to be made as aresult of the energies released and the gained good which the three earlierrents have made possible. This fourth major rent will be made by humanityitself, standing with “massed intent,” focussed through the groups which areexternalisations of the Ashrams of the Masters. It will therefore be made at thetime that the Hierarchy takes physical shape upon the earth again.[195] Bear in mind the symbolical nature of this teaching. The veils are notactually existing veils in the usual sense of that term. They are in the natureof opposing forces and energies which act as inhibitory factors to the aspirantas he seeks to make progress, and to the entire human family as it moves onwardupon the Path of Evolution. They are not basically related to consciousness atall, for in the majority of cases these veils “lie on the earthward side ofbeing and not upon the side of light”; they are essentially physical forces, andalthough they are the result of man’s own effort and activity down the ages,they are largely unrealised, unseen obstacles to his progress. They constitutethe lowest concentration of forces precipitated from levels of activity otherand higher than the physical, as you understand physical substance. If one mightuse a phrase which, even if true, is misleading, they lie between the subtleinner man, mental and astral, and his physical brain . They are that whichprevents brain registration of the world of causes and of meaning. This innerworld can be emotional or mental in its focus and in its force precipitation onto the etheric plane. It can be the fused result of personality integration andbe a combination of energies; or it can be dominated by the effects of soulenergy. These, if evoked, can penetrate occultly and drive out or break down andthrough the separating veiling forces, thus producing coordination eventuallybetween soul and brain.These veils are as curtains over the windows of vision. They prevent realisationof that which lies beyond the room or area of average or mediocre experience,and they prevent the light from penetrating.The work of the three Sons of God referred to above is not concerned with therending of the veils of their own interior life and forces, thus bringing aboutsoul contact unimpeded and dear, or with the illumination of experience upon thephysical plane. That had long ago been effected in these special and individualcases. Their service was rendered to humanity and They made rents in the veilswhich separated mankind as a whole from the higher spiritual [196] experienceand from registration of the fact of the existence of the Hierarchy. Theirs wasa universal service, and made possible further human progress, for until somegreater measure of light had been let in it was not possible for man to see andgrasp the necessity to destroy the obstacles to light. The veils remainunperceived by the average aspirant until some light appears through the rentsin the “curtain of impediment.”The glory of the Christ and the uniqueness of His accomplishment lies in thefact that He was the first to bring about the rending of the veils from “the topto the bottom.” This He could do because He acted as the World Saviour, outsideand independent of humanity; He was free from the aura of the human familyand—again quoting the Old Commentary , as far as it is possible to translatethese archaic terms:> “From above He worked and from the further side issued the force which tore> its way into the separating forces, driving them in a threefold direction,> from the point which is the highest, to the right and to the left, thus> letting in that streaming force which resolved itself as light, as love, as> lifting energy. Thus worked the One for Whom all men must wait. He is as man,> but works not as a man. He works as light divine, as energy supreme and as the> Saviour of the world of men.”Let me again quote from the same source and give you the ancient names of theveils:> “Next to the earthly plane is found the Veil of Impulsion and then the Hall of> Concentration. To that succeeds the Veil of Distortion, related to the world> of glamour as impulsion is to force. Beyond that veil is found the Hall of> Choice. And then we find another veil, the Veil of Separation, and beyond it> lies the Hall of Blinded Men—blinded by light but facing towards the final> veil, the Veil of Aspiration. Four veils, three halls and many men.”I will leave you to make due application of this paragraph [197] of stated truthand of condensed realisation. I would remind you that concentration is one thingto the aspirant, and a very different thing to the initiate, and that thechoices made by the initiate resemble not those made by the disciple. Theblinding force referred to can range all the way from the deep spiritualdarkness in which the average man moves, through the blindness of which Saul ofTarsus was the exponent, up to that condition which overwhelms the highestInitiate as He awaits entrance into the Council Chamber of the Lord.Blindness is a prelude to initiation of no matter what degree. It is only at thelast and highest initiation that the “tendency to blindness” comes to a completeend. In the early stages of evolution, blindness is natural, innate, unavoidableand impenetrable. For ages man walks in the dark. Then comes the stage whereinthis normal blindness is a protection, but has also entered a phase wherein itcan be overcome. Technically speaking, the blindness to which I have referred issomething different. From the moment when a human being catches the first, faintglimpse of the “something other” and sees himself in juxtaposition to that dimlysensed, distant reality, the blindness with which I have dealt is somethingimposed by the soul upon the hastening aspirant, so that the lessons ofconscious experience, of discipleship, and later of initiation may be correctlyassimilated and expressed; by its means, the hurrying seeker is defended frommaking too rapid and superficial progress. It is depth and a profound“rootedness” (if I may coin such a word) for which the inner Teacher and laterthe Master looks, and “occult blindness,” its need, its wise handling and itsfinal elimination are part of the curriculum imposed upon the candidate. Thistruth is recognised, though not truly interpreted, by the Masonic Fraternity. Inone of the most important and highest initiations, the candidate enters withunblinded eyes and no hoodwink is applied. Then, halfway through the ceremony,he is blinded, and in that condition passes through the terrific tests, symbolicof a certain high stage upon the Path.[198] Blindness is therefore, esoterically speaking, the place of learning andis related to the eye, throat and heart doctrine. It is not related to the dimvision, the sensing of half truths and the gropings of the aspirant in theprocess of learning about himself, or as he visions the goal and seeks to walkthe Path. That is a familiar condition and one to which all beginners aresubjected and which they cannot avoid for it is inherent in their natures.Occult blindness is spiritually induced and “blacks out” the glory and thepromised attainment and reward. The disciple is thrown back upon himself. All hecan see is his problem, his tiny field of experience, and his—to him—feeble andlimited equipment. It is to this stage that the prophet Isaiah refers when hespeaks of giving to the struggling aspirant “the treasures of darkness.” Thebeauty of the immediate, the glory of the present opportunity and the need tofocus upon the task and service of the moment are the rewards of moving forwardinto the apparently impenetrable darkness. For the initiate, this blindness isstill more esoteric; there remains for him absolutely no light whatsoever—noearth light nor any light within the three worlds at all. There is onlyblackness. To this the mystic has given the name “the dark night of the soul.”The true dark night (of which the mystic’s dark night is only a dim reflection,to speak paradoxically) marks a very exalted state of Being and stage ofdevelopment. It was into the blackness and darkness that Christ penetrated as Heovershadowed one of His Masters, the Master Jesus upon the Cross. This willstrike a new note for many, and can only now be revealed. It is concerned withthe facility with which a Master participates in the experience, subjectivelyrealised, of the disciples whom He has prepared for initiation. It relates alsoto the still higher identification of the Christ with those initiates who aretaking the fourth and fifth initiations, such as the Master Jesus in theexperience referred to above. Christ is no longer the Initiator, but stands tothe initiate as the Master does to the disciple. It is a curious phase of“identical participation,” which evokes no reaction from the Master or the [199]Master of the Masters, the Christ, except in so far as it enables the divineParticipator Himself to face another area of darkness, veiling and hiding astill more supernal glory. The above paragraph is far beyond the comprehensionof the average student, but will be comprehended by those whose eyes are open tobe blinded.Students must remember that the four veils upon the etheric plane are only thelower symbolic correspondences to certain great areas of divine expression, andthat ever the glory must be approached through the darkness. Such is the Law.These higher veiling factors can be mentioned and enumerated, but moreinformation concerning these mysteries, this separating darkness encountered bythe initiate, may not be given:> VEIL I. That which faces the disciple as he wrestles with the Dweller on the> Threshold and becomes conscious of the Angel of the Presence, though as yet he> sees Him not.> VEIL II. That which the initiate encounters at the fourth initiation and which> forces him to cry out in his blindness: “My God, my God, why hast Thou> forsaken me.” The words uttered by the Christ at that time, and as the> Participator, have been forgotten by the orthodox, though preserved by the> esotericist. To them H.P.B. refers in The Secret Doctrine .> VEIL III. That mysterious blindness which overwhelms the initiate when—as the> Embodiment of all the forces of the Spiritual Triad—He faces the Monad and is> impelled forward by the “devastating Will” of the first aspect. Of this I may> not write. It concerns the sixth and seventh initiations.> VEIL IV. That “unknown impenetrable Void, the utter darkness of negation”> which Those Who are in the Council Chamber of the Lord of the World and Who> are focussed in Shamballa face when the time comes for Them to “negate” our> planetary life-expression and experience altogether. They must then leave> behind all the seven planes of spiritual and human experience [200] and pass> onward and out into phases of Life and being for which we have no words, and> of which we have no conception. They leave through the fourth veil on the> cosmic physical etheric levels (on the highest plane of our seven planes) and> pass on to the cosmic astral plane. There They negate its existence as They> have earlier negated the existence of the astral plane, so familiar an> illusion to all of us. The initiate passes on to the cosmic astral plane and> finds—What? Who knows? I do not.Thus the veils serve their purpose; blindness nurtures and protects, provided itis innate and natural, soul-imposed or spiritually engendered. If it iswillfully self-induced, if it provides an alibi for grasped knowledge, if it isassumed in order to avoid responsibility, then sin enters in and difficultyensues. From this may all of you be protected.Step by step, the Brothers of the Light and others who tread consciously theLighted Way have removed Themselves from the lure of form; the Army of the Voiceno longer can succeed in deflecting Their footsteps and the veils of illusion nolonger block Their vision and Their moving forward. A relative freedom has beengained and the initiate stands free from much that has hitherto hindered hisprogress; the world of form, of glamour and of seduction has for him no furtherappeal. He comprehends the significance of the injunction which is embodied inthe third phrase of this tenth rule:3. Let the Army of the Voice be no more heard, and let the brothers onward movewithin the Sound.Putting the idea into esoteric terms, the above sentence could be paraphrased asfollows: The voices and the Voice fade out. The A.U.M. is replaced by the O.M.and at the centre of that O.M. the brother stands.The many voices of the world, the flesh and the devil are no longerdistinguished; there is nothing within the consciousness of the initiate whichcan respond to them. The Voice of the Silence dies out also and the Word itself[201] cannot be heard. Only the SOUND remains. This is the Sound whichreverberates in the formless worlds; it is the Sound to which the SpiritualTriad responds and of which the initiate is a part, because the Sound which hemakes as he proceeds upon his creative way is a part of the universal Sound. Itshould be pointed out that He Who stands at the very centre of the CouncilChamber of Shamballa sounds forth all words, the Word, and He also utters theSOUND. This is apt to be forgotten. He it is Who intones the A.U.M. and allthings come to be; He it is Who voices the Word, the O.M., and God incarnate inhumanity appears on earth: He it is Who utters the SOUND, and upon that outgoingBreath holds all things in life; and—in the rise and fall of its cadences—thereis found the cyclic rhythm of the creative process. He it will be Who willwithdraw the Sound and centering the vibration within Himself, will some daybring to a close this periodic manifestation and carry the Sound to otherlocalities in space, holding it in quiescence on the withdrawn breath until alater cycle of expression dawns. Then it will again be exhaled and sent forth toprovide a new field of experience for the Lives which, in cyclic rhythm, againseek to manifest. The entire story of incarnation is hidden in the understandingof the SOUND and its differentiation into the O.M. and the A.U.M.When we can identify the Sound and are no longer “moved” by the O.M., then theinitiate becomes a Christ in expression and makes His appearance, either inphysical form or upon the planes of what to us might be called the “areas ofnon-appearance.” He can then contain and utilise the energies of which theSpiritual Triad is the custodian and which are the expression of the will andpurpose of God. Though the initiate may not be a part of the planetarygovernment, and though he may not be a member of the Council at Shamballa (foronly a limited number of initiates are so placed), he nevertheless has the rightto move on identical levels and to prepare himself for those higher evolutionaryprocesses which will give him entrance to the cosmic astral plane. This willenable him to “see through” [202] and to recognise “cosmic glamour,” and willgive him the hidden key to the world of feeling and of sentiency of which ourfeeling-response and our emotional and intuitional sensitivity are but the dimand distorted reflections. This is a factor of some importance to have in mindif a right sense of proportion is to be developed. The initiate has learnt onearth that the astral plane is in fact non-existent—at least for those of thehigher degrees of initiation. This knowledge constitutes the first step towardsthe comprehension of the secret of negation, towards a true understanding of thebasis of the ever-existent pairs of opposites, and towards the knowledge whichlies behind the significance of negation. The above sentence is in allprobability of little meaning to you, but it nevertheless contains a truth forwhich the trials, experiences and initiations of planetary existence prepare theinitiate. They endow him with those qualities which will enable him to contactcosmic evil and yet remain untouched, eventually to play his part in bringingthe Black Lodge and its Brotherhood to an unholy finish. The roots of the BlackLodge are on the cosmic astral plane, as the roots of the White Lodge and itsBrotherhood are on the cosmic mental plane; this is, in reality, only for thetime being and in order to see certain organised activities upon the star Siriusperfected and carried to a consummation. This has oft been hinted in mywritings.“The Way of the Higher Evolution” leads to the cosmic astral plane, and the goalwhich carries a man there is the transcendent vision accorded at some of thehigher initiations; the quality which enables him to work as a creative factorin the great White Lodge is the developed buddhic faculty. It is upon the “wingsof Sound” that he travels, to use a well-known though little understoodmetaphor. This can only be when he can4. Hear the O.M. as it is sounded forth by Him Who stands and waits at the verycentre of the Council Chamber of the Lord.[203] These are grave and solemn thoughts, and of small use to the averagereader. It is essential, however, that he avoid the concept that the attainmentof the highest initiation upon this planet marks the end or the consummation ofa great and final stage. It only marks the beginning of significance. This is astatement of esoteric value. Just as the attainment of physical control sets theneophyte free for the learning of higher lessons in preparation for the majorinitiations, so the surmounting of the conditions presented by the seven planesof our planetary life sets the initiate (such as the Buddha or the Christ) freefor still higher and more important conditioning circumstances. Their real workas Members of the White Brotherhood is on the point of beginning, and the truepurpose of the existence of the Great White Lodge begins faintly to dawn uponTheir entranced and amazed understanding. It is of real value to us, therefore,to endeavour to grasp the continuity of revelation and the vast future or vistaof unfolding wonder which, stage by stage, grade by grade and plane by plane,unfolds before the initiate-consciousness.We enter here into a consideration of realms of advancement of which evenadvanced humanity has no faintest idea; we are touching upon goals andobjectives which confront the advanced Members of the Hierarchy; we are dealingwith ideas and concepts for which we have no adequate terminology and which areof such a nature that the human mechanism of thought proves incapable ofregistering them. What, for instance, do the words or phrases, “Divine purpose,Shamballa, the Lord of the World, states of registration or awareness which haveno relation to sentiency as it expresses itself through consciousness, the Lodgeon Sirius” and similar concepts convey to you? I would venture to suggest thatin reality, they represent nothing, and this because the goal of all who readthese words is contact with the soul, recognition of and by the Hierarchy, andinitiation. If I say to you that the words “the O.M., as it is sounded forth byHim Who stands within the confines of Shamballa” signify that the one Sound,rounded and full, [204] of O is sounded forth, but that the concluding sound ofthe M is omitted, does that convey aught to your intelligence? Again I ventureto say that it does not. It is therefore of small importance for me to enlargeupon this phase of the Rules. I would be more profitably employed if Ielucidated somewhat the meaning of the words “the Council Chamber of the Lord.”Three concepts have perchance taken shape in your minds in connection withShamballa, if you have sought the true esoteric attitude:> 1. That Humanity exists as a great centre of intelligent energy in the> substance of the planetary Life.> 2. That the spiritual centre, where attractive, coherent, magnetic energy is> focussed and from whence it flows in two directions> > a. Towards the three worlds and the four kingdoms of nature,> > b. Towards Shamballa and the two higher kingdoms in manifestation> is what we usually call the Hierarchy, the Kingdom of God, the centre of love> and of mediating understanding (note these last two words).> 3. That there is another centre which is neither spiritual nor human but which> is characterised by divinity. Divinity is the expression of the will or> purpose of the One in Whom we live and move and have our being. That centre> where the will of God is focussed and dynamically sent forth to carry out the> purpose is Shamballa.The time has now come when a distinction must be made by esotericists betweenthe words “spiritual” and “divine.” They are not the same, nor do they have thesame significance. The quality of spirituality is Love. The quality of divinityis Will. There is a definite distinction between the two and the mediatingprinciple (or that which relates or unites the two qualities) is Wisdom. Of thatWisdom the Buddha was the expression in time and space; that means that therewas only a relative and limited manifestation of that fusing linking principle.His great achievement, unrealised [205] by Him, was an innate and (at that time,not now) unconscious recognition of the distinction between love and will, andan ability to express in Himself a fusing, blending energy which could and didbring together love and will, soul and Monad. At the same time (and later infull expression in Palestine) the Christ demonstrated—for the teaching ofhumanity—the at-one-ment of love and intelligence, of soul and personality.These are points of real importance to have in mind.Embodying, therefore, divinity in a sense and form incomprehensible todisciples, and which constitutes the goal of such advanced individuals as theChrist, are a group of Lives or focussed integrated Beings Who stand aroundSanat Kumara, the Lord of the World.As I have earlier said, Sanat Kumara is to the Planetary Logos what thepersonality, plus soul, is to the disciple. He is also the coherent force withinthe planet, holding, through His radiatory influence, all forms and allsubstances in the planetary form so that they constitute one coherent, energisedand functioning whole. A parallel to this, though on a much smaller scale, canbe seen in the radiatory influence of the Christ as it permeates, energises andholds in coherent expression the Christian Church in all its many aspects in theworld; a still smaller analogy can be seen in the influence wielded by adisciple who stands at the centre of a group and holds it also in coherent anduseful manifestation. Intermediate between these two symbols of will and love,united in manifestation (the Christ and a disciple), is the work of a worlddisciple, for the influence is wider and more far-reaching than that of adisciple, yet not as potent or comprehensive as that of the Christ.Coherency, affecting lives, forms and substances, is an expression of will andpurpose, motivated by love and implemented intelligently in carrying forward theplans through which the Purpose seeks expression. When, however, you arrive atthe potency of such a Being as Sanat Kumara, you find His individual potencyenhanced and [206] amplified by the fused ability of a group of Lives Who—thoughnot as far advanced as He is upon the Path of Evolution which stretches beforethe Planetary Logoi—are yet greatly in advance of the most developed members ofthe spiritual Hierarchy. It is these Lives Who constitute the innermost circleof the Council Chamber of the Lord of the World. Their normal contacts areextra-planetary and are very seldom of a planetary nature. They are in directrapport with the Planetary Logos upon His own high plane, the cosmic mentalplane; this great and Unknown Being uses Sanat Kumara as the soul uses atemporary personality when that personality is at an advanced stage of initiateconsciousness. This is only a parallel and an analogy and must not be undulyelaborated in the detail of relationship.The major characteristic of these Lives is Will or Purpose. They embody andconsciously know and intelligently appreciate what is the motivating idea whichthe Planetary Logos—working consciously on His own high level—seeks to work outand achieve in His planned incarnation through a planet. He functions when inincarnation on the cosmic physical plane, and embodies the seven principles ofwhich we know, and all is focussed in and through the Individuality of SanatKumara, implemented and energised through the seven planetary centres. The threeBuddhas of Activity (Who are also Members of the Great Council) are expressionsof the counterparts on cosmic levels of the energies latent in the threepermanent atoms in the three worlds of human endeavour. This is again adangerous parallel to propose for—as a symbol—it lacks any true analogy.The Seven Spirits before the Throne of God are also Members of the Council, andeach of Them is in close rapport and contact with one or other of the sevensacred planets in our solar system, and can thus draw upon the energies whichthey embody.It will therefore be apparent to you inferentially, how comparatively few of theMembers of our Hierarchy have yet been able to reach the state or condition ofdevelopment which would warrant Their forming a part of the [207] great Council,or which would enable them to respond to the O, sounded out at intervals of onehundred years by Sanat Kumara. It is this sound which gathers together theresponsive Units into the Council. This Council is held at one hundred yearintervals, and as far as our modern humanity is concerned, these Councils havebeen held—under our arbitrary dates—in 1725, 1825, 1925.At these Councils, Those Who are responsible for the planetary development,along certain predetermined lines, make Their reports; decision is made as tonew unfoldments; certain types of energy, cosmic and solar, are made availablefor the carrying forward of the Plans which implement the Purpose; the evolutionof consciousness in the three worlds receives, necessarily, major attention.I would have you remember that this refers not only to the human kingdom and itsunfoldment, but to the three subhuman kingdoms also which are—from many pointsof view—of equal importance to the human. This is a hard saying for humanity toaccept.It is these great goals which slowly dawn on the consciousness of the initiateas he advances step by step along the Path of Initiation. They must perforce benoted here, even if dealing with matters incomprehensible to the reader;initiation otherwise would be apt to be regarded as the attainment of arelatively static condition and would land the initiate in an eternal impasse orimpassable cul-de-sac. Initiation is in fact the recognition of the goals whichare implemented from Shamballa. It is not a process whereby a man becomes solelya Member of the Spiritual Hierarchy. Initiation (as the candidate understandsit) is in reality only incidental and preparatory to the Path of the HigherEvolution.There is little more that I can tell you anent this Rule. The subject is, as youcan see, too advanced even for the initiate who, in a few decades, will read andstudy these instructions. That your vision may expand, and your power to thinkand reflect abstractly may grow, is my hope and wish for you.RULE ELEVEN[208] I would like to speak, at this point in our discussion of the fourteenrules for initiates, upon the theme of group initiation; these rules are thoseto which groups that are seeking, in unison, a group expansion of consciousness,must learn to conform. It is for this reason that I have hitherto omitted to gointo detail in relating these rules to the seven centres or, specifically, tothe great seven solar initiations. Of these seven initiations only five concernaverage humanity. The remaining two initiations concern only those who arewilling to meet certain unusual requirements and to produce that special effortwhich entitles them to the appellation, “Victors, through the clear pure will.”Group initiation is no easy achievement, particularly as it is practically anuntried experiment and constitutes essentially a pioneering effort. That such adevelopment was inevitable, if the evolutionary growth of humanity proved in anyway satisfactory, was early realised by the Hierarchy. However, it has takenmillenia of years to make it seem—as an hypothetical effort—in any way possible,and only tentative experiments have as yet been attempted. The first objectiveof these experiments (going on quietly in various places all over the world) isto see if a group of disciples can work together in such a manner that an innerfusion can be seen—by the Masters—to be taking place. The results, hitherto,have not been encouraging. It has, for one thing, been difficult to finddisciples who are approximately at the same point in evolution, whose rays are“shining through” adequately, and who can evidence some one quality, or somecontrolling theme (if I may use such a phrase) which they share in unison andwhich would suffice to hold them together and prove strong enough to offsetpersonality differences, preferences and barriers. It has not been possible, asyet, to do this. Group after group has been tried and tested out by differentMasters in various parts of the world, and hitherto all such attempts haveproved failures. When I use the word “failure” I mean failure from [209] theangle of the planned objective. From the angle of the individual growth of anyparticular disciple there has not necessarily been failure; from the angle ofthe unwitting, general public, the publication of Discipleship in the New Agewill prove in years to come an epochal success.It might be of value to consider briefly what group initiation involves, and todo this factually and not sentimentally and aspirationally.One of the problems confronting the Hierarchy in this connection is theelimination of sentiment—that curious, emotional reaction and relationship whichlinks all the members of a group together in the bonds of liking or disliking.Where there is liking, then too strong a personality relation is established, asfar as the good of the group is concerned. The group equilibrium is disturbed.Where there is disliking, the inner faculty of rebuff works constantly, andcleavages then occur. Is it not true, my brothers, that your relation to eachother is frequently subjected to the impact of approval or of disapproval? Whenthat attitude exists, the first steps towards group fusion are absent. This iswhat we mean by sentiment, and this emotional reaction must disappear as apreliminary stage. I speak not at this time anent impersonality. For somepeople, impersonality is simply an escape mechanism from responsibility; forothers, it connotes suppression and entails such hard labour that the entiretime of the disciple is given to the achievement of impersonality, therebyguaranteeing non-success. That at which you strenuously strive and which assumesundue place in your thinking, in due time becomes itself a prison and meritslater destruction. Such is the occult law. Impersonality is possible only to thedisciple who knows truly how to love, and to him who sees life and itsphantasmagoria (including all associated persons) in the light of the SpiritualTriad.It is to this that Rule XI primarily refers, and it will not be possible for youto comprehend the significance of this rule unless there is a measure of clarityin your minds anent true group relationships. Such relationships are not [210]based upon personality or impersonality, or upon liking or disliking, or oncriticism or non-criticism, but upon a real comprehension of “divineindifference,” spiritual detachment and deep, persistent, unchanging love. Tomany earnest aspirants the juxtaposition of these phrases will seem paradoxical;but an understanding of the occult paradoxes tends to liberation. In thecomprehension of these basic attitudes lies the first lesson of the aspirant toparticipation in group initiation.The second point which the group thus striving has to grasp is the necessity forthe utilisation of the force of destruction.A group is brought together under karmic law, ashramic necessity and souldirection. Immediately there is presented to the watching Masters an opportunityfor the very definite training of some willing aspirants, but also an equallydefinite point of tension, indicating real difficulty. There is little, inreality, to link these people except inclination, a joint aspiration and a goalseen and held in unison. The outstanding characteristic of such a group isspiritual selfishness. This statement may surprise you until a close scrutiny ofyour own heart is undergone, and then I venture to predict that you willdiscover that it is not divine love of humanity that has enabled you to findyour way into the outer group of some Ashram but desire for development, forachievement and for liberation. The first step, therefore, is to recognise thisand hence the injunction so oft misunderstood: Kill out desire. This has to bethe first destructive activity of the disciple. It is not what the discipleseeks, or wants or desires which should condition him and drive him to what wemight call “ashramic acquiescence,” but the all-impelling motive of world need.So the disciple begins to rid himself of desire by a process of attrition. Hedoes not positively fight desire with a view to its elimination; he does notseek to transmute it (as should the probationary disciple), but he ceases togive it any recognition; he fails to provide it with the needed stimulation ofattention, for as ever, energy follows thought; he is preoccupied [211] withworld need and with the service he can render, and—almost inadvertently, as itwere—desire dies of attrition.It will be apparent to you, therefore, that it will take time for all themembers of a group to achieve the destruction of individual desire, and thatuntil some measure of this united liberating process is attained, the groupcannot go forward together as a unit on the Way of Initiation.The next step is the destruction of the ties which link the personalities of thegroup members. These must be severed, and the relation between the group membersmust be on the basis of soul activity, joint pledge to the Master of the Ashram,and a united service given to humanity. There comes a point of freedom in thegroup relation which will demonstrate in some definitely planned and unitedactivity, carried forward in the outer world but enriching the life of theAshram. Until this stage is reached, the activity of the group corresponds tothat of the probationary disciple and not to that of the pledged disciple. Thespontaneously emerging group work, engendered by the group consciousness andfusing the entire group of disciples at a point of tension in service, is thefirst indication that the group is ready for further teaching, for anintensification of its group potency and for a closer relation to the Master.This has all been brought about by the group itself, independently of anyinjunction of the Master, and as a result of the united soul life of the groupeffectively making its presence felt. These two spiritually destructiveprocesses—the destruction of desire and the severing of all personality ties—arethe first two and essential results of true group work.The third quality which must be utterly rooted out and destroyed is that of allreaction towards recognition, whether that recognition is accorded by the worldof men, by other disciples, or by the Master. The ability to work without anytoken of recognition, to see others claim the reward of action taken, and evento be unaware that the results of the good initiated by the individual discipleor [212] his group are claimed by others, are the hallmarks of the hierarchicalworker. The Masters get no recognition for the work done by Their disciples,though They initiated the original impulse and have given both guidance anddirection; the disciple carries out the Plan; he shoulders the responsibility;he pays the price, either good or bad, or the karmic results of institutedactivity, and he is the one who gains the recognition of the crowd. But—untilthe disciple seeks no recognition, until he fails to think in terms of resultsand is unaware of the reaction of the world to his work as an individualdisciple—he has yet far to go in order to gain the higher initiations. Theentire problem becomes increasingly difficult when an entire ashramic group isconcerned, for the recognition of the group service seems little to ask from theworld which is served; nevertheless, such a demand and such an expectation delaythe complete absorption of the group into the inner Ashram.These are not, however, impossible objectives, or I would not waste your time ormine in their delineation. The group can measure up to the occult necessity ifunitedly they recognise the scope of the endeavour and unitedly strive forcomplete absorption in service—an absorption so deep that it excludes all otherrecognitions, particularly those of a personal nature. We come back, therefore(as is continually the case), to the fact that when a group can arrive at asuitable point of united tension, non-essential reactions disappear andundesirable qualities are automatically removed.These three types of work along the lines of destruction merit your carefulconsideration and—because they are along the line of the destroying aspect—itwill be apparent to you that the method employed is that of the utilisation ofthe group Will. It will be equally apparent that the group Will can only makeits appearance under the Law of Occult Continuity when, and if, the group isfunctioning intelligently and demonstrating love adequately.We now come to the third factor which group initiation involves. This isdiversity in unity, consciously recognised [213] and utilised. A group is notcomposed of disciples all of whom are being prepared for the same initiation.This is oft a hard saying for group members to accept. The significance of myearlier statement, that a group is composed of men and women all of whom are atthe same point in evolution, is a generalisation and simply means that all ofthem have reached the point where they are pledged and unalterably committed tothe work of the Ashram, under some particular Master.The work, however, requires a diversity of quality and of potencies in order tobe effective in manifestation upon the outer plane. It needs those who are inclose contact with the Master, and are therefore initiates of a certainstanding; it needs also those who have facility of relationship with the innerAshram and are therefore senior disciples, though not necessarily highinitiates; it needs also those not so advanced upon the Path of Discipleshipbecause they have, or can establish, a close connection with ordinary humanityin the life of everyday. A group of disciples such as this is consequently aminiature hierarchy, and a hierarchy exists in its various degrees in order topermit of a wide range of effective relationships. Ponder on this statement. Youcan see now why there is necessity for the elimination of personality reactions,for only thus could the groups function as a coordinated unit with the variousmembers recognising each other’s status and yet not moved to jealousy orbelittlement thereby; the work is then carried forward on the basis ofinspiration, coordination and practical application. The senior members of thegroup, and those with the most advanced status (whatever that may be), providethe incentive of the Plan as they receive it from the Master; the moreexperienced among the disciples then coordinate the Plan within the group,relating it to the Ashram and indicating its approach to the world of men; theneophytes—pledged and dedicated though yet without experience—carry out the Planupon the physical plane. This entails, as you can see, smooth and effectivecoordination, a proper attention to the general picture, and an application ofthe detail of [214] work to the immediate necessity. It is a hard task for agroup of intensely individualistic disciples (and all disciples are individual)to begin to take the first steps towards these attitudes and the relationshipswhich distinguish the Hierarchy as a whole.Still another important factor in the group preparation for initiation is thecultivation of silence. How, we ask ourselves at times when the functioning ofthe Ashram is under discussion, can we train our disciples to realise that,essentially, silence is not refraining from speech. So many disciples seem tothink that it is, and that they have to learn not to talk if they hope to takeinitiation. Some would do a great deal better if they talked more than theydo—along right lines. The silence imposed in an Ashram is refraining fromcertain lines of thought, the elimination of reverie and the unwholesome use ofthe creative imagination. Speech is consequently controlled at its source,because speech is the result of certain inner sources of ideas, of thought andof imagination; it is the precipitation (at a certain point of saturation, if Imight so express it) of inner reservoirs which overflow on to the physicalplane. The retention of speech and the suppression of words, if they are theresult of a realisation that what is to be said is wrong, or undesirable, orunwise, or wasteful, of energy will simply increase the inner banking up andwill lead eventually to a still more violent display of words at a later date;it may also bring about serious and disastrous conditions within the astral bodyof the disciple. The silence of thought is to be cultivated and, my brothers, Ido not mean silent thinking. I mean that certain lines of thought are refusedadmission; certain habits of thinking are eradicated and certain approaches toideas are not developed. This is done by a process of substitution, and not by aviolent process of suppression. The initiate learns to keep his thoughtapparatus in a certain effective condition. His thoughts do not intermingle theone with the other, but are contained (if I may thus pictorially word it) inseparate compartments or carefully filed for reference and later use. There arecertain [215] layers of thought (again speaking symbolically) which are heldwithin the Ashram itself and are never permitted to enter the mind of thedisciple or the initiate when not consciously working in the Ashram; others arerelated to the group and its work and are given free play within the groupring-pass-not; still others are of a more mundane nature and govern the dailylife and relationships of the disciple with personalities and with the affairsof civilised living and physical plane events. These are only indications ofwhat I mean, but will suffice to show (if you duly meditate) a little of what ismeant by the silence of the initiate. Within the permitted levels of contact,speech is free and unimpeded; outside those levels, no indication is given thatthe other spheres of thought activity, with their conditioning speech, evenexist. Such is the silence of the initiated disciple.We have therefore considered briefly but suggestively four qualities which agroup preparing for initiation needs to develop, to consider and unitedly toachieve. They are:> 1. The achieving of a non-sentimental group interrelation.> 2. Learning how to use the forces of destruction constructively.> 3. Attaining the power to work as a miniature Hierarchy, and as a group to> exemplify unity in diversity.> 4. Cultivating the potency of occult silence.We now come, after these preliminary remarks, to a consideration of the nextrule.Rule XI.> Let the group together move the fire within the Jewel in the Lotus into the> Triad and let them find the Word which will carry out that task. Let them> destroy by their dynamic Will that which has been created at the midway point.> When the point of tension is reached by the brothers at the fourth great cycle> of attainment, then will this work be done.On first reading this rule it is obvious that it concerns the fourth initiationand the consequent destruction of the [216] causal body—the vehicle through themeans of which the Monad has created first of all the personality, and then aninstrument for the expression of the second divine aspect. We are thereforedealing with one of the major initiations. I would here call to yourrecollection the fact that (from the angle of the Hierarchy) this initiation isthe second major initiation, and not the fourth, as it is regarded from thehuman angle; the third initiation is technically regarded as the first majorinitiation. The major initiations are really possible only after thetransfiguration of the personality.What, therefore, brings about the destruction of the soul body? The destroyingagent is the second aspect of the Will. The third or lowest aspect of the Will,working through the mind or the manasic principle, was the sustaining factor inthe long cycle of personality development; it was the principle of intelligentsynthesis, holding the life principle intact and individualised through the longseries of successive incarnations. During that cycle the will demonstrated firstas the lower man; then it focussed itself in the Son of Mind, the divineAgnishvatta, the soul, and became increasingly a factor of potency. Later, asthe disciple builds the antahkarana and thus establishes a direct channel ofcommunication between the Monad and the personality, the lower mind becomesfused with the abstract mind or higher mind (the manasic principle, sublimatedand purified), and gradually the soul is—to use a peculiar but sensitivelyexpressing word—by-passed . It has by now served its purpose. Love and light arein expression in the physical plane life. Neither the personality vehicle northe soul body is required, as under the old conditions. Their place can now betaken by the Spiritual Triad and the Monad; the essential life of both the loweraspects (creative in nature and expressive of loving intent as to purpose) cannow be withdrawn. Triplicity, from the angle of the three periodicalvehicles—Monad, soul and personality—is resolved into duality, and the Monad(reflected in the Triad) can now work upon the lower planes through the mediumof a definitely created personality or “point of tension” in the [217] threeworlds. It is to this that the rule applies when studied in terms of theindividual initiate, whilst the life in which the soul is “by-passed” and itsring-pass-not is destroyed, is of such profound difficulty that it is called thelife of crucifixion or of renunciation.We are, however, concerned with the interpretation of the rule as it affects agroup which is preparing for the joint initiation of its members. It is byadhering to the ancient dictum that “as it is with the Macrocosm so will it bewith the microcosm,” and by the application, therefore, of the Law of Analogy,that we shall eventually arrive at understanding. I cannot hope to do more thanindicate significances, but it will now be clear to you why I have dealt withthe four qualities which a group must develop in unison prior to initiation. Weshall find it useful to relate these qualities to the various phrases orinjunctions in this Rule XI. We must consider each of them separately. Let usnow look at the first sentence.1. Let the group together move the fire within the Jewel in the Lotus into theTriad.Let me first remind you that fire always connotes the first aspect and this, asyou know, is the life aspect. To this let me add the well-known fact that “OurGod is a consuming fire,” and call to your recollection that the first aspect isthe destroyer aspect. You have immediately established a relation between thefirst two qualities with which we have been dealing and the work of thecrucifixion as a symbolic expression of the fourth initiation. The achieving ofa selfless and impersonal group interrelation was the first prerequisite, andthe word “together” in this rule deals with the work of the group when—as aclosely knit unit—it can move forward. This transference of the life or of thefire has to be the result of united action, taken by the group when fullinterior unity has been attained. It cannot take place prior to this, any morethan an individual initiate can take this particular initiation until such timeas complete fusion of the three bodies and the soul has been effectually [218]brought about and divine indifference has been achieved to all lower reactionsof the component parts of the fused and interrelated instrument. So must it bewith the group.The group life must express itself upon the physical plane and in groupformation. It will possess a sensitive feeling apparatus, corresponding to theastral body, and the group mind will be well organised and functioningrhythmically. Thus the group “personality” will be active, but divinely active,by the time this particular stage is reached. The group soul will also be infull flower as an expression of the inner Ashram, and at the very heart of thegroup life, veiled and hidden by its outer personality expression and by itsvibrant loving soul, will be a point of living fire or life which—in due timeand under right conditions—must be transferred into the inner Ashram, found ontriadal levels. This may or may not mean the destruction of the group causalbody and the establishing of a direct line of relationship between the pureAshram and a group of disciples. It will undoubtedly mean, during the stagespreliminary to that desirable attainment, a definite change of focus and thegradual establishing of a point of tension upon slowly realised higher levels,carried on until the transference is completed.All the time that this is taking place, the fire at the heart of the group lifeis becoming more and more vital, and consequently more and more spirituallydestructive. The second quality which we considered, the constructive planneduse of the forces of destruction, can now be seen as active. It is these forceswhich are often responsible for the upheavals, the cleavages, the dispersionsand the fatalities which are so frequently the characteristics of the group lifein its early stages. The fire is then working under the stimulation of theSpiritual Triad, but is not consciously being manipulated by the group itself.The group becomes esoterically “a burning ground,” and much time would be savedand much unnecessary distress and pain and suffering would be eliminated if thegroup members would realise [219] what was happening to them and would simplystand steady until such time as the “purification so as by fire” has beencompleted and the life principle in the group heart can shine forth with bothbrilliance and radiance. It is this quality of patient endurance which is sosorely needed by the members of a group being prepared for initiation. Once,however, the purpose underlying all distressing events and disrupted personnelis grasped, rapid progress can be made—again by the simple practice of divineindifference. This divine indifference was the outstanding quality of the Masterupon the Cross at Calvary. The seven words from the Cross were concerned withothers, with His mission, with world need, and with relationship with the Fatheror with the Monad. But disciples and aspirants are so intensely preoccupied withthemselves, their effect upon others, their endurances and pain, or withcriticism of their brothers or of themselves! The goal and the main objective isnot adequately emphasised in their consciousness. The group personality is oftenfunctioning with potency, but the fusing love of the soul is absent and theshattering inflow of the life at the heart of the Jewel is not permitted fullsway. It is blocked and intercepted by group conditions, and until there is atleast some united will to take together what is needed in order to shift thelife of the group to higher levels of awareness and into the Ashram on buddhiclevels, the technique of transference will not be committed to the group by theMaster. That is what is meant by the next sentence in the rule:2. Let them find the Word which will carry out that task.What is this technique of transference? It falls into three stages, each one ofwhich has to be arrived at by the group in unison. The first is the stage ofunited tension or the attaining of such a focal point of planned and focussedintent that the group is undeviatingly oriented to the immediate task to be doneand is functioning from the angle of purpose as one individual. This is perhapsthe hardest stage, but it has to be mastered prior to the assistance of [220]the Master in the inner Ashram; He is to the group what the Monad is to thedisciple, ever seeking to bring about the esoteric “renunciation” of the causalvehicle. This point of tension has to be held in high vibratory activity allthrough the process of transference. I would remind you that the outstandingcharacteristic of Jesus of Nazareth, throughout the period prior to thecrucifixion, was one of complete silence; here is where the efficacy of thefourth quality mentioned by me appears. The group, at this stage, is sopreoccupied with the task ahead and so conscious of the need for preserving aunited and uniform tension, that “the silence of the secret place” settles on itand the work can then proceed apace. When this point has been attained, then thethird quality manifests with power to work as a miniature hierarchy, and thisbecomes increasingly noticeable.Now comes the result of all these preliminary stages, and it comes spontaneouslyand automatically. I want to emphasise that the group does not wait inexpectancy for a Word to be given to it; it does not search and strive todiscover a Word; it does not take some Word as may be suggested by a helpfuldisciple and then proceed to “empower it.” The Word is the result of the pointof tension; it emerges from the silence and its first expression is simply theslowly rising tempo of the group “Sound” or note. As you know, every individualand every group of individuals have their own peculiar note or sound which isthe creative agent of the focussed group life.At this point we again touch the fringe of the coming Science of Invocation.This group sound, rising as the tension increases and stabilises, is invocatoryin effect and draws forth response eventually from the inner Ashram, owing toits relation to the outer group. When the response of the Master is registeredin the group consciousness and His potency is added to the potency of the group,the sound emitted by the group changes in quality, is amplified and diversified,is enriched and then precipitated outside the ring-pass-not of the group life;this precipitation takes the [221] form of a Word. This Word, being the resultof group activity; focus and tension, plus the aid of the Master, brings aboutthree results:> 1. It produces fusion between the outer group and the inner Ashram.> 2. It enables the group life to be transferred along the group antahkarana and> focusses it once and for all in the Master’s Ashram.> 3. The result of this transference is twofold:> a. The outer group dies , occultly speaking.> b. The soul of the group, being now merged with the life aspect on levels> higher than those on which the causal body exists, is no longer of major> importance; the Great Renunciation takes place, and the causal body—having> served its purpose—dies and is destroyed. So died, according to theological> injunction, the Christ upon the Cross. Yet He died not, and still lives, and> by His life are all souls saved.It is hard for esoteric students to realise that the emphasis of the comingSchools of Enlightenment will be upon the life aspect, and not upon contact withthe soul. The goal will be transference and not union. Aspirants and disciplestoday are largely the result of the old order of teaching and are the flower ofthe processes to which humanity has been subjected. This is a vital transitionperiod; disciples and aspirants in the world at this time are, figurativelyspeaking, at the same stage as the group which we are considering—the stage ofthe transference of the life from the outer form into the inner being. Hence thedifficulty with which you are all faced, and the arduous task it is tocomprehend realistically that which I am attempting to convey. The problem ofsoul contact is something which you can and do grasp, at least theoretically.The problem of life transference from the highest point of present attainmentinto some vague and mystical spiritual focus is not so easy to understand.Forget not, I am not looking for understanding for I write for those who willcome after you, and [222] for those who will be the reincarnated aspects of yourpresent selves.You will note, therefore, how the four qualities dealt with (page 215) haveenabled the group to achieve the sounding of the Word. That Word, now emitted bythem as a group under the inspiration of the Master (and I use the word“inspiration” advisedly), has gone forth; it has passed beyond the sphere of theimmediate group influence; it has made its initial impact upon the soul of thegroup and has vitalised to a new potency the life aspect, the Jewel in the Lotusof the soul. Now comes the possibility of fulfilling the third great injunctioncontained in this rule:3. Let them destroy by their dynamic Will that which has been created at themidway point.In the fulfillment of the requirement here enjoined, the group enters upon itsmajor test in this work of transference. The group members have unitedlypreserved the point of tension; unitedly they have created the antahkarana;unitedly they have invoked by the group sound the attention of the Master and ofthe Master’s Ashram; unitedly that sound has taken the form of a Word, and thatWord has made an impact upon the life aspect of the group within the form of thegroup soul; it has energised it so that the destruction of the causal body isnow in order. The tendency of the group would then be to relax, and this quitenormally; the irretrievable Word has gone forth and all is well and safelyaccomplished. But it is not so in verity. By the power of their united love, thegroup has mastered personnel difficulties and has developed together the fourqualities; it has also found the Word which can affect the soul—for the Word isever related to the second aspect, and because of that it can reach and energisethe soul, the second aspect per se.But now, in the final stages of the great work of transference, the group has toarrive at a new point of tension and of united attainment. It has to use thedynamic will, the energy of the first aspect, and so bring about the final [223]destruction of the causal body. The life within the causal body has beenstimulated and vitalised and is now seeking to break out of its confining form.The vehicle of the soul is being subjected to pressure from within but then—bothin the case of the individual initiate and of the initiated group—the final blowhas to be struck also from without, by an act of the united will; thiscorresponds to the great cry of the Christ upon the Cross when He exclaimed “Itis finished.” With these words, we are told, the veil of the Temple was rentfrom the top to the bottom, and the life of the Christ ascended to the Father.Ponder upon the significances of these phrases. “That which has been created atthe midway point” is no longer needed. No mediating principle or intermediarybetween man and the Father is any longer required; the Monad and the personalityare in complete at-one-ment and have achieved perfected relationship; triplicityhas given place to duality, and the Way of the Higher Evolution stands openbefore the initiate.It will be obvious that this phase of group attainment can as yet be only ahope. It lies far ahead of the present day groups, just as the fourth initiationlies far ahead of the average aspirant or disciple. But groups must have theirgoals and must strive towards the vision, just as the individual must; I amlaying the foundation for the phase of group living and united striving whichwill be so distinctive an aspect of the coming era. There are three furtherpoints which I seek to make:First, the attainment of the ability to use the group will dynamically can bemore easily understood if it is realised that it means the extension of thepoint of tension into realms which involve the super-consciousness of thedisciple; also that the release of the life aspect from the confines of thecausal body produces a new cycle of invocation and invocative activity. Thisbrings about an inflow of the destroyer aspect of the divine Will, andconsequently the complete destruction of the causal vehicle.Secondly, it is not to be inferred that all in the group must be disciples whoare in process of taking the fourth [224] initiation. A group can be composed ofdisciples and initiates of all degrees, though there must be among the grouppersonnel at least one disciple who has taken the initiation of crucifixion.This necessity is symbolised for us in the close relation which existed betweenJesus as He took this initiation and the Christ Who had taken it in an earlierstate of life. The more diversified the group, the richer its life andpossibilities. Forget this not. One hint I can give you upon this difficultsubject. When the results of the first point of tension, prior to the emergenceof the Word, have been reached, initiates of the fourth degree within the Ashramlend their aid and do much to make possible the attainment of the goal by thegroup.Thirdly, I would have you note that I have given you much in a brief form andhave added much of new information anent the fourth initiation. What I have saidis applicable both to the individual aspirant and to a group seeking initiation.Read what I have said with attention, but remember that it is not yet possiblefor you to differentiate between what is symbolic and what may be factual. Thesecrets of initiation are thus guarded with care.One simple rule towards comprehension and attainment ever holds good. The GreatRenunciation becomes possible only when the practice of the little renunciationsgoverns the life of a disciple and a group. The renouncing of ambition, of allpersonality ties, and the renunciation of all that hinders progress as it isrevealed to the eye of the soul, lays a sound foundation for the final greattransference, based upon the renunciation of that which for aeons has connotedbeauty, truth and goodness, and which has seemed the ultimate goal of allaspirational effort. The endeavour to see that which lies ahead and beyond theapparent finality of soul fusion faces disciples, among them some of you, atthis time; and that all of you may penetrate beyond the veil of the soul andeventually see that veil “rent from the top to the bottom,” and thus be enabledto say with those of like degree “It is finished” is my earnest hope. Then willopen for you as for others, the Way of the [225] Higher Evolution, and the gloryof the Lord will be seen in a new light—a light which will dim and throw intothe shade all previous goals and visions.RULE TWELVEThe Rule which we have now to consider carries us into realms of extra-planetaryenergy, into a world of a larger consciousness towards which the higherinitiates strive and which is related in a peculiar way to both the past and thefuture. This rule might also be called the formula controlling the work of theNew Group of World Servers.The three remaining rules for initiates and disciples are concerned with thework of the New Age and the coming revelation which will make that work both newand possible. They are therefore of supreme importance to us. Step by step, inthe eleven rules already studied, we have seen the initiate or disciple carriedfrom his position as an accepted disciple standing before the Angel of thePresence, to that point of attainment where the spiritual will is released infull service and with full comprehension at the time of the fourth initiation,where atma or pure spirit is in control, where the Spiritual Triad is expressingthe nature of the Monad, where identification with the purpose of deity hastranscended illumination of the mind, and has also transcended cooperationthrough pure love with the Plan. These words are all attempts to indicate thepath of progress which is—to the initiate consciousness—the necessarypreparatory stage to treading the Path of the Higher Evolution, just as theProbationary Path is the necessary preparatory stage to being accepted into anAshram. Briefly, the eleven rules already dealt with might be regarded ascontrolling the conscious activity of the initiate in the following stages andrelationships.1. The stage of the burning ground and the establishment of illumined grouprelation. This is revealed by the mind, functioning as an aspect of the groupmind. [226]2. The stage of ashramic recognition and the establishing of a forward-movinggroup rhythm; these reciprocal activities produce a needed group tension.3. The stage of emitting the group sound and the establishing of the power toinvoke divinity, followed by a united group realisation that “God is Fire.”4. The stage of extinguishing the lesser fires through the means of the aboverealisation, and the establishing of a defined group reaction to the divinepurpose or will; this results eventually in the negation of the Laws of Karmaand Rebirth as they condition life in the three worlds.5. The stage of triadal perception and the establishing of spiritual contact,thus negating both the life of form and the soul. Duality is no longerrecognised.6. The stage of identification with the life aspect and the establishing ofcomplete divine integration into the greater Whole. The initiate then movesonward in life and not in consciousness—a concept and a truth which it is notpossible for you to understand at this time.7. The stage of a group sounding-forth of the Word and establishing directrelation with Shamballa as an integral part of the Hierarchy. This means theenunciation of a dual chord.8. The stage of responding to the higher aspects of the seven Ray Lives andestablishing contact with the Three and the One. This is done under the Law ofthe Supplementary Seven.9. The stage of spiritual negation, as it is called. This establishes a newaffirmative attitude and results in a recognition of the true nature of the OneInitiator.10. The stage of the dissipation of all veils and the establishing of the powerto work with light energy, thus earning the reward of new utilised ability,i.e., the ability to work with the consciousness aspect in all forms.11. The stage where the potencies of the death aspect of divine purpose can beused to carry out divine purpose, plus the establishing of completeidentification (as a group) with the divine will. This marks the period of theGreat [227] Renunciation and prefaces the complete transition out of the FourthCreative Hierarchy, the human kingdom.This is a brief and inadequate summation of the more general and the more easilycomprehended results of obedience to these rules. The initiate stands free andbecomes consequently a dynamic factor within the working Hierarchy. Rule XII nowbecomes clear to him, not only through the realisation induced by his illuminedmind, but through the higher divine qualities which are related to theexpression of the will and purpose of the planetary Logos.It will of course be obvious to you that only those who have reached the stagesof work described in Rules X and XI will truly comprehend my meaning. I wouldwarn you again that the obvious significance of the remaining three rules is notin reality the true spiritual significance because we are in these rules dealingwith the planned work of the Hierarchy during the next great cycle, that of theAquarian Age, we shall therefore be considering those activities and plans whichwill usher in and mature that new culture and civilisation which will slowlycome into being when the world has straightened itself out after the processesof the world war (1914-1945). The rule runs as follows:Rule XII.> Let the group serve as Aquarius indicates; let Mercury speed the group upon> the upward Way and let Taurus bring illumination and the attainment of the> vision; let the mark of the Saviour, as the group toils in Pisces, be seen> above the aura of the group.You will remember that the rule as given to applicants emphasised:> 1. The use of the hands in service for healing, blessing and for invocation.> 2. The mark of the Messenger in the feet; this referred to the use of the> intuition, which is governed by Mercury.> 3. The use of the “eye.” This is not in reality the third eye (which is after> all only a symbolic phrase), but the [228] ability to use developed soul> power. This is that intermediate potency found between the power of the mind> and the dynamic electric energy of pure will.For the initiate, this rule simply carries the same message but on an infinitelyhigher scale, and (if I may so express it) obedience to this rule calls inAquarian energy, the reasoning power of Mercury, and the illumination of Taurus,in order to carry forward hierarchical work upon a planet and in a planetarycycle which have been conditioned by Pisces for more than two thousand years.I would have you ponder on this, for in realisation you will here have theformula for the work of the Hierarchy as it reconstructs the world after thedestruction wrought since 1900 A.D. You have here also a great triangle ofenergies, functioning through the medium of Mercury, the reasonable, reasoningMessenger of the Gods:> [Image00007.jpg]The Hierarchy is, therefore, at this time, conditioned by three greatconstellations: [229] 1. Aquarius— The Custodian of that “life more abundantly” of which the Christspoke and which He can draw upon at this time in a new and dynamic manner inorder to bring about the restoration needed. This energy is the “implementingforce of universality.” It concerns the future. 2. Taurus — The Revealer ofthe vision, the “eye of the Gods,” the donor of illumination. It is that whichconcerns the present. 3. Pisces — The Inspiration of the World Saviour, andalso the field of salvation. It is the field of force in which the two otherforces must work. It has been produced by the past.As these three constellations pour their energies into the great Ashram of SanatKumara, the Hierarchy, they are there concentrated and retained until releasedunder “the swift design of Mercury” into the field of the human consciousness.The effect of this release is to awaken the intuition (governed as you know byMercury), and to enlighten advanced humanity. It is through intuitive humanbeings that knowledge of the Plan is given to humanity and the work ofrestoration can be carried forward.At this time and in a peculiar manner, the initiate-consciousness sees theHierarchy as primarily energised by life, and by the energy of Aquarius,carrying a hitherto unknown aspect of the life energy of deity. This is ofcourse difficult for you to comprehend and will only be understood as it trulyis at the close of the Aquarian Age.The initiate sees the New Group of World Servers brought under the illuminatingpower of Taurus, with the rest of humanity still under the influence of Pisces.You have, consequently, the “over-shadowing raincloud of knowable things”hovering over humanity, just as the Hierarchy overshadows the New Group and justas the soul overshadows the personality of man; you have all the neededillumination and light upon all the coming problems, waiting to precipitateitself through the New Group of World Servers under the influence of Taurus, thenurturer of all illumination, and you have humanity, at the same time,conditioned and made sensitive by Piscean energy during the past two thousandyears. You have, therefore, a condition of great spiritual promise, and in thiscombination of [230] energies you have present those forces which will implementthe activities of the Hierarchy, condition its initiates, affect every Ashram,bring light into the present darkness, and—as can already be seen—stir into newunderstanding the present Piscean consciousness of mankind.It is in the New Group of World Servers that the training of the neededdisciples for the Ashrams of the Masters takes place at this time in worldhistory. This is a new hierarchical venture. In this group also accepteddisciples learn to work in the same manner as does the Hierarchy. The Hierarchyworks within the field of the world of human living; the New Group provides asimilar field for the new disciple. It is towards that group also that initiatesin the various Ashrams converge at times, in order to study the calibre andquality of the disciples who are engaged in world salvage, for it is throughthese disciples that the Hierarchy carries out its plans. Initiates do theirmain work upon mental levels and from behind the scenes, and because of thistheir potency is great; this is particularly so with those who have taken thethird initiation. A certain percentage of them are, however, active out in theworld of daily living.You need ever to remember that at this time the main technique of the Hierarchyis that of conveying inspiration . The Masters are not openly lecturing orteaching in the great cities of the world; They work entirely through Theirdisciples and initiates. It will, however, be possible for Them to appearincreasingly among men and evoke recognition as the influence of Aquarius ismore firmly established. The Masters, in the meantime, must continue to work“within the silence of the universal Ashram,” as it has been called, and fromthere They inspire Their workers, and these latter in their time and way,inspire the New Group of World Servers.You will note, therefore, that the effect of Aquarius upon the Hierarchy (as faras you, at your particular point in evolution can determine it) is to bring inthe energy of Shamballa which is essentially the energy of life itself,implemented [231] by the will. This necessarily has created (and willincreasingly create) major adjustments within the Hierarchy itself. Theprincipal type of energy hitherto used by the Hierarchy is—as you well know—theenergy of love. Now, to that must be added the energy of the life-giving will.New methods, new approaches to the human problem and new modes of work will haveto be tried; experiment with the incoming forces will necessarily be the orderof the day, though they will be experiments based upon vast knowledge andimplemented with wisdom and understanding. It is the reaction of modern man tothe ancient forces which produces the need for care. Mankind is oftunpredictable, owing to the factor of free will. It is this which lies behindthe training given to disciples, upon which I have already given you muchinstruction. The new techniques and the changed approach from that of individualculture to united group progress will bring about many types of development. Itis this different approach to the same basic problems which lies behind the newcapacities which are emerging among disciples; it is this which enablesdisciples of experience to work at high speed and with a life potency that isunusual. I would have all disciples begin to train themselves to respond to theAquarian energy now pouring into the Hierarchy. Some of you can do so asaccepted disciples, and as members of my Ashram. Take advantage, therefore, ofthe opportunity for re-energising that comes to all those who have establishedcontact, via their souls, with the Hierarchy, or who are members of an Ashram,or who, as probationers, are upon the periphery of the great Ashram of SanatKumara, the Hierarchy. This Aquarian influence produces mainly the intensifyingof the hierarchical relationship to Shamballa, and therefore affects everymember of His Ashram, from the Christ down to the most newly accepted disciple.It is through the disciples that the New Group of World Servers are broughtunder the stepped-down Aquarian influences; this has to be an individual matter,largely dependent upon the point of evolution. Some members of [232] the NewGroup of World Servers will not respond in any way; they cannot. Others willrespond as fully as their spiritual status permits. This inflow of Aquarianenergy is one of the factors which will enable the Christ to complete His taskas World Saviour and World Teacher; it will also enable Him to take theinitiation which lies immediately ahead of Him and for which He has beenpreparing for close upon three thousand years—so exalted and peculiar aninitiation it is. It is this influence also which has enabled the Master R. toassume the mantle of the Mahachohan and become the Lord of Civilisation—acivilisation which will be conditioned by the rhythm of the seventh ray.Incidentally, it is this Aquarian influence which has given the adepts of theBlack Lodge the power to bring universal death throughout the world. These evilbeings have responded to the will energy of Shamballa and to the life-givingvitality, but have used it in keeping with their own evil intentions and withthe power conferred by their standing upon the cosmic ladder of evil. Hence thewar. I only mention this as a striking example of the oft misunderstood factthat the same energy or identical force will produce results within theconsciousness of a Christ or within the consciousness of anti-Christ. It is thesame energy, but the forms upon which it plays differ so vastly that in one casethe will-to-good is intensified, and in the others the will-to-evil. Energy perse is entirely impersonal.The group, therefore, which “serves as Aquarius indicates” is the Hierarchy; thegroup which is “speeded upon the upward Way” is the New Group of World Servers.This group is ruled by Taurus, and to it that divine Taurian energy brings“illumination and the attainment of the vision.” This group is, figurativelyspeaking, the “bull, rushing forward upon a straight line with its one eye fixedupon the goal and beaming light.” But what is that goal? It is not the goal ofSelf-illumination, for that lies far behind; it is the goal of providing acentre of light within the world of men and of holding up the vision to the sonsof men. Let this never be forgotten, and let the New Group of [233] WorldServers realise its mission and recognise the demands of humanity upon it. Whatare these demands? Let me enumerate them, and then let me ask you to take themin all simplicity and act upon them.> 1. To receive and transmit illumination from the kingdom of souls.> 2. To receive inspiration from the Hierarchy and go forth, consequently, to> inspire.> 3. To hold the vision of the Plan before the eyes of men, for “where there is> no vision, the people perish.”> 4. To act as an intermediate group between the Hierarchy and humanity,> receiving light and power and then using both of these, under the inspiration> of love, to build the new world of tomorrow.> 5. To toil in Pisces, illumined by Taurus and responsive in degree to the> Aquarian impulse coming from the Hierarchy.These objectives are not only individual objectives, but the goal for the entiregroup. All who respond to the life-giving force of Aquarius and to thelight-giving force of Taurus can and will work in the New Group of WorldServers, even though they have no occult knowledge and have never heard of theirco-workers under that name. Forget this not.Recognition of the successful work of the New Group of World Servers will beaccorded by the Hierarchy, and the testimony of the recognition will be theappearing of a symbol in the aura of the group—of the entire group. This will bea symbol projected by the Hierarchy, specifically by the Christ. What thatsymbol will be it is not for me to say. It is not yet fully earned, and only itsdim and uncertain outline can be seen from the level on which the Masters work,and not at all from the level on which the group itself works. It is “the markof a Saviour” and it will embody the mark or indication (the signature asmedieval occultists used to call it) of a new type of salvation or salvage. Uptill now the mark of the Saviour has been the Cross, and the quality of thesalvation offered has been freedom from substance [234] or the lure of matterand from its hold—a freedom only to be achieved at a great cost. The futureholds within its silence other modes of saving humanity. The cup of sorrow andthe agony of the Cross are well-nigh finished. Joy and strength will take theirplace. Instead of sorrow we shall have a joy which will work out in happinessand lead eventually to bliss. We shall have a strength which will know naughtbut victory and will not recognise disaster. Even the Black Lodge knew of thischange in the mode of salvation, and hastily founded its groups of youths,banded together by the motto “joy through strength and strength through joy.” Itseems to be a law for group development to receive recognition from the side ofevil, prior to that recognition coming from the good. But “after weeping comethjoy, and that joy cometh in the morning.” Only the dawn is with us as yet—thedawn of the Aquarian Age. The full tide of light is inevitably moving upon itsway towards us.This Rule tells us that “the group toils in Pisces.” This simply means that thefield wherein the New Group of World Servers works is that of mankind,conditioned and ruled for the past two thousand years by Piscean energy. Thisis, as you know, the energy which produces mediation and which developssensitivity in the individual. The work accomplished by and through this energyis so successfully accomplished that it has produced a mediating group ofservers; this group acts as an intermediary between the Hierarchy and Humanity,and it has also developed the sensitive response of humanity to contacts, and tosuch a degree of sensitivity that the response to be accorded to the activitiesof the New Group of World Servers is very real and cannot be negated.It should be remembered that the Piscean energy with which the group has to workis opposed to the incoming energies from the Hierarchy and the New Group ofWorld Servers. This is owing to the fact that the energy of this constellationis passing out concurrently with the sixth ray energy, with which it peculiarly“coincided,” as it is esoterically [235] called. Hence the present difficulties.The passing out of the influence of Pisces, the slow withdrawal of the sixth rayforce, the incoming Aquarian energy, via the Hierarchy (affecting at this timemainly the Hierarchy itself and the mental and astral planes) are conditions towhich we must look for the origin of all our present troubles. In this involvedsituation, you have a planetary demonstration of the significance of innercauses, producing outer effects. Slowly, however, the Hierarchy is beginning toimplement both the Shamballa energy and that of Aquarius; the Masters Themselveshave to learn how to use new incoming energies in the service of the Plan, justas the individual has to learn, in any particular incarnation, to work with anduse the available astrological forces which make their impact upon one or otherof his bodies or upon his entire personality; such energies, as you well know,can be turned to good uses or to bad. It is not possible for the Masters to turnenergy to evil ends, but They necessarily have to master new techniques and thenew methods of work called for by the new conditions; these can either affectthe Hierarchy itself or will produce reactions in the fourth kingdom and in theother kingdoms, producing rapidly changing orientation and attitudes.These forces and energies—from the zodiac or from one or other of the sevenrays—have poured into and through our planetary Life for countless aeons. Eachtime that they cyclically make their appearance, the forms and substance in thethree worlds upon which they impinge and through which they pass are differentin the degree of evolutionary response and of sensitive reaction to impact. Theresponse and the reactions of the human family as a whole, or of the individualwithin that whole, will differ from that of the previous cycle; with thesefactors the Hierarchy has to contend, changing cyclically its technique andaltering its modes of work in order to meet the changing need. Bear this inmind. This has never been more evident to the Masters than today. The war mightbe regarded as a revolt by the form side of nature against the old conditions,and [236] against the new incoming conditioning factors on the part of the BlackLodge. Between the two forces—one sensitive, onward moving, ready for that whichis new and better, and the other reactionary, static and determined to gain astrangle hold upon the life within the form—the Hierarchy stands at the midwaypoint:> a. Throwing all its weight on the side of that which is new, spiritual and> desirable.> b. Adapting itself simultaneously to new conditions and new emerging factors.> c. Standing like a wall of steel, unshatterable and immovable between humanity> and the forces of evil.This has been an epoch of crisis, and the great moment for which the Hierarchyhas been preparing ever since it was founded upon the Earth. Slowly down theages, men have been trained and prepared for initiation; they have been taughtto develop the initiate-consciousness; they have taken then their place withinthe ranks of the Hierarchy and have—later—passed into the higher centre,Shamballa.Paralleling this line of unfoldment of the individual, there has also been agreat though slow expansion of the human consciousness and a gradual steadyprogress forward into light. It has now become possible to create the New Groupof World Servers—men and women sensitive to the inner and newer vision and tothe incoming forces and energies. Each group, therefore, whether it is theHierarchy, the New Group of World Servers, or mankind itself, is wrestling withits own interior problems of response, of recognition and of responsibility;each also is actuated by an outgoing movement in two directions: towards thatwhich is higher and which indicates a better and more spiritual future, with allthat that implies, and also towards that which is rooted in and related to thepast, which is crystallising, reactionary, blind in its selfishness andmateriality, and which is implemented to retain the old things which should passaway and to fight that which is new.As individual aspirants, you all know that this condition [237] exists in theconflict waged interiorly and expressed exteriorly between the soul and thepersonality. The same conditioning factors can be seen also working in everygroup, organisation, world religion, and in every nation, as well as in theplanet as a whole. Millions of years ago, the Hierarchy realised that such atime of crisis and of conflict was inevitable. The easiest way to handle itwould have been as lesser conflicts were dealt with in the past—by a process offinal intervention. Shamballa and the Hierarchy could have unitedly ended thisworld crisis, but it would then have again arisen and have gone on arising untilhumanity itself ended it once and for all upon the physical plane.Of this situation the determination of the United Nations to win and to enforcecomplete surrender upon the aggressor nations which are the agents of the BlackLodge is symbolic and also symptomatic of the progress of the human spirit.(Written in September 1944.) This time, the Hierarchy refrains from outeraction, but simply inspires and transmits the needed energy, leaving mankind tofind its own way into freedom, and out of Pisces into the aura and the field ofactivity of Aquarius, guided by those who are responsive to the illuminationwhich Taurus confers.See you not the beauty of this plan and its synthesising, culminatingusefulness? See you not how the present crisis only indicates the success of theprevious evolutionary cycles wherein humanity mastered certain lessons? All thepost-war planning, the widespread reaction to ideals (in spite of all theefforts of the evil and reactionary forces), and the seething turmoil reachingthroughout all levels of the human consciousness, plus the inspiration ofdisaster and suffering, are blasting open hitherto sealed areas in the minds ofmen, letting in illumination, sweeping away the bad old conditions. This issymbolised for us in the destruction of ancient cities and by the intermixtureof races through the processes of war; this also signifies progress and ispreparatory to great expansions of consciousness. These expansions in the humanunderstanding will, in the next [238] one hundred and fifty years, completelyalter the manner of man’s thinking; they will change the techniques of religion;they will bring about comprehension and fusion. When this work has beenaccomplished we shall record an era of world peace which will be symbolic of thestate of the human spirit. Men will then settle down to the great task whichconfronts all of us in the New Age—the task of dissipating glamour and ofbringing about a clearer light upon the astral plane, in the same way thatbetter physical conditions will have been brought about upon the physical plane.All is planned and ordered; the right energies and forces will be available, forthe Hierarchy works ever under the Law of Cycles and of Cyclic Compensation. TheMasters know exactly that which must be done by right timing and by what hasbeen called “the crisis of spatial extension.” They call this theinterchangeableness of time and space—a meaningless phrase to you but one whichis already being dimly sensed.The two Rules which remain for us to study concern the work of the Hierarchy inthe Aquarian Age. Hence they are specifically for the more advanced disciplesand for initiates. We have seen in many ways that—at this time—the Hierarchy,because it is the Ashram of Sanat Kumara Himself, is coming peculiarly and in anew sense under the influence of His will nature. This means that the Members ofthe Hierarchy, familiar as They may be with the Plan for the immediate cyclewith which They and humanity are confronted, are being brought to a new and more“appropriate” conception of the divine Purpose which lies behind the Plan andwhich motivates it. The will of God is becoming plainer to Them. It is taking onmore definite lines. As our planetary Logos nears the climaxing point of theinitiation which He is now undergoing, His Ashram, the Hierarchy, must and does(as part of a normal development) feel the effect. From the Christ down to thenewest and latest accepted disciple, each in his own place, all are becomingincreasingly responsive to the “will of God.” This [239] does not take place ina blind, acquiescing manner, but with understanding and “fortitude.” Thisreceptive attitude on the part of the Hierarchy will bring about great,necessary and unexpected changes. Some of these, I have earlier hinted, may nowbe taking place; some will follow later. The following ideas may serve toclarify the whole concept in your minds:1. The entire technique of training disciples for initiation and of absorbingthem into the various Ashrams which constitute the great Ashram of the Lord ofthe World has been altered. The Masters are no longer concerned with anindividual, here or there, who endeavours to go forward on the Path, whoevidences capacity and who is apparently ready for what has been called “theevocation of the initiate consciousness.” It is becoming obvious to theHierarchy that with the arrival of the Aquarian Age, group preparation, groupinitiation and group acceptance must and will supersede the older methods. Theseolder methods, built around the direct relationship between a Master and adisciple, reached their highest point of usefulness early in the Piscean Age.For nearly two thousand years these methods have proved so successful that theintensity of humanity’s response is such that hundreds are now ready “forabsorption.” This readiness and success present a difficulty and pose a problemfor the Masters, necessitating a reorganisation of Their plans and areadjustment of Their techniques.2. Not only has the individual approach to the Hierarchy been superseded by agroup approach, but it is now found to be possible to make a certain measure ofthe training objective and exoteric. Hence the establishment of the New Group ofWorld Servers. This is primarily a group which, while working on the outer planeof daily, physical living, yet preserves a close ashramic integration; it thusprovides a field of service for accepted disciples who are seekingservice-expression, and it also provides a rallying point for all determinedaspirants where they can be tried out and where their motives and persistencecan be tested, prior to direct acceptance. This is something new, for it [240]shifts the responsibility of preparing aspirants for accepted discipleship ontothe shoulders of the pledged disciple and away from the immediate attention ofthe accepting Master. He is thus freed for other fields of service. This, initself, is one of the major indications of the success of the evolutionaryprocess as applied to humanity. This “shift” was initiated by the ChristHimself; he worked with men very frequently through others, reaching humanitythrough the medium of His twelve Apostles, regarding Paul as substituting forJudas Iscariot. The Buddha tried the same system, but the relation of His groupwas, in the first instance, to Him and not so much to the world of men. Christsent His Apostles out into the world to feed the sheep, to seek, to guide and tobecome “fishers of men.” The relation of the disciples of the Christ was onlysecondarily to their Master, and primarily to a demanding world; that attitudestill controls the Hierarchy, yet with no less of devotion to the Christ. Whatthe Buddha had instituted symbolically and in embryo became factual and existentunder the demands of the Piscean Age.3. The third great change has been in the relation of the Hierarchy toShamballa, and of this you can necessarily know and understand little. I couldperhaps express the underlying significance to you in symbolic language. Theenergy, emanating from Shamballa, has been divided into two direct anddistinctive streams. One stream, embodying the dynamic of purpose, is nowpouring into the Hierarchy and into its seven major Ashrams; another stream,embodying the dynamic of determination or of enlightened enthusiastic will, isreaching humanity direct, via the New Group of World Servers. Hitherto a blendedstream of Shamballa force has poured into the Hierarchy and has streamed, in itsundifferentiated type and quality, into all the groups within the Hierarchy. Nowthe quality of determination, or of what the average person understands by theuse of the word “Will,” is pouring into the New Group of World Servers, whilstthe energy of dynamic purpose, differentiated into seven diverging streams, ispouring into [241] each of the “seven points of reception,” the Masters’ Ashramswithin the ring-pass-not of the Hierarchy. These seven types of purpose embodythe seven energies which will reorganise and redefine the hierarchicalundertakings, and thus inaugurate the New Age. These seven purposes might becalled:a. The unknown, unseen and unheard purpose of Sanat Kumara. It is the secret oflife itself and is known only to Him alone. In its initial phase of this newexpression, it works through the Manu and the Master Morya; it is that whichveils the central mystery which all esoteric schools—if true to theirinaugurating impulse—will eventually reveal. What that is we do not yet know,but it is hinted at in Rule XIII.b. The purpose underlying revelation. This may be a somewhat new idea to you foryou are apt to regard revelation as a goal in itself. You seldom consider it asan effect of the inner purpose of Sanat Kumara. The emphasis hitherto has beenon the aspect of revelation, making it an effect of what the disciple has donewith himself and by means of which he is enabled to be the recipient ofrevelation. Yet behind all the successive revelations of divinity down the agesis to be found one significant purpose; all of them are and will provethemselves to be aspects of the Great Revelation. It is through the processes ofrevelation that divinity is slowly dawning upon the human consciousness. It is asevenfold revelation; each of the seven kingdoms in nature reveals one aspect ofit, and each of these seven reaches revelation in seven or fourteen lesserrevelations or phases.Ponder on this and learn to distinguish between vision (which is as much of thedivine current revelation as a disciple can grasp in time and space) andrevelation which is the synthesis of the divine expressive purpose. This isrelated to the will-to-good which is, in its turn, a complete expression of thelove nature of Deity.c. The (as yet) unrecognised purpose which evoked the creative activity of ourPlanetary Logos . This brought the [242] third aspect of the divine Trinity intoplay. The usual reasons brought forward by the finite mind of man to account forwhat is called by us “manifestation,” and to explain the dualism of allexistence and the relation of spirit-matter, are by no means the realexplanation of the divine purpose; they are based on man’s own essentialdualism; they are the highest explanation of his own divine nature which he canachieve at this time. This is a point to be remembered. They are his response tothe second Ray of Mutual Attraction, which the Ray of Love-Wisdom is sometimescalled. They are not an expression of his response to the Will of God, and onlyindicate the limitations of his definition of divine purpose. As you will note,they really define nothing. Nor can I help you to recognise this third aspectand the eternal purpose of the Lord of the World. Just as a soul seeksincarnation in order to carry forward some fixed design and to take one of thehigher initiations, so Sanat Kumara came into incarnation through the medium ofthis planet in order to carry forward His fixed designs (known to Him as acosmic Soul on cosmic mental levels), and to take one of the higher initiationswhich mark the Path of Initiation for these great informing Lives of planetaryspheres. He could take this particular initiation through the experience to begained in a vehicle constituted, expressive and at the special state ofconsciousness of our entire planetary manifestation. It required an instrumentin which the cells and atoms of His body (all lives in all kingdoms), and theintegrated organisms within that body (the various kingdoms of nature), were atthe peculiar point in evolution at which they are all now to be found.That is as far as I may go in giving you a hint, and you can see from this thatin order to grasp more and comprehend more of His divine purpose you also willhave to be in preparation for that particular initiation which for you—on yourtiny level of awareness of fixed design—is the microcosmic parallel of Hiscosmic intention. Which that initiation is I may not state. The only servicewhich these hints can render (as to the sevenfold divine purpose and [243] theconsideration of them) is to develop in you, the disciple, the power to thinkabstractly—a much needed capacity before you can begin to tread the Way of theHigher Evolution; for this the five initiations open to humanity (as todayconstituted) prepare the human spirit.d. The mysterious purpose which has necessitated the calling into activity thePrinciple of Pain . Suffering and Pain are essential requirements in order tocarry this purpose to completion. The capacity to suffer, which is distinctiveof humanity, is the outstanding conscious reaction to environment of the fourthkingdom in nature, the human. It is related to the power to think andconsciously to relate cause and effect. It is a process on the way to somethingundreamt of today. And when I say this, my brother, I mean just exactly that.This same ability to respond through pain is not to be found (in the sense inwhich the human being comprehends it) in any of the subhuman kingdoms, nor inthe superhuman kingdoms, any more than it was found in the previous solar systemor will be found in the next. It is related to an aspect of the creativeintelligence, an aspect and characteristic peculiar to humanity.This aspect was not found in the previous solar system, in which the otheraspects of the creative intelligence functioned. In this solar system, it hasbeen developed and brought from latency to potency in connection with thesubstance of the human bodies through which the human soul is gainingexperience. It holds the secret of beauty in manifestation, and its firstexpression can be seen in the creative perfection of certain phases of art forwhich man, and man alone, is responsible. No other kingdom in nature createsforms, produces colour and sounds in harmonious relation, except the human; allof this type of creative art is the result of aeons of conflict, pain andsuffering. The Jews, as a product of the humanity of the previous solar system,and as constituting the incarnating residue from that solar system, have run thegamut of suffering and are in the forefront of the creative arts at this time,particularly [244] in group production such as certain of the great motionpictures and in the field of scientific discovery.There will be, as you can well see, a close relation between this fourth purposeof Sanat Kumara, the fourth kingdom in nature, the human, and the fourth Ray ofHarmony through Conflict. It is the balanced relation of these three,consummated at the fourth initiation, which produces the full beauty of thecreative fixed design of the individual soul, or—on a different level ofinitiatory process—of the fixed design of the universal soul of the Lord of theWorld. The fourth ray being temporarily out of full incarnation at this time isthe reason for the relative interlude in the production of human creative art ofa very high order. The cycle of suffering is nearing its close, and we shalllater see—when the fourth ray again swings into full objective activity—arecurrence of the arts on a turn of the spiral far more exalted than any latelyseen.e. The fifth great secret underlying the purpose of Sanat Kumara is related in apeculiar sense to the cyclic manifestation of all that is found in the threeworlds of human evolution. It concerns that which is working slowly intomanifestation through the medium of the lower concrete mind as it controlsdesire and brings substance and matter into conformity with the divine thoughtalong this line. The sumtotal of the highest phases of human thinking along alllines, materially affects what appears on the physical plane in all the kingdomsof nature, what precipitates civilisations and cultures, and which expresses thebest response at the moment of human sensitivity to cosmic impression.This is all that can be said as we attempt to sum up the fixed desire and thepattern or purpose of divine activity down the ages. We know it to be profoundlyinadequate as yet to express or to produce in manifested form the beauty of thatdesign and to create in conformity with God’s thought; but—age by age—thethinking capacity of man and his creative imagination have wrought out theslowly unfolding design, and will continue to do so; every [245] great worldcycle sees the emergence of greater beauty, and sees the subtle effects of man’sthinking upon the subhuman kingdoms in nature steadily bringing the unknown tothe surface, altering the nature of the flora and the fauna of the planet, andpreparing the way for that time of wonder when the Hierarchy will again beexoterically directing the Plan upon the earth and aiding mankind to work with afuller understanding of the divine design.Here again is another reason for the changing plans of the Hierarchy. TheMasters have to prepare Themselves for this intended and imminent emergence.They are faced with the necessity of changing Their techniques of work in orderto meet adequately the demands upon Them. It is far easier for Them to work, asillumined Minds, upon the mental substance of Their disciples than it will befor Them to work down upon the physical plane, relating the minds and the brainsof advanced human beings. People are apt to forget that with each forwardadvance of humanity, the demands upon the Hierarchy change, new needs must bemet, new techniques used, new and experimental methods must be employed. As Iwrite for disciples and initiates, I call this to their attention. Their work ofmental training does not end as they attain certain spiritual initiatory goals.This fifth purpose is therefore closely related to the whole theme of “thegarment of God” and to the emergence into manifestation of His “robe of beauty”as it is created and brought into being by humanity, acting as the medium forideas from the superhuman kingdoms, and then influencing and swinging intocreative cooperation the subhuman kingdoms.f. It is difficult for me to give any idea whatsoever of the purpose with whichwe are now concerned, because it is expressed in the relation existing betweenthe significance of Desire, Will, Plan and Purpose . All these words are symbolsevolved by man in his attempt to grasp logoic purpose. He recognises theimpulses of desire, and in the course of the evolutionary process learns totransmute them [246] into aspiration; he passes on to a vague groping forward inan effort to understand and acquiesce in the “will of God,” as he calls it; aslong, however, as human approach to that will remains negative, submissive, andacquiescent (as it does under the influence of the theological approach and inthe manner inculcated by the Churches), no real light on the nature of that Willwill be seen. It is only as human beings enter into relation with the Hierarchyand are gradually absorbed into the hierarchical life and begin to take thehigher initiations that the true nature of the divine Will will be grasped andthe purpose of Sanat Kumara be revealed by an appreciation of the plan ,followed by a consequent cooperation with that Plan.All this will be done through the transmutation of desire into aspiration, andthen into fixed determination. When, however, the initiate has related thesephases of consciousness in his own inner experience, and has permitted thoseinner realisations to affect his outer experience and daily living, then theunderlying Purpose will shine forth and he will no longer be working in thedark. You see, my brother, that all that I can do in these abstruse matters isto indicate what you can do, as an individual, to fit yourself to grasp divinepurpose, and thus see the divine design and patterns as they are in reality.Once you have taken the needed steps and complied with the requirements, themystery disappears.g. The final phase of the divine purpose is the most difficult of all toindicate, and when I say indicate, I mean exactly that, and nothing moredefinite and clear. Does it mean anything to you when I say that the ceremonialritual of the daily life of Sanat Kumara, implemented by music and sound andcarried on the waves of colour which break upon the shores of the three worldsof human evolution, reveal—in the clearest notes and tones and shades—thedeepest secret behind His purpose? It scarcely makes sense to you and isdismissed as a piece of symbolic writing, used by me in order to convey theunconveyable. Yet I am not here writing in symbols, but am making an exactstatement [247] of fact. As beauty in any of its greater forms breaks upon thehuman consciousness, a dim sense is thereby conveyed of the ritual of SanatKumara’s daily living. More I cannot say.Here are hints, therefore, as to the divine purpose; each of the sevensupplements and completes the other six. Only by attempting to grasp the wholeinner synthesis will we arrive at the merest hint of the nature of that exaltedconsciousness which has brought our planet and all that is within and upon itinto being."},{"pageContent":"RULE THIRTEENLet us now descend to thoughts more practical and within the range ofcomprehension, and consider the thirteenth rule somewhat in detail. It runs asfollows:Rule XIII.> Let the group get ready to reveal the hidden mystery. Let the group> demonstrate the higher meaning of the lessons learnt, and these are four and> yet are one. Let the group understand the Law of Synthesis, of unity and> fusion; let the threefold mode of working with that which is dynamic carry the> group together towards the Higher Three where the Will of God holds sway; let> Transfiguration follow Transformation, and may Transmutation disappear. Let> the O.M. be heard right at the center of the group, proclaiming God is All.The key to the significance and the clue to the secret of this rule are to befound in the preparatory rule given to applicants in the earlier book(Initiation, Human and Solar ). It is included here so that you can refer to itas you study its higher corresponding rule, as given to initiates and toadvanced disciplesRule XIII. For Applicants. Four things the disciple must learn and comprehendbefore he can be shewn the inmost mystery: first, the laws of that whichradiates; the five meanings of magnetisation make the second; the third istransmutation or the secret lost of alchemy; and lastly, the first letter of theWord which has been imparted, or the hidden name egoic.[248] In this earlier rule, the disciple is told that before he can advance tothe mysteries which will be revealed to him sequentially as he advances alongthe Path of Initiation, there are four things which he must “learn andcomprehend.” These are:1. The laws of that which radiates. 1 would call your attention to the fact thatthis does not refer to the Laws of Radiation. That which radiates comes underits own laws which are different to those which produced radiation. Studentsneed to read with increasing care as they advance upon the occult way whichleads to the Way of the Higher Evolution.2. He must study the five meanings of magnetisation . This refers to the fivemodes in which the Law of Magnetisation works; this is another name for the Lawof Attraction.3. He must comprehend what transmutation is and in which consists the secret art(now lost along with the Lost Word) of Alchemy. Esoterically speaking,transmutation is the mode whereby force is transmuted or changed into energy.This means (where a disciple is concerned) the transmutation or changing orstepping up of personality force into egoic energy.4. He must know the “hidden name egoic” or the first letter of the impartedWord. Two things should be noted here. The “Word” here does not refer to theSacred Word but to the name of the planetary Logos, the hidden name of SanatKumara Who is the soul of the world in all its phases, the manifesting Ego ofthe Logos on the cosmic mental plane. Only the first letter of that “ineffablename” is permitted expression to initiates until the fourth initiation. You willsee, therefore, how vast a field this instruction on Rule XIII covers.The higher correspondences of these four requirements are expressed in thefollowing terms:> 1. Let the group understand the Law of Synthesis . (This is the law which> governs the thinking of those great Lives Who form the Council of Sanat Kumara> in Shamballa.) [249]> 2. Let the threefold mode of working with that which is dynamic carry the> group together towards the Higher Three where the Will of God holds sway.> 3. Let Transfiguration follow Transformation and may Transmutation disappear.> 4. Let the O.M. be heard right at the centre of the group, proclaiming God is> All.You can gather from the above what a tremendous field of esoteric truth is herecovered and how abstruse to the average occult student is the theme. Again Iwould remind you that the real significance will only be perceived by thetrained initiate and that what I say here must necessarily be veiled and evenmeaningless to the non-initiate, even whilst radiantly clear to those who trulyknow. Again, I would remind you that I write this particular section of ATreatise on the Seven Rays entirely for initiates, and that aspirants who havenot taken initiation cannot understand or duly appreciate the inner meaning ofthese fourteen rules. In this fact lies no reason for discouragement, nor isthere any suggestion that those with initiate consciousness should endeavour toexplain, even if—through compassion or from the desire to stimulate approach tothe Mysteries—they desired to do so. No true initiate would be so tempted, forhe would realise that it would not only be impossible but also that there is avital necessity for the disciple to work out significances and meanings throughthe medium of his own life experiment and to arrive at understanding throughdirect experience. Then no questioning can ever arise and sure knowledge takesits place. There are no questions of any kind in the consciousness of those whoform the Hierarchy. The lower analytical concrete mind which questions andseparates this from that has been completely controlled and superseded; responseto indicated group activity takes place. Students need to realise moreconcretely that group consciousness, universal awareness, and thereforesynthetic effort, synthetic understanding and synthetic activity are possible toa Master or an initiate of the higher degrees. That involves the keynote of thissolar [250] system, particularly within this planet, the Earth; it will besucceeded in the next solar system by a type of life activity which is as yetonly known in Shamballa.Here I should like to pause a moment and interpolate some remarks.There are certain phases of teaching and knowledge which I have given to theworld which are relatively new—new to the modern esotericist and occult studentthough not new to disciples and initiates. It might be useful here if Imentioned one or two of these new aspects of the fundamental Truth which havebeen given by me to the public. If these new phases of the teaching have beenlater given to the public by other occult groups, it will have been because theinformation was gained by those who have read the books put out by A.A.B. for meor who are directly and consciously in touch with my Ashram.An instance of this is that book by C. W. Leadbeater on “The Masters and thePath” which was published later than my book, Initiation, Human and Solar . Ifthe dates of any given teaching are compared with that given by me, it willappear to be of a later date than mine. I say this with no possible interest inany controversy among occult groups or the interested public, but as a simplestatement of fact and as a protection to this particular work of the Hierarchy.I would remind you that the instructions given by me as, for instance, those inA Treatise on White Magic and A Treatise on the Seven Rays were givensequentially over a period of years, antedating the publishing of the books. Thesame time factor prevailed in the publishing of the earlier books. All my bookswere written over a long period of years, prior to publishing. All that appearsof the same type of information over other signatures harks back to these books.Even if denied by their writers, a comparison of the dates of publishing withthe original dates of issuing the instructions (in the form of monthly sets forreading and study in the Arcane School) or with the books published before theformation in 1925 of the Disciples [251] Degree of the Arcane School will provethis conclusively. Bear in mind this factor of timing. A.A.B. takes down to mydictation an average of seven to twelve pages of typing (single-spaced) eachtime she writes for me; but owing to the exigencies of my work I cannot dictateto her every day, though I have found that she would gladly take my dictationdaily if I so desired; weeks sometimes elapse between one dictation and another.I write the above paragraphs for the protection of the hierarchical work inyears to come and not for the protection of A.A.B. or myself....What are some of these newer truths for which I am responsible as transmittingagent to the world of occult students? Let me briefly state them in the order oftheir relative importance:1. The Teaching on Shamballa . Little has ever been given on this subject. Onlythe name was known. This teaching includes:> a. Information as to the nature of the will aspect.> b. Indications as to the underlying purposes of Sanat Kumara.> c. Directions as to the building of the antahkarana, which is the first step> towards achieving monadic consciousness, and thus the first step towards the> Way of the Higher Evolution.2. The Teaching on the New Discipleship . This has been revolutionary where theolder schools of occultism are concerned. The teaching includes:> a. A presentation of the new attitude of the Masters to Their disciples, due> to the rapid unfoldment of the mind principle and the growth of the principle> of “free will.” This changed technique negates the old attitudes, such as that> portrayed in the Theosophical literature, and it was a recognition of the> difficulties of correcting the wrong impression given which prompted H.P.B. in> one of her communications to the Esoteric Section of her day, to regret ever> having mentioned Their names. That earlier presentation was useful but has now> served [252] its purpose. Unless the schools based on the old methods change> their techniques and their approach to truth, they will disappear.> b. Information as to the constitution of the Hierarchy and of the various> Ashrams of which it is composed. I have presented the Hierarchy as the Ashram> of Sanat Kumara in its sevenfold form, thus linking will and love.> c. A presentation of the newer type of meditations, with its emphasis upon> visualisation and the use of the creative imagination; I have presented a> system of meditation which has eliminated the attention paid hitherto to> personal problems and the intense earlier focus on the relation of the> disciple and the Master. The keynote of group fusion and of service underlies> the newer form of meditation, and not this powerful emphasis upon the personal> relation of the disciple to the Master and the achievement of the individual> aspirant. This was degenerating into a form of spiritual selfishness and> separateness.3. The Teaching on the Seven Rays. The fact of the seven rays was well known tothe heads of the Theosophical Society, was mentioned very abstractly and vaguelyin The Secret Doctrine , and formed in an elementary form some of the teachinggiven in the Esoteric Section; the names of the rays were given, and someinformation as to their qualities, and the Masters on the rays, was imparted butnot much else. I have given out much information upon the subject and haveendeavoured to show the importance of this teaching from the psychologicalangle, because the new psychology is in the making. If esoteric teaching iseventually to be public in its presentation, it will be given out along thelines of psychology because esoteric teaching in its fullest and deepest senseconcerns the consciousness aspect of man and God.4. The Teaching on the new Astrology . This teaching too has gone out to a fewhundred students before its publication in book form. This new astrology hasbeen hitherto [253] ignored by those astrologers who have read it and (with theexception of four astrologers who have deeply appreciated it but who wish Iwould be more explicit) see little in it. I have given enough, could theopen-minded astrologer but realise, to establish the coming astrology on a firmbasis; the accuracy of what I have given will in the course of time heascertained when astrologers who are dealing with the horoscopes of advancedpeople and disciples will use the esoteric planets as given by me, and not theorthodox planets as usually used. The accuracy of their deductions willnecessarily depend upon their own point of development and also upon theirability to recognise an advanced person, a disciple or an initiate when theymeet him and undertake to cast his horoscope. If they are themselves advanceddisciples, they may have a tendency to set too rigid a standard for thoseseeking astrological deduction, and thus fail to recognise a disciple; if theyare not advanced, they may regard people as advanced who are far from being eventrue aspirants. In either case then the horoscope may prove inaccurate. It is ofno use to use the esoteric planets in relation to the average man.5. Information about the New Group of World Servers and their work. Thisinformation includes> a. The recognition of this group as intermediate between the Hierarchy and> Humanity.> b. The nature of their work as it influences the human soul and as it seeks> through the instrumentality of the men and women of goodwill to determine the> period in which we live.> c. The Triangle work which embodies two phases of their work, i.e., the> forming of the network of light as the channel of communication between the> Hierarchy and Humanity, and the forming simultaneously of the network of> goodwill, which is the objective expression of the subjective influence of> light. Ponder on this statement.6. The attempt to form an exoteric branch of the inner Ashrams. This isevidenced in the work I have done with a [254] special group of aspirants andaccepted disciples whose instructions, emanating from my Ashram, have beenembodied in the book Discipleship in the New Age (Vols. I and II).7. Teaching upon the new world religion , with its emphasis upon the three majorFull Moon periods (Aries, Taurus, Gemini, falling usually in April, May and Junerespectively) and the nine (occasionally ten) minor Full Moons each year. Thisleads to a consequent relation being established between the work of the Christand of the Buddha in the minds of spiritually inclined people everywhere, withthe result of a great broadening of the human aspiration. This work is as yetembryonic, but it should receive increasing attention. Eventually it willdemonstrate as the main linking unit between the East and the West, particularlyif Shri Krishna is shown to be an earlier incarnation of the Lord of Love, theChrist. Thereby three major world religions—the Christian, the Hindu and theBuddhist—will be intimately related, whilst the Mahommedan faith will be foundto be linked to the Christian faith because it embodies the work of the MasterJesus as He overshadowed one of His senior disciples, a very advanced initiate,Mahomet.A close study of all the above will indicate to you the lines along which Iwould like to see the work expand in future years. I would ask for a carefulstudy of these words, for I regard this as an important instruction and onewhich could be regarded as the skeleton outline of the work I wish to see done.It will involve an intensification of the work of the advanced section in theArcane School, a greater emphasis upon the Full Moon meetings, a carefulorganisation of the Triangle work and the Goodwill work as an added effort toaid the work of the New Group of World Servers, plus an attempt to recognise themembers of the New Group whenever and wherever contacted. This will not be atall an easy task, my brothers, if you look only for those who think and workyour way, or who recognise the Hierarchy as you recognise it, or if you excludethose who labour in relation to religious and other fields in a manner different[255] to yours. Forget not, as an instance of this, that the great LabourMovement in the world was initiated by one of the Masters and is implementedfrom His Ashram at this time.We come now to a detailed analysis of Rule XIII. In the foregoing pages I gaveyou certain broad principles and outlined a new aspect of the work which I hadundertaken to do for humanity—under instruction from the Hierarchy. The teachingI gave there is very abstruse; little of it can as yet be of real service to themajority of aspirants but a wide and general idea can take form and provide theimmovable background for later teaching. I would have you remember that theteaching which I have given out has been intermediate in nature, just as thatgiven by H.P.B., under my instruction, was preparatory. The teaching planned bythe Hierarchy to precede and condition the New Age, the Aquarian Age, falls intothree categories:> 1. Preparatory, given 1875-1890 . . . written down by H.P.B.> 2. Intermediate, given 1919-1949 . . . written down by A.A.B.> 3. Revelatory, emerging after 1975 . . . to be given on a worldwide scale via> the radio.In the next century and early in the century an initiate will appear and willcarry on this teaching. It will be under the same “impression,” for my task isnot yet completed and this series of bridging treatises between the materialknowledge of man and the science of the initiates has still another phase torun. The remainder of this century, as I told you elsewhere (Destiny of theNations , page 106), must be dedicated to rebuilding the shrine of man’s living,to reconstructing the form of humanity’s life, to reconstituting the newcivilisation upon the foundations of the old, and to the reorganising of thestructures of world thought, world politics, plus the redistribution of theworld’s resources in conformity to divine purpose. Then and only then will it bepossible to carry the revelation further.It is with the above indicated sequence in mind that I [256] come to theanalysis of the sentences in Rule XIII, beginning with the first:1. Let the group get ready to reveal the hidden mystery.The readiness here referred to has nothing to do with personal preparedness orwith the group unity which I have so often emphasised. It does not refer toindividual purity or consecration or to mental development or to grouprelationships, as they work out in harmony and understanding. I am consideringsomething far different to all these factors which are regarded as automatic andnecessarily present. I refer to that which is the result of all of them, just asthey in their turn are the result of soul contact. I refer to effects wroughtout in the group owing to the present and factual nature of the monadic controlwhich is taking place increasingly.What does this mean? It signifies the fact that the members of the group areeach and all of them upon the Path of Initiation at some one or other of itsstages and that the group, as a group, is in process of taking initiation, forinitiation is a process at this stage, and not an event. It signifies that thegroup antahkarana is built and is being consciously used, and that thereforedivine purpose is being sensed (even if only faintly so) and that the Plan isbeing obeyed and carried out. It signifies also that the three strands of the“rainbow bridge” are now so strong and so firmly anchored that they not onlyconnect the two aspects of the mental equipment (higher and lower mind), butthat they have been carried also through the three levels of the triadalconsciousness; it means also that these three strands are firmly anchored inwhat I have symbolically called the Council Chamber at Shamballa.This Council Chamber is not a location or a place, but a state of consciousnesswithin the all-enveloping Life. These three points of anchorage within thesphere of the planetary Consciousness, or (if you like it better, thoughremembering ever that we are speaking and thinking in terms of symbols) in theplanetary brain, find their feeble correspondence in [257] the three points ofsensitivity in the head of a disciple or initiate, that is, in the region of thepineal gland, the pituitary body and the carotid gland. These, as you know, areto be found within the areas to which we give the names the head centre, theajna centre and the alta major centre. These correspondences are very real, eventhough functioning upon a minute scale; the initiate achieves his desired“perfecting” when the triad within his head is related, and love, will andintelligence are functioning in synthesis. Here we find a relation to thespiritual Triad and the three points in the Council Chamber which are presidedover by the three Buddhas of Activity, and within Whose exalted consciousnessthe three strands of the antahkarana meet and become active in a wayincomprehensible to you. Necessarily, this great antahkarana is not constructedcorrectly except by those whose individual antahkaranas are likewise in processof construction.See you, therefore, the necessity of eventually organising a group in the worldwhich will be so constituted and so carefully chosen and interiorly related thatall its members are initiates, all have created their own “rainbow bridges” withunderstanding and accuracy, and all can now work in such complete unity that thegroup antahkarana becomes a channel of unimpeded communication direct fromShamballa to the group because every member of the group is a member of theHierarchy. In this manner the three planetary centres arrive at the neededrelationship, and another great triangle reaches true functioning activity. Whenthis takes place, a revelation undreamt of will be manifested upon the Earth; anew divine quality, of which no knowledge at present exists, will make itspresence felt, and the work of the Buddha and of the Christ, and the work of thecoming Avatar, will be superseded by One for Whom both Shamballa and theHierarchy have unitedly waited and of Whom the doctrine of the Messiah and thedoctrine of Avatars have been and are today only the dim distant symbols. Theypreserve this concept of the Great Revelation in the consciousness of men, inthe expectancy which the Hierarchy evidences, [258] and through the “preparatorywork” now being undertaken at Shamballa.The group, therefore, to whom I address this instruction is not the group orgroups who will first receive these papers. The instruction is intended for agroup which will come later and which will prepare the way, and of which some ofthe more advanced aspirants can form part if they “walk humbly with their God.”This, my brother, is one of the most advanced injunctions in any of the worldScriptures and is found in The Bible. It has no reference to humility as usuallyinterpreted and understood. It signifies the ability to view all life with asense of divine proportion and from the angle of spiritual mathematics, and(paradoxical as this may sound) with no sense of dualism. The usual meaning isnot correct. It involves acceptance and comprehension of purpose, and this insuch a manner that the consecrated personality—under control of the Monad, viathe antahkarana, and in cooperation with the one known God—walks the ways ofEarth as a channel for the three divine qualities (love, will and intelligence),but also as a channel for that which these three qualities will enable him laterto sense, know and reveal.These are solemn and important statements. They have within them the element ofprophecy, but it is prophecy which has no relation to the salvation of humanityin any sense at all. It is related to an active Appearance which will, under theLaw of Synthesis, indicate That which the three great planetary centres ofdivine life are unitedly intended to reveal. Something lies behind the threedivine aspects of so great an importance, beauty and revelatory strength thatall the happenings of all time, up to the present emerging Aquarian Age, havebeen only the initial and the initiatory preparation.In this rule we find posed two preparatory steps and four major undertakings ordemonstrations of fitness, if you like so to call them, for the work to be done.These latter correspond to the “four things the disciple must learn andcomprehend before he can be shewn the inmost mystery,” [259] as it is said inthe Rule for Applicants. There is a definite relation between the two sets ofrules and it is one which we shall note as we proceed. The two preparatoryinjunctions simply summarise the effects in the life of the disciple who hasapplied and learned the significance of the Rules for Applicants, but they arethis time demonstrated by a group of disciples who have passed through certaininitiations and are functioning as a unified group. The simplicity of thesubject is great and yet it is ever deemed to be complex. The applicant hasbecome soul conscious, and is therefore an initiate; remember always that thesoul on its own plane is an initiate of all degrees. Initiation is, in the lastanalysis, the realisation, the recognition in the brain consciousness of variousspheres and states of divine awareness, with a consequent life demonstration ofthis fact, this eternal fact. Because of this, the man thinks only in groupterms and does this automatically and without any consciousness that he is sodoing; he expresses this group integrity simply as a part of his nature, just asin the personality stage and during the elapsing aeons since individualisation,he has thought only and naturally in terms of the separated self.As long as a person makes a conscious effort to be group-conscious and has totrain and discipline himself to work in group formation and as part of a group,he is still centred in the personality. This personality expression may be of anexceedingly high order and the aspirant or disciple may be the highest kind ofselfless person, but true group living is as yet not present. The transitionstage is most difficult and oft bewildering; it presents its own problems, basedupon a newly presented phase of dualistic consciousness. The disciple reacts togroup conditions and group problems; he tunes in with facility on theconsciousness of those in the group; he is aware of group reactions andaspirations, but he is still himself; he is still passing through a stage ofinner adjustment to a state of being and of awareness for which all pastrelationships have provided no guiding precedent. The group and the grouppersonnel which are capable of adjustment (and which can carry out and [260]conform to Rule XIII for disciples and initiates) have become so merged with thesoul (within themselves and within all other selves) that the situation isreversed. It would now be an effort for such people to think and react aspersonalities. I word the problem thus, so as to clarify it for you, ifpossible.When this stage of centralisation is achieved, then the group can begin toreveal the hidden mystery. All that I can tell you about that mystery is that itconcerns the purpose and the reason for which our planetary Logos tookincarnation and became the informing Life of our planet, the Earth; it concernsthe necessity, inherent in His Own nature, to reach a point upon the cosmicladder of evolution which would make Him—as a result—the informing Life of asacred planet. Forget not that our planet is not yet a sacred planet, though itis close to that great transformation. The cosmic secret of this transformingprocess is one that Sanat Kumara is now learning, and when That whichovershadows Him during this incarnation has wrought the needed changes through aprocess of transformation and transmutation, then a great Transfiguration willtake place and He will take His place among those empowered to work through asacred planet.This process is that which implements the evolutionary process. Evolution is aneffect of this hidden work, emanating from cosmic levels; only when evolutionhas run its course through all the multiplicity of forms, of cycles, chains andspheres, of rounds and races and of world periods, will we know something of thetrue nature of the hidden mystery. In the Council Chamber of Shamballa it isbeing dimly sensed. The Buddha and the Christ are expressing the qualitieswhich—when more universally demonstrated—will indicate its nature, if I might soexpress it. They are together mobilising the equipment upon our planet whichwill make the revelation of the mystery inevitable. This should give you a hintand much food for thought. More I cannot say, and even this you will onlyvaguely [261] understand. Let us pass now to the second of the preparatorysteps.2. Let the group demonstrate the higher meaning of the lessons learnt, and theseare four and yet are one.Aspirants learn, as they proceed upon the Path of Probation, to see the meaningof their physical plane activities in terms of the world of desire, of theastral plane. What they do originates upon that plane and gives their deedsmeaning. This is the a.b.c. of elementary occultism and of true psychology.Later, they enter a higher world of meaning and find that “as a man thinketh inhis heart, so is he.” Thus the lesson of kama-manasic impulse is slowly masteredand (in the process of learning) desire, prompted by the mind and implemented bythe personality, loses its hold upon the aspirant. Later again, and as the soulbegins to dominate, he learns the meaning of love and slowly, and oft throughthe mastering of pain, he absorbs the significance or meaning of group activity,group relation, and group initiation. He stands, therefore, at this stage ready(as this Rule expresses it) to learn the higher meaning of four lessons,processes or stages which are in themselves, nevertheless, one lesson. The fourlessons which he has learnt up to this point have prepared him for the fourlessons which—as an initiate and as one whose consciousness is focussed in theSpiritual Triad—he must now master. To summarise, they constitute the fourphases of an activity which will bring him to a point of tension which willindicate the next possible initiatory stage. Four words could be used to expressthese processes: Radiation. Magnetisation. Transmutation. Impartation. Let mevery briefly indicate some of the elementary significances of these words to theinitiate-consciousness:1. Radiation . The initiate is a radiating centre of light and love. Thisradiation has two effects:> a. It has made him an essential and vital factor for unity in the Master’s> Ashram. [262]> b. It has enabled him to gather around him his own group and thus begin to> form his own ashram. The personnel of the world group which will reveal the> hidden mystery will all of them be “radiant centres” to a greater or lesser> degree. They will thus be invocative and evocative. This thought holds the> clue to the Law of Synthesis, of unity and of fusion as given in Rule XIII for> initiates.2. Magnetisation . The initiate who is radiating light and love is himself beingmagnetised by the highest of the present known divine aspects—Life. Thisexpresses itself through will and purpose and is therefore dynamic in character.The initiate is charged constantly with life, and consequently can work with theimpelling Law of Evolution which (as worded in the rule we are considering) will“carry the group together towards the Higher Three.” See you not how thedifferent phases of the teaching lead from one to another and provide a greatladder of approach to reality? I would call to your attention that in theFourteen Rules for Applicants and in the Fourteen Rules for Disciples andInitiates you have the two great foundational courses of the coming Schools ofthe Mysteries, for which I have prepared the world in Letters on OccultMeditation .3. Transmutation . This indicates here an achievement and not a process; thework of transmuting the lower nature into the higher and desire into love, oftransforming personality purpose into group livingness and being, has led tothat complete transfiguration which makes the entire process of transmutation nolonger needed. But—and this is the point to be emphasised—because of thisachievement, the art of transmutation is now the instrument which the initiatecan use and transmute that which is not himself, and thus consciously and withclear purpose further the ends of evolution. Transmutation “disappears” out ofhis own life, but the forces which have been transmuted into spiritual energybegin now to have a dynamic transmutative effect in the world of forms whereinhe now chooses to work and serve, according to his ray and ashramic intent.[263]4. Impartation . Reference to this is made in the Book of Revelation, found inThe New Testament . There we are told that the initiate is given a white stone,and in the stone “a new name” is found written; this is the “hidden name egoic.”I am at a loss at this point as to how to express the higher significance ofthis. This impartation marks a climaxing point in the attainment of the point oftension where the Sound can be heard and not the Word alone. Never forget thatthe O.M. is simply a symbolically sounded word which is intended to bring intothe minds of those upon the Path those two great points of tension wherein> a. The “hidden name egoic” is conferred upon the disciple. This, as far as he> is concerned, is the Word of his soul ray.> b. The Sound heard of which the O.M. is a symbol. This is the first letter of> the sevenfold Name of the planetary Logos. More upon this subject may not be> given, nor am I in a position to give it.These two preparatory injunctions will give you some idea of how abstruse is theteaching conveyed in the rules for initiates. The understanding and theexpressing of the four rules for applicants, as demonstrated by the disciple nowfunctioning in a group, can all be summed up in the word: Being. Having saidthat, what does it mean to you? Being, per se, can only be grasped by those whohave “come alive” monadically, who function in the three worlds of the SpiritualTriad with even greater positivity than the highly advanced personalityfunctions in the three worlds of human evolution; and who have grasped somewhatthe purpose for which Sanat Kumara has come into being and through directedlivingness is working out His intention.We can now take up the four major injunctions given to the initiated disciple ashe prepares to work under the Laws of the Spirit, as a conscious soul, and (forpurposes of service) through a personality. There are many initiates workingwithout a body of contact which a personality provides, but we shall notconsider them in our studies. We shall only deal with those disciples who canwork as a group [264] on the physical plane, fulfilling ashramic intent on theone hand and preparing themselves to tread the Way of the Higher evolution uponthe other. The first major injunction in this Rule XIII reads as follows:3. Let the group understand the Law of Synthesis, of unity and fusion.The Law of Synthesis, as you know, is the law of spiritual existence, and one ofthe three major laws of our solar system, as well as of our planet. It is abasic cosmic law, applied from sources of which we know nothing, as are the Lawsof Attraction and of Economy. I dealt with these somewhat at length in ATreatise on Cosmic Fire, and of these two other laws I have given much andhinted more. Of the Law of Synthesis, I can tell you but little. It is the lawgoverning the activities of the Spiritual Triad, and the conditioning law ofmonadic living. It works neither through the use of the energy of love northrough the application of the principle of economy. The fulfillment of theselaws is necessary and preparatory to an understanding of the Law of Synthesis,and under the Law of Synthesis the worlds of illusion and glamour are masteredand the control of maya is negated; under the Law of Attraction the nature oflove is revealed, first of all through desire for form life, and then throughattraction to the soul and a consequent resolution of the dualities of soul andpersonality. This brings about a unity which—in due time—serves to reveal agreater potential dualism—that of soul and spirit; this fundamental duality mustalso be resolved, leaving the essential, universal planetary duality,Spirit-matter, present in time and space.The Law of Synthesis has reference to this relationship and to the factualnature of the tremendous assertion of H. P. Blavatsky that “Matter is spirit atits lowest point of manifestation and spirit is matter at its highest.” It is ofthis synthesis that the group must learn; it is this relation which they mustbegin to comprehend, and the distinction (for there is a distinction) betweensynthesis, unity and fusion must in due time be mastered. [265]To you, it may seem that these three words connote the same thing, but that isnot so; fusion is ever related to the conscious merging of soul and substanceuntil a point of equilibrium is achieved; at this point, unity becomes possibleand the point of balance—through the attainment of a point of tension—isdisturbed. This takes place in three definitely defined stages when the fusionof personality and soul is brought about through the self-initiated effort ofthe disciple: first of all upon the Probationary Path, then upon the Path ofDiscipleship, and finally at the third initiation, upon the Path of Initiation.It is essential that you ever remember that this third initiation, theTransfiguration, is the first major initiation from the standpoint of theHierarchy, though the third from the limited vision of the aspirant. Theinitiate then goes on to learn the significance of unity in its true sense; thisis only possible when monadic influence can be consciously registered and whenthe antahkarana is in process of conscious construction. I emphasise the word“conscious” here; much of the work of fusion and of attainment proceedsunconsciously under the fundamental Law of Evolution, which is a Shamballic law,embodying as it does the working out of the inscrutable will of Deity. The worknow being done on the three stages of the Path has to be intentional and,therefore, consciously undertaken and intelligently planned; it must be backed,first of all by determination, then by the spiritual will, and finally as animplemented aspect of purpose.Fusion might therefore be regarded as the individual process of spiritualintegration, relating—in full waking consciousness—the three divine aspects inman. Unity might be regarded as the conscious adaptation of the initiateddisciple to the greater whole, as his absorption into the group through hisobedience to the laws of the soul, and as governing his attitude to that inwhich he lives and moves and has his being. This goes on until he sees nodistinction, registers no differences and is aware of no separative reaction,and all this because the instinct to separation no longer exists in him. Itrefers to his oneness in the world of [266] energies in which he moves, makinghim an unimpeded channel for energy and, therefore, an integral and smoothlyworking part of his total environment and, above all, of the group to which,automatically and under the laws which govern his soul, he has been attracted.He has learnt all that he can learn through the processes of differentiation towhich he has been subjected for aeons. The principle of intelligence controlshim and the principle of love motivates him, and he has consequently attainedunity. But, my brothers, it is the unity of his ray, of his Ashram and of thePlan; it is the unity of the Hierarchy which exists for purposes of service andactive work in its seven major groups and its three main departments ordivisions. It is indeed attainment and liberation. But more must still be learntif the Way of the Higher Evolution is to be trodden and a choice between theseven cosmic Paths made—a choice which curiously enough is not dependent uponray, for all rays are to be found on all these paths.This can only be done through synthesis . This Law of Synthesis> “works through the Seven which yet are One; which points to the seven ways and> yet those upon the seven ways are one; which initiates the universal into the> many but preserves its integrity; which originates the plan but preserves> intact the purpose; which sees the multiplicity needed under the Law of> Sacrifice but subordinates that law unto the Law of Synthesis; which breathes> forth the many Breaths and yet is Life Itself.”In this attempt to paraphrase an ancient definition of the Law of Synthesis, Ihave said all that I can upon the theme. Only as disciples build the antahkaranaand function as the Spiritual Triad within the monadic Life will inspirationcome, just as they learnt to make contact with the soul and to function as thethreefold personality within the soul, and then revelation ensued. Naught isgained by further elucidation. Proceed with the work of building the antahkaranaand light will shine upon your way and revelation will attend your steps.[267] The second major injunction (though the fourth phrase in our rule) is:4. Let the threefold mode of working with that which is dynamic carry the grouptogether towards the Higher Three.This injunction holds in it information which is somewhat new to the moderninitiate, functioning in a physical body; it is difficult for him to grasp evena modicum of its significance. To convey any faintest hint of its meaning isincomparably difficult for me where disciples such as you are concerned. All Ican do is to fall back upon the Law of Analogy, by means of which the microcosmcan arrive at a glimmer of understanding of the more obvious aspects of theMacrocosm.First, let me make reference to the words “the Higher Three”; let me see if Icannot somewhat clarify the entire complex idea. The words “Higher Three” referto the three Buddhas of Activity Who still remain actively cooperating with theLord of the World. They are, as you have been told, close to Sanat Kumara andcame with Him when He decided to take incarnation through the medium of ourplanet, Earth. It is difficult to understand Their mysterious and peculiarfunctions. They do not belong to this solar system at all; They have passedthrough the human stage in such far distant and remote world cycles that theexperience is no longer a part of Their consciousness; They act as advisors toSanat Kumara where His initial purpose is concerned, and that is why the words“the will of God holds sway” occur in this rule. It is Their supreme task to seethat, in the Council Chamber of Shamballa, that purpose is ever held steadilywithin the “area of preparation” (I know not how else to word it) of thatCouncil. They function, in a peculiar sense, as linking intermediaries betweenthe Logos of our solar system and the informing Life of the constellation Libra;They relate these two great centres of energy to our planetary Logos.In the last solar system They were the planetary Logoi of three planets in whichthe mind principle reached its [268] highest stage of development; They embodyin Themselves in a most peculiar manner the wisdom aspect of the second ray, asit expresses itself primarily through what has been called in the Bhagavad Gita“skill in action.” Hence Their name, the Buddhas of Activity.Sanat Kumara has now moved one step ahead of Them upon the great cosmic ladderof evolution, for an aspect of the Law of Sacrifice has conditioned Them.However, within the planetary consciousness and among Those Who work out thedivine purposes, there are none Who approach the Eternal Youth and these threeBuddhas in point of Evolution. They work out Their plans—these four GreatLives—through the medium of the Lords of the Seven Rays. Under the Law ofAnalogy, They are to Sanat Kumara what the three mind aspects upon the mentalplane are to the disciple and the initiate. They represent in action:> The concrete or lower mind of the planetary Logos,> That energy which we call the soul and which the disciple calls “the Son of> Mind,”> The higher or abstract mind,but all this from cosmic levels and with cosmic implications. It was Theiractivity which (after evolution had run a long course) brought about the act ofindividualisation and thus brought the human kingdom into existence. In amysterious sense, therefore, it might be said that the three Buddhas of Activityare responsible for:1. The Act of Individualisation . The work of the particular Buddha responsibleat the time for this major activity, has been temporarily quiescent sinceLemurian days. He works, when active, through the seventh ray and draws theneeded energy from two constellations: Cancer and Gemini.2. The Act of Initiation . I would call your attention to the word act; I am nothere referring to process. His work only begins at the third initiation when theplanetary Logos is the Initiator. At that initiation, the will aspect begins tofunction. The Buddha behind the initiatory process is extremely active at thistime; He works through the Christ [269] and the Lord of the second ray, drawingthe needed energy from the constellations Capricorn and Aquarius.3. The Act of Identification . This involves what has been called a “moment ofopening-up,” during which the initiate sees that which lies within the cosmicintent and begins to function not only as a planetary unit but as a cosmic focalpoint. The Buddha of Activity, responsible for this type of planetary activity,works with the Lord of the first ray and functions as an outpost of theconsciousness of the informing life of Aries and of Leo. His work is only nowbeginning to assume importance.I realise that this information has little meaning to you and lies beyond yourunderstanding, but so was much that I gave you in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire. Itssole value for you lies in the revelation of the linking up and the interplaybetween all parts of our solar system, our universe and the zodiac. Throughthese three great Buddhas there is a basic relation, established aeons ago andsteadfastly held, between our planet, three of the seven sacred planets, and sixof the major constellations—the three and the six which most uniquely concernthe fourth kingdom in nature. Other planets and other constellations are alsorelated to the human family, but their relation is more aggressively (if I mightuse that word) related to the three subhuman kingdoms; with these we shall nothere deal. Their relation to the human kingdom has been covered by me in theastrological section of this Treatise: A Treatise on the Seven Rays , Vol. III(Esoteric Astrology) .You will note that I have here indicated the existence of five triangles:> 1. That existing in the interplay of the energies of the three Buddhas of> Activity Who create a triangle, closely related to the planet Saturn.> 2. The triangle of the three rays through whom the three Buddhas work.> 3. The three planets which are connected with the three Lords of the three> rays and by means of which They express Their impelling energy. [270]> 4 - 5. Two interlaced triangles, created by the six constellations from which> the three Buddhas of Activity draw Their needed energy and to which They are> uniquely related through Their individual karma. These two interlaced> triangles are the cause of the six-pointed star, so familiar among the many> occult symbols.From the Law of Analogy, another exceedingly important triangle is found in thehuman body and (esoterically considered) is related to the subject underconsideration:1. The ajna centre, embodying the directing energy of that body of activitywhich we call the personality.2. The throat centre, which is peculiarly active today in all human beings; thistestifies to the success of the creative work of the Buddhas of Activity. This,in its turn, has a small symbolic triangle of its own, to which I would callattention: the thyroid gland and the para-thyroids.3. The centre at the base of the spine . This is galvanised into activity at acertain stage of the evolutionary process, by energy emanating from the Buddhasof Activity Who are the least active at this particular time. It is an energypouring towards the fourth kingdom but not directed towards any individual.These great Lives work through major groups. Their potency is such that it wouldotherwise prove destructive.The purpose of Deity is necessarily embodied in a mental proposition; it isthrough this mental proposition that the three Buddhas of Activity implementTheir work. I can put it no clearer. There will come a time in the experience ofall initiates when—each for himself—a formulation of this mental propositionwill be absolutely necessary. By means of this, each initiate will embody hisindividual understanding of the divine purpose as the Plan has been revealed tohim.This he can do only through the means of group experience, in cooperation withhis group and when the group—as a whole—has reached a similar point ofrealisation [271] has together touched the fringes of this highest of allrevelations for humanity. When, for the first time, they succeed in doing this,they will come—as a group—under the direct emanation of the Higher Three andunder an aspect of the Council Chamber at Shamballa which has been hithertounknown and unrealised. This will connote a high stage of initiation of thegroup and is, in effect, connected with inter-hierarchical activity. It is aworking out into the consciousness of the group members of an event which hastaken place within the Ashram of Sanat Kumara, the Hierarchy itself; this takesplace through the stimulation of all the Ashrams at a certain Full Moon, andconcerns the relation of the Ashrams as a whole to Shamballa, and not toHumanity.Can you grasp something of what I am endeavouring somewhat unsuccessfully toconvey? There is an ashramic activity of which disciples know nothing in theirbrain consciousness until such time as the third initiation has been taken andthe results of it are then dimly but increasingly sensed. It is related to theinterplay between Shamballa and the Hierarchy, but not between the Hierarchy andHumanity. It concerns the purpose and the plan as the latter is the instrumentof the former. The event of realisation takes place via the triad formed by aMaster and His two senior disciples, or it is formed by three Masters all uponthe same ray, as for instance, the Master K.H. and his Ashram, myself and myAshram and another affiliated Ashram.It is for this reason that in all exoteric groups connected with an Ashram,there is always a group leader and two others who are the reflection or thecorrespondence to the higher triad. This is part of the externalisation of theHierarchy which is proceeding rapidly at this time.The importance of understanding the function of triangles is a prime necessity.A hint lies here for students in the political realm, where every country, underdiffering names, has its chosen ruler, and its ministers responsible for homeaffairs (or interior relations), and its foreign secretary, responsible forexoteric relationships.[272] One further point anent the Buddhas of Activity might here be of interest.Each of Them has a special relation to the three races which have been or arestrictly human: these are the third, the fourth and the fifth rootraces which wecall the Lemurian, the Atlantean and the present Aryan race (I do not use theword “Aryan” in the manner of the German race). In some peculiar manner, Theyrepresent in Shamballa the soul of each of these three races. One thingcomplicates this question for you, but it is in reality quite simple. The samesouls re-incarnate in each race, and each soul therefore comes in turn under theinfluence of each of the three Buddhas, each of Whom is of a quality differentto that of his two Associates. They represent—in Their lowest aspect—the threeaspects of the mind, as I earlier said. There is:1. The instinctual nature as it develops into the mind nature and makes atransition into an automatic, subconscious character and—at the sametime—assumes some of its paralleling higher qualities.2. The lower concrete mind in its more developed stage, as it gradually assumescontrol and supersedes instinct in the consciousness of man. The Buddhas ofActivity preside over what might be called (using a technical, occult term) theahamkara principle—the mind as it serves the selfish interests of man andenables man thereby to achieve a sense of proportion and a finer estimate ofvalues. Forget not that selfishness is a stage of unfoldment, and that it is anecessary stage whereby humanity learns the price of self-interest.3. The personality mind . This assumes control over the man and leads him toprove the nature of power and of success and—above all else—of integration. Thistoo is a necessary phase and precedes a stage of awakening.These three great Lives Who have associated Themselves with the Lord of theWorld might be regarded as constituting aspects of His personality, though thisis not technically [273] so. The name Sanat Kumara is not His true name; it isonly the first letter of that name which is known only to the Masters, whilstthe second letter is known only to the Chohans. The first syllable of His nameis known in the Council Chamber at Shamballa, but the rest of His name remainsunknown as yet. The three Buddhas of Activity are to the planetary Logos (togive you another definition) what the Spiritual Triad is to the dedicatedpersonality of the initiated disciple, for such is the spiritual status of theplanetary Logos; the one of the three Buddhas now coming into activity is theone Who works through the spiritual will.Within the body of the planetary Logos humanity is slowly building that whichthey call the antahkarana; this is, in reality, the linking thread between thehead centre of Sanat Kumara and His heart centre. Ponder on these words. Thereis a mystery involved here and it is little that I can do to make it clearer. Ashumanity builds or creates the triangles of light and of goodwill, they are inreality invoking a response activity from two of the Buddhas of Activity—the OneWho works through the medium of the will aspect, and the One Who works throughlove in humanity, intelligently applied. Forget not that these three greatBuddhas summarise in a peculiar sense the transmuted essence of the previoussolar system in which intelligent activity was the goal. Today, that essenceunderlies all the activity of this solar system but is motivated by love, whichwas not the case in the earlier manifestation. The Buddhas Themselves form adeeply esoteric Triangle.The two types of triangles now being created by a mere handful of people arerelated to that basic triangle. A third type of triangle will at some much laterdate be constructed but only when these two earlier types are well establishedin the consciousness of humanity. Then the activity of all the three Buddhaswill be involved and present, and a major planetary integration will take place.This is symbolised in man when the three centres in the head (the ajna centre,the brahmarandra centre, and the alta major centre) are [274] all functioningand unshakably related, thereby constituting a triangle of light within thehead.From the triangles now being created and those later to be assembled, theBuddhas of Activity will extract that essential quality (at present very rarelyto be found) which will go to the building of this aspect of the planetaryantahkarana.The triangles of light and of goodwill are essentially invocative. Theyconstitute the a.b.c. of the coming Science of Invocation. Their strength isdependent upon the depth of feeling in the one case, and the strength of thewill in the other, with which they are created. I have here given thosedisciples who are launching this new project which is so close to my heart a newand useful hint. This work must go on. It is because the entire concept is sonew and different to anything hitherto projected that it seems so impossible ofachievement; the triangles project has its incentive in such highly esotericsources that some disciples regard the work as exceedingly difficult and thuscomplicate, by their thinking, its essential simplicity; others regard it as thesimplest thing in the world, and by an emphasis upon the exoteric and theorganisational angle, they again hinder the true type of triangle being created.Disciples need to be aware of the true proposed plan and find ways to make clearthe middle position between the difficulties brought forward and thesimplicities which distort.Perhaps I may help to clarify somewhat the minds responsible for the initialsteps in this deeply esoteric enterprise. It is different to the intellectualand practical work which the men and women of goodwill are asked to do and willdo; it is not what some earnest people regard as goodwill work or a phase of thegoodwill work. The forming of triangles of light and of goodwill concerns thereservoir of energy upon the inner and etheric side of life which willautomatically and with full circulatory effect enable the exoteric work of themen and women of goodwill to make progress. It is not goodwill per se, but thecreation of triangles of energy within the etheric body of the planet which[275] are deliberately qualified by goodwill. The two phases of the work arenecessarily complementary to each other but must not be regarded as one. Thetriangles of light must be qualified by or become the agents of goodwill, andthe two groups are closely interrelated. The men and women of goodwill need knownothing of these triangles unless it is deemed wise and they are individuallyadvanced enough to react correctly, but their work along the lines of goodwillwill be successful or non-successful (I speak from the long range view)according to the intensity of purpose and the depth of love demonstrated by thetwo groups of triangle members.Those responsible for the creative work upon the outer field must begin with theesoteric work. I am writing here for disciples, some of whom are members of myAshram, and for the New Group of World Servers; these are responsible forcarrying forward the work as planned. The two groups of triangles already formedare in reality building a thoughtform anent this work which will evoke responsefrom the true builders.It will be apparent to you, therefore, that this creative work, with itsintelligent and practical purposes and its ability when rightly functioning tounite the exoteric and the esoteric workers in one spiritual undertaking,originates in reality in Shamballa itself and was grasped—as to intent andpurpose—by Masters upon the first and second rays, though primarily the secondray disciple and Master understood it the most easily. Later, when steady andsystematic work has been done, and the idea is familiar to the public, thisactivity will form an important part of the new world religion and be betterunderstood; it will have its own inner group who will work entirelysubjectively, building the triangles of light and of goodwill, and then willwork objectively, directing the activities of those who are building theorganisational aspect of triangles of practical goodwill on Earth with aneffective subsidiary activity.That time is not yet. Today we have the creation of a general thoughtform or thegerminating of the seed of an [276] idea. Later, when the true outer workbegins, its potency will be objectively demonstrated because the Buddhas ofActivity will gradually become aware of the existence of the thoughtform in itsnature of light and its quality of goodwill. They will then pour of Their lifeinto it as need arises and emergency decrees. Then gradually “the will of Godwill hold sway,” as our injunction expresses it. Paralleling all this will bethe work of the men and women of goodwill throughout the world, but in itselfentirely objective—worldwide and amazingly useful.Disciples need to learn to think in terms of group synthesis. This implies theachieving by them of deepened subjective relationships and increased sensitivityto the higher impression and the inner inspiration. The vertical life of thespirit and the horizontal life of relationship must be expressed simultaneouslyin some measure, before the significance of these Rules can be somewhat grasped.We have been considering Shamballa, and I have given you some information(hitherto not communicated in words) re the Council Chamber of Sanat Kumara andof Those Who constitute its membership. I would pause here to remind you of twofacts:> 1. Shamballa is a state of consciousness or a phase of sensitive awareness> wherein there is acute and dynamic response to divine purpose—a response made> possible by the synthesis of purpose and of spiritual relationship which> exists between Those Who are associated with Sanat Kumara.> 2. Brotherhood, as it essentially is, constitutes a major mystery; also it is> one which is only in process of solving, and that only on the two higher> levels of the cosmic physical plane—those levels which we call the logoic and> the monadic.I am aware that you understand brotherhood in terms of the One Father and Hischildren. That understanding is in itself so limited and inaccurate that itserves mainly to distort the truth; yet all that you can grasp at this time is[277] embodied in this concept. The nearest description of the true relationshipmight be said to be as follows: Brotherhood is an expression of the relationwhich the planetary Logos (on the cosmic mental plane) bears to His Personalityas it expresses itself through the planet with all its forms of life, upon thecosmic physical plane; this relationship is focussed through Sanat Kumara Who isthe individualised Mind of that great Life. Wording it otherwise, the planetaryLogos on His Own plane is to Sanat Kumara what the soul is to the humanpersonality upon the physical plane in the three worlds. The sum total of therelation and of the relationships set up is, therefore, inadequately covered bythe word “brotherhood.” “Fellowship,” so frequently used to express a similaridea, is in reality the mode whereby a dimly sensed brotherhood seeks to makeits presence felt. The words “the fellowship of Christ” indicate the emergenceof this concept subjectively upon the mental plane; this will be followed, astime elapses, by concrete manifestation upon the physical plane. It is this ideawhich lies behind the glibly used words “idea, ideal and idol,” and which isalso responsible for the growing sense of responsibility which characterises allhuman advancement upon the way of life. It is this basic idea which governs theCouncil Chamber at Shamballa and which constitutes the motivating impulse behindthe planetary expression of livingness. It is this also which characterises theideal for which the Hierarchy stands and which implements the Plan; it is thisspiritual planning which results in the growing “forms of relationship” whichtoday seem to be taking definite shape in the concretising of the divineproject: Right Human Relations.I have written these opening remarks because it is this elevated understandingof brotherhood which conditions divine purpose and which leads to the spiritualplanning that will give you the due to the third major injunction, with this weshall now deal. This injunction is worded as follows:5. Let Transfiguration follow Transformation, and may Transmutation disappear.[278] I would here remind you that in these fourteen rules we must approach ourtheme from the angle of the initiate-consciousness and not from that of theblended soul-personality consciousness. It is the higher approach which is hereindicated, the problem of the initiate-group and not that of the individualwithin the group. Hence the great difficulty in putting any of these teachingsinto words. To the average aspirant to accepted discipleship, the three wordswhich distinguish this third major injunction (but which symbolically constitutethe fifth injunction in the rule) might be defined as follows: The ideasconveyed are those of an aspirant to the Mysteries as he faces initiation. Letus take these words in the order given in Rule XIII.1. Transfiguration— that stage upon the Path of Initiation wherein the thirdinitiation is undergone, wherein the personality is irradiated by the full lightof the soul and the three personality vehicles are completely transcended; theyhave become simply forms through which spiritual love may flow out into theworld of men in the salvaging task of creation.2. Transformation —the evolutionary process which is carried on upon the Path ofDiscipleship, in which the disciple transforms his lower threefold “appearance”or personality and begins to display divine “quality.” His physical body becomesobedient to the dictates of his mind, which is becoming responsive to the highermind through the medium of the soul; his emotional nature becomes the receptacleof buddhi or of the intuition; then, after the third initiation it disappearsaltogether, and the buddhic vehicle becomes the main instrument of sentiency.The mind, in due course, is equally transformed by impression from the highermind, as it endeavours to implement the will nature of the Monad.3. Transmutation —the method whereby that which is lower is absorbed by thehigher, whereby force is transmuted into energy, whereby the energy of the threelower centres is carried up into the three higher centres (head, heart andthroat) and which later enables the initiate to [279] centralise all theenergies in the three directing centres in the head. This transmuting processgoes forward under the pressure of daily life experience, under the magneticeffect of soul contact, and as the inevitable result of evolution itself.All these three spiritualising processes are well known, in theory at least, toall spiritual aspirants; they are expressions of soul-personality intention andeffective interplay; they also constitute a paralleling activity to the task ofbuilding the antahkarana, as modes of alignment play a large part in the processof transmutation.It is not, however, with these attitudes, processes and interpretations that theinitiate is concerned, but with the significance of these processes in terms ofthe completed antahkarana and from the point of view of the “angle of intention”of the Monad. In other words: What do Transfiguration and Transformation signifyto Members of the Hierarchy as They face the Way of the Higher Evolution? Whatcan these words imply to Those for Whom the soul, the mediating principle, nolonger has any factual significance?Consider for a moment that the initiate who has undergone the first majorinitiation (the Transfiguration) and the two initiations of the threshold (theBirth and Baptism of the Christian Mysteries) has created the antahkarana inorder to establish direct relation between the Monad and the personality,between the centre of universal awareness or identification and theform-expression in the three worlds. The antahkarana is constructed andconstitutes an active channel of contact. The soul which has for ages directedthe various and varying personalities is no longer in existence; the causal bodyhas disappeared, shattered at the moment when the initiate (at the fourthinitiation) cries out and says: “My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?” TheTemple of Solomon, the spiritual temple “not made with hands, eternal in theHeavens,” is no longer required; it has served its ancient purpose, and thatwhich has been deemed eternal must disappear in the light of [280] THAT to whicheternity is only a phase of that which shall later be revealed. All that nowremains for the initiate are the two points of living purpose to which we givethe names of spirit-matter or life-appearance. The lesson ahead of the initiateis to realise the inner meaning (not the obvious and easily grasped meaning)that spirit is matter at its highest point, and matter is spirit at its lowest.This involves the free interplay of life-energy, consciously applied as theresult of age-long processes, and matter-force, via the antahkarana. The“rainbow bridge” becomes a channel for the impact of monadic or life energy uponsubstance, so that substance, taking form under the cyclic intention of theplanetary Logos, may become increasingly coloured or qualified by the energy ofuniversality. You can see from the above somewhat involved sentences howinadequate is language to express the understanding and the intention of theHierarchy.To the initiate, therefore, the two words, Transfiguration and Transformation,mean something quite different than they mean to a disciple, whilstTransmutation is now meaningless to him, for there is nothing within him whichrequires transmuting. It might consequently be stated that:1. Transmutation concerns the expression of the life force upon the three lowerplanes of human living and evolution.2. Transformation concerns in a most peculiar manner the three aspects of mindupon the mental plane:> a. The lower mind> b. The son of mind, the soul> c. The higher mind.3. Transfiguration concerns the life of the Spiritual Triad upon its own threelevels of identification.To this might be added the fact that:1. The three lower planes of transmutation are the dense, liquid and gaseoussub-planes of the cosmic physical plane.2. The mental plane is a unique location (or state of consciousness) whereon orwherein the lower planes are [281] subjected to impression from the threehigher. The higher three and the lower three are subjected to a definitelyesoteric and mysterious process, and it is on this plane that the work oftransmutation is completed—from the angle of the initiate.3. The three planes of the Spiritual Triad are the spheres whereontransformation goes forward. This transformation has naught to do with thetransforming of the personality, but is uniquely related to the interior work ofthe Hierarchy and the effect of this living, developing intensity upon theMembers of the Hierarchy. Five planes are therefore involved in these two phasesof the divine work.4. The two highest planes (the monadic and the logoic) are the planes oftransfiguration, from the point of view of the higher initiate. By then theprocesses of transmutation have dropped below the threshold of consciousness,and though the initiate (working with forms in the three worlds) has hisinstrument upon the outer physical plane, his own work and hierarchical activityis strictly triadal and monadic, with a steadily growing responsiveness tologoic intent.Let us now consider the phases of transfiguration and transformation as far asis possible in an exoteric instruction, and “may transmutation disappear” forall disciples as time elapses, and that with speed—owing to the great need todayfor hierarchical workers.It might here be asked: What is the work undertaken by the Masters Themselvesupon the three planes of the Spiritual Triad? Students are well aware that manyof the Masters are occupied with the evolutionary processes of the variouskingdoms in nature in the three lower worlds. They forget that the majority arenot so occupied. Have you ever wondered what it is that incites a Master to stayworking in the three worlds and with His mind focussed upon its evolutionaryprocesses? Have you ever considered what else it might be possible thatintrigued and demanded His interest? The self-centred attitude of mankind isinclined to believe that human need, and incidentally the need of the [282]other kingdoms in nature, are all that prompts the Hierarchy to carry on itswork of salvaging and stimulation. But that is only a partial estimate of thework which They are doing. In the processes of carrying forward Their work, theconsciousness of the Master is being steadily expanded, and this because of thenature of Their work in the three worlds; it necessarily becomes more and moreinclusive. That is the effect upon Him, as He works on behalf of humanity or onbehalf of the other kingdoms in nature. There is a definite and evolutionaryeffect. But on the higher three levels of the Spiritual Triad, another type ofevolutionary impulse is directing His activities. I have told you elsewhere thatconsciousness (as we understand it) is being transcended, and a new aspect ofuniversal sentiency is taking its place. To this development I have given theinadequate name of Identification . This is a word which involves consciousness,which invokes the will, which is dynamic in nature, inclusive in contact, andwhich is also based upon the doctrine of non-separativeness.This, however, is only a beginning of an entirely new phase of development;consciousness eventually drops below the level of perception. It becomes asautomatic and unregistered in its expression as animal instinct is to the humanbeing. It functions, but the man is not consciously aware of it. It is aprotective mechanism. The will aspect of the Monad supersedes but does notnegate love (which has become, in its turn, instinctual); a one-pointed,rapier-like assumption of identification takes the place of the inclusivenesshitherto felt and practised. Perhaps I can convey to you something of what Imean by pointing out that the circle with the point at the centre is symbolic ofthe perfected man. He is rounded out; he is inclusive both vertically (soulcontact) and horizontally (human relationship), yet he stands at the centre ofhis consciousness and of its self-imposed ring-pass-not. From thence he nevermoves, but is aware all the time of all that proceeds within his sphere ofinfluence. Here is the symbol of the Master, from a specific point ofattainment.[283] But the Master Himself is not static. His field of work is clear; Hisrealm of contacts—human, subhuman and super-human—is also clear. Within thering-pass-not and in the world of sentiency and in relation to the world ofloving understanding, He stands the Master.It is at this precise point in time and space that the work of Transformationbegins for the Master—a transformation which is brought about by the unfoldmentand the development made possible upon the three levels of the Spiritual Triad.As this transformation takes place, a new activity supervenes which finallyenables the Master to break through the planetary ring-pass-not, and thus arriveat the door of the Higher Evolution.What I have now to say may be made somewhat clearer by means of the followingsymbol. The Master has now penetrated into another cosmic level, but He is stillwithin the aura of the One Life. Now the cosmic astral plane is revealed to Him.He sees the reason why, first of all, sentiency had to be developed; why it hadthen to be used and mastered and finally had to be completely negated—negated insuch a manner that it dropped below the level of consciousness. There is noglamour upon the cosmic astral plane, and only those who have dominated sentientreaction upon all levels of the cosmic physical plane and are completely freefrom it, can then—through the illumined will and through the power of thatmysterious quality (if I may so call a factual expression) ofidentification—direct the lowest aspect of cosmic desire upon the cosmic astralplane. This necessarily has to be tuned in with that to which they areirrevocably related. This identification is therefore the highest expression ofdivine purpose upon the cosmic physical plane, even whilst it is the lowestaspect of the cosmic astral desire. Therefore, my brothers, the transformationwith which this rule deals is the transformation of consciousness intoidentification. More than that I may not say. To express the true meaning I haveno words or symbols.In this line of approach through identification, the Master builds that of whichthe spiritual correspondence is [284] the manasic antahkarana. The antahkaranawhich is now emerging is a projection from the Ashram of a Master; there are,therefore, seven ways into the Way of the Higher Evolution. These seven wayscorrespond to the seven Ashrams upon the seven Rays; they are related also tothe seven initiations, to the seven principles of man, and to all the other manyseptenates. It is the force of Will, generated by the Master, during the processof> 1. Attaining the fifth initiation> 2. Working in the three worlds of creative salvaging> 3. Achieving ashramic purpose and consequent group activity> 4. Manifesting ray energy> 5. Demonstrating a faculty which is known only to initiates who have passed> beyond the third initiation.This provides the focussed intention which enables the Master to attain what iscalled transformation, and later, to project the dynamic impulse of Hisspiritual will in such a manner that He succeeds in piercing the planetaryring-pass-not; He is then given the freedom of the world, and not just thefreedom of the worlds.It will be obvious that I am dealing with the subject of the sixth initiation.When this initiation has been consummated, the Chohan then transcends the threeworlds of the Spiritual Triad and is focussed as a “projecting agent of theLighted Will” as it expresses itself upon the monadic plane. This stage ofunfoldment is in reality the Ascension initiation, the true significance ofwhich will be revealed through the medium of the coming world religion.There then follows, as a result of this, what is called the trueTransfiguration. This enables the initiate to function upon the logoic orhighest plane of the cosmic physical plane. This—in Christian phraseology—iscalled the “sitting down upon the right hand of God in Heaven.” There the manwho has attained this seventh initiation is transfigured. The first contactcomes along the line which he has projected as a result of transformation; it ismade with [285] That which has ever overshadowed Sanat Kumara. The Chohan hasnow taken the seventh initiation.6. Let the O.M. be heard right at the centre of the group, proclaiming God isAll.It is not my intention to interpret this final phrase of Rule XIII. Its meaninglies beyond your most elevated comprehension. It concerns the transmutation ofthe O.M. into the originating SOUND, bringing certain basic transformation andresulting in a transfiguration which extends to the entire planet and hasreference to a certain major planetary initiation. With these matters we are notconcerned. With them, only a few of the more advanced Masters are concerned.Therefore we will wait until, through resolution, we have resolved our spiritualproblems, transmuted our lower natures and undergone the lower aspects of bothtransformations, and are consequently ready for the third initiation—that of theTransfiguration.RULE FOURTEENIn this final rule for disciples and initiates, a great summation is embodied. Iwould here point out again (as I have so frequently in the past) that theobvious meaning—no matter how elevated—is not that with which we shall deal. Itis the significance behind the meaning which is ever the concern of the initiatemind. Students would do well to remember the following sequence of words,embodying ideas: Symbol, Meaning, Significance, Light, regarding light as theemanating creative energy—the organiser of the symbol, the revealer of themeaning, the potency of the significance.We have studied the rules and have penetrated deeply into the world ofsignificances. Most of you have not, however, passed beyond the stage of gropingin the world of [286] meaning. The reason for this is that you have not yettaken the third initiation. I would ask you also to bear in mind that the worldof symbols is that of the personal life, of the phenomenal world as that phrasecovers the three worlds of human evolution; the world of meaning is the world inwhich the soul lives and moves with intention and understanding; the world ofsignificance is the world of the Spiritual Triad, which only confers its freedomfully after the third initiation.The words dealt with in this Rule XIV are apparently so simple that they can beeasily understood. I will attempt to show you that their real meaning is deepand esoteric to what you call the nth degree.Rule XIV.> For Applicants: Listen. Touch. See. Apply. Know.> For Disciples and Initiates: Know. Express. Reveal. Destroy. Resurrect.The following relationships should be noted, for the first is the seed of theother. APPLICANTS INITIATES Listen . . . Know Touch . . . Express See . . . Reveal Apply . . . Destroy Know . . . ResurrectYou will note that the applicant eventually arrives at knowledge and begins toknow; the disciple or the initiate starts with knowing, and through his abilityto express esoterically that which he knows is able to reveal the light, and bythat light to destroy all illusion, glamour and maya; he brings aboutresurrection upon the physical plane—a resurrection from the death whichphysical plane life inevitably confers.The five words as given to the applicant are indeed relatively simple. Mostaspirants understand their meaning [287] to a certain extent. They know that thelistening mentioned has naught to do with the sense of physical hearing, andthat the touch to be developed has reference to sensitivity and not the sensoryperception of the physical vehicle. They know likewise that the sight to becultivated is the power to see the beauty underlying form, to recognise thesubjective divinity and to register also the love conveyed through the medium ofsymbols. The application of soul energy to the affairs of daily life and theestablishing of those conditions which permit of soul knowledge are theelementary lessons of the aspirant. With these I need not deal, except in so faras they give the clue to the significance of the five words as given to theinitiated disciple.Let us take each of these five words and seek to ascertain their significance.But first of all, I would like to point out that here we are concerned withmonadic signatures, with that which synthesises significances, and with thatwhich contributes vital significance to the initiated life. I would have you, asyou read my words, retreat within yourselves and seek to think, feel andperceive at your highest possible level of consciousness. The effort to do thiswill bear much fruit and bring rich reward to you. You will not grasp the fullintention of these words, but your sense of awareness will begin to react totriadal impression. I know not how else to word this, limited as I am by thenecessity of language. You may not register anything consciously, for the brainof the average disciple is as yet insensitive to monadic vibration. Even if thedisciple is capable of some responsiveness, there are not the needed words inwhich to express the sensed idea or to clothe the concept. It is thereforeimpossible to put the divine ideas into their ideal form and them bring themdown into the world of meaning, and from thence into the world of symbols. WhatI say will therefore have more significance towards the close of this century,when men will have recovered from the chaos and cruelty of war, and when the newand higher spiritual influences are being steadily poured out. I write, mybrothers, for the future. [288]1. Know.What is the difference between the knowing of the aspirant and the knowledge ofthe initiated disciple? It is the difference which exists between two differingfields and areas of perception. The aspirant is told first of all to “knowthyself”; he is then told to know the relation of form and soul, and the areacovered by his knowledge is that of the three worlds, plus the level upon themental plane on which his soul is focussed. The initiated disciple knows therelation of the periphery to the centre, of the One to the many, and of unity todiversity. The applicant is concerned with triplicity: himself as the knower,his field of knowledge, and that which is the agent of knowing, the mind. Theinitiated disciple is beyond registering triplicity and is occupied with theduality of manifestation, with life-energy as it affects or is related tomatter-force, with spirit and substance. The knowledge of the initiate hasnaught to do with consciousness as the mind recognises that factor in theevolutionary process; his knowledge is related to the faculty of the intuitionand to that divine perception which sees all things as within itself. Perhapsthe simplest way to express the knowledge of the initiate is to say that it isdirect awareness of God, thus putting it into mystical terms; the knowledge ofthe aspirant is related to that aspect of divinity which we call the soul inform. Putting this in still another way, I might point out that the aspirant isconcerned with the knowledge of soul and matter, whilst the initiate isconcerned with soul and spirit.If I say to you, my brothers, that the knowledge of the initiate is concernedwith that which is produced by SOUND and not by the A.U.M. or the O.M., I shallhave linked up these comments with much else given previously in the analysis ofthese fourteen rules. The “listening” of the aspirant has now been transformedinto the effectual recognition of that which the Sound has created. I refer nothere to the creation of the phenomenal world, or to the world of meaning whichis essentially the Plan or the pattern underlying that phenomenal world, but tothe intention or [289] the Purpose Which motivated the creative Sound; I amdealing with the impulsive energy which gives significance to activity and tothe life-force which the Sound centralises at Shamballa.It is not the fault of humanity that it is only now possible for thesignificance of the divine purpose to emerge more clearly in the consciousnessof the initiated disciple. It is a question of timing and of movement in space;it concerns the relation of the Hierarchy, working with the Plan, to Shamballa,the recipient (by means of the Sound) of the creative energy which it is thedivine intention to expend in producing a perfect expression of the divine Idea.It is to the knowledge of this relationship and of its effects that the firstword of Rule XIV refers.It was the dawning of this significance upon the consciousness of the Christ—aconsciousness enlightened, purified and divinely focussed—that forced Him to cryout: “Father, not my will but Thine be done.” He received a vision of theemerging divine intention for humanity and (through humanity) for the planet asa whole. In the hierarchical stage of development which Christ had attained andwhich made Him the Head of the Hierarchy and the Master of all the Masters, Hisconsciousness was entirely at one with the Plan; its application to life in thethree worlds, and its goal of establishing the Kingdom of God on earth and theemergence of the fifth kingdom in nature, were now for Him simply the fulfillingof the law, and to that fulfillment His entire life was and had been geared. ThePlan, its goal, its techniques and methods, its laws and their application, itsphenomenal effects, the hindrances to be met, the energy (that of love) to beemployed, and the close and growing relation and interplay between the Hierarchyand Humanity, between the heart centre of the planetary Logos and the creativecentre, were known to Him and fully understood. At the highest point of thisconsummated knowledge, and at the moment of His complete surrender to thenecessary sacrifice of His life to the fulfilling of the Plan, suddenly a greatexpansion of consciousness took place. [290] The significance, the intention,the purpose of it all, and the extent of the divine Idea as it existed in themind of the “Father,” dawned on His soul (not on His mind, but on His soul). Hesaw still further into the significance of divinity than had ever seemedpossible; the world of meaning and the world of phenomena faded outand—esoterically speaking—He lost His All. These are words necessarilymeaningless to you. For the time being, neither the energy of the creative mindnor the energy of love was left to Him. A new type of energy becameavailable—the energy of life itself, imbued with purpose and actuated byintention. For the first time, the relation of the Will, which had hithertoexpressed itself in His life through love and the creative work of inauguratingthe new dispensation and the launching for all time of the Kingdom of God,became clear to Him. At that point He passed through the Gethsemane ofrenunciation.A hint lies here. This high point of attainment of the Christ—as related in theGospel story—was reached in Gethsemane, and for a brief moment we are given aninsight into an aspect or happening of the Sixth Initiation. It was this eventand spiritual crisis in the life of the Christ (taking place as He overshadowedHis disciple, Jesus) which enabled Jesus on His own level of spiritualdevelopment to take the fourth initiation, that of the Crucifixion or the GreatRenunciation. The numbers four and six are closely connected, and the lesserrenunciation (great only from the human point of view) makes the higherrenunciation possible eventually, and vice versa. Running through many parts ofthe Gospel story are two paralleling histories; the lesser world of discipleshipprofits by the achievements of those who take the higher initiations, and thusis demonstrated the close unity which forever exists within the Hierarchyand—focussing through the Christ—the synthesis which is beginning to be formedbetween the Hierarchy and Shamballa. This is taking place in this era for thefirst time in human history. The recognition of this emerging synthesis betweenWill and Love produced a definite effect in [291] the consciousness of theChrist and led Him to know much that had hitherto been concealed from Him.These are deep mysteries. Their value to the disciple in training lies in therecognised and considered relationships.These rules are—as you know—the rules controlling group life; they constitutethe key to the laws under which all planetary groups work. The hierarchicallife, through its major aspect of Love, was a familiar area of consciousness andwell-known to the Masters and to the Master of Them all, the Christ. But afurther “knowing” lay ahead of even this “perfected Son of God”; the nature andthe mind of that great Being, embodied in the Lord of the World at Shamballa,was now revealed to Him.It is this living realisation of Being and of identification with the planetaryLogos upon the cosmic mental plane which constituted the unfolding awareness ofthe Christ upon the Way of the Higher Evolution. Therefore, experience,perception and Being are the keynotes of:> 1. The Path of Evolution.> 2. The mode of unfoldment upon the Path.> 3. The state of divine focus upon the Way.In other words, you have the states of Individualisation, of Initiation, and ofIdentification.The relation between the listening of the aspirant and the knowledge of theinitiated disciple has been expressed for us in a certain ancient writing asfollows:> “Dimly the one who seeks hears the faint whisper of the life of God; he sees> the breathing of that whisper which disturbs the waters of his Spatial life.> The whisper penetrates. It then becomes the Sound of many waters and the Word> of many voices. Great is the confusion but still the listening must go on.> Listening is the seed of obedience, O Chela on the Path.> More loudly comes the voice; then suddenly the voices dim and listening now> gives place to knowing—the [292] knowledge of that which lies behind the outer> form, the perception of that which must be done. Order is seen. The pattern> clear emerges.> Knowing is the seed of conscious doing, O Chela on the Path.> Listening and knowledge also fade away and that which they produce can then be> seen. Being emerges and union with the One. Identity is known—not on this> plane but on that higher sphere where move and speak the greater Sons of Life.> Being alone is left. The work is done.”2. Express.We come now to the second word of the fourteenth rule for disciples andinitiates—the word Express. This cannot be correctly understood apart from theearlier word imparted to applicants—the word Touch. I would have you note thatall the words given to the neophyte refer basically to something he must do inreference to himself, some task he must undertake which will make him more fitfor advancement, or some process of apprehension which will enable him tofunction in a better and more sensitive instrument. This might be called the“introverted stage” of training because it brings the would-be disciple to abetter knowledge of himself; he grasps the fact that he himself, the microcosm,is the key to the Macrocosm; he is the clue to the future, and he holds withinhimself the revelation which must precede esoteric action. In contradistinctionto this, the words for the disciple and the initiate mark the attainment of acapacity to work from a most deeply esoteric centre in a pronouncedly occultway. By this I mean that the initiate, working as we have seen from a standpointof knowledge, is at the same time no longer self-centred, but is now preoccupiedwith that in which he lives and moves and has his being. His interests are withthe Whole and not with the part; his interests are those which will affect hisenvironment (an aspect of that living vibrant Whole) and not himself; his taskis the hierarchical one of the salvaging of others, and not his own salvation.[293] If you will note your own present attitudes and actions, you will discoverthat primarily (I might add almost necessarily) they centre around yourselves,your own recognitions, your own grasp of truth, and your own progress upon thePath. But—as you achieve initiate status—self-interest declines until itdisappears and, as an ancient Word has it, “only God is left”; only that remainsin consciousness which is THAT, which is beauty, goodness and truth; which isnot form but quality, which is that which lies behind the form and that whichindicates destiny, soul, place, and status. Ponder on these words, for theyconvey to you where (as evolution goes on) you will later lay the emphasis.In considering the word Express I can, I believe, make this distinction somewhatclearer. When the beginner on the Path ponders the significance of expression,he is occupied with his ability to express the truth which he theoreticallyrecognises but to which he cannot as yet give form. This is valuable because itfeeds his aspiration, centres his attention upon himself and increases his naiveself-interest. This, frequently, presents its own problems, such as a sense offailure or an undue registration of success, or it fails to develop a sense ofproportion.When, however, the initiate takes into his consciousness this injunction toexpress, it signifies to him not his own needs or requirements, but the need ofothers for those expressions of truth which will guide them on their way. Thisword, therefore, is to him an injunction to be creative. The initiate createsoutside himself that which is his individual contribution to the totality of thecreative forms whereby the Hierarchy is attempting to create “a new heaven and anew earth.” He is not occupied with what he himself expresses as a soul within apersonality; he has developed the habit of right soul expression in the threeworlds, and the appearance of his quality (to revert to the use of our originalwords—life, quality and appearance) is automatic and without any planning on hispart. He is, however, occupied with the sequence of activities which I will listas follows: [294]> 1. The preservation of hierarchical contact, of which direct, conscious soul> contact is now an incident because it is now a habit.> 2. An awareness, unbroken and consistent, of his ashramic place; I refer not> to location but to status—a very different matter.> 3. Reflective concentration upon the hierarchical Plan as his particular> Ashram has assumed responsibility for a measure of it; that responsibility he> seeks to share intelligently and effectively.> 4. Recognition of the immediate contribution of the Ashram and his immediate> contribution as an integral part of it. This does away with visionary> mysticism and produces the practicing occultist.> 5. A study of the creative methods of his particular Ray and an imaginative> visualisation of that which will be expressed when the desired creative work> has taken due form.> 6. Conscious projection of his contribution onto the outer physical plane. A> tangible creative project is undertaken and eventually produced.> 7. He thus plays his part in bringing into objectivity the creative> undertaking of his Ashram.The seed of this creative work is that which the Ashram has planned for theexact moment of humanity’s presented need, correct as to timing and placement.This may not be what humanity believes it needs; it is essentially what theHierarchy recognises as the needed factor, leading to the needed progress forthe race at any specific moment in time. For instance, humanity believes todaythat its major need is peace and material comfort and is working vaguely forboth; the Hierarchy knows that its major need is the recognition of the folly ofpast separateness and the cult of goodwill. Towards these ends, workers in theAshrams are bending every effort. The creative task, therefore, of workingdisciples and initiates is to produce that presentation (appearance) of thenecessitous truths in such a manner that the recognition of humanity may be sosound that right action can duly be [295] taken. Hierarchical workers musttherefore express the true need in form, appropriate to the registering capacityof humanity at this moment.The creative work of expression does not consequently concern the developmentand personal progress of the initiate. He has been taken into the Ashram becauseof his development and because of the contribution he should be able to make tothe ashramic creative purpose. What, as a neophyte, he “touched” because of whathe could gain spiritually for himself (and this with sound motive) has nowbecome that which must be expressed in the field of service of the initiate,exacting from him all that he has and leaving him nothing for the separatedself.A great creative activity involving all Ashrams—major and minor—is now beingplanned in the hierarchical assembly, and the work of all waiting and attentivedisciples is to make that creative plan successful through its full expressionupon the physical plane. This they must do through their grouped and blendedactivities, which will embody the full expression of all that they have achievedand gained in the earlier stages of their individual unfoldment. Thus you willsee that from God the Creator of all that IS, down to the humblest disciple inthe hierarchical centre, the theme of creativity dominates and is the expression(again occultly understood) of the divine intention. At present, what is calledcreative work by men is in reality an expression of themselves and of theirappreciation of beauty as they see it, of truth as they grasp it, of psychologyas they interpret it, of nature as they scientifically interpret it. Accordingto their spiritual development and their intelligent perception, so will be thequality and the nature of their expression—but it will be theirs .In the case of hierarchical workers however, the situation is different. Theywork to express that which the Ashram, through its group of workers, is seekingto express they seek to express the Plan, or as much of it as they can grasp;they are occupied with the expression of soul as that soul should be known inthe culture and the civilisation [296] immediately to be developed. They canwork entirely free from self-interest; that which they create is not claimed bythem but is regarded as an expression of hierarchical activity; they are freefrom the spirit to identify themselves with that which they expressed,but—having created that which their ashramic impulse has indicated—they pass onto a fresh expression of the dynamic, ever-moving purpose. They are not occupiedwith form, but with life, with organism rather than organisation, with ideasrather than ideals, and with essential truth rather than with carefullyformulated theologies.Christ expressed in Himself and refrained from putting it into form; He Himselfwas the truth, yet inevitably (because of its inherent life) that which Heexpressed took form and has greatly modified and coloured human thinking andplanning, and this will be increasingly so. As the essence of Christianityemerges into expression (and in so doing destroys Churchianity) you have again astriking illustration of the truth of what I am seeking to emphasise. In theChristian Church, men have expressed themselves, not the Christ; they haveimposed their interpretations of truth on truth itself; they have created amassive organisation in every land but a living organism is non-existent. In thenew world religion which is on its way, Christianity will be expressed throughthe creative activity of the Christ spirit through the medium of the worlddisciples and initiates; we shall then see the full expression of hierarchicaltruth—of which the Christ today is the symbol and exponent.Neophytes and aspirants have “touched” that for which the Christ stood, and havethen attempted to impose their comprehension of that which they contacted uponthe rest of the world. Knowers, disciples and initiates express that which Herepresented (love-wisdom). This they do automatically and by force of habit,first in themselves and finally by a definitely planned creative activity in theouter world.Therefore, my brothers, there lies ahead of all true aspirants an intermediatestage of decentralisation, of automatic spiritual living and of absorption intothe Hierarchy [297] through the medium of an Ashram; therein the Plan can belearnt. When this phase of development is completed the disciple can then beginto work creatively in line with hierarchical activity.As we consider the next word on our list, we must hold in our minds what we havediscussed anent the words Touch and Express. It might be said that the wordswhich are given to aspirants and applicants are the seed or germ of the conceptsindicated in the words for initiates and disciples. Until the earliersignificances are mastered in the earlier phases of discipleship, the laterillumined service—based upon the later words—is not possible. Always in thefresh attitude to the developing esoteric understanding of the initiate there isimplicit the fact of transition from individual self-interest to a universalstate of consciousness; this in time becomes the directing agent forindividualised service—as rendered by the individual disciple upon the physicalplane. The fusion of the two attitudes—inclusive realisation and specialisedservice—renders the task of the initiate peculiarly difficult. He has to holdtwo attitudes simultaneously, whilst at the same time subjecting himself to thetraining required in order to enable him to take his next step forward upon thePath. It is only whilst this condition persists that the initiate has any senseof triplicity. This is an important point to note. Bear this in mind as wediscuss our next two words: See and Reveal.3. Reveal.The objective of the strictly human evolution in this planetary cycle is sight ,culminating in that spiritual perception which is the major gift of the soul tothe personality when contact is made; this conveys the sense of attractive love,indicates the nature of things, reveals the world of meaning, and gives thegreat gift of light, knowledge and ultimate illumination. Such are the goals forthe mystic, the aspirant and the pledged disciple. The greatest physical gift isthat of sight, and it is the same upon a higher turn of the spiral within theworld of the soul. When the disciple has achieved a measure of vision and is “insight” of his goal, he [298] can then be admitted to an Ashram wherein thenature of revelation can be made known to him . Men are apt to confuse visionand revelation, and I seek to clarify your minds somewhat on this matter;therefore, the preceding sentence is of major importance. Aspirants are prone tothink that the goal towards which they move is that of soul contact, with asecondary goal of hierarchical position, and a third goal of service. This,however, is not correct.The goal ahead of the aspirant is the consciousness of non-separateness and therecognition of a universal inclusiveness; the secondary goal is the ability toreveal the nature of that reality, Unity; the third goal is the ability to takethose measures in the three worlds which will facilitate mankind’s apprehensionof these fundamentals. You will note how this last definition of the goalremoves inevitably the factor of self-interest in its entirety. It mighttherefore be said that revelation concerns Oneness and nothing else. Thepractical nature of this truth is only recognised when the disciple attempts todo two things: to realise it individually, and to bring the nature of planetaryunity and of non-separateness to the minds and into the lives of men everywhere.The work of the aspirant is to see the light; only when this has become a factin his consciousness can he begin to grasp the hidden revelation which thatcontacted and utilised light can reveal. Here is another key sentence for yourconsideration.With the theme of light, of vision, and of illumination, I seek not here todeal. I have covered these subjects at length in the books which I have written,and they have also constituted the earnest search of the mystics of all time;and also the Scriptures and the literature of all nations give much information.It is the subject of revelation and the task of the initiate to reveal withwhich I am concerned. The disciple, who represents the Ashram, must reveal tohumanity the essential unity underlying all creation. This he does, first ofall, by acting like a clear sheet of glass through which all may see the realityof Oneness as it [299] demonstrates in practicing operation. When he has,through his own life and words, demonstrated his conscious participation in thisbasic unity, he passes on to practice ashramic methods of making thisfundamental truth still more apparent. You can here see why—as a hierarchicaltechnique—we brought to the attention of the general public the fact of theexistence of the New Group of World Servers. They offer a practical expressionof an existent unity, based upon oneness of motive, of recognition, oforientation (towards the spiritual world and towards the service of humanity),of methods and of ideas; and all this in spite of the fact that the physicalplane relationship is usually non-existent and outer organisation andrecognition lack. The unity is subjective, and for that reason is impervious toevery taint of separateness.The inner organisation, to which we have given the name of the New Group ofWorld Servers for the sake of recognition and identification, cannot be brokenor in any way diminished, for it is constructed around a major principle ofevolutionary growth which—when attained—indicates a registered consciousness ofunity; this is something which, once recorded and known, cannot be lost ordisproved. Once seen and realised, it becomes as much a fact in its possessor’sconsciousness as the recognition and utilisation of his own physical body. Thishe knows to be a complex organism which constitutes a functioning unity throughthe medium of the life principle; it is an incontrovertible fact in therealisation of the intelligent man.When, therefore, sight has been attained and the light streams forth, revelationof the oneness of all life is a simple and immediate occurrence; it comes firstof all to the disciple as a flash of wondrous informative and instinctiverealisation and then steadies down, as progress is made, into a constantapprehension and appreciation; it eventually produces the motivating impulse ofall action.What is the immediate revelation which the initiates and the disciples of theworld are seeking to bring to humanity? What aspect of this essential unity arethey [300] endeavouring to make simple and apparent? One of the easiest thingsin the world to say (as has, for instance, Krishnamurti) is that life is one;that there is nothing but unity. That is a trite formulation of a very ancienttruth, and one which is today an occult platitude. But life is not yet one inconsciousness, however true it may be in fact. The reason for this is that lifeis loving synthesis in action, and of that there is little today indemonstration. We have life in activity but love, based on realised unity andleading to expressed synthesis, is still absent. The vision of it is, however,upon the horizon of many, for in these days many are attaining sight and lightis pouring in. Revelation will come when the world disciples and initiates haveperfected the art of revelation.The task ahead is simple. The important aspect, at this time, of the basiconeness underlying all forms, and which the workers of today must immediatelyemphasise, is the fact of the kingdom of God, of the planetary Hierarchy. Thecitizens of that kingdom and the members of that Hierarchy are gathered out ofevery nation, every political party, every social group, every religious cult orsect, and every organisation—no matter what their expressed objectives—and theuniversality of the field from which these people emerge, demonstrates theirunderlying unity. When this unity assumes adequate proportions in the eyes ofmankind, a real synthesis will follow.Therefore the call goes out at this time for hierarchical workers to reveal withgreater emphasis the fact of the Hierarchy. This—if done on a large scale andthrough proper organisation—will destroy on a large scale the present worldstructure in the field of religion, of economics, and of politics; it is alreadydoing so. An increase of pressure on the part of all who recognise the factualnature of the inner subjective kingdom of God, will produce amazing results.This kingdom, through its major power (a quality of synthesis, could you butrealise it), is gathering together into itself men and women out of every nationand out of all parts of the Earth. It is absorbing them into itself not because[301] they are orthodox or religious in the generally accepted sense of theterm, but because of their quality . Simultaneously, as their numbers increase,a reverse movement is taking place. Men are moving outward on to the physicalplane, and doing this as a group in order to prove the factual nature of theworld of unity into which they have succeeded in penetrating. They, therefore,are demonstrating oneness and synthesis in such a simple way that men everywherecan grasp it. The New Group of World Servers is the vanguard of the kingdom ofGod, the living proof of the existence of the world of spiritual Oneness.To all applicants the call has gone out to see the Christ as He is, in order (asThe New Testament puts it) that “as He is, so should we be in the world.” Todisciples and initiates the call goes out to reveal to the world the groupedformation of all spiritual workers, the nature of the Christ consciousness whichknows no separation, which recognises all men everywhere as Sons of God inprocess of expression. This is all desired because of the need to emphasise theall-inclusive approach of divinity to humanity. These working disciples andinitiates regard all as essentially one and as brothers, which repudiates allman-made theologies (religious, scientific, political or economic) and says toall men everywhere: “We are all the children of God; we are all equally divine;we are all on our way to the revelation of divinity, and this upon the physicalplane of existence; it is what we reveal that is of importance; what is revealedto us is of lesser importance, though it has its due place in the process oftraining and perfecting.”There is an old catechism which seeks to make clear to the neophyte upon theverge of acceptance the distinction and the difference between vision andrevelation. It is falling somewhat into disuse, owing to the fact that theapplicant today starts on a much higher turn of the spiral than he did at thetime the “form of interrogation” was compiled. I would like, however, to quoteone or two of the questions and answers for the instruction of present-dayaspirants. [302]A CATECHISMWhat dost thou see, O disciple on the Path?> Naught but myself, O Master of my life.Look closer at thyself and speak again. What seest thou?> A point of light which waxes and which wanes and makes the darkness darker.Look with intense desire towards the dark and, when the light shines forth graspopportunity. What now appears?> A horrid sight, O Master of my life. I like it not. It is not true. I am not> this or that. This evil selfish thing, it is not me. I am not this.Turn on the light with will and power and fierce desire, and then recount thevision that may come. What seest thou?> Beyond the dark, revealed to me by means of light, I see a radiant form which> beckons me. What is this Being, standing gracious in the dark and in the> light? Is it and can it be my self?What dawns upon the sight as thou standest on the Way, O worn and tireddisciple, triumphant in the light?> A radiant shining form which is my Self, my soul. A dark and sombre figure,> yet old and wise, experienced and sad. This is my self, my lower self, my> ancient tried appearance upon the ways of earth. These two stand face to face> and in between, the burning ground....They move and merge....The Path comes to> an end. The Way stretches before. Sight is attained, and in the light reality> appears.What canst thou now reveal, O Server on the way?> Revelation comes through me, O Lord of Life. I see it not.Why canst thou see it now? What hinders apprehension?> Naught hinders me. I seek not sight for I have seen. My task is revelation. I> seek naught for myself.What comes thy way for revelation? What hast thou to reveal?> Only that which has for aeons long existed and has for aye been here. The> Oneness of the Presence; the area [303] of love; the living, loving, wise,> inclusive One, enfolding all and being all and leaving naught outside.To whom must come this revelation, O Server of the world of living things?> To all enfolded in the living, loving Presence; to those who all unknown to> them maintain that Presence and for ever shall endure—as doth that Presence.And who are those who live within that Presence but know it not?> They are myself and thou, and still they are myself and still are all I meet.> It is the one in every form who think mayhap that form is all; who living thus> in time and space, see not the light or life within the form, who hide within,> behind the veils, between the four and five (the four kingdoms in nature and> the kingdom of God. A.A.B.) and see naught else. To them I must reveal the> truth.How will you do this hardest of all tasks, O triumphing disciple?> By letting it be seen I am myself the truth; by living as a fragment of that> Presence and seeing all its parts. And thus is revelation brought into the> four and by the fifth.This is all that I can give you at this time upon the word and the injunctiongiven to the initiate: Reveal. I would point that it is not his task to revealthe world of symbols. The five senses and the mind principle are adequate tobring that about. It is not his task to reveal the world of meaning. That, thedisciple arrives at and interprets as he develops soul consciousness. His is thetask to reveal the world of significances, the world of reality and of essentialtruth. Because of the success of the evolutionary process, this latter task isgrowing, and more and more initiated revealers will be needed during the periodimmediately ahead. Forget not that the invocative appeal of the mass of men, andthe intelligent voicing of demand by those prepared intelligently to moveforward, will inevitably [304] call forth the needed response and the neededrevealers of reality.The next word which we are to consider is one of the most difficult for me toexplain. The reason for my difficulty is that you are all imbued with theordinary ideas anent these familiar words, and therefore it is well-nighimpossible for me to convey their significances to you from the angle of theinitiate-consciousness. Identified as you are with the form aspect and with lifein the three worlds, it is hard for you to comprehend the state of mind and thetype of awareness which distinguishes those who are free from theseall-compelling forces in the three worlds which condition human beings, thusbringing about erroneous orientation and preventing what is really meant byspiritual perception. The attitude of the average man, and even of the averagedisciple, is that of one who looks in from the periphery towards the centre, ofone who is preoccupied with the shell of life and is not conscious of Reality asis a member of the Hierarchy.Therefore, when I tell you that these words for initiates which constitute whatI have called Rule XIV have a connotation quite different from that to which youare accustomed, I am propounding for you a most difficult problem. The trueunderstanding is, I realise, not possible for you but much can be gained by youreffort to comprehend. What you mean when you speak of the abstract mind is notexactly true to the facts; the effort to think abstractly is really an effort tothink as far as possible as an initiate thinks who has transcended the concretemind and thinks, or rather is aware, in terms of life and not of form, of beingand not that which anchors being on the physical plane—or even in terms ofconsciousness, as you understand it. Forget not that I have elsewhere told youthat consciousness (as grasped by the personality and the soul) has littlerelation to that form of living awareness which distinguishes the initiate whois essentially an expression of the Monad through the medium of the threeaspects of the Spiritual Triad. This is peculiarly so in connection with the two[305] words Which remain for us to consider: Destroy and Resurrect.4. Destroy.What is this destruction which the disciple and the initiate (under instructionfrom this final rule) is asked to bring about? What is he required to destroy?Why is this destruction ordered?Let me start with a basic statement: Destruction or the power and the wish todestroy which is characteristic of the undeveloped man, of the average man andof the probationary disciple is based upon the following impelling influences:> 1. Lack of self-control along some line.> 2. Desire to attain one’s wishes by the removal of all obstacles.> 3. Violent emotional reaction.> 4. Revenge, hate, acquisitiveness and similar faults, based on lack of> spiritual unfoldment.> 5. The effort to remove hindrances within oneself, such as those implied in> the rule for probationary disciples: Kill out desire.> 6. The deliberate destruction of all that prevents contact with the soul.> 7. The destroying of all links which hold the spiritual man in the three> worlds.These motives for destruction are all related to desire, to emotion and also toaspiration, implemented (towards the end of the cycle which leads to thetreading of the Probationary Path) by the lower concrete mind. They cover afamiliar case history and one which is well known to every sincere aspirant, orone which is realised for what they are at a lower level of life expression bythe man who pays the penalties involved by this type of destruction. I feel nonecessity to enlarge on this mode of destroying to students such as those whoread this Treatise. This type of destruction is concerned mainly with form lifein the three worlds, with individual aspiration and enterprise (from the lowest[306] groping physical desire up to the aspiration for conscious soul life), andwith experiment and experience upon the three planes of ordinary human living.But in this word “destroy” given (as an expressed command) for those who aremembers of the Hierarchy or who have moved or are moving from an affiliatedrelationship on the periphery of that Hierarchy toward the centre of activityand into close contact with some Ashram, the significance is very different.The type of destruction here dealt with is never the result of desire; it is aneffort of the spiritual will and is essentially an activity of the SpiritualTriad; it involves the carrying out of those measures which will hinderobstruction to God’s will; it is the furthering of those conditions which willdestroy those who are attempting to prevent divine purpose from materialising asthe Plan—for which the Hierarchy is responsible. Therefore, it is connectedprimarily with the relation of Shamballa to the Hierarchy, and not with therelation of the Hierarchy to Humanity. This is a formidable esoteric statementand its implications must be considered most carefully. This type of destructionhas only a secondary relation to the destruction of form life as you know it.When steps are taken to implement divine purpose, the resultant effect may bethe destroying of forms in the three worlds, but that is an effect and only asecondary destruction; something else has been destroyed on a higher level andoutside the three worlds. This, in due time, may produce a form-reaction towhich we may give the name of death. But the death of that form was not aprimary objective and was not even considered, because it was not within therange of awareness of the destroyer.The higher destruction which we are considering is related to the destruction ofcertain forms of consciousness which express themselves in great areas orextensive thoughtforms; these may have, in turn, conditioned human thinking.Perhaps the simplest illustration I can give you of this type of destructionwould be concerned with the major ideologies which down the ages haveconditioned or may [307] condition humanity. These ideologies produce potenteffects in the three worlds. This type of destruction affects thosecivilisations which condition the human family for long periods of time, whichconcern climatic conditions that predispose the forms in the four kingdoms tocertain characteristics in time and space, which produce effects in the greatworld religions, in world politics and all other “conditioning forms ofthinking.” Does this convey much or little in connection with the concepts whichI am attempting to make clear?That which is destroyed, therefore, are certain group forms and these upon alarge scale; this requires an exercise of the spiritual will to bring about, anddoes not require simply the withdrawing of the attention of the soul, thedecision to vacate the form and the failure of the basic desire to perpetuate,which is what we imply when we speak of death in the three worlds. The lack ofthe will-to-live of which we so glibly speak has little relation, in reality, tothe will itself; it refers only to its faint or distorted reflection in thethree worlds; this is much more closely related to desire and aspiration than topure will, as spiritually comprehended.The Purpose of God (to use a familiar phrase) is that which implements the Plan.This purpose is the motivating life behind all that emanates from Shamballa andit is that which impulses all the activities of the Hierarchy; the task of theHierarchy is to formulate the Plan for all forms of life in the three worlds andthe four kingdoms in nature. This Plan, in time and space, is not in any wayconcerned with individual man or with the life of any microcosmic entity in anyof the kingdoms of nature, but with the wholes, the cycles of time, with thosevast plans of livingness which man calls history, with nations and races, withworld religions and great political ideologies and with social organisationswhich produce permanent changes in types, constitutions, planetary areas andcyclic manifestations. It will therefore be obvious to you that from thestandpoint of man’s little mind, these plans are well-nigh impossible to [308]grasp. From the standpoint of the vision of the initiate who has developed or isdeveloping the wider grasp and who can see and think and vision (I care not whatword you choose) in terms of the Eternal Now, the significance is clear; attimes, the initiate creates and then anchors a germ of livingness; at times hebuilds that which can house his living idea with its conditioning qualities; attimes, when these have served their purpose, he definitely and deliberatelydestroys. The reference is necessarily ever to form; with the initiate it is,however, to the “formless form” which is always the subjective aspect of thetangible world. It must be remembered that from the point of view ofesotericism, all forms in the three worlds are tangible, in contradistinction toforms in the two higher worlds of the Spiritual Triad.The destruction considered is that of the formless structure on which thegrosser structure is built. Some understanding of this will come if you considerthe relation of the four subplanes of the physical plane, the four ethericlevels, and the three subplanes which we call the dense physical planes. Theseconstitute our physical plane in its two aspects. This is only a reflection ofthe three planes of the three worlds and the four planes from the buddhic planeup to the logoic, which constitute the cosmic physical plane. The destructionconsidered by the initiate is connected with the subjective worlds of the fourhigher planes and the three worlds of human living, and of other forms of lifesuch as the three subhuman kingdoms.In the human family, death supervenes when the soul withdraws its consciousnessthread and its life thread; this process of death is contained, however,entirely within the three worlds. The soul has its station on the higher levelsof the mental plane, as well you know. In connection with the forms ofexpression to which I have referred above—cycles, civilisations, cultures,races, kingdoms in nature and so forth—their destruction is brought about fromstill higher sources than the three worlds in which they manifest. Thisdestruction takes place under the direction of Shamballa as it evokes the willof the Hierarchy or some particular [309] Ashram or some member of the Hierarchyin order to produce a predetermined result in the three worlds in line with thepurpose of God. It might be said (accurately to a certain esoteric extent) thatthe destruction brought about in obedience to this fourth word in Rule XIV isthe destruction of some aspect of the plan as it has been functioning in thethree worlds, and this under divine purpose and intent.This destruction is not outwardly so conclusive as is death—on the physicalplane—of a man, though that is not essentially the rapidly consummated processas is usually surmised. The physical form may die and disappear, but an innerprocess of dying of the subtler bodies supervenes and the death process is notcomplete until the astral and mental bodies have disintegrated and the manstands free in his causal or soul body. So it is, on a much larger scale, withthe death or destruction of phases of the divine Plan, engineered by theHierarchy in conformity with the divine Purpose. There is an overlapping betweenthe building process and the destroying process. Dying civilisations are presentin their final forms whilst new civilisations are emerging; cycles come and goand in the going overlap; the same is also found to be true in the emerging anddisappearing of rays and races. Death, in the last analysis and from thestandpoint of the average human being, is simply disappearance from the physicalplane—the plane of appearances.The form of destruction we are considering however, is more concerned with thedestruction of quality than with forms, though the disappearance of thesequalities produces the death of the outer form. The withdrawing life of a greatexpression of the hierarchical plan absorbs the qualities and returns with them,as endowments, later in time and space and manifests anew through the medium ofmore adequate forms of expression. The soul, however, kills the forms in thethree worlds; it is the life aspect (in this higher and more extensive type ofdestruction) which destroys the innate quality and consequently the form of acivilisation, the type of an ideology and the character of a race or nation,[310] preserving only the essentials but discarding the distortions.This fourth word is closely related to the fourth initiation in which the causalbody or soul vehicle on its own plane is destroyed—that beautiful, intangible,qualitative Identity which has motivated and implemented the man in the threeworlds. Does this instance somewhat clarify the difficulty of this subject withwhich we are concerned? Ponder on this as an illustration of this form ofdestruction, and seek better understanding.This higher form of destruction does not manifest under the activity or thenon-activity of the Law of Attraction, as does the death which the soul bringsabout. It is definitely under the Law of Synthesis, a law of the monadic sphereof life, and one therefore most difficult for you to comprehend; it emanatesfrom a point outside the five worlds of human and superhuman evolution, just asthe destruction of form in the three worlds emanates from the soul functioningoutside the three worlds of the lower, concrete mind, the astral world and thephysical plane. This statement again may aid you in understanding.If this is so, it will be apparent to you that only initiates who have taken thefifth initiation and higher initiations can wield effectively this particularform of death—for monadic potency only becomes available after the thirdinitiation, and its first successful use is the destruction of the causal bodyof the initiate. It is the reward of Transfiguration.In connection with the use by the initiate of what we might call pure will, itshould be remembered that this pure will works into manifestation through one orother of the three aspects of the Spiritual Triad. This activity is determinedby the major ray upon which the initiate finds himself, from the angle of hismonadic ray. Every spiritual man is upon one or another of the three major rays,for the minor four rays of attribute are all eventually absorbed into the thirdRay of Active Intelligence.If the initiate is upon the first ray, and therefore working in the Departmentof the Manu, he will use and express [311] the innate will aspect through theatmic nature or through the highest aspect of the Spiritual Triad, to which wegive the inadequate name of “divine Will.” Students are apt to forget that theSpiritual Triad, related as it is to the Monad in much the same way as thethreefold personality is related to the soul, expresses the three major aspectsof Shamballic energy, which three are all of them expressions of the will of theplanetary Logos and His essential Purpose. If the initiate is on the second ray,and therefore is working in the Department of the Christ, he will use the willthrough the medium of buddhi, the second aspect of the Spiritual Triad. If he ison the third ray and in the Department of the Mahachohan, the Lord ofCivilisation, he will work through the higher mind, the lowest aspect of theSpiritual Triad. Forget not, however, that none of these aspects can be regardedas higher or lower, for all are equally divine. Understanding of these ideas maycome if, for instance, you realise that the expression of buddhi, or of theintuition, in the consciousness of the spiritual man will lead to the use of thewill in working out the purposes of Shamballa in the field of religions, ofeducation, and of salvaging or saving the life aspect in all forms in the threeworlds, but it will have no relation to the individual and personal problems ofthe man himself. If the expression is that of the higher mind, the use of thewill will be in connection with civilisations and cultures for which the thirddepartment is responsible, and there will be the carrying out of the will of Godin the large and general plans. If it is the will as it expresses itself throughthe atmic aspect of the Triad, it will function in relation to races, nations,and the kingdoms in nature, and to great planetary arrangements at presentunknown to man. The synthesis of this picture will be apparent if carefullystudied.At the same time it must be borne in mind that the destroying aspect of thispure will, expressing through the Monad, implements the purpose of Shamballa andis one of the major manifestations of the Love nature of the One in Whom we liveand move and have our being; it is also [312] the guarantee of our ultimate andinevitable attainment, perfection, illumination and divine consummation.This destruction wrought by the initiate is preparatory to his responsiveness tothe fifth word which he receives at the fifth initiation and to which we givethe inadequate name: Resurrect.Prior to considering that word, I would like to point out that these five wordshave a clear reference to each of the five initiations; they give the initiatethe keynote to the work which he must carry forward between the variousinitiatory processes. The work indicated has nothing whatever to do with thetraining and the discipline to which he will (needless to say) subject hispersonality; they are related instead to the work which he has to render. Thiswork concerns what I might call certain essential realities connected with thepurpose of Shamballa and with his ability to react or respond to the will of theMonad. As you know, this ability does not become an established fact andfunctioning realisation until after the third initiation; nevertheless, thepreparatory sensitivity (if I may use this word is this connection) is slowlydeveloping and paralleling the two other activities—Destroy and Resurrect—towhich he is pledged:> 1. The disciplining of his lower nature so that the unfolding> initiate-consciousness may find no hindrances and obstacles.> 2. Service to the Plan, under hierarchical impression.> 3. The development of monadic sensitivity.It might be of interest at this point if, in view of this thirddevelopment—responsiveness to pure will—we considered these five words inrelation to the five initiations with which you are all so theoreticallyfamiliar.The word Know , in relation to the initiate-consciousness, concerns thecertainty of the initiate, and his profound conviction of the fact of the Christin the hearts it is at the same time coupled with a reaction which emanates fromthe sacrifice petals in the egoic lotus—those petals which are composed of thewill quality of the Monad and relate the soul to the emanating Monad. The firstfaint tremor of the [313] impact of monadic “destiny” (I know not how else toexpress this concept) makes itself felt, but is registered only by the soul ofthe initiate and on the level of soul consciousness; it is never registered bythe man on the physical plane who is taking the first initiation; his braincannot respond to this high vibration. Theoretically, and as a result of theteaching of the Ageless Wisdom, the spiritual man (in incarnation) has knownthat he is essentially the indwelling Christ, and the attainment of the Christconsciousness has been and will be his goal; the knowledge here referred toconcerns something higher still—the Self-identification of the soul on its ownplane and the Self-recognition which relates that Self to the enveloping whole,the Monad. If I might word it symbolically, I would say that the soul, theChrist (after the first initiation), knows that the inevitable processes ofChrist-expression on Earth have been started and that the attainment of “thefull-grown man in Christ” cannot be arrested. The centre of interest which hashitherto been directed to bringing this about now shifts and the soul on its ownplane (not in the reflection of its consciousness on Earth) becomes determinedto “go to the Father” or to demonstrate the highest aspect of divinity, the willaspect.There are in the Gospel story four recorded moments in the life of the Christwherein this process of development within His consciousness, this monadiccentralisation (I know not what other word to use, for we have not yet developedthe terminology of the monad, the will aspect) begins to demonstrate and can betraced in a definitely unfolding process. In the past I have incidentallyreferred to these points, but I would like to gather all four of them togetherhere for your illumination.1. His statement to His parents in the Temple, “Wist ye not that I must be aboutMy Father’s business?” I would have you note that:> a. He was twelve years old at the time, and therefore the work upon which He> had been occupied as a soul was finished, for twelve is the number of> completed [314] labour. The symbolism of His twelve years is now replaced by> that of the twelve Apostles.> b. He was in the Temple of Solomon, ever a symbol of the causal body of the> soul, and He was therefore speaking on soul levels and not as the spiritual> man on Earth.> c. He was serving as a member of the Hierarchy, for He was found by His> parents teaching the priests, the Pharisees and the Sadducees.> d. He spoke as an expression of the substance aspect (He spoke to His mother)> and also as a soul (He spoke to His father), but He was controlled by neither;> He now functioned as the monad, above and beyond yet inclusive of both.2. His statement to His disciples, “I must go up to Jerusalem,” after which weread that He steadfastly set His face to go there. This was an intimation thatHe had now a new objective. The only place of complete “peace” (the meaning ofthe word Jerusalem) is Shamballa; the Hierarchy is not a centre of peace in thetrue meaning of the term, which has no relation to emotion but to the cessationof the type of activity with which we are familiar in the world ofmanifestation; the Hierarchy is a very vortex of activity and of energies comingfrom Shamballa and from Humanity. From the standpoint of true esotericism,Shamballa is a place of “serene determination and of poised, quiescent will” asthe Old Commentary expresses it.3. The exclamation of the Christ, “Father, not my will, but Thine be done,”indicated His monadic and realised “destiny.” The meaning of these words is notas is so oft stated by Christian theologians and thinkers, a statement ofacceptance of pain and of an unpleasant future. It is an exclamation evoked bythe realisation of monadic awareness and the focussing of the life aspect withinthe Whole. The soul, in this statement, is renounced, and the monad, as a pointof centralisation, is definitely and finally recognised. Students would do wellto bear in mind that the Christ never underwent the Crucifixion subsequent tothis episode, but [315] that it was the Master Jesus Who was crucified. TheCrucifixion lay behind Him in the experience of the Christ. The episode ofrenunciation was a high point in the life of the World Saviour, but was no partof the experience of the Master Jesus.4. The final words of the Christ to His apostles, gathered together in the upperchamber (in the Hierarchy, symbolically) were, “Lo, I am with you all the days,even unto the end of the age,” or cycle. Here He was speaking as Head of theHierarchy, which constitutes His Ashram, and also speaking as the Monad andexpressing His divine Will to pervade or inform the world continuously andendlessly with His overshadowing consciousness; He expressed universality andthe ceaseless continuity and contact which is the characteristic of monadiclife—of life itself. It was also a tremendous affirmation, sent forth on theenergy of the will, and making all things new and all things possible.If you will carefully study these four statements you will see what is theknowledge referred to in this command given in Rule XIV to the initiate at thefirst initiation, the command to Know . It is the order to reorient the soul tothe monad and not an order to reorient the personality to the soul, as is so oftbelieved.The word Express , in its deepest meaning and when given at the secondinitiation, does not mean the necessity to express the nature of the soul. Itmeans (behind all other possible meanings) the command to express the willnature of the monad and to “feel after” and embody the Purpose which lies behindthe Plan, as a result of the developed sensitivity. Obedience to the Plan bringsrevelation of the hidden Purpose, and this is a phrasing of the great objectivewhich impulses the Hierarchy itself. As the initiate learns cooperation with thePlan and demonstrates this in his life of service, then within himself andparalleling this activity to which he is dedicated as a personality and soul,there is also an awakening realisation of the Father aspect, of the nature ofthe will, of the existence and factual nature of [316] Shamballa and of theuniversality and the livingness of whatever is meant by the word “Being.” Heknows and is beginning to express that pure Being as pure will in activity.When the third initiation is taken the initiate becomes aware, not only of thesignificance of the command to Know and of his innate ability to Express thewill nature of the monad in carrying out the Purpose of Shamballa, but that(through his fused personality-soul) he is now in a position to “makerevelation” to the Hierarchy that he is en rapport with the monadic source fromwhich he originally came. He can now obey the command to Reveal, because theTransfiguration is consummated. He is not now revealing the soul only, but allthe three aspects now meet in him and he can reveal the life aspect as will andnot only the soul aspect as love or the matter aspect as intelligence. This is,as you know the first major initiation from the angle of the greater Lodge onSirius, because it is the first initiation in which all the three aspects meetin the initiate. The first two initiations—oft regarded by humanity as majorinitiations—are in reality minor initiations from the Sirian point of view,because the relation of the man “under discipline and in training” is only atendency ; there is only a developing recognition of the Father and a slowlygrowing response to the monad, plus an unfolding sensitivity to the impact ofthe will aspect. But in the third initiation these developments are sufficientlypresent to merit the phrase, “revelation of the glory,” and the Transfigurationinitiation takes place.At the fourth initiation the destroying aspect of the will can begin to make itspresence felt; the soul body, the causal body, the Temple of the Lord, isdestroyed by an act of the will and because even the soul is recognised as alimitation by that which is neither the body nor the soul, but that which standsgreater than either. The awareness of the perfected man is now focussed in thatof the monad. The road to Jerusalem has been trodden. This is a symbolical wayof saying that the antahkarana has been constructed and [317] the Way to theHigher Evolution—which confronts the higher initiates—has now opened up.The three aspects of the will, as focussed in the Spiritual Triad, are now infull expressions the initiate is animated by Purpose, but faces still greaterevolutionary developments; of these I do not need to speak, as they concerndivine aspects as yet unknown and unregistered by man. The reason for thiscomplete ignorance is that the vehicles of any man below the third initiationcontain too much “impure matter” to record the impact of these divine qualities.Only the “created body” (the mayavirupa) of an initiate of the fourth initiationcan begin to register these divine impacts; it is therefore waste of our time toconsider even the possibility of their existence. Even I, a Master, andtherefore an initiate of a relatively high degree, am only faintly sensing them,and that because I am learning to obey the fifth word which we will briefly,very briefly, now consider.5. Resurrect.One of the greatest of all distortions, and one of the most misleading of thetheological teachings, has been the interpretation put upon the word“resurrection” in the Christian approach. This resurrection has been applied inmany cases to the resurrection of the body; it is also applied to the fact (theselfishly motivated wish) of immortality; it is applied also to the physicalresurrection of the Christ after he supposedly died upon the Cross. Resurrectionteaches essentially the “lifting up” of matter into heaven; it does not teachthe eternal persistence of the physical body of a man, as many Fundamentaliststoday suppose, looking for the reappearance of the discarded physical body; itdoes teach the “livingness of Life” and the state of “unalterable Being.” Thisunalterable Being constitutes the nature of the Monad, and it is to thiscondition of awareness that Christ attained when He functioned as a WorldSaviour and thereby guaranteed, by the force of His achievement as apersonality-soul, the same point of attainment for us, for we are equally andessentially sons of the Father or expressions of the Monad, [318] the One. Itdoes not, however, signify the resurrection of some personality in a particularvehicle used in a particular incarnation.The whole concept of resurrection is the new and most important revelation whichis coming to humanity, and which will lay the basis for the new world religion.In the immediate past, the keynote of the Christian religion has been death,symbolised for us in the death of the Christ, and much distorted for us by St.Paul in his effort to blend the new religion which Christ gave us with the oldblood religion of the Jews. In the coming cycle, this distorted teaching ondeath will assume its rightful place and be known as the disciplining urge torelinquishment and to the ending by death of the hold by matter over the soul;the great goal of all religious teaching will be the resurrection of the spiritin man, and eventually in all forms of life, from the lowest point in evolutionto the highest monadic experience. The emphasis in the future will be upon the“livingness of the Christ nature”—the proof of which will be the RisenChrist—and upon the use of the will invoking this “living display.” The gloryand the radiance of the Transfiguration initiation will eventually be relegatedto its destined place, and what is meant by the “display of life” will dimly besensed in its unimaginable beauty.The line or the path or the Way of Resurrection is the “Radiant Way” to which wehave given the cumbersome name of the Antahkarana; this Way leads straight anddirectly from one great planetary centre to another—from Humanity to theHierarchy and from the Hierarchy to Shamballa. This is the Way of Resurrection.It is a Way which is composed of the light of intelligent substance, of theradiant attractive substance of love, and the karmic way which is infused by theessence of inflexible will. Forget not that karma is essentially the conditionedwill of the planetary Logos as He orders all things toward the ultimate goal oflife itself through the process of livingness, of loving understanding, and ofintelligent activity.Therefore, the order to resurrect, as understood by the [319] initiate, concernssolely the application of the will nature and the aspect of Shamballa to theimpulsing of hierarchical attraction and activity. It does not concern theindividual life of the upward-moving aspirant or disciple, no matter what hisdegree, except incidentally and because major divine macrocosmic impulses musthave lesser microcosmic effects. All these stupendous words with which we havebeen dealing relate to the cooperation of the initiate with the Will ofShamballa, and therefore, my brothers, are only dim hints to you.PART TWO - INTRODUCTORY REMARKS[323] We now come to the final part of A Treatise on the Seven Rays and I havein mind three things which it appears to me to be necessary to do; these threewill make this Treatise not only the textbook of the new psychology but also amore vital factor in the human consciousness, because the fact of initiationwill be emphasised. These three are:> 1. I propose to deal with the theme of Initiation in order to prepare the> world of men for the restoration of the Mysteries.> 2. I will give some definite teaching on the Centres from the planetary angle> and also from the angle of the individual aspirant.> 3. I will endeavour to relate the seven Ray energies to the five and the seven> Initiations and to the three and the seven centres in a new and more arresting> manner.This is a large order and one not easy to fulfill because so much has alreadybeen given out anent initiation; the subject is dangerously familiar. By that Imean that certain preconceived ideas are already present in men's minds and manyof these are not factual in nature and need to be discarded or, at the best,reinterpreted. I have myself dealt in a broad and general way with the subjectof initiation in one of my earliest books: Initiation, Human and Solar ; also,scattered through all my writings over the years is a mass of information whichneeds collating and bringing together as a basis for the instruction ofdisciples in training for an initiation.In Discipleship in the New Age, Volume I, I gave out much more upon this subjectand also information of a deeply esoteric nature anent the Ashrams of theMasters. The second volume of the book also contains much that is new and shouldserve to bring this whole subject much closer to public understanding. In theinstructions now to be given, however, I shall endeavour to cover the ground[324] not already considered, and look at the subject of initiation from theangle of the seven rays, from the effect upon the centres, planetary andindividual, and from the point of view of the esoteric training of the acceptedaspirant or disciple. (These instructions were begun in March 1946 and completedin March 1949.)This final Volume of A Treatise on the Seven Rays will eventually change theattitude of men's minds towards the Mysteries and towards the activity ofspiritual transference, which is one of the names given by the Masters to thebasic mystery of initiation. In due time our educational centres, particularlythose concerned with adult education, will take into calculation, normally andcustomarily, the fact of future initiation where their students are concerned,and will study their graduates from this angle in order to give advice orrecommendation. In these institutions the elements of true esotericism will betaught, though they will not be then regarded as esoteric.It will be apparent to you that this long Treatise is in the nature of apreparatory thesis covering a vast field or area of information. The first twovolumes dealt with the sevenfold nature of man and with the influence of theseven basic energies or rays upon his unfoldment and his history, and (in abriefer manner) upon the world in which he lives and upon the environment whichaids and conditions him. In the third volume we took into consideration theinfluences of the constellations and planets upon the man and upon our planet,the Earth, and gave much time to the consideration of esoteric astrology; therays, the signs, the constellations and the planets are all of them closelyinterrelated and the human being is the recipient of the energies and forceswhich they emanate or distribute. This makes the man what he essentially is atany one time whilst in incarnation.We next considered the subject of healing because of the necessity ofunderstanding the limitations—psychological and physical—which restrict man'sfree expression of divinity. We dealt with a major condition which has to befaced [325] and comprehended if humanity is ever to step off the ordinary pathof evolution on to the path of discipleship and of initiation. Man has to becomeaware of the ray effects, of the place the centres play in his advance andunfoldment, and of the play of energies and forces which produce thedifficulties and the diseases, and can at the same time cure them and bringabout the liberation of the man.From the consideration of limitations we passed on to an entirely new theme andan entirely new concept as regards man's education when he has reached arelatively very advanced stage of unfoldment. I gave you the new teaching anentthe antahkarana or the mode and method whereby the initiate could relate in onegreat fusion or at-one-ment not only the soul and the personality, but monad,soul, and personality. This teaching has carried all that has hitherto beengiven, down the ages, another step further on and indicated the next stage ofdevelopment ahead of the disciple. The time has come, as the Hierarchy hadforeseen, for further light upon the endless Way.Teaching anent the five initiations which confront all aspirants has long beengiven and has become public property; it has meant very little for most peopleand nothing at all to the mass of men; it has been regarded by theintelligentsia as vague and visionary nonsense; some few have admitted thatthese initiations may be possible, and others say that they are simply symbolicmodes of indicating some final achievement which mankind faces; still othershave accepted this teaching and have come to regard the initiations as goals andhave then taken the necessary steps to prove the veridical nature of theirbeliefs; they have proved it, have become initiate, and have attained the statusof Master of the Wisdom and taken their place within the Hierarchy. There is,therefore, a certain familiarity about these goals, the service they couldentail and the consummation of the hierarchical possibilities; this itselfindicates that the time had come when certain faint indications of that whichlies behind the Mysteries and of that which is to be seen ahead of those whohave achieved initiation should [326] be somewhat clarified; I therefore startedto impart three phases of information:I. I gave out teaching which indicated the mode of bridging the gap between thelower three worlds and the world of the Spiritual Triad. In doing this, itbecame apparent that there were three groupings or levels of consciousness whichhad to be recognised:> 1. The three worlds of human evolution.> a. The mental plane.> b. The astral plane.> c. The physical plane.> 2. The three levels of the mental plane.> a. The level of the concretising mind, the lower mind.> b. The level on which the soul is to be found.> c. The level of the abstract or higher mind.> 3. The three worlds of superhuman evolution, the levels of the Spiritual> Triad: atma-buddhi-manas.Between the higher three and the lower three and embracing the mental plane wasa definite gap, a break in the continuity of conscious contact or an area wherethere was no channelling for the inpouring of higher energies. Here the teachingof the conscious building of the antahkarana was required; thus the gap betweenthe mental unit and the manasic permanent atom, between the personality (indweltby the soul) and the Spiritual Triad could be bridged by the aspirant himself.II. I found it necessary also to indicate the nature of the Way of the HigherEvolution which had been hinted at but about which absolutely no information hadbeen given. It is the Way which opens out before the Master of the Wisdom,leading to states of identification and levels of awareness which lie outsideour planetary sphere altogether. The following of this Way enables the Master to“abstract” Himself from the seven planes of our planetary life and divestHimself of all we understand as material existence. [327] Forget not that ourseven planes are only the seven subplanes of the cosmic physical plane.III. I therefore opened up the subject of the possibility of the higherinitiations which confront the Members of the Hierarchy. In this connection itis useful to remember that:> 1. The Council Chamber at Shamballa provides a goal for the Members of the> Hierarchy, but not an abiding place.> 2. The seven Paths which stretch out before a Master are entered by the> treading of the Way of the Higher Evolution.> 3. The so-called third initiation, the Transfiguration, is only the first> major initiation, from the standpoint of the Hierarchy; it marks the moment in> time and space when the initiate sees truly and for the first time the door> which opens on to this higher Way. Then—if he chooses the Path that the Christ> chose (and there is no reason that he should)—he will “set his face to go up> to Jerusalem.”These are some of the things which I have hinted at in past writings; they havebeen touched upon, vaguely and mysteriously, by past teachers and somewhat moreexplicitly by myself; I propose to be a little more definite in this newsection.Teaching, if true, must be in line with the past and must provide scope forendeavour in the present and must also hold out further enlightenment for thosewho have succeeded or are succeeding in attaining the indicated goals. Theremust be a spiritual future indicated. It is that which is required now, for manyare attaining the goals proposed by the Hierarchy, and others are workingtowards them. The taking of initiation is now often to be seen and is far morefrequent today than at any other time in the history of the race; for those whohave thus succeeded, the next step forward and the new spiritual enticement mustbe clearly disclosed. Evolution is not a static thing; death cannot be the [328]reward of living effort. To be static, to have attained all that can beattained, and to be at a complete standstill would be utter death and, mybrothers, there is no death. There is only progress from glory to glory, amoving forward from point to point on the divine Way, and from revelation torevelation towards those points and revelations which are perhaps part of theGoal of God Himself. What the goals are upon the Higher Way is as yet utterlyunknown to you; what divine qualities and objectives may be revealed to theMaster and to the Christ as They tread the Way which leads Them off the cosmicphysical plane altogether, you cannot know or sense, and if you could, you wouldnot comprehend the meaning. “Eye hath not seen nor ear heard” the things whichGod will reveal to those who tread the way to the innermost centre, to those wholove. This ancient writing can be paraphrased as follows: It is impossible torealise the wonder of the future which the planetary Logos will unfold beforethose who have unfolded the second divine aspect, Love, and who are thereforefull Members of the Hierarchy, the centre where the energy of Love is anchored.It is interesting to realise that the unfoldment of the love nature is thatwhich opens the door which leads to the Way of the Higher Evolution and thatnothing else will open it. This Way leads the Master off the cosmic physicalplane on to the cosmic astral plane or to a level of cosmic awareness whereon isgenerated that cosmic impulse which we call Love.It will be obvious to you that as this Treatise is not written to instructMembers of the Hierarchy, but only for aspirants and disciples and initiatesbelow the grade of the third initiation, much that I will say will be somewhat“blind” or veiled in symbol; much that I could say (if words existed of anadequate nature) will not be said. Those that have eyes to see and ears to hearwill read between the lines and correctly interpret my symbols, hints andreferences. To many what I will say will be as meaningless as A Treatise onCosmic Fire is to the average reader and as the entire theme of initiation is tothe ignorant and the undeveloped [329] man. Much, however, should be ofpractical service to the struggling disciple, and I want in these concludingpages to fire his zeal, deepen his understanding, stimulate his capacity tolove, and enlighten his mind. Such is what I seek to do. On his part, let himapproach this subject with deep humility, with a meditative and reflectiveattitude, and with a refusal to materialise the presented concepts, as is soeasy a thing to do. Let him refuse to step down the teaching to the level of hisphysical consciousness. In these words I have conveyed a basic hint.Love and light are the great revealers, and if the student truly seeks tounderstand and profit by what I am endeavouring to teach, let him love all menmore deeply and let him see to it that his light shines forth in a dark place,for “in that light shall he see Light.” It is the lesser light within thatreveals the greater light; when the light of the soul combines with the light ofthe lower man, then that fused and blended light will enable the aspirant to seethe Door which opens upon the Way of the Higher Evolution.In considering our theme I propose to divide what I have to say, according to myusual custom as follows:> The Aspirant and the Mysteries of Initiation> The entering of the two Doors> The entering of the Ashrams> The dual life of the initiatory process> The science of the Antahkarana> The Aspirant and the Major Initiations> The relation of the seven Rays to the Initiations> The significance of the initiations> The Aspirant and the seven CentresI have given you here and elsewhere in my writings all that it is at this timepossible to give anent the planetary centres and the rays, including the rays ofnations and of races. You will find a wealth of information hidden in my variousbooks if due search is made and the material is gathered together into acoherent whole. I suggest that you study and compare, read and search topicallyand extract all that I have said about the various nations, their governing[330] constellations and their planetary rulers. This will facilitate researchinto the relation of the planetary centres to the systemic centres, the sacredplanets and the energies pouring through them from the constellations which they“rule” in the esoteric sense. This is one of the paradoxes of occultism but itcan be understood if the student remembers that the centres in his etheric bodyrule in so far as they are receptive or non-receptive to the influencesemanating from the planet, via the planetary centres. It would not be advisablefor me to give out the relation of the planetary centres to the centres of thehuman being; there is not enough love present as yet to balance such knowledgeand to offset any possible misuse with its dire consequences. The reason Iinclude them in the above outline is to show the organic wholeness of our theme,for the life of man encompasses the abstract and subjective as well as the outerphysical levels of the manifested world.I have made two affirmations during the past years anent the Hierarchy. One wasthat as a result of the cleansing of the Earth through the medium of the worldwar (1914-1945) and through the suffering to which humanity has been subjected(with a consequent purifying effect which will demonstrate later), it will bepossible for the Hierarchy to externalise itself and function openly upon thephysical plane. This will indicate a return to the situation which existed inAtlantean days when (using the Biblical symbolism) God Himself walked amongmen—divinity was present in physical form because the Members of the Hierarchywere guiding and directing the affairs of humanity as far as innate freewillpermitted. On a higher turn of the spiral, this again will happen. The Masterswill walk openly among men. Secondly, the Hierarchy will then restore theancient Mysteries, the ancient landmarks so earnestly preserved by the Masonictradition and which have been securely embalmed in the Masonic ritual, awaitingthe day of resurrection.These ancient Mysteries were originally given to humanity by the Hierarchy, andwere—in their turn—received [331] by the Hierarchy from the Great White Lodge onSirius. They contain the clue to the evolutionary process, hidden in numbers andin words; they veil the secret of man's origin and destiny, picturing for him inrite and ritual the long, long path which he must tread. They provide also, whenrightly interpreted and correctly presented, the teaching which humanity needsin order to progress from darkness to Light, from the unreal to the Real andfrom death to Immortality. Any true Mason who understands, even if only to aslight degree, the implications of that in which he participates will recognisethis most ancient of Oriental prayers, giving the key to the three degrees ofthe Blue Lodge. I mention here the Masonic purpose because it is closely relatedto the restoration of the Mysteries and has held the clue—down the ages—to thatlong-awaited restoration, to the platform upon which the restored teaching canbe based, and the structure which can express, in powerful ritual and inorganised detailed rites, the history of man's moving forward upon the Path ofReturn.The Mysteries will be restored in other ways also, for they contain much besidesthat which the Masonic rites can reveal or that religious rituals and ceremoniescan disclose; they contain within their teaching and formulas the key to thescience which will unlock the mystery of electricity—that mystery of whichH.P.B. spoke; though much progress has already been made by science along thisline, it is as yet only embryonic in nature, and only when the Hierarchy ispresent visibly on earth, and the Mysteries of which the Masters are theCustodians are given openly to man, will the true secret and nature ofelectrical phenomena be revealed.The Mysteries are, in reality, the true source of revelation, and it can be onlywhen the mind and the will-to-good are closely blended and conditioning humanbehaviour that the extent of the coming revelation will be grasped, for onlythen can humanity be trusted with these secrets. They concern those capacitieswhich enable the Members of the Hierarchy to work consciously with the energiesof the planet and of the solar system and to control forces within the [332]planet; they will put the ordinary psychic powers (today so stupidly approachedand so little understood) in their rightful place and guide man towards theirhelpful usage.The Mysteries will restore colour and music as they essentially are to the worldand do it in such a manner that the creative art of today will be to this newcreative art what a child's building of wooden blocks is to a great cathedralsuch as Durham or Milan. The Mysteries, when restored, will make real—in a senseincomprehensible to you at present—the nature of religion, the purpose ofscience and the goal of education. These are not what you think today.The ground is being prepared at this time for this great restoration. TheChurches and Masonry are today before the judgment seat of humanity's criticalmind and the word has gone forth from that mass mind that both of them failed intheir divinely assigned tasks. It is realised everywhere that new life must bepoured in and great changes wrought in the awareness and in the training ofthose who work through and in these two media of truth. Those changes have notyet been carried out, for it will take a new vision and a new approach to lifeexperience, and this only the coming generation is capable of giving; they andthey alone can bring about the needed alterations and the revitalisation, but itcan and will be done:> “That which is a mystery shall no longer be so, and that which has been veiled> will now be revealed: that which has been withdrawn will emerge into the> light, and all men shall see and together they shall rejoice. That time will> come when desolation has wrought its beneficent work, when all things have> been destroyed, and men, through suffering, have sought to be impressed by> that which they had discarded in vain pursuit of that which was near at hand> and easy of attainment. Possessed, it proved to be an agency of death—yet men> sought life, not death.”So runs the Old Commentary when referring to the present cycle through whichmankind is passing.[333] The tests for the first initiation, as far as humanity (the worlddisciple) is concerned, are well-nigh over and the hour of the birth of theChrist as an expression of the fourth kingdom in nature and the consummation ofthe work of the Fourth Creative Hierarchy is at hand. This there is nogainsaying; the birth hour may be long and the form may be “in labour” for muchtime, but the Christ will be born and the nature of the Christ and Hisconsciousness will permeate and colour all human affairs. It is thiscondition—so imminent and so desirable and long foretold and anticipated—whichwill make possible the return of the Hierarchy and the restoration of theMysteries.These occurrences are not only dependent upon the fitness of humanity to providethe right setting and upon the inevitability of evolutionary development itself,but the reappearance of the Hierarchy and that which its Members will accomplishis related also (and primarily) to the interior life and the spiritual impulseswithin the Hierarchy itself and unrelated to mankind altogether. The Hierarchypursues its own line of spiritual unfoldment as a paralleling activity to itsservices on Earth in connection with planetary evolution. Men are so apt toregard their own lives and destiny and the unfoldment of the human consciousnessas the factor of only and paramount importance upon Earth and in theevolutionary processes of the planet. These conditions are of importance, butthey are not the only factors of importance, nor does humanity stand alone andisolated. Humanity occupies a midway point between the subhuman and thesuperhuman kingdoms, and each of these groups of evolving lives has its ownimportant destiny—important to all contained within the group ring-pass-not.They have their own chosen and differing modes, methods and ways of achievement.Just as individual man has to learn the art or science of relationship to othermen and to his environment, so humanity as a whole has to learn its relationshipto that which lies above and beyond mankind and with that which is below andleft behind. This involves a sense of proportion which can be attained only bythe mind principle in man [334] and by those who are beginning to be mentallypolarised. This sense of proportion will reveal to men their place upon theladder of evolution and lead them to the recognition of the peculiar destiny andunique goals of other kingdoms in nature, including the fifth kingdom, theKingdom of God, the spiritual Hierarchy of our planet.The Hierarchy is itself also at a point of spiritual crisis. Its initiates standbefore the Door which leads to the Way of the Higher evolution and the entirepersonnel of the Hierarchy waits to make a united move forward, paralleling—onits own level—the move forward which humanity is also destined to make.But, my brothers, here is the point of interest. Under the great law ofsynthetic expression (called by us the Law of Synthesis, the law governing thefirst divine aspect) the Hierarchy must move forward in such a manner that theeffort must encompass the physical plane as well as the higher planes. Theactivity engineered must cover the three worlds of human evolution as well asthe three worlds of the Spiritual Triad. Forget not the overlapping of these twoworlds which takes place upon the mental plane and warrants the well-knownphrase “the five worlds of superhuman evolution.” Hence, therefore, thenecessity for the externalisation of the Hierarchy and the demonstration ofTheir united ability to work from the physical plane up to the highest, in orderto move unitedly through this Door on to the Way. Speaking symbolically, thisexternalisation is for the Members of the Hierarchy an act of sacrificialservice, but it is also a symbolic gesture. The Hierarchy incarnates on Earthagain, and for the first time since its last incarnation in Atlantean days. Itis, however, a group incarnation and not the incarnation of individual Members.This is probably a subtle point too difficult for you to grasp.The externalisation of the Hierarchy, therefore, and the restoration of theMysteries, are not something done for humanity or simply carried out because menhave earned a closer contact, have the right to some reward or are now sospiritual that the Hierarchy can have a good and useful time [335] helping them.The picture is entirely different. What looms with such importance in theconsciousness of men is, in reality, quite secondary in relation to thehierarchical crisis which we are considering. This reappearance upon thephysical plane and the consequent life of service (involving factors of profoundsignificance to men) are an expression of the inherent spiritual impulse whichis impelling hierarchical action in two directions but involving one unifiedmovement, embracing all the five planes of superhuman evolution andnecessitating a group recapitulation of incarnated process.The Hierarchy has its own life and its own goals and objectives, its ownevolutionary rhythm and its own spiritual expansions; these are not the same asthose of the human kingdom. These goals and rhythms will become more familiar tothinking men as the Hierarchy approaches closer to the physical plane.This inclusive and planned activity of the Hierarchy is related to spiritualincentives which have their roots in Shamballa. There the life aspect is beingalmost violently stimulated through the action of the Lords of Liberation Whohave swept into planetary activity because of the use of the second Stanza ofthe great Invocation—which was used potently by Members of the Hierarchy. Again,it was not used by Them solely on behalf of humanity or for the liberation ofmankind; it had hierarchical implications also and was in part a demand by theHierarchy for permission to move along the Way. The releasing of the “savingforce” because the hour of service had arrived, permitted (at the same time) theinflow of an aspect of energy which never reached humanity at all and was notintended for strictly human use, but which was retained by the Hierarchy for thevitalising into renewed livingness of the seven major Ashrams, thus enabling theentire Ashram of the Christ to lift itself on to a higher spiritual level andcloser to the door which leads to Life.These statements veil deep hierarchical mysteries and are not in any way relatedto the Mysteries which will concern [336] humanity when the Hierarchy isexternalised. These mysteries will not be revealed to men. Only a generalstatement of the effects upon the Hierarchy of certain mysterious activities ispermissible. They serve to show the steady pulsation of the evolutionary rhythmwhich permeates every atom, form, group and centre upon our planet, producingeffects upon the lowest forms of existence and on and up to the very highest;there is naught anywhere but progress and a steady moving forward into clearerlight and greater livingness.In these instructions I am dealing with the entire theme of initiation from itsbroad and general angle and from the angle of definition; it is not myintention, therefore, to duplicate here what is given in Volume II ofDiscipleship in the New Age. Our approach will be somewhat different in thisfinal section of our Treatise; we will confine ourselves to the effect of therays upon the initiate and to the relation existing between the ray energies andvarious initiations which I have already outlined. In this section also I do notintend to deal with the scientific awakening of the centres or with thetechnicalities of bringing them into the desired balance and activity. I havealready given what is necessary in my various books, where a very great deal ofinformation is given and will be found scattered through all of them. By meansof this diffusion and scattering, the teaching is protected and cannotconstitute a danger to the general public. Students in the immediate future willhave to search out the teaching in all the many volumes and hunt most carefullyfor the details of the science of the centres and for information anent theirnature and processes. The whole subject of the centres is dangerous ifmisunderstood; the centres constitute a menace when prematurely awakened orunduly energised, and this entire subject can prove most dangerous to thecuriosity-impelled man and to the ignorant experimenter. The time is not yetripe for the presentation of this subject in a fully coordinated manner;students are warned against publishing a clear correlated thesis on the subjectas a result of their researches in my books. Nevertheless, [337] the trueaspirant must be given the needed information.The Mysteries are revealed not primarily by the reception of information anentthem and their processes, but by the action of certain processes, carried outwithin the etheric body of the disciple; these enable him to know that which ishidden; they put him in possession of a mechanism of revelation and make himaware of certain radiatory and magnetic powers or energies within himself whichconstitute channels of activity and modes whereby he may acquire that which itis the privilege of the initiate to own and to use.The disciple upon the Probationary Path starts off on his quest for the door ofinitiation, and for that which he will contact after passing through that door,with a definite equipment and created mechanism. This has been acquired, andfacility in its use has been attained, through many cycles of incarnation. Anincarnation is a definitely determined period (from the angle of the soul)wherein Experiment, Experience and Expression are the keynotes in eachincarnation. Each successive incarnation continues the experiment, deepens theexperience and relates the expression more closely to the latent unfoldingdivinity.The same three words—in greatly enhanced interpretation and with the emphasisupon a much fuller opportunity—can be used to describe the progress of theinitiate upon the final stages of the Path; with this we shall be partly engagedin this section. I would ask you, whilst reading and pondering upon all that Isay, to have these three words in mind. Every initiation is approached by thedisciple or initiate in a spirit of divine experimentation, but with ascientific aspect, because an initiation is a culminating moment of achievement,and success is a graded series of experiments with energy.Having garnered the fruit of the experiment above indicated, there follows acertain period wherein experience in the use of the related potencies talesplace. This occupies the interlude between one initiation and another. This maycover a period of many lives or prove relatively short. The results of theexperiment of initiation and of experience [338] with the then endowed energiesemerge as the ability of the initiate to express divinity more fully thanheretofore; this means that he increasingly can function as a divine creator inrelation to the hierarchical Plan, as the manipulator of the attractive energiesof love, and as one who determines under the impelling will of Shamballa—thephase or aspect of the divine purpose with which he must himself be occupied inrelation to the manifestation of the planetary Logos. You will note that I donot say in relation to humanity. The initiate works in many fields of divinecreativity of which the field of mankind is only one.These three words will therefore indicate the first type of approach to oursubject; what I have to say will therefore, in every case, have them in mind.Secondly, I would have you consider with me the various aspects of our sectionaltheme from the angle of the seven rays. By this I mean that disciples upon thedifferent rays will all have the same goal, make the same experiments, gothrough the same experience and arrive equally at divine expression. However,their qualities and their modes of approach, their reactions and theirdistinctive natures will differ according to their ray type; this constitutes amost interesting and little known phase of our study of initiation. Initiationhas been a blanket happening, and no note has been made of the ray implications.This I propose to remedy.Each of the seven initiations, for instance, is an exemplification or a revealerof one of the seven ray qualities or tendencies; it is governed and conditionedalways by a certain ray, and this is one of the factors which disciples have tolearn and grasp whilst preparing for an initiation, because it involves successin handling and manipulating certain types of divine energy.Each of the initiations brings one or other of the seven centres into fullfunctioning activity, not from the angle of awakening or of stimulation, butfrom the angle of a “wheel turning upon itself.” This is an Old Testamentexpression [339] and is wholly inadequate, but I can find none other tosubstitute. The wording is totally blind and inadequate and will prove to yousomewhat meaningless, except to the initiate who has experienced that turning.As esoteric astrologers know well, there comes a life cycle wherein the disciplereverses himself upon the Wheel of Life (the zodiacal wheel) and from goingclockwise around the zodiac, he now begins to go anti-clockwise; he learns thatthe substance aspect of his nature may still be conditioned by the forcesflowing through them sequentially and serially, and according to his horoscopeand according to the exoteric mode of the zodiacal revolution; at the same time,the disciple is receiving energy currents from the reversed wheel whereon he, asa soul, finds himself. He is consequently the recipient of two currents ofenergy, going in reverse directions; hence the increased conflict in his lifeand circumstances; these constitute the reason for the tests of initiation.This, on a tiny scale, is true of the centres in the etheric body of thedisciple; they too evidence the same dual activity, once the Path ofDiscipleship is trodden and the Path of Initiation is entered. The zodiacalwheel is itself essentially a cosmic centre; it is a twelve-petalled lotus, butit is a twelve-petalled lotus within the thousand-petalled lotus of an unknowncosmic Entity, the One referred to in my earlier books as the ONE ABOUT WHOMNAUGHT MAY BE SAID.The multiplicity of zodiacal influences have eventually a dual effect: one uponShamballa (the planetary head centre) and the other upon the Hierarchy (theplanetary heart centre); the effect is also felt in the head centre and theheart centre of every initiate. This final dual activity is registered by theinitiate of the highest degrees when he undergoes the eighth and ninthinitiations; the other seven initiations are governed by the seven rays.You have, therefore: [340]Initiation 1.

All that is possible is to indicate certain spiritual trends andtendencies and—as this section is written primarily for those who have taken orwho are preparing to take one or other of the initiations—I can only hope thatsome meaning will be conveyed to those persons who are ready.A careful study of the above tabulation should give you [341] a somewhatdifferent idea anent the whole subject of initiation. The concept which has tosupersede the one at present extant is that of group initiation, and not that ofthe initiation of an individual aspirant. In the past, and in order to get theidea of initiation into the minds of the people, the Hierarchy chose the mode(now obsolete) of holding out the prospect of initiation before the earnestdisciple; upon this they placed an early emphasis of its peculiarity, itsrewarding nature, its ritual and ceremonies, and its place in the scale ofevolution. Since the fact of initiation had been grasped by many and achieved bysome, it has become possible today to reveal what has always been implied, thatinitiation is a group event. If clear thinking had taken the place of a selfishindividual aspiration, the fact of group initiation would have been obvious andfor the following reasons, inherent and implied in the whole situation:> 1. The soul—in its own nature—is group conscious and has no individual> ambitions or individual interests, and is not at all interested in the aims of> its personality. It is the soul which is the initiate. Initiation is a process> whereby the spiritual man within the personality becomes aware of himself as> the soul, with soul powers, soul relationships, and soul purpose. The moment a> man realises this, even in a small measure, it is the group of which he is> conscious.> 2. Only the man whose sense of identity is beginning to expand and become> inclusive can “take initiation” (as it is erroneously termed). If initiation> were a purely personal achievement, it would throw the man back into the> separative consciousness, out of which he is endeavouring to escape. This> would not be spiritual progression. Every step upon the Path of Initiation> increases group recognition. Initiation is essentially an expanding series of> inclusive recognitions.> 3. Initiation admits the aspirant into membership in the Hierarchy. This> involves, speaking esoterically, the relinquishing of all separative> personality reactions in a series of progressive renunciations; these> culminate [342] in the fourth initiation, and are again mysteriously> emphasised at the ninth initiation.It dawns on the initiate, as he proceeds from one initiation to another, thateach time he moves forward on the path or penetrates into the heart of theMysteries in company with those who are as he is, who share with him the samepoint in evolution, and who are working with him towards the same goal, that heis not alone; that it is a joint effort that is being made. This is in fact thekeynote of an Ashram, conditioning its formation. It is composed of disciplesand initiates at various stages of initiate-unfoldment who have arrived at theirpoint of ashramic consciousness together, and who will proceed together untilthey arrive at that complete liberation which comes when the cosmic physicalplane drops below the threshold of consciousness or of sensitive awareness andno longer holds any point of interest for the initiate.This is one of the new factors in hierarchical methods and techniques which Ihave had the responsibility of bringing to public attention, and so correctingthe erroneous teaching of those trained under orthodox (so called) schools ofoccultism. The Master K.H., in one of the few (the very few) paragraphs in TheMahatma Letters which are genuine and not simply the work of H.P.B., gave a hintto aspirants of that time when He said that so many of them were so “spirituallyselfish.” This spiritual selfishness has led the average esoteric student toappropriate initiation and to make it personal and individual. Yet one of theprime prerequisites for initiation is a clear and concise recognition of one'sown group, not through a process of wishful thinking, but through factualcooperation and work upon the physical plane. I said group, my brother, and notorganisation, for they are two very different things.Have carefully in mind, therefore, the fact of group initiation, and forego theprocess of considered thought anent your preparation for initiation. Some groupsare being prepared for initiation in which the following factors control—as faras the individual is concerned: [343]1. A group of men and women whose souls are on some one ray are gatheredtogether subjectively by a Master on the same ray, for group training.2. Opportunity is given to such people to contact on the physical plane some ofthose who are thus subjectively linked, and thus mutually convey a sense ofgroup solidarity. The subjective relationship is assured by an objectivecontact. Recognition is therefore a preliminary test of initiation, and thisshould be remembered.3. Such people thus being trained and related are, from the angle of theinitiation to be taken, at the same point in evolution. They are taking the sameinitiation and are being subjected to the same tests and difficulties. Thesetests and difficulties are due to the fact of the personality ray which may be(and usually is) quite different to the soul ray. It is the personality raywhich works to prevent contact, to mislead in recognition, to retard progressand to misinterpret information. As long as a disciple in training is focussedin his personality, group initiation will not be possible for him, hisrecognition of co-aspirants will be fleeting and rapidly disturbed by thecritical lower mind, and a wall of thoughtforms, created by the personality,anent the group members, will be thrown up and prevent a united moving forwardthrough the Door of Initiation.4. Group initiation cannot be achieved by a group in training until the members,as a group, have developed their particular “spiritual enterprise.” It is thelaw of the spirit that the disciple must appear before the Initiatorempty-handed, but that in group formation the group members unitedly contributesomething to the enrichment of the Ashram. This may take the form of someconsidered project in line with the Plan, whereby they testify to theircomprehension of that Plan and demonstrate to the initiate-company in which theyfind themselves, and those senior disciples to whose contact they are to beadmitted, that they have already proven their fitness for acceptance and haveproven it along the line of service. It has to be a group [344] enterprise, agroup service and a group contribution. The specific contribution of theindividual does not appear.This thought of group initiation must be remembered, for it will colour all thatI shall seek to convey to your minds and will hasten the day of your ownacceptance.No one is admitted (through the processes of initiation) into the Ashram of theChrist (the Hierarchy) until such time as he is beginning to think and live interms of group relationships and group activities. Some well-meaning aspirantsinterpret the group idea as the instruction to them that they should make aneffort to form groups—their own group or groups. This is not the idea as it ispresented in the Aquarian Age, so close today; it was the mode of approachduring the Piscean Age, now passed. Today, the entire approach is totallydifferent. No man today is expected to stand at the centre of his little worldand work to become a focal point for a group. His task now is to discover thegroup of aspirants with which he should affiliate himself and with whom he musttravel upon the Path of Initiation—a very different matter and a far moredifficult one. He needs to bear in mind the meaning of the following words fromthe Archives of the Masters, given in question and answer form. The questionsare addressed to the neophyte who is getting his first glimpse of grouprelations leading to group initiation:> “And dost thou see the Door, O Chela in the light?> I see the door and hear a calling voice.

InAtlantean times, when the Door of Initiation stood wide open, the aspirants tothe Mysteries were admitted in groups of seven, but had not contacted theirfellow group members in physical consciousness; the emphasis was still (duringthe training period) upon individual attainment and achievement. Today, sorapidly is man making spiritual progress, the Hierarchy is admitting groups allthe time, particularly in connection with those rays which are at present inincarnation. This means that the three major rays (which are always [346]predominantly active though they may have varying cycles of increased ordecreased activity) have large groups undergoing their preparatory training forsome one initiation. This group admission will develop rapidly as the worldsettles back into a cycle of peaceful growth and unfoldment after the drasticexperience of the world war (1914-1945); it is for this that information such asI am here attempting to give must be made available.One other point I would seek to make clear. As you know, an Ashram has in itdisciples and initiates at all points of evolutionary development and of allgrades and degrees; these all work together in perfect unison and yet—withintheir differentiated ranks, for each degree stands alone yet united with all theothers—with their own established rapport, their coded telepathic interplay, anda shared occult secrecy and silence which guard the secrets and knowledges ofone grade from another and from the unready. Similarly, when an aspirant,seeking upon the physical plane to find those who will share with him themystery of his next immediate step or demonstrated expansion, discovers his owngroup, he will find that it has in it those who have not reached his particularpoint of wisdom and those also who have already left him far behind. He will bedrawn into a vortex of force and a field of service simultaneously. Ponder onthis statement. He will learn, therefore, the lessons required by one who is towork in an Ashram and will know how to handle himself with those who may not yetshare with him the secrets which he already knows, and with those who havepenetrated deeper into the Mysteries than he has."},{"pageContent":"SECTION ONE - THE ASPIRANT AND THE MYSTERIES OF INITIATION[347] Let us now take up our first point in this section and see what is reallymeant by the hackneyed words “door of initiation,” and what constitutes thedifference between the door which faces the disciple and that which confrontsthe Master.THE ENTERING OF THE TWO DOORS OF INITIATIONIt is of course obvious to you that the use of the word “door” is purelysymbolic; the interpretation given to the word by the ordinary esoteric studentand the orthodox Theosophist is that of a point of entry, and the significanceof it to him is that it offers an opportunity to pass to new experience andfresh revelation—much of which is regarded by him as due reward for disciplineand aspiration. That is largely an interpretation based on wishful thinking andis of quite secondary importance.The Door of InitiationThe real meaning underlying the phrase “door of initiation” is that ofobstruction, of something which bars the way, of that which must be opened, orof that which hides or stands between the aspirant and his objective. This is amuch more exact significance and one much more useful for [348] the aspirant tograsp. The picture of a man moving along the Path of Evolution until suddenlyone day he stands before an open door through which he may joyously pass has nofaintest resemblance to the truth; the idea that a man of a nice disposition andpossessing certain character developments such as those portrayed in such books(by Annie Besant) as The Open Court and the Path of Discipleship , whichcondition the theosophical aspirants, is exceedingly misleading. These books arevery useful and should be carefully studied by the man upon the Path ofProbation, but are not so useful to the disciple, for they lead him to put theemphasis in the wrong direction and to focus upon that which should already havebeen developed. Naturally, the character development must be present and assumedto be stable in the man's equipment; these characteristics have, however, littlebearing on initiation and passing through the “door” on the Path. They areindicative of the point reached upon the Path of Evolution, as a result ofexperiment, experience and continuous expression, and should be common to allaspirants who have reached the point of facing discipleship; they areunavoidable developments and connote simply the reaction of the personality totime and experience. It is eternally true that no one may pass through this doorunless these character indications are developed, but that is due to the factthat the aspirant has progressed to a certain stage of unfoldment andautomatically now has a measure of self-control, of mental understanding and ofpurity.I would point out also that even the black magician possesses these qualities,for they are the sine qua non of all magical art, both black and white; theblack magician passes through the door of initiation as it opens twice for thefirst two initiations. He passes through on the strength of his will and hischaracter accomplishments and because the group-conscious aspect of the soul isactive in him as in his brother seeking affiliation with the Great White Lodge.The love aspect is, however, lacking in the black magician. Forget not that allis energy and there is nothing else. The energy which [349] is an aspect of thesoul and which we call magnetic attraction (the group-building quality) heshares with the spiritual aspirant. He is essentially group conscious, andthough his motives are separative, his methods are those of the group, and thesehe can get only from the soul.You see again another reason why the first and second initiations are notregarded by the Lodge of Masters as major initiations. Only the third is soregarded, because at that initiation the entire personality life is flooded withenergy coming from the Spiritual Triad, via the “sacrifice petals” of the willand purpose aspect of the soul. To this type of energy the black magician is notresponsive. He can and does respond to the knowledge—most ancient and hardlywon—stored up in the “knowledge petals” of the souls he can appropriate andutilise the energy of attraction (erroneously called love by some students)stored up in the “love petals” of the soul, but he cannot respond to and use theenergy of divine love, working out in the divine Plan which controls allknowledge and converts it into wisdom, and which actuates and clarifies themotive which brings loving magnetic attraction into action and which we calltrue group consciousness and group cohesion. It is at this point that the twoways—of darkness and of light—become widely divergent. Until the thirdinitiation is taken, glamour may condition the attitude of those seeking tounderstand the life of a man upon the Path, and they may mistake the spuriousfor the real. The black magician leads a disciplined life, analogous to that ofthe spiritual aspirant; he practices purity for his own safeguarding and not inorder that he may become a channel for the energy of light; he works with power(the power of magnetic attraction) with and in groups, but he does this for hisown selfish ends and for the fulfillment of his own ambitious purposes. But atthe third initiation there comes to the true spiritual initiate the revelationwhich is the reward of perseverance and purity rightly motivated—the revelationof the divine purpose, as the soul records it in terms of the hierarchical plan,though not yet in terms of the Monad. To this purpose and [350] to the lovingWill of God (to use a trite Christian phrase) the black brother cannot respond;his aims are different. You have here the true meaning of the oft-used andmisunderstood phrase, “the parting of the ways.”But both groups of aspirants (the black and the white) stand before the door ofinitiation and take the needed steps to open it on two similar occasions. Bothovercome glamour after the second initiation, and see their way clearly ahead;but their goals emerge as widely different; one treads the broad way which leadsever deeper into matter and materialism, into darkness and “black power”; theother leads to the straight and narrow way, to the razor-edged path which leadsinto light and life. One group has never freed itself from the principles whichgoverned the first solar system. They were principles entirely related to matterand substance, and were at that time and in that period (so remote that thenumber of years of distance can be stated only in super-astronomical figures)the conditioning factors for the initiation of the time. Certain units ofhumanity—then existent—were so completely conditioned by these materialprinciples and so deliberately unready for moving on to the comprehension ofanother set of principles (more expressive of the divine nature) that theyremained of “fixed and selfish material purpose” and a planned distortion of thedivine will was intelligently created by them. You have here a hint as to thenature of evil and a clue to a part (though only a part) of the mystery to benoted in the statement that evil and good are reverse aspects of the same onereality, and evil is that good which we should have left behind, passing on togreater and more inclusive good. Forget not that the black magicians of todaywere the initiates of a previous solar system. When the door of initiation isready to open for the third time, the parting of the ways takes place. Somefollow selfish intention and the fixed determination to remain with theseparative condition of matter; and to others, the divine will is clearlyimpressed upon them and becomes the motivating power in their lives. It wasunder instructions from the Great White Lodge on Sirius that the door remains[351] closed the third time to the dark brothers. Evil, as we understand it, hasabsolutely no place on Sirius.To the black magician, at this third opportunity, the door of initiationpresents an insuperable barrier and obstacle; to the true spiritual neophyte,the door connotes “overcoming.” We shall not consider further the approach ofthe black brothers to that door, but shall confine ourselves to a considerationof the initiations of the Great White Lodge.This door of initiation is connected with the great problem of what H.P.B. callsthe “mystery of electricity”; the door is itself an electrical phenomenonessentially. Having said this, even if you do not understand my meaning, youcan, however, grasp the possibility that (being electrical in nature) it caneasily present an obstructing force, a repelling energy to the approach of theaspirant; this is the correct way to look at it. It is only when the electricalenergy of which the door is constituted and that of which the man is constructedat any particular time synchronise and vibrate in unison that the aspirant canpass through to greater light. This gives you a somewhat new and rather abstrusedefinition of initiation. Nevertheless, as science arrives at a betterunderstanding of the human being as an electrical unit of power and light, andof his triple mechanism as created of three aspects of electricity, a truercomprehension of the significance of initiation will eventuate. The three firesof which all things are made are electrical in nature and—speakingsymbolically—it is only when “fire by friction” is dominated by “solar fire”that the first four initiations can be taken, culminating in the fifthinitiation in which these two fires are subordinated to “electric fire”emanating from the monad and giving a new revelation. This monadic processbegins at the third initiation. It might be added that the third initiation(culminating in the Transfiguration) is taken on the three higher levels of themental plane, and that it is therefore upon the fourth level of the mental planethat the aspirant first of all stands before the door, seeking initiation. Thatelectrical unit or phenomenon of electricity [352] which we call the fourthkingdom in nature, on this fourth subplane of the mental plane esoterically“ejects” the unit of electricity which is ready to be absorbed by the higherform of electricity. Fire by friction dies out and solar fire takes its place,and the relationship between the two higher forms of electricity becomesestablished.It is solar fire which forms and likewise guards the door of initiation for thefirst four initiations. It is the electrical fire which forms the door ofinitiation for those initiations which guard the Way to the Higher Evolution.There are four types of fire by friction which create the “obstructing door” inunison with solar fire, of which it is essentially created. These are asfollows:1. Electrical energy, composed of two forces of electricity: the innate, inertand latent force of the physical plane atoms of the dense physical vehicle, andthe force which we call prana which is an aspect of the energy composing theetheric body. These two blend, combine and form the “door” through which thespiritual man must pass then he undergoes the first initiation. This provocativeenergy tests out every part of his physical equipment and—as he passes thetest—the door opens, the opposing energies symbolically “die out,” and he canpass on to the Path of Initiation, free from that type of obstruction. Thephysical body no longer rules him, either through its limitations and faults orthrough the physical disciplines which have been hitherto needed but are nolonger required.2. The electrical energy of the astral or emotional body next confronts him ashe prepares to take the second initiation. You can call this energy, if you sochoose, the sum total of all the glamours; a glamour is essentially abewildering, deceiving and illusory energy-form which seeks to sidetrack andmislead the neophyte and which is attracted to him by ancient habit and oldcontrols. He is therefore responsible for the impact of this energy. This typeof energy takes form, and the massed forms of these glamours constitute theopposing door and oppose the passing of the [353] aspirant on to the next phaseof the Path. With this electrical energy he must deal before he takes the secondinitiation. These particular energies are not thoughtforms; they are drifting,undefined and exceedingly fluid. Of this type of energy water is the symbol, andthis is one reason why this second initiation is called the Baptism initiation,or the initiation of “entering the stream.”3. The electrical energy of the mind now creates the door for the thirdinitiation, and the obstruction which confronts the initiate is that of theelectrical figments of his own thinking, shining with a light which is all theirown (for they are of the highest order and type), but veiling the pure lightwhich shines behind them. They constitute the sumtotal of illusion. This “door”is formed by the coming together of the three types of energy: fire by friction,solar fire (playing in full force at this third initiation), and electrical firefrom the Spiritual Triad, making its first impact on the other two fires, forall three are in full activity at this initiatory crisis. All are localised andconcentrated in that symbol of progress, the “door of initiation.”It should be becoming increasingly clear to you why the initiate is everportrayed as one who works with the forces and energies of the planet and thesystem. To him, there is naught else.4. The fourth type of “fire by friction” which confronts the initiate as hestands prepared for that initiation which we call the Great Renunciation is theelectric energy of the entire integrated personality. That which is the productof every incarnation—the highly developed, powerful and “clear-eyed” personality(as it is called)—is the final event and presents the final great obstruction.In the Gospel story there are two major episodes in the life of the Master Jesuswhich throw some light upon this fourth entrance through the door of initiation:the Transfiguration and the Crucifixion. In both of them the three aspects ofthe personality are symbolised. In the first case, they are symbolised by thethree apostles who in bewilderment and profound humility took part in the thirdinitiation, [354] the Transfiguration; in the second case, the three weredepicted by the three Crosses—the two thieves and the central Master. Thedifference in the fourth initiation is definite; it lies in the fact that thefour aspects of the personality (counting the dense physical body as one aspectand the etheric vehicle as a second aspect of the physical body) are involved,for this fourth emanation of fire by friction has a potent and destructiveeffect upon the dense physical body. The Great Renunciation involves therejection of the physical life at any cost, and that cost frequently involvesits physical death.The Great Renunciation or fourth initiation has, therefore, two aspects: theouter involvement or objective happening in the eyes of the physical planeonlooker, and the subjective aspect, portrayed symbolically by the three Crossesand those who hung upon them.The implications emerging out of this symbolism are not easy to see, even whenthe superficial meaning is apparent, because that superficial meaning hides andveils a universal reality. The Master Jesus passed through the door of thefourth initiation and overcame the final hindrances offered by His perfectedpersonality. He died upon the Cross. All the four aspects of His personalityparticipated in the event, and all four aspects electrically obstructed Hispassing though this door, even to the point of their completedestruction—bringing a final liberation. Something universal was also symbolisedwhich had naught to do with the Initiated Master Jesus.This symbolism and its meaning are related to the three Crosses which stood sideby side and to the relationship between those who hung upon them. In the threefigures humanity itself is portrayed and also related to the Hierarchy, and this“pictorial event” is a parallel to the one already considered—the initiation ofthe Master Jesus. In the Crucifixion, in this fourth passing through the door ofinitiation and in the staging of this event, two great and differentindividualities—the Master Jesus and the World Saviour, the Christ—areimplicated; two major happenings [355] are indicated, and the Christian Churchhas confused the two and related both of them without discrimination to theMaster Jesus. Yet one event was a hierarchical occurrence and the other was agreat human crisis; one was the entrance of an initiate into the Mysteries ofdeath, involving in the process all the four aspects of His nature; the otherwas a dramatic portrayal to mankind of three groups to be found within the humanfamily:> 1. Unregenerate man, pictured by the unrepentant thief.> 2. The struggling aspirant, moving consciously towards liberation, symbolised> for us in the repentant thief.> 3. The Hierarchy, composed of all who have passed to liberation through the> medium of human experience, and thereby representing to us a guarantee of> achievement.Students would do well to keep this fourfold picture and this threefold symbolclearly distinguished in their minds, for individual attainment and the grouppossibilities are both involved; each is, however, distinct; in the one case theMaster Jesus is the participator, and in the other and the more esotericoccurrence it is the One Who overshadows Him, the Christ. It was the MasterJesus who “died” and entered into the tomb, thus climaxing His long series ofincarnations and ending—by destruction—the hold of matter on the spirit; throughthe tomb He passed into the Hierarchy, and the destiny of the Christian Churchwas committed to Him; that destiny still lies in His hands. But in the Gospelstory, it is the Christ Who is indicated as appearing after the resurrection andnot the Master Jesus, except in the one brief episode wherein He appeared toMary, weeping outside the door of the sepulchre. The other episodes areuniversal in their implications, as indicated by:> 1. Christ walking with the two disciples on the road to Emmaus—a symbol of the> essential dualism of spirit and matter, as embodied in a world Saviour.> 2. Christ appearing to the disciples in the upper room, [356] symbolising the> zodiac, for Judas Iscariot was there, standing for the sign at the time in> power; the other eleven disciples representing the remaining signs through> which the sun must pass.> 3. Pentecost. This event does not portray the triumph of orthodox Christianity> (as the theologians believe and teach), but signifies the universal> dissemination of the Christ consciousness throughout all time in the heart of> every human being; to this the words and promise, “Lo, I am with you all the> days, even until the end of the world,” bear witness.It is owing to the deeply esoteric meaning of the Resurrection and the Ascensionand their major significance, referring to the consciousness of the Christ, thatnothing much is told us about these initiations in The New Testament, except thevaguest generalities, in contradistinction to the wealth of detail given anentthe other four initiations. Four of these initiations are related to the “doorof initiation” as occultly understood and with the interpretation of which weare familiar; these four are related also to the electrical “fire by friction”of which that door is constructed, and which spreads to and creates the burningground across which the initiate must four times move in order to “enter throughthat door.”The other two initiations (vaguely called the Resurrection and the Ascension)are related to the second so-called “door.” This door is not in the same sensean obstruction as is the first door; it opens on to the Way of the HigherEvolution. The first door symbolically admits the initiate into the “heart ofthe Sun,” whilst the second door—in a most mysterious sense—indicates the routewhich must be followed by the liberated initiate who seeks to penetrate to theCentral Spiritual Sun—to which all the seven Paths eventually lead.The Door to the Way of the Higher EvolutionI write not for those initiates who have taken the third initiation, whosepersonality is soul-dominated and who [357] “walk ever in the light.” It willtherefore be obvious that there is relatively little that I can say at thispoint which will be comprehensible, as far as the true meaning goes, to you whohave not as yet achieved that state. The key to your understanding lies in therealisation that our seven planes are only the seven subplanes of the cosmicphysical plane, and that all that now transpires in the life of the initiatesimply releases him from physical experience (technically physical, even on theatmic, monadic and logoic planes), into that vortex of force which we know andunderstand as LOVE, or onto the cosmic astral plane. The note, the quality andthe influence of the cosmic astral plane is love—the higher correspondence ofemotion as experienced upon the astral plane of the planetary or solarmanifestation. It is therefore to be realised that the Hierarchy is definitelyunder the impact of energies emanating from the cosmic astral plane, whilstShamballa reacts to influences coming from the cosmic mental plane. The relatedstream of energy can therefore be seen to be from:> 1. The cosmic astral plane.> 2. The solar buddhic plane, reflected in our planetary buddhic plane.> 3. The astral plane, the plane of glamour in the three worlds.In relation to the mind, you have:> 1. The cosmic mental plane.> 2. The solar atmic plane, reflected in our planetary atmic plane.> 3. The mental plane, the plane of illusion.In connection with the references to glamour and illusion, (see Glamour: a WorldProblem ) it must be borne in mind that the reason glamour predominates andillusion functions in the three worlds is due to the fact that men identifythemselves with the dense physical brain, and interpret life in terms ofexperience in the three worlds. There is no true astral plane, from the angle ofpersonality identifications, but only what might be regarded as the figments ofthe imagination; yet fundamentally and sub-standing what [358] we know as theastral plane is the reflection of the cosmic principle of love. However, beingessentially a reflection, it lacks basic reality from the angle of the truedisciple and must be ignored as an expression of fundamental truth; at the sametime, the astral plane exists from the angle of the Master, because it is anexpression in dense physical cosmic substance of cosmic love. Its potency is,however, so great that it produces glamour in those who are not yet liberated.Students should remember that focussed power produces glamour where wrongidentification is involved, but only reality and truth where there is freedomfrom the factor of form life. Therefore, temporarily, there is no astral planefor the disciple who is withdrawing identification; there is a field of servicefor the Master Who has no longer the power to identify His consciousness withanything in the three worlds; He can, however, relate cosmic sources withplanetary and solar expressions of energy.As we study the whole subject of initiation and the advanced initiations, itwill be found necessary to remember always the relation of our seven planes tothe cosmic range of planes. It is necessary also to bear in mind a fact oftforgotten, but which has been known and taught ever since modern occultism beganto influence human thinking: the four planes which connote the highest possiblespiritual influences, as far as humanity is concerned, are only—in the lastanalysis—the four etheric subplanes of the cosmic physical plane. These highestplanes of our planetary life are, therefore, the source of all energy and alloriginating activity in our entire planetary expression and experience. Thesefour planes are (as you already know):> 1. The highest plane . . . Logoic plane . . . Will> (Adi) Life . . . . . . . . . 1st aspect> 2. The monadic plane . . . Universal . . . Love> Human monads . . . . . . 2nd aspect> 3. The atmic plane . . . 3rd aspect . . . Intelligence> 4. The buddhic plane . . . Pure reason . . . IntuitionThis 4th or buddhic is a fusion of 2 and 3, of love and [359] intelligence, andproduces understanding and intuitive perception.All influences and energies, therefore, which are prevalent in our planetaryexistence, flow through and create the four above-mentioned planes and thusdetermine the nature of the evolutionary process at any given time in the threeworlds. From the standpoint of a Master, the four planes are composed of forceswhich are basically responsive to, and finally conditioned by, the energieswielded by the Hierarchy and directed by Shamballa. In a peculiar manner, andunder the Law of Correspondences, the three lower planes—mental, emotional andphysical—constitute the three dense physical subplanes of the cosmic physicalplane and are not, consequently, regarded as embodying principles. H.P.B. says,in connection with our physical plane (the lowest subplane of the cosmicphysical plane), that it is not a principle, and this holds good also for thegreater whole. The dense physical plane is matter conditioned by a previoussolar system, and is almost automatic in its response to etheric energies; theseconstitute the etheric bodies of all forms created out of this “unprincipledsubstance,” as it is occultly called.The three lower planes of our seven planes are, from the angle of theesotericist, the equally unprincipled dense cosmic substance; the mark orindication of the true initiate is the transfer of his life and his point ofidentification from unprincipled substance and substantial forms to “principled”substance and etheric forms. The tendency of the occult student to think ever interms of spiritual abstraction can (and often does) militate against a grasp ofthe truth and presents a false picture to the intelligence; the facts which Ihave just emphasised have much to do with the nature of the higher initiations.I would ask you to remember this.The third initiation, therefore, releases the initiate from the planes ofunprincipled substance (the lower subplanes of the cosmic physical plane),whilst the next two initiations make it possible for him to work withintelligence [360] and love on the two lower levels of the cosmic ethericplane—the buddhic and the atmic, the planes of spiritual love and intelligentwill. The Way of the Higher Evolution leads through the monadic and logoicplanes (the two highest levels of the cosmic physical plane); when the fourplanes of the cosmic etheric plane are completely mastered and under occultdirection, the initiate is faced with the seven Paths and with the choice totread one or other of them. His choice is naturally dependent upon raydeterminations and past activity but is nevertheless a free choice, because alllimitation has been removed, all wrong identification with physical forms is nowimpossible, and the initiate's only limitation is that imposed by entrance intocosmic levels of awareness with which he is still unfamiliar. Bear, therefore,continually in mind that the highest spiritual attainment upon and within theseven planes of our recognised planetary life is entirely conditioned by thefact that they are the seven subplanes of the cosmic physical plane and arecomposed of the three dense physical planes (our three worlds of humanevolution) and the four cosmic etheric planes (the four levels of so-calledspiritual development); these are conditioned by three forces and four energies.I have emphasised this by constant repetition on account of the great importancethe recognition of these facts will play in any grasp you may achieve anent theWay of the Higher Evolution.After the Master has taken the fifth initiation, He has—as you know—covered andmastered the ordinary field of evolution for humanity; that means the threeworlds of ordinary human experience and the two worlds of superhuman effort,making the five fields of the spiritual activity of man. Love and intelligenceare now perfectly developed in Him, though their expression and emphasis mayvary according to His rays; He is aware of the fact of the Will or of the firstdivine aspect, with its two qualities (veiling a third) of destruction and ofpurpose; He is becoming active on the second plane of our planetary life, themonadic plane, and that great centre of life, Shamballa, is having a [361]definite vibratory effect upon Him; also (and this will be incomprehensible toyou) He is becoming sensitive to a range of energies and influences which cannow be registered by Him, owing to His increasing monadic polarisation and Hiscontact with Shamballa.The cosmic astral plane becomes, for the Master, a definite objective; He isbeginning to develop a great sensitivity to that level of awareness, butconsciousness of that within the planetary life—as He knows it—prevents Him fromregistering this energy of pure cosmic love as He later will. It is this senseof limitation which is the cause of His recognition of the Door on to the Way ofthe Higher Evolution, for the fifth and sixth initiations liberate Him into theatmic and monadic states of awareness; these initiations are to the initiate atthis stage of development what the first and second initiations are to thedisciple who is seeking to tread the earlier stages of the Path of Initiation.They might therefore be regarded as initiations of the threshold—one leading tothe awareness of the higher levels of conscious unfoldment which the thirdinitiation (the first major initiation) inaugurates, and the other to thoselevels of impression, of contact and of future ascension which are the sevenfoldgoal set before the Master when the sixth initiation (the true ascension) isconsummated. It is for this reason that this particular initiation is called theInitiation of Decision. The Master then chooses which of the seven Ways or PathsHe will follow, because His aeonial experience has enabled Him to choose any ofthem and know that He has chosen aright. Though these seven Paths, being one ofthe septenates, are necessarily related to the seven rays, they are not raypaths, nor are they governed by the seven rays. Any one of them is open to aMaster of the Wisdom, and His choice will not be dependent upon His ray type,though He will take that factor into consideration. They are more definitelyrelated to the seven cosmic planes than to the seven rays; this we will considerin greater detail when dealing with the factor of the seven Ashrams which are“proving” grounds for all the Masters confronted with the Initiation ofDecision. [362]Disciples are more apt to be interested in the Ashrams from the angle of theirown development; they are not prone to remember that the life progress andpurpose of the Master not only determines the quality of the Ashram but that Hisown development and His eventual decisions are closely related to the Ashramwhich He controls. It is not easy for students to shift their attention awayfrom the relation of the Ashram to humanity as a whole, or to realise that thisrelation is secondary to the Master Whose primary preoccupation is theunfoldment of the purposes of Sanat Kumara and the attainment of that state ofBeing which is significant of Shamballa. Students need to bear in mind that onephase of preparation for future work is that which will succeed the Initiationof Decision, and that this is dependent upon the type, quality and servicerendered by the Master as He conditions and controls His Ashram. This I willattempt to enlarge upon under our next heading. It is useful however, foraspirants to discipleship, and above all for those preparing for initiation andconsequently already working in an Ashram, to get this different point of viewand begin to unfold within themselves a new sensitivity to impression comingfrom sources higher than the Hierarchy itself. This involves in them a new andhigher type of orientation, and though it remains as yet impossible ofattainment there is definite developing value in a grasp of the concept and theeffort of the abstract mind and the intuitive perception to seize upon andreflect upon a new and entirely foreign concept. This higher reflective processis to the disciple who is working in an Ashram what aspiration is to the studentupon the Probationary Path and the early stages of the Path of Discipleship.In the latter case, the aspirant's emotional body becomes responsive to theprinciple of buddhi, reaching him via the love petals of the egoic lotus; in themore exalted situation, the disciple becomes aware (for that is all it is) ofthe possibility of an impression reaching him from the cosmic astral plane, viamonadic levels of awareness. Note what I say—simply the possibility—for there isat this stage no assured [363] recognition of this goal; it is an impressionwhich is to the disciple preparing for one of the higher initiations what anoccult theory is to an aspirant on very much lower levels. The only way in whichI can give any faintest idea of the higher reaches of the initiate consciousnesswill be through reference to lower grasped capacities and the presentation ofundefinable truths in terms of that which has been defined and which (to thesehigher states of awareness) are in the nature of seed thoughts.Some small grasp of the nature of the consciousness of Shamballa will emerge aswe study this section of the Treatise, for the higher levels of the cosmicetheric plane are permeated with energies emanating from the cosmic astral planeand the cosmic mental plane; these energies, playing through and directed by thegreat Lives Who form a permanent nucleus of the Council Chamber at Shamballa, docondition and are the impelling, motivating and relating power behind all theevolutionary processes on lower levels.Yet, the life and consciousness of the Hierarchy are very different to the lifeand consciousness of Those Who constitute the great centre called Shamballa; thedeveloping sensitivity to increasingly high impression, which is the result ofeach stage of the final initiatory process, is the only way in which thedistinction and the goal become apparent. Just as those who read and study theseideas are occupied with concepts and thoughts totally unrealised and whollyinexplicable and sometimes even senseless, to the ordinary everyday businessmanin the street, so there are also ranges of thought and eternal extra-planetaryconcepts which are equally unknown and temporarily inexplicable to the initiateworking in an Ashram under some Master. When the student realises that the greatuniversal Oneness which he associates with monadic consciousness, is only theregistration of impressions localised (and therefore limited) and defined withinthe etheric levels of the cosmic physical plane, he can perhaps grasp theimplications of the wonder which will be revealed to the initiate who cantranscend the entire cosmic physical plane (our seven planes of the [364] human,superhuman and the divine worlds) and function upon another cosmic level. Thisis what the treading of the Way of the Higher Evolution enables a Mastereventually to do.One interesting fact emerges out of all this comparative work and this mode ofanalogical teaching, and that is that the word “spiritual” refers neither toreligious matters (so-called) nor to the Path of Discipleship or the Path of themajor or higher initiations, but to the relationships on every level of thecosmic physical plane, to every level from the lowest to the highest. The word“spiritual” relates to attitudes, to relationships, to the moving forward fromone level of consciousness (no matter how low or gross, from the point of viewof a higher level of contact) to the next; it is related to the power to see thevision, even if that vision is materialistic as seen from the angle of a higherregistration of possibility; the word “spiritual” refers to every effect of theevolutionary process as it drives man forward from one range of sensitivity andof responsiveness to impression to another; it relates to the expansion ofconsciousness, so that the unfoldment of the organs of sensory perception inprimitive man or in the awakening infant are just as surely spiritual events asparticipation in an initiatory process; the development of the so-calledirreligious man into a sound and effective businessman, with all the necessaryperception and equipment for success, is as much a spiritual unfoldment—in thatindividual's experience—as the taking of an initiation by a disciple in anAshram.The assumption by orthodox church people that the word “spiritual” connotesprofound and effective interest in orthodox religion is not borne out by thefacts of the spiritual life. Some day, when the world is increasingly led by itsinitiates, this erroneous assumption will be discarded, and it will be realisedthat all activity which drives the human being forward towards some form ofdevelopment (physical, emotional, intuitional, and so forth) is essentiallyspiritual in nature and is indicative of the livingness of the inner divineentity. [365]I have felt it necessary to point this out because it will become apparent as weread and study this section of the Treatise that the Master—moving forward intohigher areas of impressionability—may not and frequently will not express thisdevelopment in terms of what is now regarded as “spiritual” by the religiousdevotee and by the man used to the wording and the terminology of the churchmenof all faiths. The discoveries of science, my brother, or the production of somegreat work in literature or in the field of art, are just as much an evidence of“spiritual” unfoldment as the rhapsodies of the mystic or the registration bythe so called occultist of a contact with the Hierarchy.There will, however, come a point in the experience of all those thus making aspiritual approach along some specialised line, where a meeting place willbecome apparent, where a joint goal will be unitedly recognised, where essentialunity under diversity of forms, of methods and of techniques will beacknowledged, and where pilgrims on all ways of approach will know themselves tobe one band of demonstrators of the divine.One such meeting place is upon the periphery of the Hierarchy during the stageimmediately prior to acceptance into an Ashram. It is interesting to notethat—on a world-wide scale—the world disciple, Humanity, is today on the vergeof this major awakening and joint registration of a unity not hitherto reached;the growth of the spirit of internationalism, the inclusiveness of thescientific attitude, and the spread of a universal humanitarian welfare movementare all indicative of this meeting place.Another such meeting place is recorded and entered (symbolically speaking) whenthe third initiation is taken, and still another is realised at the time of theseventh initiation. These all register development in group awareness, as wellas in the recognition of the individual initiate, as to what is happening withinthe consciousness aspect of humanity. [366]The door into the Way of the Higher Evolution simply permits the entrance of thesensitive initiate into “spheres of intimacy” (as they are sometimes called)which are this time cosmic in their implications, planetary in their effects,and which give to the initiate what has been called the “key to the Sun”—as itconditions the solar system—just as the door to initiation gives to the aspirantthe “key to the kingdom of God.”We have dealt in the foregoing pages with deep matters and have touched upontopics too high for the understanding of the average student or probationarydisciple; dim recognitions, based on past acceptances are, however, possible tosome of you. We have seen, among other things, that the so-called “door ofinitiation” presents obstacles whose purpose is to block entrance and to drawout the latent will of the applicant; an initiate is one who succeeds inpenetrating to the further side of the door, where recognition awaits him. Wewill now concern ourselves with the basic theme of the Ashram itself.THE ENTERING OF THE ASHRAMThis theme necessarily has great interest for all aspirants and would-bedisciples, but I am not at first going to deal with the subject from the angleof humanity and its effort to establish contact with the Ashram. I desire firstof all to speak of the Ashram as a whole, constituted of many Ashrams andcreating an “invoking area” of relationship for the supreme Head of the Ashram,Sanat Kumara, the Lord of the World. I seek to enter into no discussion of thisleading Life of our entire planet. HE is to a still greater Being, the Onereferred to elsewhere as “the One about Whom naught may be said,” what thevehicle of a Master in physical incarnation is to Him, and on a less accuratebasis, what your personality is to you; it is an expression of the soul or ofthe Monad when a disciple has attained initiate-consciousness. [367] All thequalities, the love and the purpose of a supreme Entity, referred to in The NewTestament as the “Unknown God,” are focussed in Sanat Kumara. Some gauge of theunfoldments which can lie ahead of humanity will enter the human consciousnesswhen:> 1. The fact of the Hierarchy,> 2. The nature of its relationship to Shamballa,> 3. The spiritual nature of Those Who respond in reverent obedience to the> slightest wish of the Lord of the World,are among the accepted truths whereby men live. This will happen after theexternalisation of the Hierarchy.This Lord of the World is the sole repository of the will and purpose of the Oneof Whom He is an expression; this again can be understood by you as evoking thesame relation to the “unknown God” as your personality—when expressingadequately the soul and later the Monad—conditions your perception, knowledge,plans and purpose, and controls the quality of your life and directs the energywhich you express.His vehicle of manifestation is the planet with its seven centres, of which onlythree are yet recognised by the occult student: Shamballa, His head centre, theHierarchy, His heart centre, and Humanity, His throat centre. The other fourcentres are concerned with evolutions which are reached, controlled and relatedfrom one or other of these three major centres. The solar plexus is dominated bythe Hierarchy, the heart centre of Sanat Kumara, and has a close relation to thedeva evolution, hinted at by me in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire. The vastness ofthis subject will be understood by my use of the word “hint” in reference towhat I have earlier written on the subject.The centre which we call Shamballa controls that mysterious centre which is thecorrespondence to that which we call “the centre at the base of the spine”; thisis the inadequate name given to the reservoir of threefold fire, latent andquiescent, which is found at the base of the human spine; it is entirelyinactive except in those people who have [368] taken the third initiation. Theplanetary centre is related to the three fires (electric fire, solar fire, andfire by friction) which are the source of the life, warmth, moisture and growthof all forms upon our planet. It may seem curious and inexplicable to you, butthe centre of creativity is affected, and I had almost said guarded, by the“centre which we call the race of men”; the reference in the serious occultbooks to the future of humanity as the Saviour of all the subhuman kingdoms hasrelation to this fact.The ajna centre of the Lord of the World is just beginning to express itself ina recognisable manner through the New Group of World Servers. This intermediategroup—between the Hierarchy and Humanity—is a carrier of the energy which makesthe Plan possible (the Plan of which the Hierarchy is the custodian). This Planimplements the Purpose, and later, when the New Group of World Servers isorganised and is recognised as a living organism, it will definitely receiveenergy from Shamballa in a direct reception, via the Hierarchy. This informationis, I realise, of little immediate importance to you, but—towards the end of thecentury—it will be found explanatory of much.Though the Christ is the Head of the Hierarchy, it is Sanat Kumara, the Ancientof Days, Whose Ashram it truly is. The Christ (I am using one of His officialnames) is indeed the Master of all the Masters and the Coordinator of the entirelife of the great Ashram, in conjunction with the two other hierarchicalOfficials, the Manu and the Mahachohan. The information I gave as to theconstitution of the Hierarchy, in Initiation, Human and Solar , was along thesame line. The Hierarchy is the Ashram of Sanat Kumara, but He has delegated Hisauthority, right down the ages, to the so-called World Saviours successively;Their life expression embodied in every case the goal of the period during whichThey held office.In the early days of the Hierarchy, millennia of years ago, neither the officialDirectors of the Hierarchy nor the Masters were of the calibre which They aretoday. Had They been so, They would have been too far removed from [369] thefactual life of the cycle, and therefore useless for the cycle of divine lifewhich existed. The growth of humanity and its evolutionary status (when comparedwith primordial and primitive man) can be seen in the quality of the Hierarchytoday, which humanity produced and towards which it looks for guidance andteaching. This is an interesting point which I offer for your consideration.Never forget, my brothers, that as it is humanity which has furnished thepersonnel of the Hierarchy—including the Christ, the first of our humanity toachieve divinity—we have, therefore, the guarantee and the assurance ofhumanity's ultimate success.> The three major Executives of the Hierarchy:> 1. The Christ, representing the second Ray of Love-Wisdom,> 2. The Manu, representing the first Ray of Will or Power,> 3. The Mahachohan, representing the third Ray of Active Intelligence,are responsible to the Lord of the World for the processing of the life andimpulse which condition the evolutionary process. This statement is made withoutany further definition by me because the whole subject is too abstruse and itwould require another Treatise like that on Cosmic Fire to make it even a littleclearer.Humanity can only be the recipient of this type of information after the firstRay of Will or Power has become more active; this will take place when the workof the second Ray of Love-Wisdom has reached its next cyclic crisis point. Thecrisis points of a ray are ever indicative of success and have in them thequality of joy. Mankind will then be much freer from the spirit of separateness,and a measure of peace, unity and cooperation will be conditioning humanrelations. There is a constant shifting in the state of the planetaryconsciousness and this, though implemented from Shamballa, is produced byhumanity itself; this unfolding human consciousness leads mankind eventually outof the fourth kingdom in nature into the fifth, the hierarchy of souls, and—atthe same time—raises the level of consciousness [370] in all the three subhumankingdoms. This series of happenings will remain for a long time inexplicable toman, though the results can be seen in the effect which humanity has had on theanimal kingdom, through domestication; on the vegetable kingdom, throughspecialisation and science; and on the mineral kingdom, through the skilledutilisation of metals and the widespread use of the mineral products of theearth.It must be borne in mind that the Council Chamber of the Lord at Shamballa is aunit, but that the Hierarchy is a differentiation of this basic unity into theseven major Ashrams and the forty-nine Ashrams which are gradually forming. TheHierarchy is, however, a unity within itself, for the entire ashramic life isguarded by a ring-pass-not, created by its radiation; the seven and theforty-nine Ashrams are held together by the magnetic interplay of the whole. Itis this radiation which affects by its quality the senior aspirants in theworld, and draws them gradually into relationship with itself and finally intoits magnetic field. This is aided by the clarity of perception, theintensification of the livingness of the rightly oriented aspirant. I prefer theword “livingness” to that of “vibration,” so widely used in modern occultism.There is therefore a dual inflow into the Ashram of Sanat Kumara, controlled anddirected by the three hierarchical Directors:1. From Shamballa itself. This is a flow of energising life or of what we mightcall “unfettered enlightenment”; this impresses the purpose or the will of theLord of the World upon the united Hierarchy in a manner incomprehensible to you;it also creates a dynamic magnetic impulse which enables the graded initiates,through the medium of the Ashrams, to organise the Plan and set it in motion, sothat the Purpose gradually materialises on earth. Because the senior initiates,from the Christ down to initiates of the fourth degree, are conscious in varyingways (according to ray) of the Eternal Now, and can work free from thecompulsion of time, They can see the impressed Purpose as a [371] more completewhole than can initiates of lesser degree and development. It is this capacitywhich makes Them responsive to Shamballa, where the living will of the “UnknownGod” (for a period of a life cycle) is seen in completeness and is alreadyexistent. The Hierarchy is, however, handicapped in its activity by the timesense and the materialistic focus of the “centre which we call the race of men.”2. From Humanity. There is a constant (and increasing) flow of reoriented humanenergy penetrating into and beyond the radiatory periphery. This penetratingenergy, implemented by the individual aspirant and disciple, is that ofintelligent activity and—little as you may have realised it—it is this constantinflow which aids in the intelligent application of the Plan to human affairs.The Science of Impression, which governs the technique of Shamballa, functionsthrough the three different centres in three different ways:> a. Shamballa . . . dynamic impression> b. The Hierarchy . . . magnetic telepathy> c. Humanity . . . radiatory sensitivityyet these three are only manifestations of the will of God as it works out inthe activities of His three major centres.One point should here be made: the entry of a member of the human family intothe ranks of the initiates and his participation in the activity of some one orother of the Ashrams produces a movement out of the Hierarchy of some Master andinto the highest centre of all; it has this effect only after the enteringinitiate has taken the third initiation, and can therefore take his part in thehierarchical life as a monadic expression susceptible to impression fromShamballa. When a Master thus emerges He is immediately confronted with thechoice between the seven Paths. With this development and decision we shalllater deal. The seven Paths are all concerned with purpose , just as the sevenAshrams are all concerned with the plan. There is, as you will later see, adirect relation between the seven Paths and the seven Ashrams. Though we shallnot deal with the subject at all, there is likewise a correspondence in thethird [372] major centre, Humanity. You have, therefore, curiously interrelated:> The seven Paths> The seven Rays> The seven Ashrams> The seven RacesStudents would do well to bear in mind that these relationships are the resultof the involutionary activity of the life expression of the Lord of the World.The key to the mystery of differentiation is found by the Master when He isfaced by the choice of the seven Paths. At that high point of will expression,He discovers the secret of that evolutionary process which proceeds from unityto differentiation, and from differentiation to unity again. Individualisation,Initiation and Identification are the three main stages in the evolutionaryactivity of the life of God and condition the quality of each of the threedivine centres. The four related septenates, enumerated above, eventuallyproduce a synthesis which will consummate upon the cosmic mental plane. This isof course beyond my powers to teach or to explain, as I am not yet a liberatedMaster, though I am a liberated human being.In the human centre, the man becomes identified with himself; in the Hierarchy,he becomes identified with the group; in Shamballa, He becomes identified withthe planetary WHOLE. When that takes place, He is then aware for the first timethat other identifications—lying beyond the planetary ring-pass-not—confrontHim; His choice of one or other of the Paths is conditioned by the quality ofHis previous identifications, which are in their turn conditioned by His raytype.Passing from these broad generalisations, which in reality lie far beyond ourpresent grasp but which will have their future usefulness, let us now considerthe Hierarchy as it exists (in the consciousness of Sanat Kumara, as His Ashram)and as it constitutes “the noble middle Path” to which the Buddha refers, andfills the intermediate and the [373] mediating place between Shamballa andHumanity. This position of the Hierarchy must never be forgotten.The seven Groups of Ashrams within the HierarchyIt is because the first Ray of Will or Power, through its Ashram, is related toShamballa, that the Master Morya is the Head of all truly esoteric schools. Inthe esoteric enterprise and in the work done by disciples in the Ashrams, theWill is developed so that the Purpose may eventually be understood. He relatesthe three points of the triangle composed of the Hierarchy, the world of soulson the mental plane, and those human souls who (on all Rays) are ready forcontact with the Hierarchy. They have made contact with their souls, and this isregistered in the Hierarchy. The triangle is, therefore, as follows:> [Image00000.jpg]As the externalisation of the Ashram proceeds, those souls upon the physicalplane who are ready for enlightenment will find their way into the New Group ofWorld Servers; this group will increasingly assume potent relation between theunits of life within its periphery, the Ashram, and humanity. From one point ofview, the New Group of World Servers can be regarded not only as a relatinggroup, but also as a great transforming station, dowered later (though notnoticeably so at the present time) with two functions in relation to the Ashram:1. One function is to enable “externalising units of perfection” (the higherinitiates and the Masters) to step down Their individual potency to such adegree that They will be able to work in physical objectivity on the earth, withno undesirable effects upon humanity. I refer to average and undeveloped humanbeings. Students should bear in mind that contact with Those Who are initiatesof high degree [374] and members of an Ashram has the following three effectsupon humanity:> a. On evolved men, aspirants, probationers and disciples, the effect is> stimulating and magnetic.> b. On average human beings, capable of little response yet susceptible to> impact and sensitive to impression, the effect is not helpful and is often> destructive, because their etheric bodies are not competent to entertain and> employ such high vibrations.> c. On undeveloped humanity, the effect has been called “condensation or> concretisation”; all their natural qualities (the qualified substance of their> three bodies) are solidified; thus they create an automatic barrier to the> entry of the too high impulses and vibrations.2. The second function is to enable those who are making definite soul contact,reorienting themselves and nearing the periphery of the Ashram, to absorb withprofit the radiation of the Hierarchy.I would like at this point to refer back to the time sense in relation to theHierarchy and its work, to which I referred a few pages back. It involves theinability of the average disciple to think in terms of the Ashram—the Ashram ofthe Christ, representing Sanat Kumara. When he turns his thoughts to the Masterand the radiatory and magnetic group which He has attracted to Himself, thedisciple almost inevitably thinks in terms of “my Master and His Ashram.” Yetthis is not in any sense a statement of truth. There is one great Ashram, theHierarchy, radiating (after due absorption of light, understanding and powerfrom Shamballa, and this inflow is adequate to hierarchical need) as it seeks toaid not only the human evolution but all the other evolutions, of whichhumanity, in several cases, knows nothing. The great Ashram is likewise magneticin its effect, and through its magnetic potency (brought about by an inflow offirst ray power) “units of life and devotion”—human beings—are brought into theAshram as disciples in preparation for initiation. People are apt to regardmagnetic [375] potency as evidence of love; it is, in reality, evidence of theradiation of love when enhanced and strengthened by first ray energy. It is theadmixture (if I may use such a peculiar term) of love and will which producesradiation . It is the conscious use by the Hierarchy of the power coming fromShamballa which results in the magnetic impact and the spiritual “pull” whichdraws the soul, incarnated in the body, towards the Ashram. This pull isdirected towards the world of souls which is, through its manifesting units,undergoing experience in the school of life, yet overshadowed by the soul on itsown level. It is this overshadowing soul which absorbs and utilises the magneticpower and which, from soul levels, transfers it to the souls of men.There is still another point upon which I would like to touch. Owing to the factthat the Law which governs the Hierarchy is the second systemic law, the Law ofAttraction, students are apt to think that magnetism is a second ray quality.They are right in so far that all the systemic laws are expressions of the lifeof God through the medium, at this time, of the second ray, which makes oursolar system a second ray system. All other laws and qualities (for a law fromthe divine angle is the motivating, qualified agent of the divine will, asunderstood in Shamballa) are related to the second ray as it manifests throughour planetary Logos. Nevertheless, magnetic action is more closely allied tofirst ray functioning than it is to the second ray, and is an aspect or qualityof the Law of Synthesis. It was this magnetic power of the first ray to whichthe Christ referred when He said “I, if I be lifted up (The AscensionInitiation. A.A.B.), will draw all men unto me.” He faced then those initiationswhich would qualify Him to become what is esoterically called “a Shamballarecipient.” There is, in magnetic action, more of the element of the will and ofan expressing purpose. In explanation it might be said that the radiation of theHierarchy, which is definitely second ray in nature, and which is projected asattractive radiation, is implemented by the magnetic aspect. This—as the OldCommentary puts it—is “a point of focussed fire, found in the centre of thejewel. [376] It stirs to life the quality of love which permeates the Ashram ofthe Lord. Radiation then can penetrate to other centres and to other lives, andthus the Lord is served.” It is this point of focussed dynamic will at the veryheart of the Hierarchy which in reality implements the Plan.To put the matter as simply as possible—too simply to be entirely exact, yetnear enough to the truth to be clarifying and helpful—it is this magneticpotency, this dynamic active and energising will, which enables the Hierarchy tomove forward upon the eternal Path. Its functions might be listed as follows:1. It is the connecting energy which comes from Shamballa and “enlivens”(literally and occultly understood) the Ashram of Sanat Kumara. It is, in onesense, the higher correspondence to the prana which “enlivens” the densephysical body of man.2. It is the stimulating factor which produces cohesion among the variousAshrams, and is one of the sources of hierarchical unity. Putting it in otherwords, it is the service of the Plan which binds the seven Ashrams, with theirsubsidiary Ashrams, coherently into the one great Ashram. The Plan is theexpression of the Purpose or the Will of God.3. This Shamballic magnetism not only relates the Ashrams to each other, but itis also the potency which evokes the will or the first ray nature inherent inevery man but which is only consciously and definitely unfolded within theperiphery of the great Ashram.4. In a mysterious sense, it is the life of that seed or germ which will come tofruition in the third solar system:> a. In the “centre which we call the race of men” the potency of intelligence> (developed in a previous solar system) is brought to fruition and the> stirrings of the potency of love are felt.> b. In the “centre which is nearest to the Lord” the potencies of intelligence> and love are expressed, and at the third initiation the magnetic pull of the> potency of will is felt. [377]> c. In the “centre where the will of God is known” the intelligent loving> Master, now responsive to the energy of the will, is faced with the seven> Paths whereon that will can come to fruition and the “units of love can be> transferred because they also will and know.” They can then form part of the> third solar system which will be definitely under the influences coming from> the cosmic mental plane, just as, in this solar system, the energies coming> from the cosmic astral plane have been the major influence.All this is, of course, an inadequate expression of abstruse truth. The cosmicastral plane is not an illusion, as is the astral plane with which we are all sounhappily acquainted. The reason for this lies in the fact that all our planesconstitute the cosmic physical plane and are therefore regarded—as far as threeworlds of human evolution are concerned—as illusion, for the dense physicalsubstance is not a principle. This you have oft been told. The cosmic astralplane is a reservoir of love energy, pouring into two of our planes whichconstitute part of the cosmic etheric body—the monadic plane and the buddhicplane.5. It is that which permeates the radiation from the Hierarchy to which humanityis responsive. No disciple or aspirant can be drawn into the periphery of theHierarchy, and from thence into an Ashram, without finding that his will natureis being affected. It will only show itself at this stage as persistence anddetermination. Persistence is a quality of life and related to immortality,whilst determination is the lowest aspect of the will. Their developmentproduces a reorientation which becomes a permanent attitude, and the disciplethen becomes responsive not only to the “vitalised radiation” coming from theperiphery of the Hierarchy but also, in an increasing measure, to the “magneticpull” which emanates from the Hierarchy itself, and in particular from theAshram to which he must eventually find his way.If you will make a close study of all the above information, you may find somemeasure of enlightenment. It is the great simplicities which must be ever keptin mind: the [378] three great divine aspects, the septenates of theevolutionary process, the divine qualities or principles, and the relation ofenergy to force. With these clearly held in mind, the detail is of small momentthe intuition rapidly assimilates and relates the detail, if there be need to doso, to the manifesting whole.To return to our theme, which is the expression of the great Ashram through themedium of the seven Ashrams, it is this magnetic energy of the first aspectwhich is found at the heart of the seven Ashrams, energised and enlightened fromthe reservoir of will energy found at the heart of the great Ashram itself. Thisreservoir is fed from the “centre where the will of God is known,” and thedirecting agent of this energy, within the Hierarchy itself, is the Christ andHis two Associates, the Manu and the Mahachohan. The forty-nine subsidiaryAshrams (not all of which are yet functioning) are energised by the potency ofwill from the reservoir of energy at the heart of each major Ashram, these intheir turn being fed from the central reservoir. The correspondence of this inthe human centres is called the “jewel in the lotus.”Let us now study the formation of the great Ashram and then (this will have moremeaning for you) the gradual formation of the seven Ashrams under direct rayactivity. This process lies in the past history of humanity and I shall onlybriefly touch upon it. Once formed, it became the task of these seven Ashrams toproduce the forty-two Ashrams. These seven Ashrams express ray qualities, andthe whole forty-nine are expressive of the forty-nine fires, referred to in TheSecret Doctrine; through these fires, the God of Fire seeks to make Himselfknown.As we study some of the esoteric details connected with the life, the qualityand, later, the appearance of the Ashrams of the Masters, I would remind you ofcertain points I have already made; your minds then will be predisposed to rightthinking and interpretation. I am anxious for your approach to the subject to becorrect. I have given you a number of definitions of an Ashram in the previouspages [379] and in my other books, and I would have you bear these in mind. Theconcept of a college group, of a band of workers or of a number of men and womenworking under the supervision of a Master is too apt to colour your thoughts.The complete freedom from all coercion or from any supervision of dailyactivity, the instinctive reaction of all within the Ashram to the ray influenceand to the “breath of the prevailing Will” (as it is called) is something verydifferent. I seek in what I intend to impart to you to give a very differentimpression. In our next section, on the dual life of the initiatory process, thenewer concepts may emerge more clearly. The points I want you to bear in mindare as follows:> 1. The great Ashram, the Hierarchy, is composed of many Ashrams, creating an> “invoking area” of relationship for Sanat Kumara.> 2. The Christ, aided by the Manu and the Mahachohan, is the Coordinator of the> entire life of the great Ashram.> 3. The personnel of the great Ashram is today entirely provided from the ranks> of humanity. This was not so in the earlier cycles.> 4. The great Ashram is formed of seven major Ashrams and forty-two secondary> Ashrams which are gradually forming.> 5. The entire Ashram is a unity, for the ashramic life in its differentiated> groups is guarded by a ring-pass-not.> 6. This ring-pass-not is provided by radiation.> 7. The forty-two lesser Ashrams are held together by the magnetic interplay of> the whole.> 8. Aspirants are drawn into relation with the Ashram through its radiation and> enter finally into its magnetic field.> 9. There is a dual flow of energy or force into the great Ashram:> a. Energising life from Shamballa or what is called “unfettered> enlightenment.” [380]> b. The energy of active intelligence from Humanity, thus enabling the Masters> to formulate the Plan.> 10. The seven Ashrams are all concerned with the Plan.> 11. The Master Morya is the Head of all esoteric schools which truly prepare> an aspirant for ashramic contact and work. The reason that a first ray Master> is thus the Head is because it is the Will aspect which is developed within> the Ashram.> 12. It is the service of the Plan which binds the seven Ashrams, with their> subsidiary Ashrams, into the one great Ashram.> 13. It is only within his ray Ashram that the will of the disciple is> developed.> 14. The magnetic, dynamic energy of the first aspect of divinity is found at> the heart of each of the seven Ashrams, fed from a reservoir of will energy> which is found at the heart of the great Ashram itself.> 15. The forty-two subsidiary Ashrams are energised by the reservoir of will> energy found at the heart of each of the major Ashrams.> 16. The seven Ashrams express each the quality of their ray, one of the seven> ray types.If you will have these points in mind, the whole hierarchical theme will berecognised and correctly interpreted by you.There was a time when (in the early history of the planet) there was noHierarchy; there were only two major centres in the expression of the life ofthe Lord of the World: Shamballa and His embryonic throat centre, Humanity.Shamballa was the head centre. There was no humanity, such as we now know it,but only something so primitive that it is well-nigh impossible for you to graspits significance or factual expression. But the life of God was there, plus aninherent “urge” and a dynamic “pull.” These two factors rendered the mass of men(if one may call them so) inchoately invocative, thus drawing from highspiritual centres certain developed and informed Lives Who—in increasing [381]numbers—”walked among men” and led them slowly, very slowly, forward intoincreasing light. The early history of the Hierarchy falls into two historicaleras in the process of its becoming a “mediating Centre”:First: The time when the relating, mediating, enlightening correspondences toThose we now call the Masters trod the earth with men and were not withdrawn andapparently invisible, as is now the case. Their task was to bring the primitiveintelligence of humanity to the point where there could be the presentation ofthe Plan, with eventual cooperation. In occult parlance, Their work was theestablishing of a rapport between the unrevealed second aspect (to which Theywere responsive) and Humanity. In this They succeeded, but the matter aspect andquality—that of active intelligence—was so strong that the second historicalphase became essential.Second: The time when the Hierarchy was created as we know it today; the heartcentre of Sanat Kumara came into its own life, formed its own magnetic field,possessed its own ring-pass-not, and became a dynamic mediating centre betweenShamballa and Humanity.It has oft been told in occult and theosophical literature that the Hierarchywithdrew as a penalising measure because of the wickedness of mankind. This isonly superficially true and is an instance of a man-made interpretation; givingus the first example of the fear-and-punishment psychology which—from that timeon—has conditioned all religious teaching. The withdrawing Masters had TheirPaul to distort the truth, just as had the Christ, Their august Head today. Thetruth was far otherwise.The time came in those distant aeons when a certain percentage of human beingsreached, through their own efforts, the stage (at that time demanded) ofpreparedness for initiation. This attainment brought surprising results:> a. It became possible for certain of the Masters to “return from whence They> came.”> b. It became necessary to provide conditions where [382] these men “accepted> for unfettered enlightenment” could receive the needed training.> c. The process of creation had reached the evolutionary stage where the> centres of the Lord of the World were differentiated; function and radiatory> activity were established, and this produced a stronger “pull” and placed the> Hierarchy “at the midway point.” A station of light and power was formed. All> this was made possible because humanity could now produce its own “enlightened> ones.”These two historical periods (not events, except in so far that all TIME is asequence or pattern of events) covered vast cycles; aeon by aeon, the work wenton until we have today the three major centres in the planet, demonstratinggreat activity, much more closely related than ever before, and ready now toenter into a third historical period. In this coming cycle we shall see thefirst stages of the great spiritual fusion towards which all evolution tends; itwill take the form of the externalisation of the Ashram, so that the Hierarchy(or the centre where the love of God is known and the purpose of Sanat Kumara isformulated into the Plan) and Humanity will meet on the physical plane andoccultly know each other. Two centres then will be “visible in the light”—theHierarchy and Humanity. When these two centres can work in full cooperation,then Shamballa will take form and will no longer be found existing only incosmic etheric substance, as is now the case.What this means, how it will be accomplished, and what the implications are,will be revealed in such a distant future that we need waste no time consideringit. We are working and living in the initial stages of the period whereinpreparation is being made for the emergence of the Hierarchy into the world ofmen. This emergence is at present purely on to mental levels, but when thethoughtform of exoteric existence is created by Humanity itself and theinvocative cry is intense enough, then the Great Ashram will slowly make itsappearance upon the physical plane.On that plane, the distinction between the two centres [383] will be preserved,but the inner relationship and the spiritual fusion will steadily proceed until:> Soul and personality are one,> Love and intelligence are coordinated,> Plan and fulfillment are achieved.All this will be brought about through the invocative spirit in man, plus theinitiatory process, carried on in the Ashrams of the great Ashram. What thiscoming process will entail of change in civilisation, in human nature and in thegroup expression of the human spirit—religions, society and politics—it is notpossible here to say; so much lies hidden in the free will and right timing ofmankind. But that future of spiritual cooperation and interplay within andwithout the great Ashram is assured, and for it all true disciples are working.The world situation today is therefore one of great interest. Humanity, theworld disciple, is in process of recovering from a major test, prior to a greatstep forward towards a conscious approach to more spiritual living; this,factually, means a definite approach to the Hierarchy.In the meantime the Hierarchy is orienting itself to a much closer rapport withhumanity, and to an interior reorganisation which will make it possible to admitdisciples in large numbers into the great Ashram. This will lead to theimplementation of the lesser Ashrams and also to a preparation for thetransmission of more of the Will energy, through the great Ashram, into thethroat centre of Sanat Kumara, Humanity.The seven major Ashrams are each responsive to one of seven types of ray energyand are focal points in the Hierarchy of the seven rays. The central, senior andmajor Ashram is (at this time) the repository of second ray energy, as this raygoverns this second solar system. It is the Ashram of Love-Wisdom—the Ashram inwhich the Buddha and the Christ received Their initiations and through whicheach of Them works. It will be obvious that if the process of invocation andevocation governs the interplay of the planetary centres, you have in this factanother reason why the senior Ashram is second ray in quality. Invocation isrelated [384] to radiation. Evocation is related to magnetism. These are twopoints worthy of your consideration.The other six major Ashrams came sequentially into being as the invocation ofprimitive man reached such a point of intensity of expression that a responsewas evoked from Shamballa, via its ray Representatives, working with directedenergy in the three worlds. A “point of radiatory force” was established, atfirst in relation to the second ray Ashram, and later to the other Ashrams. Oneby one, as the rays cycled into activity in the three worlds and eventually onthe physical plane, the seven Ashrams were founded, developed and expanded untilthe time arrived—several aeons ago—when all seven Ashrams were fully organised,and through them passed a steady flow of human beings liberating themselves fromthe three worlds.In the earliest times this flow of disciples was exceedingly small. One by one,individual aspirants found their way out of the ranks of humanity and inside thering-pass-not of the Hierarchy. In the beginning, only the first two initiationswere given and only through the instrumentality of the second ray; and at theseinitiations the World Teacher of the period of officiated.Then at a time when the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Order (the ray which plays sopotent and mysterious a part in the phase of discipleship called initiation) wasin cyclic activity, a much greater number of disciples appeared, prepared forinitiation; the initiatory process was then administered in a seventh rayAshram; this seventh ray Ashram was the second to be formed, owing to the factthat the seventh ray is the relating factor between life and matter upon theform side. Again, so the ancient Archives tell us, there came a great crisis inthe evolution of humanity; this necessitated one of the rare cyclic changeswhich have distinguished the fluid policy of the Hierarchy. Men began todemonstrate responsiveness to the Law of Integration and personality appearedwith all its potentiality for good and evil. Man became an integrated unit inthe three worlds. A great possibility then emerged; man could, through training[385] and the use of the mind, make contact with the soul. This had not hithertobeen done except to a slight degree. This crisis therefore led to the creation,or rather to the appearance, of the initiatory process to which we have giventhe name of the third initiation.The Hierarchy for the first time realised the complete success of the vast work,carried on in the human centre for millions of years. Soul and personality couldbe and were intelligently fused. This is one of the reasons why the Hierarchyregards the third initiation as the first major initiation; it marked a point ofcomplete soul-personality integration. In the earlier initiations, the soul waspresent but was still only occasionally in control; constant failure in thethree worlds was still possible, and the relation between the man in the threeworlds and his soul was nebulous and largely potential. You will realise what Imean when I point out that many thousands of people in the world today havetaken the first initiation and are oriented towards the spiritual life and theservice of their fellowmen; their lives, however, frequently leave much to bedesired, and the soul is obviously not in constant control; a great struggle isstill being waged to achieve purification on all three levels. The lives ofthese initiates are faulty and their inexperience great, and a major attempt isinstituted in this particular cycle to achieve soul fusion. When that isattained, then the third initiation (the first, hierarchically speaking) istaken. Today this triple process of preparation, purification and fusion is theordinary practice of the disciple and the process has prevailed for untoldyears; but when this fusion first occurred, it marked a great hierarchicalevent. It was a crisis of supreme spiritual import.As you know, the first human being out of that “centre which we call the race ofmen” to achieve this point was the Christ; in that first great demonstration ofHis point of attainment (through the medium of what was then a new type ofinitiation) the Christ was joined by the Buddha. The Buddha had attained thissame point prior to the creation of our planetary life, but conditions fortaking the third initiation [386] were not then available, and He and the Christtook the initiation together. At this initiation, and since then for allinitiates of that degree of attainment, They stood in the Presence of the OneInitiator, the Lord of the World, and not in the Presence of the Initiate Whowas then Head of the Hierarchy. This third initiation was taken in a fourth rayAshram, the Ray of Harmony through Conflict. This Ashram had taken form andattained functioning activity some time earlier. You can see, under the Law ofCorrespondences, why this was so. The first human being in the fourth kingdom innature to take this initiation did so in a fourth ray Ashram and then,esoterically speaking, “the Way lay open toward the Cross”; the initiate facedthe process of extension on the Cross, and from that vantage point could viewthe three worlds. The fourth initiation then became a possibility; thecrucifixion faced the disciple of the third degree with its promise of completeliberation and final resurrection.You can see, therefore, what a tremendous crisis took place in the relationbetween Humanity and the Hierarchy—a crisis of such importance that Shamballabecame involved and the Lord of time World Himself admitted the initiate to thehigher contacts. Between that time and the crucifixion of the Master Jesus, thesixth ray Ashram, the fifth and the third, have all been formed around thenucleus of light, started by the ray Lords much earlier. The point of light andof will energy at the centre of each Ashram has existed for untold millennia ofyears, but the Ashrams themselves were only slowly formed around the nucleus asthe various types of energy swept into manifestation and brought with them humantypes responsive to the ray energy.When the Master Jesus took the Crucifixion Initiation, another crisis arose ofequally great import, if not greater. The crisis was brought about becausesimultaneously with the crucifixion of the Master, the Head of the Hierarchy,the Christ, took two initiations in one: the Resurrection Initiation and that ofthe Ascension. These are the fifth and sixth initiations, according to theChristian terminology. [387] This was possible because the first ray Ashram wasnow active, making entry into the Council Chamber at Shamballa possible. Whenthe Christ achieved this, He was deemed worthy of embodying in Himself a newprinciple in evolution and of revealing to the world the nature of the secondray aspect—the divine principle of love (as humanity calls it) or of pure reason(as the Hierarchy calls it).Since that time, all the seven major Ashrams have been fully organised and aresteadily increasing in radiatory activity. As you will have noted, the order oftheir appearance—under ray activity—was 2, 7, 4, 6, 5, 3, 1. In giving this itemof ashramic information I am giving you more hints than you will immediatelyrealise.Each Ashram, as you know, expresses ray quality in its purest and most essentialform. During the process of creating the seven Ashrams, they have shifted theirfocus (or location) from the lowest of the three levels of the abstract mentalplane at each major crisis, until today the Ashrams are to be found on thebuddhic plane and not on the mental plane at all. This marks the triumph of thehierarchical work, because pure reason—through the second ray—is now thedominant quality in all the Ashrams. Forget not in this connection that all therays are subrays of the second Ray of Love-Wisdom, but that in the early days ofhierarchical activity, it was the particular quality of the ray which dominatedan Ashram that first demonstrated, and not the quality of the great major ray ofwhich they were all a part.Today this is all changing, though the process is not yet perfected, and purereason or true love is beginning to manifest itself through the quality of allthe rays, functioning through their respective Ashrams. The secondary rayquality will not die out or in any way be lessened, but each ray quality willserve to implement the expression of pure love, which is the essential and—atthis time—the primary quality of the Lord of the World, Sanat Kumara.As the centuries have slipped away and the potency of the rays has increased onEarth, humanity has become more and more invocative; this has necessitated theexpansion of [388] the Hierarchy itself, and each Ashram has become the creatorof six other Ashrams (few of them as yet complete, and some entirely embryonic),so that, in fact, all the forty-nine Ashrams are in the making. The second ray,for instance, has five affiliated Ashrams and one of which only the nucleusexists, and all these are working under its inspiration and through the effectof the second ray central fire. All have at their centre a second ray disciple.The third ray has already two subsidiary Ashrams; the sixth has four, and so on.The first ray is the only one at this time with no subsidiary fully functioningAshram, and this because the will aspect is as yet very little understood andfew initiates can meet the requirements of the first ray initiation. This is noreflection upon humanity. It is a question of divine timing and expediency, andShamballa is not yet prepared for an influx of first ray initiates. Ages mustpass before this Will aspect will have reached the stage of unfoldment andexpression on the physical plane and through the medium of mankind which willwarrant the fusing of six first ray fires—the purest fires there are.If you will add all the above information as a background to what you know aboutashramic work today, you will have a more complete picture of evocative andspiritual reality. You know much (for I have told you much) anent the Ashramsopen today and the requirements for acceptance. It is essential that theuniqueness of the initiatory process be discounted. Down the ages men haveachieved, are achieving and will achieve. The only difference is that—as theintellect of man develops—the requirements for initiation become more drasticand exacting, and the initiate therefore becomes of a distinctly higher order.The Master today is infinitely wiser and more full of love and more “occultlyreasonable” than was the Master in Atlantean times. This in itself constitutes areasonable fact, does it not, my brothers?In considering the work carried forward in the Ashram as it affects the MastersThemselves, two ideas automatically emerge: [389]1. The Masters are also subject to limitation. The general idea of all aspirantsis that They represent Those Who leave achieved freedom, have been liberated,and are therefore held by no limiting circumstances whatsoever. This is nottrue, though—speaking relatively, or so far as humanity is concerned—it is afact that the limitations by which They were held as human beings are no longerpresent. But one achieved freedom only opens the door to another and widerfreedom on ahead, and the ring-pass-not of our planetary Life in itselfconstitutes a powerful limitation. Speaking symbolically, somewhere in thatgreat dividing wall of our planetary circumference, the Master must find an exitand discover a door which will permit Him to enter the Way of the HigherEvolution in its more cosmic stages. This Way leads Them in awareness andconsciousness and experience into that “life more abundantly” of which Christspoke; the origin and source of this more abundant life is to be found on cosmiclevels, and not on the levels of the cosmic physical plane to which humanity andthe Masters have hitherto been confined.2. I am dealing with states of awareness and with experiences and spiritualundertakings which lie outside my own personal realisation. But in spite of thistruth, just as you in the position of aspirants and disciples know much aboutthe Hierarchy, its life, aims and conditioning rules, so do I, a Master of thefifth degree, know much concerning what lies ahead of me; I can thereforeendeavour to make some small part of these essential truths clearer to those whocan profit by them. Such people will necessarily be initiated disciples.Years ago (in 1922) when I gave the names of the seven Paths along one of whicha Master must go (Initiation, Human and Solar ), it was felt by Those for Whom Iwas working that humanity was not ready for the information which I now proposeto give. I would here remind you that I have ever stated that even the Hierarchydoes not know exactly how humanity will react or what progress they will makewithin a given time. Since I gave the earlier exoteric information, the worldwar took place, the forces of hidden evil [390] emerged for a short period andwere then routed, and humanity has awakened to truer values and spiritualperception to a totally unexpected extent. Men have been so aroused by the pastagony that never again will they fall asleep; they may move slowly but they are,for the first time on a large scale, really thinking and visioning. For thisreason, it is now possible to give out teaching hitherto regarded as tooadvanced. There are those alive today who will understand; there are thosecoming into incarnation during the next fifty years whose feet are already setupon this Higher Way, and it is for them I write.There are certain preliminary statements which would be useful here, if there isto be any real and true measure of clear thinking and understanding. Theirsignificance will emerge as we study the Seven Paths and the Nine Initiations. Ishall do no more than state them, but you must regard them as basic:1. Our seven planes—the mastery of which is our idealised spiritual goal—areafter all only the lowest cosmic plane, the cosmic physical plane. From thecosmic angle, the Masters are only beginners, and even our deeply desiredinitiations (from the first to the sixth) are simply preparatory initiations forthose to be taken later on upon the Way of the Higher Evolution.2. This Higher Way is a sevenfold Way. The seven Paths form its seven modes ofapproach to the One Way and together create it. These seven Paths are notray-conditioned. By that I mean that entering one or another of them is not inany way dependent upon the ray which conditioned the Master earlier. The Mastersand the still higher initiates, such as the Christ, can choose any Path whichmakes its appeal in such a manner that complete rightness is registered in theinitiate's consciousness and He knows that He can go no other way.3. At the sixth initiation, called the Initiation of Decision, the Initiatemakes His final choice as to the Way that He will go, and from that decisionthere is no turning back. [391]4. Three things will necessarily colour any decision the Initiate may make; Hisray, which still determines Him, His past activities as they may fit Him forspecialised work, plus a sense of freedom hitherto unrealised. The decisionmight be regarded as the first gesture of the advancing Master toward liberationfrom all ray limitations. As He moves forward on the Higher Way, He will findHimself, as a result of the new training and field of experience, able to workon any ray.5. The fifth initiation is usually called that of the Resurrection by theorthodox Christian, but this is not its real name; it is in reality theInitiation of Revelation, because the Initiate gains His first vision of theDoor through which He must pass on to the seven Paths. He glimpses it and thatis all, but between that initiation and the next in which He must perforce makeHis decision, He comes to understand the nature of the energy which each Pathexpresses and which will eventually evoke from Him a decisive activity.6. By passing through the second great Door of Initiation, the Initiate beginsto learn the significance and the attractive potency of the Central SpiritualSun, to which all the Paths eventually lead.7. The fifth and sixth initiations are to the Master what the first and secondare to the disciple—simply initiations of the threshold and not true initiationsfrom the cosmic angle. The first true initiation upon the Higher Way is calledthe Initiation of Resurrection; this has no reference to the fifth initiation.8. The decision made by the Master enables Him to take the required training toenter His chosen Path, and this training is taken entirely upon cosmic ethericlevels—the four highest subplanes of the cosmic physical plane—the buddhic,atmic, monadic and logoic planes.9. On these planes the spiritual and the divine will is developed and broughtinto use; these are aspects of that undefinable purpose to which we give thesimple name: the Will of God. Intelligence and love have been fully unfolded inthe Master, but the will is embryonic still, from the [392] standpoint of Thoseresponsible for training the Master and the higher Initiate. It is only by meansof the divine will that the Master begins to free Himself from ray limitations.10. I would remind you of an earlier statement that the Hierarchy reacts orresponds to the energies and influences coming from the cosmic astral plane;from that level of spiritual life true divine love pours into it. Shamballareacts to the cosmic mental plane, and therefore to the nature and purposes ofthe Mind of God; the expression of THAT which overshadows Sanat Kumara issimilar to the soul overshadowing the incarnated spiritual man.If you will bear these facts in mind, some light may break through and, in anycase, when the student or disciple returns to incarnation, this impartedknowledge (stored in the soul's content) will then be usefully available.I would like to enlarge somewhat upon an earlier remark. I stated that the“seven Ashrams are 'proving grounds' for all the Masters confronted with thesixth Initiation of Decision.”This constitutes part of the problem facing the Masters Who are thus to moveforward; it is particularly crucial for Those Who have chosen the first Path,the Path of Earth Service, and for all in preparation for the sixth initiation.This process of changing for a final, conditioning decision—in line, consciouslyrealised, with divine Purpose and entailing responsiveness to Shamballa—is amajor undertaking; it is related to the development of understanding the Will,and concerns the spirit or life aspect; it involves an increasing revelation ofthe purpose and the “fixed intention” of the planetary Logos but (even more thanthat) it has relation to extra-planetary sources and energies and to thosecosmic conditions which are responsible for the Presence of Sanat Kumara uponthe Earth. It is will which has brought Him here, and the unfoldment of the willnature of the Masters and still higher Initiates admits Them into His innerdeliberations by means of the highest form of telepathic rapport or impressionto be found upon our planet. [393] This impression is, however, made possible bythe development of the intuition, and has no relation to the mind nature.This training in decision is given by forcing the Master to make basic decisionswithin His Ashram affecting world work and involving all within the Ashram. Itis given by His admission to the conclave of the Masters, meeting every sevenyears. At that conclave They make decisions which concern all forms of life inall the kingdoms in the three worlds and their evolutionary progress; it is putto the test in group form when the entire Hierarchy meets at Its centennialconference and—at that time—decides what form of crisis, on what level ofconsciousness, and involving what group of lives, must be implemented andpresented to humanity, though the other kingdoms of nature will be necessarilyimplicated. The reason for this is that the meeting of such a planned crisiswill hasten certain realisations. Forget not that humanity grows through thepresentation of moments of crisis. These moments of crisis, based on past karma,conditioned by the point in evolution already achieved, and on the presence inthe three worlds of certain appropriate ray forces, are brought to the point ofprecipitation by united decision in the conclave of the Masters.These decisions do not affect man's free will, for the Hierarchy does nothing tocondition man's approach to the crisis and, occultly speaking, Their “attitudeis deliberately turned to other things” during the period of man's decision;thus the potency of Their thinking does not affect the human mind. Once theprecipitation of the crisis is complete, and humanity has begun to take actionof some kind, then the full attention of the Masters, working through TheirAshrams, is committed to the giving of full assistance to all those who areseeking to guide humanity along correct lines—a relative few among the countlessmillions of the ignorant.While these centennial conclaves are being held at the close of the firsttwenty-five years of every century, the Lord of the World with the Members ofHis Council watch the process of decision in order to see how far the will ofthe [394] Hierarchy conforms to that aspect of the divine will which should beexpressed in the three worlds as the result of Their decision. They watch alsoThose particular Masters Who should in a short time be ready for the sixthinitiation, in order to see how much of that divine will They register and whatis the nature and quality of Their use of it. By recording that quality, theCouncil at Shamballa is able to determine with great accuracy which of the sevenPaths a certain Initiate will choose. In this manner They become aware of howmany senior disciples will be needed to take over the headship of an Ashram,with a consequent admittance of many disciples to the initiation next in orderfor them. At the same time, aspirants on the periphery of an Ashram are enabledto move forward into full ashramic participation.All this should give you some idea of the synthesis which expresses itselfthrough the three planetary centres: Shamballa, the Hierarchy and Humanity.These are responsible for the conditioning of the other planetary centres andthe consequent demonstration of divine intention. The basic purpose of SanatKumara is to bring about right relations in every field of His manifested life.The encouraging factor is today that the activity of humanity itself is, for thefirst time, concerned with the entire subject of right human relations and howto bring it about. I would have you reflect on this, for it means that, againfor the first time, humanity is consciously responding to the will and intentionof Shamballa, even though without realising the esoteric implications. This isof far greater importance than you can imagine, for it signifies a newrelationship of a spiritual nature and deeply spiritual results.The preparation of the Masters for this sixth initiation is exceedinglystrenuous. They find it as difficult to achieve Their goal as does the averagedisciple as he looks ahead at the initiation which immediately confronts him.They have to master the technique of handling the most potent energy andinfluence in the world, that of the intelligence. They have to penetrate intothe mystery of electricity and implement [395] its expression in the creativeprocess under the directive of Shamballa; They have to learn to work withelectric fire in the same way as—much earlier—They worked with fire by frictionas personalities, and with solar fire as disciples and lesser initiates. In thisway, They become familiarised with what is meant by the words the “CentralSpiritual Sun,” just as They were familiar with the appearance of the physicalSun when members of the human family, and with the “Heart of the Sun” as Membersof the Hierarchy. Again you can see the same unfolding synthesis—a synthesiswhich originates in that focal point of attractive dynamic energy, known to usas the Sun and its planets.Thus within His Ashram the Master learns “occultly to decide” and to conditionthe creative centre for which He is responsible. He has to do this with theAshram, surrounded by all those who are in training and who are the agents ofHis will. Through them He must act, and they thereby limit necessarily thevision to which He reacts, and step down the rate and quality of the energy ofwhich He is the focal point. This energy constitutes the animating life of theAshram as well as the force which the disciples and initiates must use in theirwork in the world, this of course in cooperation with the energy which eachdisciple within himself “occultly generates” and for which he—in his lesserdegree—is responsible.More anent this subject will be given when we study specifically the nineinitiations wherein another synthesis, interlocking with the synthesis of theWill, will appear.The seven Paths confronting the MasterIt will be apparent to you now that the Master confronts two crises:> 1. The crisis of the will, as it demonstrates in unalterable decision.> 2. The crisis of the new step which will probably “cast Him adrift upon the> shore of some distant sphere wherein His will must be expressed in love.”> These ambiguous words of the Old Commentary mean that [396] His decision will> (with one exception) take Him away from all that He has hitherto known.The majority of the Masters then enter into realms wherein They are needed “toimpart, strengthen and enlighten that which is already fused, already strong andalready full of light, but which needs that which He brings in order to expressthe all-encompassing whole.”I have to leave you with these words as food for reflection as there is littlefurther that I may say upon this point. In any case and for all deciding groupsof Masters, the work with the Hierarchy is over, except for the few Who choosePath I. Part of the mistake which the Buddha made was connected with thissubject of decision. He loved humanity so much that He felt He could not and didnot choose the Path which He was in reality ordained to follow; He chose insteadthe Path of Earth Service—which was not His Path at all. This He knows and willin due time pass on to His rightful Path. This little incident will demonstratethe complete freedom of choice which distinguishes the sixth initiation.The seven Paths are, as you know from your study of Initiation, Human and Solarthe following:> 1. The Path of Earth Service.> 2. The Path of Magnetic Work.> 3. The Path of Training for Planetary Logoi.> 4. The Path to Sirius.> 5. The Ray Path.> 6. The Path on which our Logos is found.> 7. The Path of Absolute Sonship.In that first book which I wrote for the world, I gave a simple definition ofthe exoteric significance of these Paths—so simple as to convey but little. Iwrote then for the general public. I will now endeavour to convey some of thedeeper meanings, writing as I do for advanced disciples and for initiateswho—reading between the lines and understanding the symbolism involved—willcomprehend according to their point in evolution. [397]As we approach the subject of the seven Paths, I would point out that the onlybasic point which can be presented to you is that of relationship. All theseseven Paths lead to some objective which is thereby put in touch with ourplanetary life; these objectives—with the life and conditions theyrepresent—present to the Master a vision of possibility. This vision is adequateto the task of drawing Him forth from the hierarchical Ashram, except in onecase where vacancies in Shamballa need to be filled. The progressive experienceof the greater Lives Who work in the Council Chamber of Sanat Kumara form nopart of our studies. Many of these supreme Workers, as you have read in ATreatise on Cosmic Fire, found Their way to our planet from our sister planet,Venus, thereby in Their turn establishing relationship. Remember also that allthe seven rays are the subrays of the great cosmic Ray of Love-Wisdom, which isever expressive of relationship, implemented under the Law of Attraction; it isthis form of esoteric attraction which draws the Master forth from His Ashram,conditions His decision and eventually leads to His passing through the doorwhich opens on to other spheres and planes of activity.Let us now consider—very briefly and necessarily inadequately—these seven Paths,taking them one by one:1. The Path of Earth ServiceThis is the only Path which the Lord of the World regards as within the field ofHis spiritual interference. He reserves the right to retain in the service ofthe Hierarchy, and consequently of Humanity and the subsidiary evolutions, ThoseMasters Whom He regards at any one time as essential to the work to be done.This He does by asking Them to record Their decision when taking the sixthinitiation, but to postpone moving on to one or other of the Paths until Hegives the word. This word He has lately given in the case of the Buddha, Who hasexpiated His most understandable mistake and will now move forward—in His owngood time—on to the Path which will lead Him to His rightful field ofexpression. In due time also, though [398] not for some time, the Christ willmove forward “to the place which calls Him,” and the Master K.H. will assume therole of World Teacher. All these moves present their unique problems; theyproduce vacancies in the ranks of the Hierarchy which must be filled; they leadconstantly to the inflow of new and powerful energies, for it must be recognisedthat these energies reach us along Paths leading to our planet as well as awayfrom it. The invocative note of our united evolution at stated times and cyclessounds out and reaches Those Who are waiting for spiritual opportunity andservice. They then follow the Path to our planet. From other spheres and planesThey emerge along the lines of Their destiny and intention; we then call ThemAvatars or Great Enlighteners or Planetary Saviours or Spiritual Regents; Theyact at the request of Sanat Kumara, given on higher cosmic levels.It is nevertheless a statement of fact that in due time even Those Who choosethe Path of Earth Service and remain in hierarchical work are eventually giventhe right to follow Their decision and pass to extra-planetary service. TheHierarchy, as we have seen, gives the needed training for that wider service,and the theme of what I might call the educational process to which the Masterssubmit is the unfoldment of the consciousness of the relationships which liebeyond the aura of our planet; this is, in reality, a higher and most abstrusebranch of the Science of Impression, which disciples upon their lower level haveto master. This aspect of impression is, however, concerned with the formlessworlds, whereas all the impressions to which the disciple has to learn to reactemanate from and within the cosmic physical plane, of which all our seven planesare an integral part; our highest spiritual world is a part of the substantialworld. The Masters, therefore, are working at a conscious receptivity orsensitivity to the cosmic astral plane, the source of the spirit or energy oflove. There is a fundamental connection between the Hierarchy (the source ofexpression of love on Earth) and the cosmic astral plane, and it is towards thisobjective that the Masters work Who choose the Path [399] of Earth Service. Themajor ray of our solar system is that of love-wisdom, and there is no betterfield on which to master the preliminary stages of that divine unfoldment andreceive the needed development and education than on the Earth.On the Earth, the Masters have overcome glamour and illusion, and for Them noastral plane exists. Now ahead of Them, and owing to Their freedom from these“bewilderments,” will come the opportunity to enter into the Heart of God, thecentre of pure love, and from that centre to tread the way of love. All theseseven Paths lead either to the cosmic astral plane or to the cosmic mentalplane, according to the decision made at the sixth initiation. Upon the cosmicastral plane there is no glamour, but instead a great vortex of energy—theenergy of pure love—under the domination of the Law of Attraction. It might bestated that:> Path 1. The Path of Earth Service leads to the cosmic astral plane.> Path 2. The Path of Magnetic Work leads to the cosmic astral plane.> Path 3. The Path for Training for Planetary Logoi leads to the higher levels> of the cosmic mental plane.> Path 4. The Path to Sirius leads to the cosmic astral plane.> Path 5. The Ray Path leads to the cosmic mental plane.> Path 6. The Path the Logos Himself is on leads to the cosmic buddhic plane.> Path 7. The Path of Absolute Sonship leads to the cosmic mental plane.Three Paths, therefore, lead to the realm of loving attractive energy; one Pathleads to its higher correspondence, the cosmic level of pure reason; three leadto the realm of divine Mind. Four of the Paths relate the advancing Master tothe Heart of the Great Life Who functions through this solar system, and threeto His Mind nature. All of them lead the initiate eventually to the CentralSpiritual Sun. [400] All Who work in Shamballa find Their way to this supremecentre by the three most arduous ways, whilst the remainder reach the same goalvia the way of love.The unfoldment of the will has much to do with Their decision. It must not bethought that Those Masters Who are on the first, third and fifth rays, forinstance, follow the Path numerically the same; such is not the case; nor thatThose Who are predominantly on the second line of energy find the cosmic astralplane Their goal. Such again is not the case. Their response and decision isbased on a realisation of cosmic need—a need of which you can know nothing, anymore than it is possible for you to comprehend the nature of cosmic evil.As to the detail of the work of Those Who choose—until released—to stay on Earthand work in or with the Hierarchy, is there more that I can tell you? You knowmuch anent this subject for I have given much—far more than has ever been givenbefore. I have not dealt with the work of the Hierarchy in relation toevolutions other than the human, for two reasons:> Your unfoldment is still such that you do not and cannot yet include or> register the consciousness or nature of the subhuman kingdoms.> The work done by the Hierarchy in those kingdoms is largely carried forward> via humanity and modern scientific development.There are many Masters Who do not work with the human kingdom at all, but arefully occupied with carrying out the divine Will in other kingdoms. With thiswork we have, at present, no concern. When any one takes the sixth initiationand makes his decision to follow the Path of Earth Service (either temporarilyat the request of Sanat Kumara, or until the end of the world cycle), he willfind himself faced with a secondary decision as to which of the four kingdomswill profitably provide the field of his sacrifice and service. We will nowconsider: [401]2. The Path of Magnetic WorkIn referring to this Path, I have stated that Those Who find Their way on tothis Path work with fohat, or with the essential energy of our solar systemwhich differentiates into seven major types of energy. Our planet with itsruling Lord is an integral part of the life expression of a still greaterEntity, the solar Logos, and it is with the astral energy incident to His cosmicnature that the Master has to work. He learns to direct the currents of thisessential energy, and because of His past relation to the Earth, He is part ofthe directing agency for astral energy within the planetary ring-pass-not. Ialso said that many Masters Who leave reached liberation upon the fifth ray findTheir way to this Path, thus proving the statement that it is not the ray whichdetermines decision. These fifth ray Masters (among many others, of course) willbe working in a great second ray vortex of energy.It must be pointed out that, in its original state, this pure astral energy,directed under law into our planetary life, is free from all that is at presentassociated with the astral plane: glamour and delusion, emotional fog andpoisonous deceiving phenomena. These well-known aspects of the astral plane areall the creation of humanity down the ages and present, therefore, anincreasingly difficult problem to all aspirants. The tormenting turmoil andchaos of the astral plane are due largely to three factors:> The force of the constantly developing glamour as self-centered and> undeveloped human beings create it.> The force of those aspirants and disciples who are seeking to combat this in> their own lives and in the lives of others.> The inflow of pure solar astral energy under cyclic law and the direction of> the Master working on the second Path.These three factors create great trouble; during the past crisis of the worldwar (1914-1945) it reached most serious proportions. The hierarchical crisis towhich I have earlier [402] referred was involved, and many Masters from thevarious Ashrams made a decision to work on this second Path in order to bringorder out of chaos by pouring into the planetary astral plane pure astralenergy, untainted by glamour and revelatory of pure love. They were experts intiming and in energy manipulation.You will also note how three types of astral energy are therefore related:> The astral force of our planet, distinctive of the planetary astral plane in> the three worlds of human enterprise.> The astral force of the solar Logos, the true God of Love.> The astral energy of the cosmic astral plane.These forces are symbolised to the manipulating Master by a triangle. In the OldCommentary it says:> “The Master throws Himself—under the liberating Law of Sacrifice—into the> vortex of the astral life of the One to Whom our Lord relates Himself with> humble joy. And as the Master works, there forms before His eyes a triangle of> force in shades of varying rose. By His magnetic power, He concentrates the> energy required. Then through this triangle of force, as through an open door,> He sends the potency of love into our planet, and till His cycle ends He thus> must work.”This is but a rough translation of some very ancient phrases, and is perhapsless symbolic than it may appear. It is in connection with this Path that thework of the Triangles which I initiated is related; the function of theseTriangles is in reality to facilitate the work of distributing the pure incominglove energy (expressing itself as light and as goodwill) into the Hierarchy andHumanity. This deeply esoteric purpose of the Triangles will not be understoodby the general public, but some of you who read this will appreciate theopportunity to serve in this manner consciously .The Path of Magnetic Work takes the Master, first of all, to the Heart of theSun, and from thence to the cosmic [403] mental plane, passing through andpausing temporarily upon the cosmic astral plane. The above statement does notin reality refer to progress from point to point in an ordered sequence. Itrefers to high states of awareness and to a form of cosmic contact which isregistered by the Master from the point at which He stands upon this secondPath, for all the planes are interpenetrating. This has been somewhat easy tounderstand in connection with our seven planes, as the rarer substances could bevisualised as interpenetrating the denser. It is not so easy to comprehend,however, when we pass out of the cosmic physical plane (in our imagination,needless to say) and enter those planes of which we know nothing and of whosecomposition and substance (if they are substantial, as we understand the term)we are totally ignorant; besides that, we are not in a position to ascertain thetruth.The method of the Master's work upon this Path is also not easily understood. Itcan be summed up in the following words which may bring some light via theirunited meaning (each phrase contributing an idea), if due reflection is broughtto bear upon them: Isolated Unity the position of the Master A positive Focus the mentalattitude Sound, under the Law of Attraction the means employed Precipitation the intention visioned Passage through the Triangle the projection ensuing Directive work under the Law of Distribution direction towards the goalThese phrases may give some vague idea of a process, based on “reception, thendirection, producing rejection and impact where the rejecting agency ordained.”Another aspect of the work done by the Master on the second Path is the drawingoff of those phases of glamour which no longer have the power to deceivemankind. They are not allowed to accumulate or to remain upon the astral plane.They are therefore, through the magnetic power of the Master, withdrawn from ourplanetary life and are “occultly [404] absorbed” by the Master; the substance ofthe glamour, purified and freed from all that conditioned it on the planetaryastral plane, and with only the pure essence retained, sets the law in motionwhich draws this purified remainder into the cosmic astral plane.Constantly, therefore, this great circulatory process goes on, demonstratinganew the essential synthesis underlying all life—human, planetary, systemic andcosmic; it reveals also that the Law of Attraction, the Law of Magnetic Work,and the cosmic Law of Synthesis are three aspects of one Law for which, as yet,we have no name.It might be said that the Masters working on the second Path are working inrelation to and in contact with certain great Lives Who work on the periphery ofthe constellation Libra, the Balances. This is due to the fact that ThoseMasters Who can work with magnetic energies, and with the three above Laws, haveachieved a point of balance which makes Their work possible; it involves also apoised attention and directive power, permitting the inflow of energies fromLibra which could not otherwise enter our planetary life at all. These Libranenergies enter our solar system via the Heart of the Sun and are peculiarlyamenable to magnetic attraction and distribution.All these Paths gradually came into being when our planetary Logos created theEarth and started the involutionary process of creation, leading in due time butmuch later, to evolution. They are therefore, all of Them, Paths of Return. Thissecond Path was one of the first to be used and (again quoting the OldCommentary ) “the door once opening inward now opens outward and permits theexit of those who hold the key because they entered by that door in aeons longgone by.”All the Masters (and not only Those upon the fifth ray) receive careful trainingin the manipulation of energies, and hence the statement of the Master K.H. toHis disciples that the occultist has to learn to master and control the forcesand energies within himself; the disciple and the initiate work withhierarchical energies and with the forces [405] of the kingdoms of nature in thethree worlds; the Master receives instruction in the handling of the energieswhich are extra-planetary but within the solar ring-pass-not. Those MastersWhose decision it is to tread the second Path are taught the control anddirection of systemic energies and of certain energies emanating from Libra andfrom one of the stars in the constellation of the Great Bear. In the moreadvanced stages of Their work, and when the Master is far more advanced than theword indicates, He works consciously upon the cosmic mental plane; Hisactivities will then be concerned with the relation of the energies of the GreatBear to the Pleiades, and their dual relationship (a higher correspondence toatma-buddhi) to the solar system and only incidentally to our Earth. Great isthe interlocking, the interdependence and the interpenetration!3. The Path of Training for Planetary LogoiIt is obviously impossible to say much about this Path. Those Masters Who treadit find Their way to the various schools for the training of planetary Logoiwhich are found within certain of the major planetary schemes, as stated inInitiation, Human and Solar. They are necessarily few in number, and a smallgroup of Them remains to study in our particular planetary enterprise underSanat Kumara. This They do after making Their decision and passing through thedoor on the periphery of our planetary ring-pass-not. Then—out of incarnationand working through the medium of the higher telepathy—They receive instructionof a nature incomprehensible to us, from the Members of the Council Chamber atShamballa, and primarily from two of the Buddhas of Activity. Having learnt thetechnique and having passed certain tests, They move into the planetary life ofVenus, our Earth's Alter-Ego, and there They complete Their training, as far asour solar system can give it, finding Their way eventually on to the cosmicmental plane.Two things should be borne in mind in connection with this abstruse subject:First: These Masters work primarily with the “psyche” [406] or the soul aspectwithin the solar system. They are occupied with the subtler expressions ofconsciousness, with occult impressibility and that acute sensitivity whichproduces instant and accurate registration of all soul reactions within anyparticular planetary life. These kingdoms are not necessarily identical withthose found on the Earth, but they are, in all cases, vast groups of livingforms which are manifestations or expressions of the nature of any particularplanetary Logos. The Masters taking this training are not occupied withindividual states of consciousness within any group. It is the consciousness ofthe whole, and its responsiveness to cosmic impacts, that engages Theirattention. They are not (if I might so express it) interested in any individualunit of any kind or in its individual reactions, responsiveness orsusceptibility to impression. They are only concerned with those higherprocesses of identification which indicate an advanced state of evolutionarydevelopment. Their work is to further progressive development of identification.They begin with the identification of the Monad within our planetary sphere withthe Purpose and the Will of the Lord of the World, and proceed—as Their trainingproduces the desired capabilities—with greater identifications within the solarsystem. Beyond that we need not proceed.Their whole training is concerned with the planetary, systemic and cosmicbuilding of the antahkarana, for it is via the antahkarana that spirit works,that life processes are controlled, and the will of all developing aspects ofDeity function. Forget not that relating our planet to the planet Venus is aplanetary antahkarana, passing from thence to the Heart of the Sun and later tothe cosmic mental plane. There are “rainbow bridges” carrying the sevenfoldenergies of the seven rays from planet to planet, from system to system, andfrom plane to plane on cosmic levels. It is over these bridges that the will ofthe related spiritual Identities is projected, producing that synthesis ofeffort which is distinctive of the cooperative systemic life. The work of theMasters in training from our planet is, among other [407] things, to unfoldwithin Themselves not only sensitivity to systemic purpose, but the ability totransmit that Purpose to the Council Chamber at Shamballa. They have—in anextraplanetary sense—a definite correspondence with and relation to the group ofNirmanakayas within our planet Who work in contemplative activity with theantahkarana which connects the Hierarchy with Shamballa and Humanity with theHierarchy.As planetary Logoi when Their Own time comes, these Masters will be concernedwith the registration of the Purpose and expressed Will of some solar Logos.They will then, through the planetary and systemic antahkarana, supervise thegradual evolutionary impartation of that Will (which is now Theirs) to all theforms through which They function in any particular planet for which They haveassumed responsibility. This definitely involves working with the soul aspectand with the unfoldment of conscious responsiveness and sensitive reaction toall the higher impressions.Second: These Masters are the directing builders and Creators eventually of allforms of planetary life—forms embodying qualities and intentions as yetundreamed of by us. They have developed in Themselves a perfected synthesis ofthe two energies of atma-buddhi, or of spiritual will and spiritual love,completely unified and energetically active in a comprehensive condition seldomattained by any other group of Masters in training.It must be realised that the Buddhas of Activity, of Whom there are only threeon our planet, are similarly active. They are active love-wisdom or a completesynthesis of active intelligence, active love and active will. The Masters onthis third Path will, therefore, some day complete Their training for planetaryLogoi by attaining the status of Buddhas of Activity, and will for a periodserve in that capacity in some planetary scheme, before taking the control andguidance of Their Own body of manifestation.The training of these Masters on the third Path might be described as anintensive study of a most exalted form of the Science of Impression. The supremetask of a planetary [408] Logos is to impress His sevenfold body ofmanifestation, via its seven states of consciousness and the seven centres, withHis will and intention; these are progressively imparted as the etheric body isbrought into an increasing state of receptivity through the awakening of theseven planetary centres, primarily the three major centres. The Masters thus intraining gain experience of the methods used by the planetary Logoi of all theseven sacred planets, and the training is therefore an exceedingly lengthy one.It must be remembered however that—except in dense physical incarnation and,therefore, conditioned by the brain and its special limitations—the spiritualman is not conscious of time, once He is separated from the physical body. Timeis the sequential registration by the brain of states of awareness and ofprogressive contacts with phenomena. There is no such thing as time on the innerplanes, as humanity understands it. There are only cycles of activity or ofnon-activity; this non-activity for Masters on the third Path takes the form ofcyclic periods of contemplation and mental activity, followed by active periodsof energy direction to impress the will of certain planetary Logoi and Theiragents upon the Council Chamber of our planet in particular, and upon otherplanets, as Their training is perfected.It is the impulsive incentive of these Masters which bridges and links betweenthe Monad on the monadic plane and the three worlds of dense expression on thecosmic physical plane; in this process the antahkarana between the spiritual manin incarnation and the spiritual Triad is aided and finally constructed, butthis is only incidental to the far greater work of relating Shamballa to allkingdoms in nature and to other planets.The number of Masters deciding on this Path is, as I said, not large; thetraining is peculiarly arduous and is followed, when opportunity is offered tofunction as a planetary Logos, by an act of sacrifice which confines Themindefinitely to the limitations of the ring-pass-not of Their body ofmanifestation, a planet. It is for this reason that Sanat Kumara has ever beencalled “The Great Sacrifice.” [409]Certain Hierarchical ChangesBefore proceeding with our consideration of the seven cosmic Paths, I would liketo pause here and clarify your mind, A.A.B., and answer certain questions whichyou are formulating.Some years ago (in 1925) I gave out to the world through your instrumentality ATreatise on Cosmic Fire. In that volume I elaborated upon the very elementaryinformation given upon this subject in Initiation, Human and Solar —a bookpublished earlier (in 1922). In both these volumes I touched upon the cosmicPaths. I gave (in very abstruse terms) some information; the terms were soabstruse that few can understand their meaning. The true significance is onlyfor advanced initiates, of which I am not one, from Their point of view, thoughfrom yours I may be. In Initiation, Human and Solar very little was said,because the book was written for the general public and thus only a few ideaswere indicated to point direction. Now, in A Treatise on the Seven Rays I haveadded to that already given; this book is, however, intended for a much largernumber than those who read (and claim, erroneously, to understand) A Treatise onCosmic Fire . In what I have to say, the teaching is carefully guarded. Twothings should, however, be pointed out here in order to save confusion:1. It had not been the intention of the Hierarchy to give any furtherinformation anent these Paths; it was felt that enough had been said about thisnaturally incomprehensible subject. Owing, however, to the fundamental changesin the hierarchical plans, this decision was altered. I was permitted to add tothat already given. This was due to two causes:> a. The tremendous unfoldment of the human consciousness during the last> twenty-five years warrants more information; so many aspirants were being> admitted to the Path of Discipleship and were finding their way into the> Ashrams, thus forcing the passage of many initiates on to the Way of the> Higher Evolution. [410] This in itself is a most joyous happening, but> necessitated many ashramic adjustments.> b. Owing to this advancement, owing to the increased sensitivity of the human> mechanism, and owing to the decisions humanity is in process of making (as a> result of the frightful testing period of the war, 1914-1945), the> Hierarchy—far earlier than had been hoped or anticipated—has prepared Itself> for physical plane manifestation, or for what is called by Them “the process> of externalisation.”This has necessarily produced problems, and among them the strictly hierarchicalproblem of the passage of the initiate of the sixth degree on to the cosmicPaths. You will find, if you study closely the three presentations of theteaching (in Initiation, Human and Solar, A Treatise on Cosmic Fire, and ATreatise on the Seven Rays ) what may appear to you as contradictions ordifferences. This is not truly so, but the casual reader may feel them to bepresent even though the differences are apparent more than real. Two causesaccount for this:> a. The decision to throw open initiations higher than the fifth to the ready> Master, and to familiarise the world of aspirants with their existence. Little> has ever been given beyond the fifth initiation. Many initiates are becoming> Masters, and many disciples are achieving the first initiation, and this fact> confronts the three Great Lords Who rule the Hierarchy with a definite> problem.> b. To make the sixth initiation and not the fifth initiation the Initiation of> Decision. Here I must state the existence of a hierarchical problem: the use> of the will aspect in the unfoldment of the initiate. It must be remembered> that this first ray aspect is:> > A definite and most potent energy. It is the most potent energy in the> > planetary life and is carefully held in leash by Those Who are in a position> > to wield it. [411]> > The medium whereby the purpose of creation is finally revealed.> > The force which enables the Hierarchy to present the Plan in the three> > worlds.> > The needed dynamic whereby the “deciding” Master sets His foot upon the Path> > of the Higher Evolution.Owing to the success of the influence of this Shamballa energy upon humanitywhen the experiment was made to test its impact without stepping it down throughthe medium of the Hierarchy, the entire course of man's spiritual history wasmost peculiarly altered. This had not been anticipated, for—as oft I have toldyou—the Masters know not which way mankind will go, nor may They interfere byaction or thinking in humanity's decision. It was therefore necessary to controlmore definitely the passage of initiates on to the seven Paths; only a certainnumber are required to fulfill cosmic intention; it was therefore decided tomake the rules of entrance more difficult and more rigid.Forget not, brother of mine, that this is not the first time that this hashappened. Changes were made in Atlantean times; the door of entrance for theanimal kingdom or for animal man into the human kingdom was stopped. No moreunits have since then been admitted from third kingdom into the fourth, exceptin a few cases and for specific reasons. Here, however, you have a reversesituation. The Hierarchy, owing to its constitution at that time and to the factthat very few, relatively, of our Earth humanity were members of the Hierarchy,could not influence directly the more developed human beings or train moreaspirants. They therefore closed the door. That particular condition does notnow exist, and the supreme Directors of the seven cosmic Paths are today in thesame position as was the Hierarchy then; the word has gone forth to our threeGreat Lords—the Manu, the Christ and the Mahachohan—via the three Buddhas ofActivity, to act in order to tighten up on requirements, to make the sixthinitiation and not the fifth, the decisive one, and to present those on theseven rays with [412] a wider range of choices and a greater diversity ofchoice. Thus the Masters will have nine choices to face when They face Theirdecision; there will then be no need for Those on certain rays to pass tocertain already determined Paths, but They can move forward under Their Owninspiration and with greater freedom. The cosmic mental plane is not barred toThem, as has hitherto been the case.All these changes have been due to the successful response of our planetarylife, expressed through the human kingdom at this time, to the processes ofevolution and to the inflow (since 1825) of the will energy from Shamballa.This, in its turn, is due to the progress of Sanat Kumara Himself, within HisOwn identified life upon the cosmic Path which emerges from the cosmic mentalplane. All that we can contact and know is interdependent, and the unfoldment ofthe Life in Whom we live and move and have our being affects every aspect anddepartment of His manifestation, just as the successful spiritual unfoldment ofa human being and his ability to contact his soul produces incredible changes inthe personality and affects every aspect and organ of his little manifestationupon the physical plane.2. The intelligence of humanity now is of such a nature that certain earlierinitiations no longer exist, and mankind has shown itself to possess thepotentialities which will enable its individual units to tread not only the oneor two cosmic Paths hitherto open to them, but all of them, if given the righttraining. This the premature discovery of the release of atomic energy has welldemonstrated to the Hierarchy.All these factors have forced a reorganisation in the Plans at Shamballa and, ina unique conference, in that far greater Council Chamber over which our SolarLogos presides; greater opportunity was consequently offered to the Members ofour planetary Hierarchy. I stress that point: the opportunity was not offered orpresented to the fourth kingdom in nature, but to the fifth kingdom.It is all these facts which have caused what may look to you like discrepanciesand limitations in what I have given and [413] in comparison with that given inthe earlier volumes of this Treatise, but they are not so in reality. The Masterof the fifth initiation, even if now He does not at that time make His decision,faces intelligently and with some understanding of the choices to be made, thesixth initiation and its decisions. He begins to take also the particulartraining, and to this the teaching in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire now applies. Heis shewn the newer opportunity, the modes of decision, and the limitations whichare no longer legitimate. I would like to point out here that these changes area cause of deep joy to the Hierarchy and to the Great Lives in the CouncilChamber at Shamballa, for they indicate the strength and potency of SanatKumara's success and the incredible progress made in the consciousness ofhumanity as a consequence; this will lead also to future paralleling decisionson the physical plane in human affairs; this deeply spiritual and mysterioussuccess (mysterious because the human mind knows naught about it) was also thereason for the violent attempt of the Forces of Evil to gain control, and theirresultant failure.4. The Path to SiriusI have frequently hinted in my various books that the Sun, Sirius, is closelyrelated to our planetary Life; much is known in the Hierarchy anent thisconnection, and the particular relationship of this fourth Path to humanity, thefourth kingdom in nature, but little can be communicated to the general public.I may, however, tell you certain things which may make your imaginative rangings(if I may use so strange a phrase) creatively profitable to you.This great Sun which is to our solar Logos what the Monad is to the spiritualman, has a peculiar part to play where our Earth is concerned. It might beconsidered by those with a sound sense of occult proportion that our tiny planetwith its planetary Logos (one of the “imperfect Gods” of The Secret Doctrine )would be too small to enter in the slightest way into the consciousness of thatSupreme Illumined Entity Who is greater even than our Solar Logos. [414] Such,however, is the case. There is a relationship of very ancient date between ourLord of the World, Sanat Kumara, and the Lord of Sirius, and this exists inspite of the fact that our planet is not a sacred planet. It might be added thatour planet is, in the immediate cycle, owing to the factors I have latelyconsidered with you, rapidly passing out of this category, and on the innerplanes and subjectively considered is a sacred planet; the effects of thistransition from non-sacred to sacred have not fully demonstrated themselvesobjectively. The mystery of this relationship is partially revealed at one ofthe higher initiations and it is then realised by the initiates that there is agood and adequate reason for the relation and that the following esotericevents, relations and happenings are simply consequences:> [Image00009.jpg]1. The majority of liberated humanity, and therefore a large number of theinitiates who have to make decision, choose this way to the cosmic centre.2. The relationship as it expresses itself is between the Hierarchy and Sirius,and not between Shamballa and that stupendous Sun. The energy evoked in responseto this relationship enters the Hierarchy via the Heart of the Sun, creating asa consequence a triangle of spiritual energy of enormous potency. You have,therefore:3. As progress is made in the course of taking the higher initiations, itbecomes apparent to the initiate that two major streams of energy enter ourplanetary life:> a. A stream of energy coming from the cosmic mental plane and from that focal> point which is to Sanat Kumara what the egoic lotus, the soul, is to the> spiritual man; it carries the life principle of our planet and centres itself> in Shamballa. From there it is dispersed throughout all forms upon the planet> and we call it LIFE. It must be remembered that this life principle embodies> or is impregnated with the will and purpose [415] of THAT which overshadows> Sanat Kumara as the soul overshadows the personality.> b. A stream of energy coming from the sun, Sirius; this enters directly into> the Hierarchy and carries with it the principle of buddhi, of cosmic love.> This, in a mysterious way, is the principle found at the heart of every atom.The life principle follows the line of 1.3.5.7, whilst the buddhic flow followsthe line of 2.4.6. Thus atma-buddhi becomes the blended reality which is broughtto full unfoldment as evolution proceeds. The energy of Sirius by-passes (to usea modern word) Shamballa and is focussed in the Hierarchy. Its effect is notfelt until after the third initiation, though the Masters use this energy whilsttraining disciples for the second, the fourth and the sixth initiations.4. The entire work of the Great White Lodge is controlled from Sirius; theAshrams are subjected to its cyclic inflow; the higher initiations are takenunder its stimulation, for the principle of buddhi, of pure love (i.e.,love-wisdom) must be active in the heart of every initiate prior to theinitiation of the great decision; it is therefore only initiates of the fifth,sixth and higher initiations who can work consciously with the potent buddhic“livingness” which permeates all Ashrams, though unrecognised by the averagedisciple.5. This Sirian influence was not recognised, and little of it was definitelyfocussed in the Hierarchy, until Christ came and revealed the love of God tohumanity. He is the expression, par excellence, of a Sirian initiation, and itis to that high place He will eventually go—no matter what duties orhierarchical obligations may take Him elsewhere between that time and now. TheBuddha was originally to have chosen the fourth Path but other plans confrontHim now and will probably claim His choice.6. Sanat Kumara is not on the Sirian line but—to speak in symbols, not toodeeply veiled—Lucifer, Son of the Morning, is closely related, and hence thelarge number of human beings who will become disciples in the Sirian Lodge. This[416] is the true “Blue Lodge,” and to become a candidate in that Lodge, theinitiate of the third degree has to become a lowly aspirant, with all the trueand full initiations awaiting him “within the sunshine of the major Sun.”7. None of the above facts indicates divergence of view between Shamballa andthe Hierarchy, nor do they signify cleavage or differing aims and goals. Thewhole subject is reflected in such minor relations on Earth as those between:> a. The Spiritual Triad and the Personality.> b. The mental unit and the manasic permanent atom.> c. Atma-Buddhi.> d. The Christ and the Buddha.The above somewhat uncorrelated items of information will give you a generalidea of the significant connection between our unimportant little planet andthat vast expression of divinity, the Life which is manifesting through Sirius;it is an expression which is organised and vital beyond anything man can visionand which is free to a completely unlimited extent, again beyond the power ofman to comprehend. The principle of freedom is a leavening energy which canpermeate substance in a unique manner; this divine principle represents anaspect of the influence which Sirius exerts on our solar system and particularlyon our planet. This principle of freedom is one of the attributes of Deity (likewill, love and mind) of which humanity knows as yet little. The freedom forwhich men fight is one of the lowest aspects of this cosmic freedom, which isrelated to certain great evolutionary developments that enable the life orspirit aspect to free itself from the impact, the contact and the influence ofsubstance.It is the principle of freedom which enables Sanat Kumara to dwell on the Earthand yet stand free from all contacts, except with Those Who have trodden thePath of Liberation and now stand free upon the cosmic physical plane; it is thatwhich enables the initiate to achieve a state of “isolated unity”; it is thatwhich lies behind the Spirit of Death and forms the motivating power of thatgreat releasing Agency; it is that which provides a “pathway of power” [417]between our Hierarchy and the distant sun, Sirius, and gives the incentivetowards the “culture of freedom” or of liberation which motivates the work ofthe Masters of the Wisdom; it is that which produced the ferment and the vortexof conflict in far distant ages and which has been recognised in the presentthrough the results of the Law of Evolution in every kingdom in nature; this isthat which “substands” or lies under or behind all progress. This mysteriously“exerted influence,” this “pulling away” from form (as we might simply call it),emanates from Sirius and for it we have no name; it is the law of which thethree cosmic laws—the Laws of Synthesis, of Attraction and of Economy—are onlyaspects. None of these three subsidiary laws imposes any rule or limitation uponthe Lord of the World. The Law of Freedom, however, does impose certainrestrictions, if one can use such a paradoxical phrase. It is responsible forHis being known as the “Great Sacrifice,” for (under the control of this law) Hecreated our planetary life and all that is within and upon it, in order to learnto wield this law with full understanding, in full consciousness, and yet at thesame time to bring release to the myriad forms of His creation.The Law of Economy affects humanity as a whole today throughout every phase ofits life; the Law of Attraction is beginning to gain some control, particularlyin the work which the Hierarchy undertakes to do; and many initiates and seniordisciples are becoming aware of the significance of the Law of Synthesis and arereacting to its impact. Later on, when moving to one of the seven Paths, theMaster will work with the Law of Freedom. This is not, as you may well surmise,its true name, for in the last analysis, freedom and liberation are effects ofits activity. This unique and mysterious law governs the Life and the Lives uponSirius, and it is to that unknown “sphere of functioning and intelligentactivity” what the Law of Economy is to our planet—the lowest of the lawscontrolling existence in planetary form.This Law of Economy includes, as you know from my earlier writings, many lesseror subsidiary laws; it might therefore be stated that this Law of Freedom alsodoes the [418] same. Until more divine attributes are realised as existing andrecognised as aspects, it is not possible for the name of the law which embodiesthe Law of Freedom to be given, for there is no word in our language adequatelyavailable. The above information will, however, link Sirius and our littleplanet, the Earth, in your minds.Masonry, as originally instituted far back in the very night of time and longante-dating the Jewish dispensation, was organised under direct Sirian influenceand modelled as far as possible on certain Sirian institutions and bearing aslight resemblance also to our hierarchical life—as seen in the light of theEternal Now. Its “Blue Lodge” with its three degrees is related to the threemajor groups of Lives on Sirius, for there are there no kingdoms of nature, suchas we possess; these groups receive all Those Who choose the fourth Path, andtrain Them in the mode of existence and the type of livingness which is found onSirius. This will make it plain to you that the least developed of the SirianLives are—from our standpoint—all of Them initiates of very high degree. Masonryis, therefore, connected in a peculiar way with the fourth Path. Down the ages,the Masonic tradition has been preserved, changing its nomenclature from time totime, reinterpreting its Words of Power, and consequently getting further andfurther removed from its original beauty and intent.The time has now come, under cyclic law and in preparation for the New Age, forcertain changes to be worked by Masons with spiritual understanding. The presentJewish colouring of Masonry is completely out of date and has been preserved fartoo long, for it is today either Jewish or Christian and should be neither. TheBlue Lodge degrees are entirely Jewish in phrasing and wording, and this shouldbe altered. The Higher Degrees are predominantly Christian, though permeatedwith Jewish names and words. This too should end. This Jewish colouring is todayone of the main hindrances to the full expression of Masonic intention andshould be changed, whilst preserving the facts and detail and structure of theMasonic symbolism intact. Whatever [419] form the new nomenclature will take(and this change will inevitably come), that too will pass away after dueservice rendered. Thus the cyclic transformation will proceed until such time asthe bulk of humanity, standing upon the fourth Path, will pass through theinitiatory process on Sirius, of which our E.A degree is a faint reflection.5. The Ray PathThe history of evolution upon the Earth, from the angle of humanity is one ofprogress, emphatic revolutionary decisions and climaxing crises. Without such ahistory we should not realise the progress made and the steady though gradualgrowth of sensitive response to environment, to contact and toimpressions—mental and spiritual. The history of evolution is in reality andfrom the occult point of view the history of the freeing of the spirit by themode of steadily developing forms which—in orderly unfoldment and at the demandof spirit—meet its requirements in any particular cycle and at every stage ofgrowth, consequent upon the response of substance to spiritual impact andimpression.This impact and this impression relate to the bringing together of substance andspirit, of form and matter, and is also closely connected with the cyclicappearance of the rays, with their varying ray influences, qualities andintentions , for they all contribute to the evolutionary process as they cyclein and out of manifested expression. It should be recognised that each ray Lord,whilst following His own path of development, has certain qualities to expressand certain aspects of life to unfold and manifest. The effect of theseintentions of the ray Lords or Lives upon our planet is, from Their angle,purely incidental and takes place without planning, being due to definitecyclic, circulatory and cosmic activities wherein They are eternally engaged.Their intention and purposes are not, therefore, in any way related tohumanity—a fact which men are apt to forget.It is, however, with these ray intentions that the Initiate of the sixth degreeis occupied when He passes on to the fifth or Ray Path. His decision and theintention of the ray [420] Lord at first, and the united intention of all ofThem eventually, are curiously and uniquely connected. The Master on this Pathworks at the comprehension of the intention and the life purposes of the rayLords. Many first ray souls find their way on to this Path, for there is a closeconnection between the decision at the sixth initiation and this fifth Path;this might be expected for two reasons: one, that every Master is on one of thethree major rays, and secondly, every Master has to develop an understanding ofthe world of cosmic Purpose. It is a connection based upon the use of the will;it is the will-to-power, the will-to-love and the will-to-know, plus the otherfour aspects of will (A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol III. Esoteric AstrologyPages 599-601) which form the elementary basis of the training given on thisfifth Path. Souls from other rays reach the same goal and occasionally choosethis Path, but it is not the one which constitutes for Them the line of leastresistance, as it often is for Masters on the first ray.Masters from the first ray and the second ray tread it often, and each of Themhas a different mode of approach, technique and type of realisation:1. First ray souls have to negate their “isolated unity” and study the beautyand value of differentiation. This period of training is followed by amysterious process called “multiple identification.” Note how the adjective hereconveys the many and the plural whilst the noun gives the concept of unity andthe singular. In these two words, apparently contradictory though esotericallysignificant, there is embodied one aspect of the initiation to be experienced onthis ray Path.2. The second ray Master who decides to go this way has to negate hisattractive, magnetic tendencies and learn the meaning of “isolated intentionwith a multiplicity of goals.” I know not how else to translate the archaicphrase which describes the objective of the Master's training on this Path. Theexclusive has to become the inclusive in an [421] entirely newly apprehendedworld of realisation, whilst the inclusive has to master the technique ofexclusiveness and become exclusive in a new realm of realisation; it is anexclusiveness which has in it no slightest element of the great heresy ofseparateness.I may not here even indicate the type or quality of the intentions of the rayLords which the Master of the sixth initiation has to learn to comprehend. Thetraining given Him ends in another tremendous decision which will place Him in agroup of Lives on some sacred planet or in some solar system which will be acorrespondence to Shamballa on our little planet. Shamballa embodies the will orpurpose of our planetary Logos. The goal which these initiates (trained on theray Path) eventually reach is some sphere of activity wherein sublime purposesand divine intentions are worked out.6. The Path the Logos Himself is onIt should be remembered as this peculiarly abstruse subject is approached thatthe Solar Logos is as far removed (in the evolutionary sense) from our planetaryLogos as the latter is from the point of attainment of an accepted disciple. Yetthe two are linked by a subjective unity and similarity of objective. At certainpoints upon the Way of the Higher Evolution Their two lines of energy meet andblend. Our Solar Logos also plays a peculiarly interesting part in thedevelopment of our entire planetary life. For the sake of clarity, yet at thesame time speaking symbolically, Sanat Kumara might be regarded as a personaldisciple of the Solar Logos, with all that that indicates of cosmicresponsibility.We had much difficulty in considering understandingly the path trodden by ThoseMasters Who decided to tread the Path of training for planetary Logoi. It istherefore far more difficult and practically impossible to say anything anentthis Path which is trodden by Those Great Beings Who are in training for SolarLogoi. Of These, Sanat Kumara [422] is One. Not all the planetary Logoi treadthe Path of Solar Logoi, for just as exalted positions await Them elsewhere inthe universe. Those Masters, as I have said in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire , Whotread this Path are rare indeed, and hitherto have had to enter this Path viathe angel or deva evolution and by transference then to the fifth or ray Path.Changes have however been made, and a Master can now pass on to this sixth Pathdirectly and without entering the deva evolution.This sixth Path is one on which the Masters in training have to work with thedevas who are so frequently the mobile agents of the creative process in solarcreation. The Masters Who enter upon this Path, eventually and as part of Theirtraining, enter the Council Chamber of some of the sacred planets, beforetransferring into the group which guides our Solar Logos; this in its turn isonly a temporary phase, though in both cases the time embraced may cover vastperiods, from the point of view of humanity. They work with principles unknownto us on Earth, though two of these principles will later be revealed; many ofthem are controlling factors on other spheres and in other planetary schemeswhich are more advanced than ours; the Master in training then acts as thecustodian of these “energetic principles” or as distributing agent; in this wayVenus was the custodian of what we call the principle of Mind and brought it asa pure gift to embryonic humanity.7. The Path of Absolute SonshipAs I have previously pointed out, not much can be given out concerning thismysterious Path which leads into a triangle (if I may so express it) formed ofthree lines of energy of differing and greatly varying vibratory effectiveness.This triangle is in the nature of an open door, presenting unique andunprecedented opportunity to Those Who discover this Path. Just as one of theseven Paths produced ultimately relationship to the Pleiades, so this Pathrelates our solar system to the constellation of the Great Bear. You have,therefore, the following triangle composed [423] of one stream of energyemanating from the Great Bear, another stream of energy issuing from the Heartof the Sun or from our Solar Logos, and the base line constituted of the sevenstreams of energy which come from our seven sacred planets. The potency and theeffectiveness of this triangle is therefore unique and apparent; it producesrelation between our system, our planets and the universe. This “open” trianglepresents opportunity to Those Lives Who, from the other side of the triangle tothat presented to our solar system and its contents, seek to help our solarsystem and bring the non-sacred planets to the point of liberation which istheir particular goal. Through this triangular door all the great Avatars enterour system and “find the Point where They can serve.”> [Image00004.jpg]The inflow of extra-solar energy is what produces the seven cosmic Paths. Thereis no such grouping as the seven solar Paths. In most cases, the Paths lead awayfrom our solar system altogether.If you will study the more abstruse teaching (more veiled and more symbolic thanthis) you will find certain statements made which—to the esotericist—will throwmuch light on the simpler presentations in this Treatise on the Seven Rays . Itis simpler because only those points are given which carry in them the germ ofpossible enlightenment to the general public. A Treatise on Cosmic Fire is notwritten for the general public; it is strictly a presentation of truth for theinitiated disciple. Its line is strictly a first ray and third ray presentation,whilst this Treatise is strictly a second ray approach . This is a statementwarranting careful thought, and one that has as yet received no recognition.[424]Among the changes necessitated by the abnormally rapid development of mankind,with its consequent stepping up of the qualities of disciples, is the fact thatno longer does the Master—faced at the sixth initiation with a stupendousdecision to make—enter upon the indicated Path entirely blindly, as heretofore.He is now given a revelation of the true united goal of the seven Paths andlikewise a vision of their varying intermediate, individual goals. Hence thename of the fifth initiation is that of the “Initiation of Revelation.” He canthus make His decision with opened eyes and unblinded by the glory.One point requires elucidation here. The whole standard of the mental equipmentof entering disciples is so much higher than it used to be, owing to the mentaland intuitive development of man, that this fact has forced correspondingchanges within the Hierarchy itself. The Masters Who are now moving forward onto the Path of the Higher Evolution are equally of much greater unfoldment; thewill aspect is present to a great degree (little as you may realise it), andthis is a new factor, conditioning much. Love and intelligence distinguished theMasters up to three hundred years ago. Love and intelligence and willdistinguish Them today. This again is another reason for the comprehensivechanges made and it is interesting to note that the bulk of the changes are dueto the response of men to the hierarchical work. It is humanity that has forcedthese events of so far-reaching a nature; mankind has also forced revelationswhich it had been believed could not be given to men for thousands of years oruntil the sixth rootrace had come into being. An instance of the expansion ofthe information given can be noted in connection with the second Path. Nothingis mentioned in my earlier presentation of the seven Paths in Initiation, Humanand Solar of a conditioning constellation. In A Treatise on Cosmic Fire, Imention that energy enters our system from an unknown source, via Gemini. Inthis latest contribution on the subject I mention that Libra, the Balances, isinvolved. Thus there are found on this Path of [425] Magnetic Work two blendedinfluences, those of Gemini and Libra. You have, therefore:> [Image00011.jpg]The dual energy of Gemini is brought to a point of balance by means of theinfluence of Libra, and this balanced and dual energy is released then into oursolar system. This entering stream of balanced energies forms the second Path. Ihave given you much information in the above statement.I have asked A.A.B. to incorporate at the close of this instruction a passagefrom A Treatise on Cosmic Fire , for this teaching anent the seven Paths is as aclimaxing comment. I shall not enlarge upon it, but if you have spiritualimagination and speculative ability you can comprehend much. I have also askedA.A.B. to add to this instruction the seven tabulations earlier given so as tocomplete and round out this triple presentation. I do not urge you to study orto give much time to the consideration of the seven paths. The treading of oneor other of those Paths lies far ahead of you, and it would be a waste of time.I would however remind you that every effort to live rightly, beautifully andusefully, to control the mind and to achieve loving understanding, lays thefoundation for right decision at the sixth initiation; some day you too willstand at this point of unique choice and it is what you do here and now whichwill determine the way which you will go.An Extract from A Treatise on Cosmic Fire , Pages 1243-1266The seven Paths, at a certain stage which may not be defined, become the fourPaths, owing to the fact that our solar system is one of the fourth order. Thismerging is [426] effected in the following way:The initiates upon Path I “fight their way” on to Path VI.The initiates upon Path II “alchemise themselves” on to Path VII.The initiates upon Path III through “piercing the veil” find Themselves uponPath V.This leaves Path IV to be accounted for. Upon this Path pass all those who,through devotion and activity combined, achieve the goal but who lack as yet thefull development of the manasic principle. This being the solar system oflove-wisdom or of astral-buddhic development, the fourth Path includes thelarger number of the sons of men. In the Hierarchy of our planet the “Lords ofCompassion” are numerically greater than the “Masters of the Wisdom.” The formermust therefore pass to the sun Sirius there to undergo a tremendous manasicstimulation, for Sirius is the emanating source of manas. There the mystic mustgo and become what is called “a spark of mahatic electricity.”These seven Paths are not concerned with nature or the balancing of the pairs ofopposites. They are concerned only with unity, with that which utilises thepairs of opposites as factors in the production of LIGHT.PATH I. EARTH SERVICE> Attributes . . . . . .

[428]The World Tension AnalysedThe tension in the world today, (written in April 1947) particularly in theHierarchy, is such that it will produce another and perhaps ultimate worldcrisis, or else such a speeding up of the spiritual life of the planet that thecoming in of the long looked-for New Age conditions will be amazingly hastened.I would have you consider carefully what I have said here, remembering what Ihave told you in the past anent points of tension. This present tensionconstitutes a major problem for the disciple in training, and therefore ourparticular theme in this instruction is peculiarly apposite.There is a great deal of glamour in the world today and a great deal of thatglamour is concentrated in Russia, owing to the youth and the basic politicalinexperience of that people. The United States of America is also young andinexperienced, but not to the same extent as are the Russian people. Today, theRussians are suffering from the glamour of power, the glamour of planning, theglamour of what they consider a great ideal (and such it is), the glamour ofprestige and the inevitable—but ephemeral—glamour of totalitarianism. It is thissame totalitarianism which also constitutes their weakest point, because itleads inexorably to a revolt of the human spirit. That human spirit is to befound in Russia to exactly the same extent as it is to be found in any othercountry in the world.Freedom is an essentially spiritual attribute, underlying the entireevolutionary process; this should always be remembered as a strengthening andconditioning reality by all men everywhere. It has survived aeons of oppositionfrom the principle of enslaving selfishness and is largely responsible, at thistime, for the struggle in which we are all participating.The country which is the most free from selfishness today is Great Britain; sheis experienced, old, and therefore mature in her thinking; she has learnt muchin a relatively short time and her judgment is sound. The most [429] selfishcountry in the world today is France, with the United States (though alongtotally different lines) running her a close second; both are materially selfishand capitalistically engrossed. Russia is also selfish but it is the selfishnessof a fanatical ideal, held by an immature, a too young a people. The selfishnessof the United States is also due to youth, but it will eventually yield toexperience and to suffering; there is—fortunately for the soul of this greatpeople—much suffering in store for the United States. The selfishness of Franceis less excusable; France too is old and experienced; again and again she hasbeen the victim of the armed forces of Germany and cries aloud to the worldabout it. France forgets that she frequently over-ran central Europe in theMiddle Ages, and the Napoleonic conquests are relatively modern history. Herevil destiny (as she regards it) does, nevertheless, give her the opportunity tobecome spiritual in her life and attitudes, instead of grossly andintellectually (though brilliantly) material. She has not yet learned herlesson, and as yet shows little inclination to do so. Strain, economicprivations and anxiety may teach her; the result will be stability.In the hands of the United States, Great Britain and Russia, and also in thehands of France, lies the destiny of the world disciple, Humanity. Humanity hasbeen passing through the tests which are preparatory to the first initiation;they have been hard and cruel and are not yet entirely over. The Lords of Karma(four in number) are today working through these four Great Powers; it is,however, a karma which seeks to liberate, as does all karma. In the comingcrisis, true vision and a new freedom, plus a wider spiritual horizon may beattained. The crisis, if rightly handled, need not again reach the ultimatehorror.The area of difficulty—as is well known—is the Near East and Palestine. TheJews, by their illegal and terroristic activities, have laid a foundation ofgreat difficulty for those who are seeking to promote world peace. As a Jewishmember of my Ashram pointed out (and I commend him on his soul vision), the Jewshave partially again opened the door [430] to the Forces of Evil, which workedoriginally through Hitler and his evil gang. The “sealing” of that door had notbeen successfully accomplished, and it is the part of wisdom to discover this intime. These Forces of Evil work through a triangle of evil, one point of whichis to be found in the Zionist Movement in the United States, another in centralEurope, and the third in Palestine. Palestine is no longer a Holy Land andshould not be so regarded.I would have you bear these points in mind while you investigate the worldpicture. This picture is taking shape and warrants recognition. It involves theJews (who are not a nation but a religious group) the Near East and Russia. Inthe maps which are to be found in the Archives of the spiritual Hierarchy, theentire area of the Near East and Europe—Greece, Yugoslavia, Turkey, Palestine,the Arab States, Egypt and Russia—are under a heavy overshadowing cloud. Canthat cloud be dissipated by the right thinking and planning of Great Britain,the United States and the majority of the United Nations or—must it break indisaster over the world? Will it present a task too hard for correct handling bythat inexperienced disciple—Humanity?In what I have written above you have the picture of the true situation; it isone which finds Great Britain temporarily weakened and ineffective (except forthe clear thinking of her people and her political maturity); it finds theUnited States, unused to power, somewhat arrogant, with a strong superioritycomplex, inexperienced and yet at the same time exceedingly well-intentioned andfundamentally sound. It is the mass of the people who are sound in theirthinking and not their representatives in Congress.It is not for me to tell you what will happen, although the Hierarchy knows.Humanity must (as must all disciples) be left entirely free to settle its owndestiny. Humanity has not yet learned the difficult lesson which all discipleshave to master: the lesson of the dual life of the man whose soul is functioningand whose physical brain is constantly aware of this fact.THE DUAL LIFE OF THE INITIATORY PROCESS[431] In all the many books which I have written, I have said relatively littleabout the brain and its relation to the personality and the soul. It is notpossible to enlarge at any length on that theme here, but I will make certainstatements without which this whole process of dual living would be mostdifficult to explain. I will sum up what I have to say in the form of threebasic statements:1. The brain is a most delicate receiving and transmitting apparatus:> a. It is responsive to information relayed to it, via the senses, from the> emotional plane and from the mind.> b. Through its medium the personal lower self becomes aware of its> environment, of the nature of its desires, and of its mental peculiarities, as> well as of the emotional states and the thoughts of the people contacted in> the environment.2. The brain is largely conditioned by the endocrine system, and this far morethan the endocrinologists would care to admit:> a. It is powerfully conditioned by three major glands which are found in close> relation to the brain substance. These are the pituitary body, the pineal> gland and the carotid gland.> b. These form a triangle, practically unrelated in primitive man, occasionally> related in average man, and closely related in the spiritual man.> c. These glands are objective correspondences of the three energy centres, by> means of which the soul, or the indwelling spiritual man, controls his> physical vehicle.> d. Where the relation is close between the three glands—as is increasingly the> case where disciples are concerned—a triangle of circulating energies is> always established.> e. This triangle, through the carotid gland in the [432] medulla oblongata,> becomes related to other glands and centres.3. The brain, as transmitter, becomes a powerful directing agency:> a. As a recipient and transmitter of pure energy or life it uses the carotid> gland controlled by the alta major centre, and establishes a close relation> with the heart and the heart centre.> b. As a recipient of mental energy or of energy from the soul, the ajna centre> becomes the directing agency; this is the centre which controls the pituitary> body.> c. These energies are received via the head centre, which controls the pineal> gland. Emotional energy enters the personality system via the solar plexus> centre, where it either controls or is transmuted and elevated.It is this triple mechanism in the head—both objective and subjective—which usesthe physical brain as a receiving agent and as a transmitting agent. It is thiswhich is brought into creative activity and thus under the control of thedisciple in training or in process of being prepared for initiation. I have nothitherto emphasised this, nor do I wish to do so, for it is not desirable forthe disciple or aspirant consciously and deliberately to deal with the mechanismin the head. Let him learn to control and consciously employ the mind; let himtrain his mind to receive communications from three sources:> The three worlds of ordinary living, thus enabling the mind to act as the> “common-sense.”> The soul, and thus consciously become the disciple, the worker in an Ashram,> illumined by the wisdom of the soul, and superseding gradually the knowledge> gained in the three worlds. That knowledge, rightly applied, becomes wisdom.> The Spiritual Triad, acting as the intermediary between the Monad and the> brain of the personality. This can eventually take place, because the soul and> personality [433] are fused and blended into one functioning unit, this> superseding again what we mean when we use the erroneous phrase “the soul.”> Duality then takes the place of the original triplicity.It has been necessary to make these somewhat elementary remarks and to clarifythese points, if there is to be true understanding as to what constitutes thedual life of the disciple or the Master, and wherein they differ.One of the tests of the initiatory process is a hitherto totally unexpected one.Tests which are expected and for which preparation has been made do notconstitute true tests in the real sense of the word, esoterically understood. Itis a test—imposed with increasing rigidity as initiation after initiation istaken—to see just how far the initiate is capable of retaining or preserving inhis brain consciousness the registered facts of several worlds or planes ofconsciousness; i.e., the three worlds of human endeavour and the world of soulconsciousness, or both of these and the world of the Ashram; or again these andthe activity of the Hierarchy itself, viewing it as a complete whole; or again,of all these and the world of Triadal experience, until the point is reachedwhere a straight continuity of consciousness can be registered and held whichcomes directly from the Council Chamber of the Lord of the World to ThoseMasters Who are functioning in a physical body and must therefore use a physicalbrain. In every single case the test (in order to be passed correctly) mustinvolve the brain consciousness; the facts, registered upon the subtler planes,must be correctly registered, recognised and interpreted simultaneously upon thephysical plane.You can see for yourselves that this is a major and most necessary indication ofa developing awareness; a Master has to be aware at any time on any plane and atwill. It will also be obvious to you that this will be a growing and anincreasing perception for which the intermediate stages, between initiations,prepare the initiate. Gradually, each one of the five senses, plus thecommon-sense (the mind), has to demonstrate the effectiveness of its highercorrespondence [434] and thus of a developing subtle apparatus. Through thisapparatus the initiate is put in touch with widening areas of the divine “stateof mind” or with the planetary consciousness, until “the mind that is in Christ”becomes truly the mind of the initiate, with all that those words entail ofmeaning and esoteric significance. Consciousness, Sensitivity, Awareness,Planetary Rapport, Universal Consciousness—these are the words which we mustconsider, sequentially developed and in their truly esoteric sense.You have here a wide and general picture, involving the goal, the means or mode,the testing point and the physical brain; these are four factors which havereceived little or no attention where initiation has been dealt with in theoccult writings. They are nevertheless of major importance. I am dealing withthem here because of the stage of development now reached by the human mind,because of their increasingly close relation to the physical brain, and becausethere are now so many aspirants ready to tread the Path of Discipleship, thePath of Initiatory Training. They are now in a position to work consciously atthe task of a dual and constant process of spiritual and physical recognitions.The Dual Life of the DiscipleI have divided this theme into two parts, owing to the fact that the dualismdisplayed by a Master and that demonstrated by a disciple are not identical orone and the same thing at advancing points of distinction. The subject, when youfirst approach it, seems of a relative simplicity, but a closer consideration ofit will present great and unexpected dissimilarities.In connection with the dual life of the disciple, the factors involved are thethreefold personality (with an awakening or onlooking consciousness centred orfocussed in the brain), the soul which seems at first the ultimate goal ofattainment but is later seen as simply a system or collection of fusingspiritual attributes, and the lowest aspect of the Spiritual Triad, the abstractmind. The disciple feels that, if he can attain the immediate and fusedconsciousness [435] of the three, he has attained; he realises also that thisinvolves the construction of the antahkarana. All these factors, for one who hasjust been admitted to the Path of Discipleship and who is just finding his placewithin an Ashram, seem an adequately difficult undertaking and one thatengrosses every power which he possesses.This, for the time being, is true and—until the third initiation—theseobjectives, their conscious fusion, plus a recognition of the divine planes ofawareness to which they all admit him, indicate the disciple's task and keep himfully occupied. To the recognitions entailed he has to add a growing capacity towork on the levels of consciousness involved, remembering always that a planeand a state of consciousness are synonymous terms, and that he is makingprogress, becoming aware, building the antahkarana, training as a hierarchicalworker within an Ashram, familiarising himself with new and opening spiritualenvironments, widening his horizon, stabilising himself upon the Path, andliving upon the physical plane the life of an intelligent man within the worldof men. He is demonstrating also no freakish peculiarities, but appears as a manof goodwill, of benevolent intelligence, of unalterable goodness, and of sternand unchangeable spiritual purpose. Is that enough of a goal for a disciple?Does it seem well-nigh impossible of accomplishment? Can you undertake such aproposition and make good your undertaking?Most assuredly you can, for the factor of time enters in and the disciple isfree to submit to its conditioning, particularly in the early stages of hisdiscipleship; this he usually does at first, knowing nothing else to do, but thespeed or the sattvic or rhythmic nature of the spiritual life eventually changesthis attitude; he then works with no true consciousness of time except as itaffects other people and his associates upon the physical plane.At first, his registration of that which is sensed or seen upon the subtlerplanes or the soul plane is slow; it takes time for contacts and for knowledgegained to penetrate from the higher levels to his physical brain. This fact(when [436] he discovers it) tends to upset his time-awareness, and the firststep is therefore taken on the path of timelessness, speaking symbolically. Hegains also the capacity to work with greater rapidity and mental coordinationthan does the average intelligent man; in this way he learns the limitations oftime as a brain condition, and learns also how to offset it and to work in sucha way that he does more within a set time limit than is possible to the averageman, no matter how ardently he may pursue the effort. The overcoming of time andthe demonstration of spiritual speed are indications that the dual life ofdiscipleship is superseding the integrated life of the personality, thoughleading in its turn to a still greater synthesis and higher integration.The dual life which all disciples lead produces also a rapidity of mentalinterpretation which is essential to the sane registration of the phenomenallife of the various higher planes and states of consciousness. Forget not thatall our planes are subplanes of the cosmic physical plane, and are thereforephenomenal in nature. As they are contacted and recorded and the knowledge istransmitted to the physical brain, via the mind, there must always accompanythem a true interpretation and a correct recognition of “things as they are.” Itis here that the non-disciple and the psychic go wrong, for their interpretationis almost always fundamentally in error, and it takes time (coming within thatcycle of limitation) intelligently to interpret and truly register what theperceiving consciousness has contacted. When the time factor no longer controls,the interpretations registered by the brain are infallibly correct. I have heregiven you a major piece of information.You will see, therefore, that in the earlier initiatory process, the factor oftime is noted by the initiate and also by the presenting Masters. An instance ofa slow permeation of information from the plane of initiation to the physicalbrain can be seen in the fact that very few aspirants and disciples register thefact that they have already taken the first initiation, the birth of the Christin the cave of the heart. That they have taken it is evidenced by theirdeliberate [437] treading of the Way, by their love of the Christ—no matter bywhat name they may call Him—and by their effort to serve and help theirfellowmen; they are still, however, surprised when told that the firstinitiation lies behind them. This is due entirely to the factor of time, leadingto their inability to “bring through” past events with accuracy, by a falsehumility as well (inculcated by the Christian Church, as it attempts to keeppeople subjugated by the sin idea), and by the intensely forward-lookinganticipatory consciousness of the average aspirant. When a true perspective anda balanced point of view have been attained, and some awareness of the EternalNow is beginning to penetrate into their understanding, then the past, thepresent and the future will be lost to sight in the consciousness of theinclusiveness of the moment that IS; then the limitations of time will be endingand the Law of Karma will be negated; it is at present so closely related topast and future. The dual life of the disciple will then be ended, giving placeto the cosmic dualism of the Master. The Master is free from the limitations oftime, though not of space, because space is an eternal Entity.You will see, therefore, the great necessity for a constant emphasis, at thisstage in the training of the average aspirant, on the need for alignment, or forthe creation of a channel of direct relation from the brain to the desired pointof contact. To this trained alignment must eventually be added the building ofthe antahkarana and its subsequent use in a growing system of alignments. Theantahkarana must be completed and direct contact must be established with theSpiritual Triad by the time the third initiation has been taken. Then followsthe fourth initiation with its destruction of the egoic, causal or soul body,owing to the complete fusion of soul and personality. The dual life of thedisciple ends.The Dual Existence of the MasterI would have you note here the difference between the two headings. I refer inone place to the dual life of the [438] disciple but in another to the dualexistence of the Master. That distinction is deliberate and intentional. Thedisciple lives in the three worlds and, until the third initiation, hedemonstrates his livingness strictly in relation to the soul and thepersonality, and therefore strictly to the phenomenal world and to the variouslevels of the dense cosmic physical plane.The Master functions on the plane of BEING and demonstrates the fact that Heeternally IS, that He exists as a divine aspect upon the formless levels of thecosmic etheric planes; this is a very different matter to the life of thedisciple and to which little attention has been paid. Existence, Being,Essential Life, Dynamic Energy, electric Fire are all of them distinctive of thehigher initiations; they produce basic distinctions between their constitutionand mode of life expression and that of those who live, who are in process ofbecoming, who express quality, and who fuse and blend solar fire and fire byfriction. Being and Existence are not the same as Becoming or of QualifiedAppearance. It is largely a question of emphases. A Master has synthesisedwithin Himself all for which the advancing disciple longs to express, all thatis possible as Expansion, plus an emphasis upon the dynamic life aspect, plus anability to stand immovable in pure Being. Here again I find it hard to expressthat for which no words are to be found.In the Master, all the divine aspects are proved capable of expression inaccordance with this particular time, in this particular round and chain(reverting to the old symbolism of The Secret Doctrine ) and through anyparticular racial expression. These divine characteristics—viewed from the angleof time and space—are shewn in a definitely relative form; later cycles and timeperiods will show these aspects in a still more perfected form. But therelativity of these matters does not really concern us, and the perfectionis—from the angle of the human disciple today—exactly what we understand byperfection. The Masters know, however, that a higher, deeper and more intensivemanifestation of divinity is potentially possible, but it causes Them no [439]concern or strain, no anxiety or fiery aspiration; They know, as no disciple canknow, the workings of the Law of Inevitability. This Law releases the Masters(under the accompanying Law of Service), at the sixth initiation, into a widerfield of experience, with all the divine assets and qualities so developedwithin Them that They know that Their equipment is adequate to the undertakingand that They can, without hesitancy and concern, take the next required steps.It is hard for the disciple—struggling with glamour and illusion—to realise thatthe higher initiations are free from all concern and from any emotional orself-centred reactions to the work which lies ahead or to the form side ofmanifestation; it is well-nigh impossible for the neophyte to vision a time whenhe will be free from all reactions engendered by life on the dense cosmicphysical planes and from all the limitations of life in the three worlds. Today,aspiration provides a constant source of anxious questioning, of painfuldeliberations and of high voltage spiritual ambition, with their consequentlimitations and moments of sensed failure and lack of achievement. The Masterhas left all this behind, knowing that even this so-called “spiritualresponsiveness” is a form of self-centred attitude. Eventually—and disciplesshould take courage and hope from this statement—all this agonising reaction tothe spiritual urge will be left behind. The Master knows the Law and is entirelyfree from any consideration of the time equation, as far as He Himself isconcerned. He only regards time as it may affect the working of the Plan in thethree worlds.The dual existence of the Master involves what we might call the two poles: thatof the monadic consciousness, whatever that may be, and that of the self-createdform which He may use as a member of the Hierarchy and a worker in the threeworlds of human enterprise. I would here remind you that there are many groupsand types of Masters, and most of Them are quite unknown to occult studentseither from Their work or from rumour or from knowledge of the many evolutionaryprocesses of which the human is only [440] one. Not all the Masters work in thethree worlds; not all the Masters need or possess physical bodies; not all theMasters “have Their faces turned towards the realm of dark light, but many facefor aeons towards the clear cold light of spiritual existence”; not all theMasters make or are required to make the sacrifices which work for the fourthkingdom in nature entails. Not all souls liberated or limited constitute theKingdom of God in the sense which that phrase conveys to us; that term islimited to the soul which informs units in the human family; not all the Masterswork under the great Buddha of Activity Who is responsible to Sanat Kumara forthe Plan working out in connection with Humanity. He works through the threeGreat Lords of the Eternal Ashram of Sanat Kumara, but His two Brothers haveEach of Them an equally important work and are responsible—as He is—to theCouncil Chamber. Each of Them also works through a triangle of energies withgrouped subsidiary forces working in seven departments and differentiated alsointo forty-nine lesser departments, as is the Ashram which we call theHierarchy. Forget not, there are many Hierarchies and the Human Hierarchy is butone.This whole theme is one of great complexity and yet at the same time so simplethat when the simplicity of the planetary constitution is truly grasped and theanalytic disputations of the concrete mind are overcome, the liberated Masterenters a world of spiritual endeavour which is free from forms and symbols orthe veils which hide the basic truth and the underlying mystery.Being is simple, free, unlimited and unimpeded and in that world the Mastermoves and works. Becoming is complex, imprisoning, limited and subjected tohindrances, and in that world the disciple and the lesser initiates live andmove and have their being. The Master works simultaneously in two worlds orstates of awareness; i.e., that related to pure existence, to the untrammelledlife of the planes controlled by the Monad, and also by the Hierarchy. Therenaught but the Plan engrosses His attention. He deals safely with “thesimplicity which is Shamballa” and its [441] sphere or aura of influence and“with the field of relationships which are nurtured from the Ashram of theChrist.” I am here quoting one of the Masters Who was endeavouring to explain toa disciple the simplicity of the life which a Master expresses."},{"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF THE ANTAHKARANAAs we enter on the consideration of “The dual life of the initiatory process ” Iwould call your attention to the wording used, and particularly to itssignificance in reference to the initiatory process. This deals, as we shallsee, not with the effort of the disciple to live simultaneously the life of thespiritual world and the practical life of physical plane service, but entirelywith the preparation of the disciple for initiation, and therefore with hismental life and attitudes.This statement might be regarded as concerning itself primarily with two majoraspects of his mental life and not with the life of relation between soul andpersonality. It is proper, consequently, to see a duality existing in theconsciousness of the disciple, and both of its aspects existing side by side:1. The life of awareness in which he expresses the soul attitude, soul awarenessand soul consciousness, through the medium of the personality upon the physicalplane; this he learns to register and express consciously.2. The intensely private and purely subjective life in which he—the soul-infusedpersonality—oriented upon the mental plane, brings into increasing rapport:> a. His lower concrete mind and the higher abstract mind.> b. Himself and the Master of his ray group, thus developing the ashramic> consciousness.> c. Himself and the Hierarchy as a whole, becoming increasingly aware of the> spiritual synthesis underlying the united Ashrams. He thus consciously and> steadily approaches the radiant Centre of this solar Ashram, the Christ> Himself, the first Initiator.[442] This inner life with its three slowly revealed objectives concernsessentially the life of preparation for initiation.There is no initiation for the disciple until he has begun consciously to buildthe antahkarana, thus bringing the Spiritual Triad and the mind as the highestaspect in the three worlds into a close relationship; later, he brings hisphysical brain into a position of a recording agent upon the physical plane,thus again demonstrating a clear alignment and a direct channel from theSpiritual Triad straight through to the brain via the antahkarana which haslinked the higher mind and the lower.This involves much work, much interpretive capacity and much power to visualise.I am choosing my words with care. This visualisation is not necessarilyconcerned with form and with concrete mental presentations; it is concerned witha pictorial and symbolic sensitivity which expresses interpretively thespiritual understanding, conveyed by the awakening intuition—the agent of theSpiritual Triad. The meaning of this becomes clearer as the work proceeds. It isdifficult for the man who is beginning the work of constructing the antahkaranato grasp the meaning of visualisation as it is seen to be related to a growingresponsiveness to that which the ashramic group conveys to him, to his emergingvision of the divine Plan as it exists in reality, and to that which iscommitted to him as the effect or the result of each successive initiation. Iprefer the word “effect” to the word “result,” for the initiate increasinglyworks consciously with the Law of Cause and Effect on planes other than thephysical. We use the word “result” to express the consequences of that greatcosmic Law as they demonstrate in the three worlds of human evolution.It is in connection with this effort that he discovers the value, uses andpurpose of the creative imagination. This creative imagination is all thatremains to him eventually of the active and intensely powerful astral life whichhe has lived for so many lives; as evolution proceeds, his astral body becomes amechanism of transformation, desire being transformed into aspiration andaspiration itself being transformed [443] into a growing and expressiveintuitive faculty. The reality of this process is demonstrated in the emergenceof that basic quality which has always been inherent in desire itself: theimaginative quality of the soul, implementing desire and steadily becoming ahigher creative faculty as desire shifts into ever higher states and leads toever higher realisations. This faculty eventually invokes the energies of themind, and the mind, plus the imagination, becomes in time a great invocative andcreative agent. It is thus that the Spiritual Triad is brought into rapport withthe threefold personality.I have told you in earlier writings that basically the astral plane isnon-existent as a part of the divine Plan; it is fundamentally the product ofglamour, of kama-manas—a glamour which humanity itself has created and in whichit has lived practically entirely since early Atlantean days. The effect of anincreasing soul contact has not simply been to dispel the mists of glamour, butit has also served to consolidate and to bring into effective use, therefore,the imagination with its overwhelmingly powerful creative faculty. This creativeenergy, when implemented by an illumined mind (with its thoughtform makingability), is then wielded by the disciple in order to make contacts higher thanwith the soul, and to bring into symbolic form that of which he becomes awarethrough the medium of a line of energy—the antahkarana—which he is steadily andscientifically creating.It might be said (equally symbolically) that at each initiation he tests theconnecting bridge and discovers gradually the soundness of that which he hascreated under the inspiration of the Spiritual Triad and with the aid of thethree aspects of his mind (the abstract mind, the soul or the Son of Mind, andthe lower concrete mind), combined with the intelligent cooperation of hissoul-infused personality. In the early stages of his invocative work, theinstrument used is the creative imagination. This enables him at the verybeginning to act as if he were capable of thus creating; then, when the as ifimaginative consciousness is no longer [444] useful, he becomes consciouslyaware of that which he has—with hope and spiritual expectancy—sought to create;he discovers this as an existent fact and knows past all controversy that “faithis the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.”Building the AntahkaranaWith the introductory teaching on the science of the Antahkarana we shall nothere deal, for the student will find it in the book, Education in the New Age.That preliminary presentation should be studied before taking up the moreadvanced stage which begins here. Let us now consider, step by step this sciencewhich is already proving a useful source of experiment and testing.The human soul (in contradistinction to the soul as it functions in its ownkingdom, free from the limitations of human life) is imprisoned and subject tothe control of the lower three energies for the major part of its experience.Then, upon the Path of Probation, the dual energy of soul begins to beincreasingly active, and the man seeks to use his mind consciously, and toexpress love-wisdom on the physical plane. This is a simple statement of theobjective of all aspirants. When the five energies are beginning to be used,consciously and wisely in service, a rhythm is then set up between thePersonality and the Soul. It is as if a magnetic field were then established andthese two vibrating and magnetic units, or grouped energies, swung into eachother's field of influence. This happens only occasionally and rarely in theearly stages; later it occurs more constantly, and thus a path of contact isestablished which eventually becomes the line of least resistance, “the way offamiliar approach,” as it is sometimes called. Thus is the first half of the“bridge,” the antahkarana, constructed. By the time the third initiation iscompleted, this Way is completed, and the initiate can “pass to higher worlds atwill, leaving the lower worlds far behind; or he can come again and pass uponthe way that leads from dark to light, from light to dark, and from the underlower worlds into the realms of light.” [445]Thus the two are one, and the first great union upon the Path of Return iscompleted. A second stage of the Way has then to be trodden, leading to a secondunion of still further importance in that it leads to complete liberation fromthe three worlds. It must be remembered that the soul, in its turn, is a unionof three energies of which the lower three are the reflection. It is a synthesisof the energy of Life itself (which demonstrates as the life-principle withinthe world of forms), of the energy of the intuition or spiritual love-wisdom orunderstanding (this demonstrates as sensitivity and feeling in the astral body),and spiritual mind, whose reflection in the lower nature is the mind or theprinciple of intelligence in the form world. In these three we have theatma-buddhi-manas of the theosophical literature—that higher triplicity which isreflected in the lower three, and which focusses through the soul body on thehigher levels of the mental plane before being precipitated into incarnation—asit is esoterically called.Modernising the concept, we might say that the energies which animate thephysical body and the intelligent life of the atom, the sensitive emotionalstates, and the intelligent mind, have eventually to be blended with andtransmuted into the energies which animate the soul. These are the spiritualmind, conveying illumination; the intuitive nature, conferring spiritualperception; and divine livingness.After the third initiation the “Way” is carried forward with great rapidity, andthe “bridge” is finished which links perfectly the higher spiritual Triad andthe lower material reflection. The three worlds of the Soul and the three worldsof the Personality become one world wherein the initiate works and functions,seeing no distinction, regarding one world as the world of inspiration and theother world as constituting the field of service, yet regarding both together asforming one world of activity. Of these two worlds, the subjective etheric body(or the body of vital inspiration) and the dense physical body are symbols onthe external plane.How is this bridging antahkarana to be built? Where [446] are the steps whichthe disciple must follow? I deal not here with the Path of Probation whereon themajor faults should be eliminated and whereon the major virtues should bedeveloped. Much of the instruction given in the past has laid down the rules forthe cultivation of the virtues and qualifications for discipleship, and also thenecessity for self-control, for tolerance and for unselfishness. But these areelementary stages and should be taken for granted by the students. Such studentsshould be occupied not only with the establishment of the character aspect ofdiscipleship, but with the more abstruse and difficult requirements for thosewhose eventual goal is initiation.It is with the work of the “bridge-builders” that we are concerned. First, letme assure you that the real building of the antahkarana takes place only whenthe disciple is beginning to be definitely focussed upon mental levels, and whentherefore his mind is intelligently and consciously functioning. He must beginat this stage to have some more exact idea than has hitherto been the case as tothe distinctions existing between the thinker, the apparatus of thought, andthought itself, beginning with its dual esoteric function which is:> 1. The recognition and receptivity to IDEAS.> 2. The creative faculty of conscious thoughtform building.This necessarily involves a strong mental attitude and reorientation of the mindto reality. As the disciple begins to focus himself on the mental plane (andthis is the prime intent of the meditation work), he starts working in mentalmatter and trains himself in the powers and uses of thought. He achieves ameasure of mind control; he can turn the searchlight of the mind in twodirections, into the world of human endeavour and into the world of soulactivity. Just as the soul makes a way for itself by projecting itself in athread or stream of energy into the three worlds, so the disciple beginsconsciously to project himself into the higher worlds. His energy goes forth,through the medium of the controlled and directed mind, into the world of thehigher [447] spiritual mind and into the realm of the intuition. A reciprocalactivity is thus set up. This response between the higher and the lower mind issymbolically spoken of in terms of light, and the “lighted way” comes into beingbetween the personality and the spiritual Triad, via the soul body, just as thesoul came into definite contact with the brain via the mind. This “lighted way”is the illumined bridge. It is built through meditation; it is constructedthrough the constant effort to draw forth the intuition, through subservienceand obedience to the Plan (which begins to be recognised as soon as theintuition and the mind are en rapport), and through a conscious incorporationinto the group in service and for purposes of assimilation into the whole. Allthese qualities and activities are based upon the foundation of good characterand the qualities developed upon the Probationary Path.The effort to draw forth the intuition requires directed occult (but notaspirational) meditation. It requires a trained intelligence, so that the lineof demarcation between intuitive realisation and the forms of the higherpsychism may be clearly seen. It requires a constant disciplining of the mind,so that it can “hold itself steady in the light,” and the development of acultured right interpretation, so that the intuitive knowledge achieved may thenclothe itself in the right thoughtforms.It might also be stated here that the construction of the bridge whereby theconsciousness can function with facility, both in the higher worlds and in thelower, is primarily brought about by a definitely directed life-tendency, whichsteadily sends the man in the direction of the world of spiritual realities,plus certain movements of planned and carefully timed and directed reorientationor focussing. In this last process the gain of the past months or years isclosely assessed; the effect of that gain upon the daily life and in the bodilymechanism is as carefully studied; and the will-to-live as a spiritual being isbrought into the consciousness with a definiteness and a determination thatmakes for immediate progress. [448]This building of the antahkarana is most assuredly proceeding in the case ofevery earnest student. When the work is carried on intelligently and with fullawareness of the desired purpose, and when the aspirant is not only aware of theprocess but alert and active in its fulfillment, then the work proceeds apaceand the bridge is built.It is wise to accept the fact that humanity is now in a position to begin thedefinite process of constructing the link or bridge between the various aspectsof man's nature, so that instead of differentiation there will be unity, andinstead of a fluid, moving attention, directed here and there into the field ofmaterial living and emotional relationships, we shall have learnt to control themind and to have bridged the divisions, and so can direct at will the lowerattention in any desired manner. Thus all aspects of man, spiritual and natural,can be focussed where needed.This bridging work has in part already been done. Humanity has as a wholealready bridged the gap between the emotional-astral nature and the physicalman. It should be noted here that the bridging has to be done in theconsciousness aspect, and concerns the continuity of man's awareness of life inall its various aspects. The energy which is used in connecting, inconsciousness, the physical man and the astral body is focussed in the solarplexus. Many today, speaking in symbolical terms, are carrying that bridgeforward and linking the mind with the two aspects already linked. This thread ofenergy emanates from or is anchored in the head. Some people, fewer of course innumber, are steadily linking the soul and the mind, which in its turn is linkedwith the other two aspects. The soul energy, when linked with the other threadshas its anchor in the heart. A very few people, the initiates of the world,having effected all the lower syntheses, are now occupied with bringing about astill higher union, with that triple Reality which uses the soul as its mediumof expression, just as the soul in its turn is endeavoring to use its shadow,the threefold lower man.These distinctions and unifications are matters of form, [449] symbols inspeech, and are used to express events and happenings in the world of energiesand forces, in connection with which man is definitely implicated. It is tothese unifications that we refer when the subject of initiation is underconsideration.It will be useful if we repeat here a few statements made in an earlier book:Students should train themselves to distinguish between the sutratma and theantahkarana , between the life thread and the thread of consciousness. The onethread is the basis of immortality and the other the basis of continuity. Hereinlies a fine distinction for the investigator. One thread (the sutratma) linksand vivifies all forms into one functioning whole, and embodies in itself thewill and the purpose of the expressing entity, be it man, God or a crystal. Theother thread (the antahkarana) embodies the response of the consciousness withinthe form to a steadily expanding range of contacts within the environing whole.One is the direct stream of life, unbroken and immutable, which can be regardedsymbolically as a direct stream of living energy flowing from the centre to theperiphery, and from the source to the outer expression, or the phenomenalappearance. It is the life . It produces the individual process and theevolutionary unfoldment of all forms.It is, therefore, the path of life, which reaches from the Monad to thepersonality, via the soul. This is the thread soul and it is one andindivisible. It conveys the energy of life and finds its final anchor in thecentre of the human heart and at some central focal point in all forms of divineexpression. Naught is and naught remains but life. The consciousness thread(antahkarana) is the result of the union of life and substance or of the basicenergies which constitute the first differentiation in time and space; thisproduces something different, which only emerges as a third divine manifestationafter the union of the basic dualities has taken place.The life thread, the silver cord or the sutratma is, as far as man is concerned,dual in nature. The life thread [450] proper, which is one of the two threadswhich constitute the sutratma, is anchored in the heart, whilst the otherthread, which embodies the principle of consciousness, is anchored in the head.This you already know, but this I feel the need to constantly reiterate. In thework of the evolutionary cycle, however, man has to repeat what God has alreadydone. He must himself create, both in the world of consciousness and of life.Like a spider, man spins connecting threads, and thus bridges and makes contactwith his environment, thereby gaining experience and sustenance. The spidersymbol is often used in the ancient occult books and the scriptures of India inconnection with this activity of the human being. These threads, which mancreates, are triple in number, and with the two basic threads which have beencreated by the soul, constitute the five types of energy which make man aconscious human being.The triple threads created by man are anchored in the solar plexus, the head andthe heart. When the astral body and the mind nature are beginning to function asa unit, and the soul also is consciously connected (do not forget that it isalways unconsciously linked), an extension of this five-fold thread—the basictwo and the human three—is carried to the throat centre, and when that occursman can become a conscious creator on the physical plane. From these major linesof energy lesser lines can radiate at will. It is upon this knowledge that allfuture intelligent psychic unfoldment must be based.In the above paragraph and its implications you have a brief and inadequatestatement as to the Science of the Antahkarana. I have endeavoured to expressthis in terms, symbolic if you will, which will convey a general idea to yourminds. We can learn much through the use of the pictorial and visualimagination. This bridging must take place:> 1. From the physical to the vital or etheric body. This is really an extension> of the life thread between the heart and the spleen.> 2. From the physical and the vital, regarding them as a [451] unity, to the> astral or emotional vehicle. This thread emanates from, or is anchored in, the> solar plexus, and is carried upwards, by means of the aspiration, till it> anchors itself in the love petals of the egoic Lotus.> 3. From the physical and astral vehicles to the mental body. One terminus is> anchored in the head, and the other in the knowledge petals of the egoic> Lotus, being carried forward by an act of the will.Advanced humanity is in process of linking the three lower aspects, which wecall the personality, with the soul itself, through meditation, discipline,service and directed attention. When this has been accomplished, a definiterelation is established between the sacrifice or will petals of the egoic Lotusand the head and heart centres, thus producing a synthesis betweenconsciousness, the soul and the life principle. The process of establishing thisinter-linking and inter-relation, and the strengthening of the bridge thusconstructed, goes on until the Third Initiation. The lines of force are then sointer-related that the soul and its mechanism of expression are a unity. Ahigher blending and fusing can then go on.I can perhaps indicate the nature of this process in the following manner: Ihave stated here and elsewhere that the soul anchors itself in the body at twopoints:> 1. There is a thread of energy, which we call the life or spirit aspect,> anchored in the heart. It uses the blood stream, as is well known, as its> distributing agency, and through the medium of the blood, life energy is> carried to every part of the mechanism. This life energy carries the> re-generating power and coordinating energy to all the physical organisms and> keeps the body “whole.”> 2. There is a thread of energy, which we call the consciousness aspect or the> faculty of soul knowledge, anchored in the centre of the head. It controls> that response mechanism which we call the brain, and through its medium it> directs activity and induces awareness throughout the body by means of the> nervous system. [452]These two energy factors, which are recognised by the human being as knowledgeand life, or as intelligence and living energy, are the two poles of his being.The task ahead of him now is to develop consciously the middle or balancingaspect, which is love or group relationship . (See Education in the New Age,pages 26-27, 32-33, 92.)The Nature of the AntahkaranaOne of the difficulties connected with this study of the antahkarana is the factthat hitherto the work done upon the antahkarana has been entirely unconscious.Therefore, the concept in men's minds relating to this form of creative work andthis construction of the bridge meets at first with little response from themind nature; also, in order to express these ideas, we have practically tocreate a new terminology, for there are no words suitable to define our meaning.Just as modern sciences have evolved a complete new terminology of their ownduring the past forty years, so this science must develop its own peculiarvocabulary. In the meantime, we must do the best we can with the words at ourdisposal.The second point I would make is to ask those who are studying along these linesto realise that in time they will arrive at understanding, but that at presentall that they can do is to depend upon the unalterable tendency of thesubconscious nature to penetrate to the surface of consciousness as a reflexactivity in the establishing of continuity of consciousness. This reflexactivity of the lower nature corresponds to the development of continuitybetween the superconscious and the consciousness which develops upon the Path ofDiscipleship. It is all a part—in three stages—of the integrating process,proving to the disciple that all of life is (in terms of consciousness) one ofrevelation . Ponder on this.Another of the difficulties in considering any of these esoteric sciences thatdeal with what has been called the “conscious unfoldment of the divinerecognitions” (which is true awareness) is the ancient habit of humanity tomaterialise [453] all knowledge. Everything man learns is applied—as thecenturies pass—to the world of natural phenomena and of natural process, and notto the recognition of the Self, the Knower, the Beholder, the Observer. When,therefore, man enters upon the Path, he has to educate himself in the process ofusing knowledge in reference to the conscious self-aware Identity, or to theself-contained, self-initiating Individual. When he can do this, he istransmuting knowledge into wisdom.Previously I spoke of “knowledge-wisdom” which are words synonymous with“force-energy.” Knowledge used is force expressing itself; wisdom used is energyin action. In these words you have the expression of a great spiritual law, onewhich you would do well to consider carefully. Knowledge-force concerns thepersonality and the world of material values; wisdom-energy expresses itselfthrough the consciousness thread and the creative thread, as they constitute inthemselves a woven dual strand. They are (for the disciple) a fusion of the past(consciousness thread) and the present (the creative thread), and together theyform what is usually called, upon the Path of Return, the Antahkarana. This isnot entirely accurate. The wisdom-energy thread is the sutratma or life thread,for the sutratma (when blended with the consciousness thread) is again alsocalled the antahkarana . Perhaps it might clarify the issue somewhat if Ipointed out that though these threads eternally exist in time and space, theyappear distinct and separate until a man is a probationary disciple, andtherefore becoming conscious of himself and not only of the not-self. There isthe life thread or sutratma and the consciousness thread—the one anchored in theheart and the other in the head. Throughout all the past centuries, the creativethread, in one or other of its three aspects, has been slowly woven by the man;of this fact in nature his creative activity during the past two hundred yearsis an indication, so that today the creative thread is a unity, generallyspeaking, as regards humanity as a whole and specifically of the individualdisciple, and forms a strong closely woven thread upon the mental plane. [454]These three major threads which are in reality six, if the creative thread isdifferentiated into its component parts, form the antahkarana. They embody pastand present experience and are so recognised by the aspirant. It is only uponthe Path itself that the phrase “building the antahkarana” becomes accurate andappropriate. It is in this connection that confusion is apt to arise in the mindof the student. He forgets that it is a purely arbitrary distinction of thelower analysing mind to call this stream of energy the sutratma, and anotherstream of energy the consciousness thread and a third stream of energy thecreative thread. They are essentially, all three of them together, theantahkarana in process of forming. It is equally arbitrary to call the bridgewhich the disciple builds from the lower mental plane—via the egoic, centralvortex of force—the antahkarana. But for purposes of comprehending study andpractical experience, we will define the antahkarana as the extension of thethreefold thread (hitherto woven unconsciously, through life experimentation andthe response of consciousness to environment) through the process of projectingconsciously the triple blended energies of the personality as they are impulsedby the soul, across a gap in consciousness which has hitherto existed. Twoevents can then occur:> 1. The magnetic response of the Spiritual Triad (atma-buddhi-manas), which is> the expression of the Monad, is evoked. A triple stream of spiritual energy is> slowly projected towards the egoic lotus and towards the lower man.> 2. The personality then begins to bridge the gap which exists on its side> between the manasic permanent atom and the mental unit, between the higher> abstract mind and the lower mind.Technically, and upon the Path of Discipleship, this bridge between thepersonality in its three aspects and the monad and its three aspects is calledthe antahkarana.This antahkarana is the product of the united effort of soul and personality,working together consciously to produce [455] this bridge. When it is completed,there is a perfect rapport between the monad and its physical plane expression,the initiate in the outer world. The third initiation marks the consummation ofthe process, and there is then a straight line of relationship between the monadand the lower personal self. The fourth initiation marks the completerealisation of this relation by the initiate. It enables him to say: “I and myFather are one.” It is for this reason that the crucifixion, or the GreatRenunciation, takes place. Forget not that it is the soul that is crucified. Itis Christ Who “dies.” It is not the man; it is not Jesus. The causal bodydisappears. The man is monadically conscious. The soul-body no longer serves anyuseful purpose; it is no more needed. Nothing is left but the sutratma,qualified by consciousness—a consciousness which still preserves identity whilstmerged in the whole. Another qualification is creativity; thus consciousness canbe focussed at will on the physical plane in an outer body or form. This body iswill-created by the Master.But in this task of unfoldment, of evolution and of development, the mind of manhas to understand, analyse, formulate and distinguish; therefore the temporarydifferentiations are of profound and useful importance. We might thereforeconclude that the task of the disciple is:> 1. To become conscious of the following situations (if I may use such a word):> a. Process in combination with force.> b. Status upon the path, or recognition of the available qualifying agencies,> or energies.> c. Fusion or integration of the consciousness thread with the creative thread> and with the life thread.> d. Creative activity. This is essential, for it is not only through the> development of creative ability in the three worlds that the necessary focal> point is created, but this also leads to the building of the antahkarana, its> “creation.”> [Image00001.jpg]> 2. To construct the antahkarana between the Spiritual Triad and the> personality—with the cooperation of the [456] soul. These three points of> divine energy might be symbolised thus:> [Image00005.jpg]In this simple symbol you have a picture of the disciple's task upon the Path.Another diagram may serve to clarify:See DiagramIn these you have the “nine of initiation” or the transmuting of nine forcesinto divine energies: [457]The Bridge between the three Aspects of the MindThere is one point which I would like to clarify if I can, for—on thispoint—there is much confusion in the minds of aspirants, and this is necessarilyso.Let us for a moment, therefore, consider just where the aspirant stands when hestarts consciously to build the antahkarana. Behind him lie a long series ofexistences, the experience of which has brought him to the point where he isable consciously to assess his condition and arrive at some understanding of hispoint in evolution. He can consequently undertake—in cooperation with hissteadily awakening and focussing consciousness—to take the next step, which isthat of accepted discipleship. In the present, he is oriented towards the soul;he, through meditation and the mystical experience, does have occasional contactwith the soul, and this happens with increasing frequency; he is becomingsomewhat creative upon the physical plane, both in his thinking and in hisactions; at times, even if rarely, he has a genuine intuitive experience. Thisintuitive experience serves to anchor the “first tenuous thread spun by theWeaver in fohatic enterprise,” as the Old Commentary puts it. It is the firstcable, projected from the Spiritual Triad in response to the emanation of thepersonality, and this is the result of the growing magnetic potency of boththese aspects of the Monad in manifestation.It will be obvious to you that when the personality is becoming adequatelymagnetised from the spiritual angle, its note or sound will go forth and willevoke response from the soul on its own plane. Later the personality note andthe soul note in unison will produce a definitely attractive effect upon theSpiritual Triad. This Spiritual Triad in its turn has been exerting anincreasingly magnetic effect upon the personality. This begins at the time ofthe first conscious soul contact. The response of the Triad is transmittednecessarily, in this early stage, via the sutratma and produces inevitably theawakening of the head centre. That is why the heart doctrine begins to supersedethe doctrine of the eye. [458] The heart doctrine governs occult development;the eye doctrine—which is the doctrine of the eye of vision—governs the mysticalexperience; the heart doctrine is based upon the universal nature of the soul,conditioned by the Monad, the One, and involves reality; the eye doctrine isbased on the dual relation between soul and personality. It involves thespiritual relationships, but the attitude of dualism or of the recognition ofthe polar opposites is implicit in it. These are important points to remember asthis new science becomes more widely known.The aspirant eventually arrives at the point where the three threads—of life, ofconsciousness and of creativity—are being focussed, recognised as energystreams, and utilised deliberately by the aspiring disciple upon the lowermental plane. There—esoterically speaking—”he takes his stand, and lookingupward sees a promised land of beauty, love and future vision.”But there exists a gap in consciousness , though not in fact. The sutratmicstrand of energy bridges the gap, and tenuously relates monad, soul andpersonality. But the consciousness thread extends only from soul topersonality—from the involutionary sense. From the evolutionary angle (using aparadoxical phrase) there is only a very little conscious awareness existingbetween the soul and the personality, from the standpoint of the personalityupon the evolutionary arc of the Path of Return. A man's whole effort is tobecome aware of the soul and to transmute his consciousness into that of thesoul, whilst still preserving the consciousness of the personality. As thefusion of soul and personality is strengthened, the creative thread becomesincreasingly active, and thus the three threads steadily fuse, blend, becomedominant, and the aspirant is then ready to bridge the gap and unite theSpiritual Triad and the personality, through the medium of the soul. Thisinvolves a direct effort at divine creative work. The clue to understanding liesperhaps in the thought that hitherto the relation between soul and personalityhas been steadily carried forward, primarily by the soul, as it stimulated thepersonality [459] to effort, vision and expansion. Now—at this stage—theintegrated, rapidly developing personality becomes consciously active, and (inunison with the soul) starts building the antahkarana—a fusion of the threethreads and a projection of them into the “higher wider reaches” of the mentalplane, until the abstract mind and the lower concrete mind are related by thetriple cable.It is to this process that our studies are related; earlier experience inrelation to the three threads is logically regarded as having occurred normally.The man now stands, holding the mind steady in the light; he has some knowledgeof meditation, much devotion, and also recognition of the next step. Knowledgeof process gradually becomes clearer; a growing soul contact is established;occasional flashes of intuitive perception from the Triad occur. All theserecognitions are not present in the case of every disciple; some are present;some are not. I am seeking to give a general picture. Individual application andfuture realisation have to be worked out by the disciple in the crucible ofexperience.The goal towards which the average disciple has worked in the past has been soulcontact, leading eventually to what has been called “hierarchical inclusion.”The reward of the disciple's effort has been admittance into the Ashram of someMaster, increased opportunity to serve in the world, and also the taking ofcertain initiations. The goal towards which higher disciples are workinginvolves not only soul contact as its primary objective (for that has to somemeasure been attained), but the building of the bridge from the personality tothe Spiritual Triad, with consequent monadic realisation and the opening up tothe initiate of the Way to the Higher Evolution in its various branches and withits differing goals and objectives. The distinction (I said not “difference,”and would have you note this) between the two ways can be seen in the followinglisted comparisons: [460] Desire—Aspiration Mind—Projection The 1st and 2nd Initiations The 3rd and4th Initiations Universal Love and Intuition Universal Will and Mind The Pathof Light The Way of the Higher Evolution The Point of Contact The Antahkaranaor Bridge The Plan The Purpose The Three Layers of the Egoic Petals TheSpiritual Triad The Hierarchy Shamballa The Master's Ashram The CouncilChamber The Seven Paths The Seven PathsIn reality, you have here the two major approaches to God or to the DivineWhole, both merging at the time of the fifth initiation in the one Way, which initself combines all Ways. Forget not a statement which I have several timesmade, that the four minor rays must merge eventually into the third ray, andthat all five must then finally merge into the second and the first rays; bearalso in mind that all these rays or modes of Being are aspects or sub-rays ofthe second cosmic Ray of Love and of Fire.I would like here also to point out some further relationships. You know wellthat upon the mental plane the three aspects of mind, or the three focal pointsof mental perception and activity, are to be found:1. The lower concrete mind . This expresses itself most completely through thefifth Ray of Concrete Science, reflecting the lower phase of the will aspect ofdivinity and summarising within itself all knowledge as well as the egoicmemory. This lower concrete mind is related to the knowledge petals of the egoiclotus and is capable of pronounced soul illumination, proving eventually to bethe searchlight of the soul. It can be brought under control through theprocesses of concentration. It is transient in time and space. Throughconscious, creative work, it can be related to the manasic permanent atom or tothe abstract mind.2. The Son of Mind. This is the soul itself, governed by the second aspect ofall the seven rays—a point I would ask you seriously to register. It reflectsthe lower phase of the love aspect of divinity and summarises in itself theresults of all accumulated knowledge which is wisdom, illuminated [461] by thelight of the intuition. Another way of expressing this is to describe it aslove, availing itself of experience and knowledge. It expresses itself mostfully through the love petals of its innate being. Through dedicated and devotedservice it brings the divine Plan into activity in the three worlds of humanaccomplishment. It is therefore related to the second aspect of the SpiritualTriad and is brought into functioning activity through meditation. It thencontrols and utilises for its own spiritual ends the consecrated personality,via the illumined mind, referred to above. It is eternal in time and space.3. The abstract mind. This reveals itself most completely under the influence ofthe first Ray of Will or Power, reflecting the higher aspect of the will ofdivinity or of the atmic principles it summarises in itself when fully developedthe purpose of Deity, and thus becomes responsible for the emergence of thePlan. It energises the will petals until such time as the eternal life of thesoul is absorbed into that which is neither transient nor eternal but which isendless, boundless and unknown. It is brought into conscious functioning throughthe building of the antahkarana. This “radiant rainbow bridge” unites theillumined personality, focussed in the mind body, motivated by the love of thesoul, with the Monad or with the One Life, and thus enables the divinemanifesting Son of God to express the significance of the words: God is Love andGod is a consuming Fire. This fire, energised by love, has burnt out allpersonality qualities, leaving only a purified instrument, coloured by the soulray and no longer necessitating the existence of a soul body. The personalityhas by this time completely absorbed the soul, or to put it perhaps moreaccurately, both soul and personality have been fused and blended into oneinstrument for the use of the One Life.This is but a picture or a symbolic use of words in order to express theunifying goal of material and spiritual evolution, as it is carried to itsconclusion—for this world cycle—through the development of the three aspects ofmind upon [462] the mental plane. The cosmic implications will not be lost toyou, but it profits us not to dwell upon them. As this process is carriedforward, three great aspects of divine manifestation emerge upon the theatre ofworld life and on the physical plane. These are Humanity, the Hierarchy andShamballa.Humanity is already the dominant kingdom in nature; the fact of the Hierarchyand of its imminent approach into physical appearance is becoming well known tohundreds of thousands of people today. Its recognised appearance will later setthe stage for the needed preparatory phases which will finally lead to theexoteric rule of the Lord of the World, emerging from His aeonial seclusion inShamballa, and coming forth into outer expression at the end of this worldcycle.Here is the vast and necessary picture, presented in order to give reason andpower to the next stage of human evolution.The point which I seek to emphasise is that only when the aspirant takes hisstand with definiteness upon the mental plane, and keeps his “focus ofawareness” increasingly there, does it become possible for him to make realprogress in the work of divine bridge building, the work of invocation, and theestablishing of a conscious rapport between the Triad, the soul and thepersonality. The period covered by the conscious building of the antahkarana isthat from the final stages of the Path of Probation to the third initiation.In considering this process it is necessary, in the early stages, to recognisethe three aspects of the mind as they express themselves upon the mental planeand produce the varying states of consciousness upon that plane. It isinteresting here to note that, having reached the developed human stage(integrated, aspiring, oriented and devoted), the man stands firmly upon thelower levels of that mental plane; he is then faced by the seven subplanes ofthat plane with their corresponding states of consciousness. He is thereforeentering upon a new cycle where—this time equipped with fullself-consciousness—he has seven states of mental awareness [463] to develop;these are all innate or inherent in him, and all (when mastered) lead to one orother of the seven major initiations. These seven states of consciousnessare—beginning from the first or lowest:Mental Plane1. Lower mental awareness. The development of true mental perception.2. Soul awareness or soul perception. This is not the perception of the soul bythe personality, but the registering of that which the soul perceives by thesoul itself. This is later registered by the lower mind. This soul perceptionis, therefore, the reversal of the usual attitude of mind.3. Higher abstract awareness. The unfoldment of the intuition and therecognition of intuitive process by the lower mind.Buddhic Plane4. Persistent, conscious, spiritual awareness. This is the full consciousness ofthe buddhic or intuitional level. This is the perceptive consciousness which isthe outstanding characteristic of the Hierarchy. The life focus of the manshifts to the buddhic plane. This is the fourth or middle state ofconsciousness.Atmic Plane5. The consciousness of the spiritual will as it is expressed and experiencedupon atmic levels or upon the third plane of divine manifestation. There islittle that I can say about this condition of awareness; its state of nirvanicawareness can mean but little to the average disciple.Monadic Plane6. The inclusive awareness of the Monad upon its own plane, the second plane ofour planetary and solar life.Logoic Plane7. Divine consciousness. This is the awareness of the whole on the highest planeof our planetary manifestation. This is also an aspect of solar awareness uponthe same plane.As we strive to arrive at some dim comprehension of the nature of the work to bedone in building the antahkarana it might be wise, as a preliminary step, toconsider the nature [464] of the substance out of which the “bridge of shiningmind stuff” has to be built by the conscious aspirant. The oriental term forthis “mind stuff” is chitta; it exists in three types of substance, allbasically identical but all qualified or conditioned differently. It is afundamental law in this solar system, and therefore in our planetary lifeexperience, that the substance through which divinity (in time and space)expresses itself is karmically conditioned; it is impregnated by those qualitiesand aspects which are the product of earlier manifestations of that Being inWhom we live and move and have our being. This is the basic fact lying behindthe expression of that Trinity or Triad of Aspects with which all the worldreligions have made us familiar. This trinity is as follows: 1. The Father Aspect This is the underlying Plan of God. The WillAspect. The essential Cause of Being. Purpose. Life purpose, motivatingevolution. The note of synthetic sound. Utilises the sutratma 2. The SonAspect. The quality of sensitivity. The Love Aspect. The nature ofrelationship. Wisdom. Understanding. The method of evolution. Consciousness. Soul. The note of attractive sound. Utilises theconsciousness thread 3. The Mother Aspect The intelligence of substance. The Intelligence Aspect. The nature of form. The Holy Spirit. Responseto evolution. The note of Nature. Develops the creative threadThe mental plane which must be bridged is like a great stream of consciousnessor of conscious substance, and across this stream the antahkarana must beconstructed. This is the concept which lies behind this teaching and behind thesymbolism of the Path. Before a man can tread the Path, he must become that Pathhimself. Out of the substance of his own life he must construct this rainbowbridge, this Lighted Way. He spins it and anchors it as a spider spins a thread[465] along which it can travel. Each of his three divine aspects contributes tothat bridge, and the time of this building is indicated when his lower natureis:> 1. Becoming oriented, regulated and creative.> 2. Recognising and reacting to soul contact and control.> 3. Sensitive to the first impression of the Monad. This sensitivity is> indicated where there is:> a. Submission to the “will of God” or of the greater Whole.> b. Unfoldment of the inner spiritual will, overcoming all obstacles.> c. Cooperation with the purpose of the Hierarchy, the interpreting will of God> as expressed in love.I have enumerated these three responses to the totality of the divine aspectsbecause they are related to the antahkarana and must become defined andconditioned upon the mental plane. They are there to be found expressingthemselves in substance:> 1. The lower concrete mind.> The receptive common sense.> The highest aspect of the form nature.> The reflection of atma, the spiritual will.> The throat centre.> Knowledge.> 2. The individualised mind.> The soul or spiritual ego.> The middle principle. Buddhi-manas.> The reflection in mental substance of the Monad.> Spiritual love-wisdom.> The heart centre.> Love.> 3. The higher abstract mind.> The transmitter of buddhi.> The reflection of the divine nature.> Intuitive love, understanding, inclusiveness.> The head centre.> Sacrifice.[466] There are necessarily other arrangements of these aspects inmanifestation, but the above will serve to indicate the relation ofMonad-soul-personality as they express themselves through certain focussedstations or points of power upon the mental plane.In humanity, however, the major realisation to be grasped at the present pointin human evolution is the need to relate—consciously and effectively—thespiritual Triad, the soul on its own plane and the personality in its three-foldnature. This is done through the creative work of the personality, the magneticpower of the Triad, and the conscious activity of the soul, utilising the triplethread.You can see, therefore, why so much emphasis is laid by esotericists uponfusion, unity or blending; only when this is intelligently realised can thedisciple begin to weave the threads into a bridge of light which eventuallybecomes the Lighted Way across which he can pass into the higher worlds ofbeing. Thus he liberates himself from the three worlds. It is—in this worldcycle—pre-eminently a question of fusion and expressing (in full wakingawareness) three major states of consciousness:> 1. The Shamballa Consciousness.> Awareness of the unity and purpose of Life.> Recognition and cooperation with the Plan.> Will. Direction. Oneness.> The influence of the Triad.> 2. The Hierarchical Consciousness .> Awareness of the Self, the Soul.> Recognition and cooperation with divinity.> Love. Attraction. Relation.> The influence of the Soul.> 3. The Human Consciousness.> Awareness of the soul within the form.> Recognition and cooperation with the soul.> Intelligence. Action. Expression.> The influence of the consecrated personality.The man who finally builds the antahkarana across the mental [467] planeconnects or relates these three divine aspects, so that progressively at eachinitiation they are more closely fused into one divine expression in full andradiant manifestation. Putting it in other words, the disciple treads the pathof return, builds the antahkarana, crosses the Lighted Way, and achieves thefreedom of the Path of Life.One of the points which it is essential that students should grasp is the deeplyesoteric fact that this antahkarana is built through the medium of a consciouseffort within consciousness itself , and not just by attempting to be good, orto express goodwill, or to demonstrate the qualities of unselfishness and highaspiration. Many esotericists seem to regard the treading of the Path as theconscious effort to overcome the lower nature and to express life in terms ofright living and thinking, love and intelligent understanding. It is all that,but it is something far more . Good character and good spiritual aspiration arebasic essentials. But these are taken for granted by the Master Who has adisciple under training; their foundation and their recognition and developmentare the objectives upon the Path of Probation.But to build the antahkarana is to relate the three divine aspects. Thisinvolves intense mental activity; it necessitates the power to imagine and tovisualise, plus a dramatic attempt to build the Lighted Way in mental substance.This mental substance is—as we have seen—of three qualities or natures, and thebridge of living light is a composite creation, having in it:> 1. Force, focussed and projected from the fused and blended forces of the> personality.> 2. Energy, drawn from the egoic body by a conscious effort.> 3. Energy, abstracted from the Spiritual Triad.It is essentially, however, an activity of the integrated and dedicatedpersonality. Esotericists must not take the position that all they have to do isto await negatively some activity by the soul which will automatically takeplace after a certain measure of soul contact has been achieved, and thatconsequently and in time this activity will evoke response [468] both from thepersonality and the Triad. This is not the case. The work of the building of theantahkarana is primarily an activity of the personality, aided by the soul; thisin time evokes a reaction from the Triad. There is far too much inertiademonstrated by aspirants at this time.One might also look at this matter from another angle. The personality isbeginning to transmute knowledge into wisdom, and when this takes place thefocus of the personality life is then upon the mental plane, because thetransmutation process (with its stages of understanding, analysis, recognitionand application) is fundamentally a mental process. The personality is alsobeginning to comprehend the significance of love and to interpret it in terms ofthe group well-being, and not in terms of the personal self, of desire or evenof aspiration. True love is rightly understood only by the mental type who isspiritually oriented. The personality is also arriving at the realisation thatthere is in reality no such thing as sacrifice. Sacrifice is usually only thethwarted desire of the lower nature, willingly endured by the aspirant, but—inthis phase—a misinterpretation and limitation. Sacrifice is really completeconformity to the will of God because the spiritual will of the man and thedivine will (as he recognises it in the Plan) is his will. There is a growingidentification in purpose. Therefore, self-will, desire and those intelligentactivities which are dually motivated are seen and recognised as only the lowerexpression of the three divine aspects, and the effort is to express these interms of the soul and not, as hitherto, in terms of a dedicated and rightlyoriented personality. This becomes possible in its true sense only when thefocus of the life is in the mental vehicle and the head as well as the heart isbecoming active. In this process, the stages of character building are seen asessential and effective, and are willingly and consciously undertaken. But—whenthese foundations of good character and intelligent activity are firmlyestablished—something still higher and more subtle must be erected on thesub-structure.Knowledge-wisdom must be superseded by intuitive [469] understanding; this is,in reality, inclusive participation in the creative activity of divinity. Thedivine idea must become the possible ideal, and this ideal must become unfoldedand manifested in substance upon the physical plane. The creative thread, nowsomewhat ready, must be brought into conscious functioning and activity.Desire-love must be interpreted in terms of divine attraction, involving theright use or misuse of energies and forces. This process puts the disciple intouch with divinity as a progressively revealed Whole. The part, through themagnetic development of its own nature, comes into touch gradually with all thatIS. The disciple becomes aware of this sum total in increasingly vividexpansions of consciousness, leading to initiation, realisation andidentification. These are the three stages of initiation.The consciousness thread, in cooperation with the creative thread and the lifethread, awakens to a fully aware process of participation in the divine creativePlan—a Plan which is motivated by love and intelligently carried forward.Direction-Will (which are words describing the orientation produced by theunderstanding of the two processes of knowledge-wisdom and desire-love) mustproduce the final orientation of the personality and the soul, fused and blendedand at-one, towards the freedom of the Spiritual Triad; then the consciousattempt to use these three energies eventuates in creating the antahkarana uponthe mental plane. You will note that at this early stage of the process I amemphasising the words “orientation” and “attempt.” They simply indicate thefinal control of substance by the initiate.One of the indications that a man is no longer upon the Probationary Path is hisemerging from the realm of aspiration and devotion into the world of thefocussed will . Another indication is that he begins to interpret life in termsof energy and forces, and not in terms of quality and desire. This marks adefinite step forward. There is too little use of the spiritual will, as theresult of right orientation, in the life of disciples today. [470]In the future, this Science of the Antahkarana and its lower correspondence, theScience of Social Evolution (which is the joint or united antahkarana ofhumanity as a whole), will be known as the Science of Invocation and Evocation.It is in reality the Science of Magnetic Rapport, in which right relationship isbrought about by mutual invocation, producing a responsive process which is oneof evocation. It is this science which lies behind all conscious awakening ofthe centres and their interrelation; it lies behind the rapport between man andman, group and group, and eventually between nation and nation. It is thisinvocation, and the consequent evocation, which eventually relate soul andpersonality and soul and monad. It is the outstanding objective of humanity'sappeal to God, to the Hierarchy and to the Spiritual Powers of the cosmos, nomatter by what name you call them. The appeal goes forth. The invocation ofhumanity can and will and must evoke response from the spiritual Hierarchy andgive the first demonstration upon a large scale of this new esotericscience—esoteric because it is based upon sound. Hence the use of the O.M. Intothis science I cannot here go; we must confine our attention to our theme, whichis the Science of the Antahkarana.The Bridge as the Agent of AlignmentThe word “alignment” is used much in modern esoteric training. I would point outthat in making his alignment, the aspirant is only establishing the first stageof his process of realisation; he is establishing in his own consciousness thefact of his essential dualism. I would also point out that the critical aspectof this process is only arrived at when the distinction is sharply defined andrecognised between the integrated and potent personality and the soul. It is anoccult truism to state that the aspiran t is to be recognised by or triplicity;the disciple by or recognised duality and the initiate by or unity. Note thatthe symbol of duality for undeveloped humanity is in which the separation of thehigher nature from the lower is depicted; in the case of the disciple, it isshowing the “path across” or the [471] narrow razor-edged Path between the pairsof opposites, forming later the antahkarana. These symbols, simple as they are,embody and convey vast truths to the illumined mind.Relatively speaking, and speaking in terms of the mental consciousness, therealisation of duality is only to be found in the three worlds and on the mentalplane. When the third initiation is taken, the power of the lower pair ofopposites is no longer felt and exists no more. A liberated consciousness and anunrestricted awareness—unrestricted as regards the initiate, moving within theorbit of the planetary Logos (though not unrestricted as regards that greaterLife which moves within still other and greater defined limits)—are bothunderstood and expressed. Within the planetary ring-pass-not the initiate moveswith freedom and knows no limitation in consciousness. That is why the higherlevels of our planetary and systemic planes are called formless. It is thiswhich is the true symbol of alignment, involving as it does the sense of dualitybut indicating at the same time the way through what are called “the walls oflimitation.”Students would do well to consider the building of the antahkarana as anextension in consciousness. This extension is the first definite effort madeupon the Path to bring in the monadic influence with full awareness, and finallydirectly. This process constitutes the individual parallel to the present inflowof force from Shamballa, about which I have elsewhere spoken. That highestCentre of energy upon our planet is now having a definite effect upon thatcentre which we call Humanity. This is brought about by direct alignment, andnot via the Hierarchy as has hitherto been the case. When the individualantahkarana has been successfully started, and there is even a tenuous thread ofliving energy connecting the threefold personality and the Spiritual Triad, thenthe inflow of the will-energy becomes possible. This, in the early stages, canbe most dangerous when not offset by the love energy of the soul. Only onethread of the threefold antahkarana passes through the egoic lotus. [472] Theother two threads relate themselves directly with the Triad, and henceeventually with the Monad, the source of the triadal life. This is true of theindividual and of humanity as a whole, and the effects of this alignment can beseen demonstrating in the world at this time.This rather unexpected responsive activity has necessitated much increasedactivity on the part of the Hierarchy, in order to offset the consequences ofany premature inflow of the will force. After the third initiation, when thesoul body, the causal body, starts to dissipate, the line of relation or ofconnection can be and is direct. The initiate then “stands in the ocean of love,and through him pours that love; his will is love and he can safely work, forlove divine will colour all his will, and he can wisely serve.” Love andintelligence then become the servants of the will. Soul energy and personalityforce contribute to the experience of the Monad in the three worlds of lifeservice, and then the age-long task of the incarnating spiritual man is finallyaccomplished. He is ready for Nirvana, which is but the Way into new fields ofspiritual experience and of divine development—incomprehensible as yet, even tothe initiate of the third degree. This Way is revealed only when the antahkaranais built and completed and the man becomes focussed in the Triad as consciouslyas he is now focussed in the threefold lower nature.Then, and then only, is the true dualism of the divine nature apparent and theillusory duality disappears. Then you have Spirit-matter, Life-form. For thisthe triple experience of the unfolding consciousness is only preparatory.Through the unfolding consciousness, the initiate knows the significance of lifeand the uses of form, but stands completely unidentified with either, thoughblending these dualities in himself into a conscious synthesis. The attempt toconvey his state of mind, in words that but limit and confuse, leads to apparentcontradictions, and this is one of the peculiar paradoxes of the occult science.Do the above imparted facts make sense to you? Have they meaning for your mind?I think not. You have not yet the needed equipment [473] through which the typeof implied awareness can work, or the realisation of that true Self-consciousness which would produce in you an understanding reaction. I simplymake the esoteric assertion; later will come apprehension of the truth and thatconsequent energising which always comes when any abstract truth is trulyappreciated and assimilated. But the time has not yet come for the comprehensionof the above information. Disciples and aspirants grow through the means of apresented vision—unattainable as yet but definitely an extension of the knownand previously grasped. Such is the mode of evolution, for it is ever a pressingforward towards the sensed.Today, through human effort and hierarchical endeavour, a great alignment andlinking up is taking place, and Monad-Soul-Personality are being more directlyrelated than has hitherto been possible. One reason for this is that there arepresent in incarnation upon the planet many more initiates of the third degreethan ever before; there are many more disciples being prepared for the thirdinitiation; and in this third strictly human race, the Aryan (using this term inits generic sense and not in its prostituted German connotation), the threeaspects of the personality are now so potent that their magnetic influence andtheir creative effect are making the building of the antahkarana an outstandingachievement, thus linking and aligning the three aspects in man. The same istrue of the three divine centres in the planet which embody these divinequalities: Shamballa, Hierarchy, and Humanity. These are now closely aligned,thus producing a fusion of energies which is causing an inflow of the spiritualwill, as well as a demonstration of the Destroyer aspect.I have here indicated much of interest; I have pointed out a goal and indicateda Way. I have related (in consciousness) the Hierarchy and Shamballa. Thissignifies a great and critical moment in human affairs and an opportunityhitherto unparalleled in history. The need for a due appreciation of this willbe evident, and should incite all who read to renewed effort and to freshendeavour. Students must [474] seek to meet all the planetary changes andopportunities with corresponding changes in their own lives. They must seekthose new attitudes and those new creative approaches which will result notalone in the building of the individual antahkarana, but also in the fusion ofthe many “radiant strands” which will produce those “connecting cables,”speaking symbolically, which will relate the planetary centres and present themedium along which can pass the fiery will and the predetermined purpose ofDeity. This will bring about the reconstruction of the manifested worlds, and inthis task each and every one of you can have his share.Let us now take up our next point in this section and indicate the technique forthe constructing of the antahkarana. This will constitute an intensely practicalteaching for which all that I have hitherto given should prove a firmfoundation.The Technique of ConstructionIt is my intention to be very practical. The building of the antahkarana (whichis consciously undertaken upon the Path of Discipleship) is a process which isfollowed under certain ancient and proven rules. When these rules are correctlyfollowed, the sequence of events and the appearance of the desired results areinevitable and unavoidable. There is much that I could say which would be ofsmall use to the average aspirant, as it would be concerned with subjectiverealities which—though existent and occult facts in a natural process—are as yetunrealisable. My problem is to present the process in such a manner that—towardsthe end of this century—educators will be thinking, speaking and teaching interms of bridging , and thus approaching basic statements which have a definitebearing upon this point which we are considering. I would like here verysuccinctly to recall a few of them to your attention:> 1. Knowledge-force expresses itself through the consciousness thread and the> creative thread.> 2. These two threads are, for the disciple, a fusion of [475] past knowledge> (the consciousness thread) and the present (the creative thread).> 3. The life thread or sutratma proper is closely blended with these two. You> then have atma-buddhi-manas (the latter being the agent of creation)> functioning to a certain degree consciously in the aspirant.> 4. The fusion of personality and soul is in process, but when it has reached a> certain point it becomes apparent that a creativity or a creative activity of> the Will is needed to bridge between the Spiritual Triad and the personality,> via the soul.> 5. The bridge which must be constructed is called, technically, the> antahkarana.> 6. This bridge has to be built by the aspirant who is focussed upon the mental> plane, because it is mental substance (in three grades) which must be used,> and the three aspects of the mind—the manasic permanent atom, the Son of Mind> or Ego, and the mental unit—are all involved in the process.Students would do well to learn that this process of building the antahkarana isone of the means whereby man, the trinity, becomes a duality. When the task iscompleted and the antahkarana is definitely built—thus producing perfectalignment between the Monad and its expression upon the physical plane—the bodyof the soul (the causal body) is completely and finally destroyed by the fire ofthe Monad, pouring down the antahkarana. There is then complete reciprocitybetween the Monad and the fully conscious soul on the physical plane . The“divine intermediary” is no longer required. The “Son of God Who is the Son ofMind” dies; the “veil of the temple is rent in twain from the top to thebottom”; the fourth initiation is passed, and there then comes the revelation ofthe Father.This is the final and far-reaching result of the building of the bridge whichis, in reality, the establishing of a line of light between Monad andpersonality as a full expression of the soul—between spirit and matter, betweenFather and Mother. It is evidence that “spirit has mounted on the [476]shoulders of matter” to that high place from whence it originally came, plus thegain of experience and of full knowledge, and of all that life in material formcould give and all that conscious experience could confer. The Son has done Hiswork. The task of the Saviour or of the Mediator has been completed. The unityof all things is known to be a fact in consciousness, and a human spirit can saywith intention and with understanding: “I and my Father are one.”The above is a brief and probably meaningless statement except theoretically,but it summarises the task which lies ahead and the work of the disciple who isin process of constructing the antahkarana. There is a close connection betweenthe fourth initiation, the quaternary in its evolved condition—vital body,emotional vehicle, mind and soul—and this fourth technical stage of buildingconsciously the “rainbow bridge.” You have therefore:> 1. The Quaternary, the creative factor on Earth.> 2. The fourth initiation, that of the Crucifixion.> 3. The fourth technical stage of building the Antahkarana:> a. Sutratma, the life thread.> b. The consciousness thread.> c. The creative thread, itself threefold.> d. The technical antahkarana, bridging between the threefold personality and> the Spiritual Triad.> 4. The four stages of the Path of Return:> a. The stage of evolution itself.> b. The stage of the Probationary Path.> c. The stage of the Path of Discipleship.> d. The stage of the Path of Initiation.Yet it is one and the same entity which participates in and is responsible forall the differentiated aspects, steps and stages—experimenting, experiencing andexpressing consciously in every one of these stages or modes of life, until thefourth initiation. Then consciousness itself gives place to life, and yetremains itself. To the above statement, add [477] the fact that it is the fourthkingdom in nature which undergoes all that is indicated above and is conditionedby the four aspects of the one sutratma. Once this is grasped, the beauty of thesymbolism and the numerological relationships emerge significantly.The Construction of the Antahkarana...PastIn connection with this there is no need for elaboration, as it must be obviousthat only the man who is the product of a very long and fruitful past experienceis equipped to undertake the task of bridge building. The process involves muchscientific experience in the art of living, and only the highly trained humanenquirer can soundly and safely build the bridge between the highest and thelowest. Each of the major human races has been responsible for the expressionand the employment of the threads which together form the antahkarana:1. In ancient Lemuria, the life thread, the sutratma per se, was the dominantfactor in the life expression; the physical body, the animal form nature, andthe dense outer factor was the focus of life exuberant, productive and vital.2. In old Atlantis , the consciousness thread began to function in a wayunrealised in Lemuria. Sensitivity, awareness and—as a result—desire andreaction were the keynotes. Active sensitivity as a prelude to fullconsciousness distinguished the human being. The astral vehicle was acontrolling factor. The mind was relatively quiescent, except where the foremostmembers of the human race were concerned. The humanity of that world cycle were,however, all of them extremely psychic and mediumistic; they were “sensitives,”in the modern use of the term. The state of awareness was astral, and humanbeings were—as a race—clairaudient and clairvoyant, though in no way able tointerpret that which they contacted; they were not able to distinguish astralphenomena from ordinary physical life (particularly in the middle period oftheir racial history), and the interpreting mind revealed nothing to them. They[478] simply lived and felt. Such was their life history. Two of the threadswere functioning; one was not functioning at all. The bridge was not built.3. In our modern Aryan race —modern as far as racial histories are concerned—thethird thread, the creative thread, comes into active expression and use. I wouldremind you that all these threads exist from the beginning of human existence,and that all these three streams of energy have been indissolubly present fromthe beginning of human consciousness. But for the greater part of human history,up to the present, men remained unaware of them, and quite unconsciously madeuse of and continued to make use of their presence. The process of recognisingcreative ability and of opportunity falls into two phases or stages:> a. The stage wherein the mind principle is developed and unfolded and man> becomes a mental creature. This produces the full activity of the mental unit,> the integration of the three aspects of the personality, and the consequent> awareness of the Son of Mind or soul.> b. The stage of creative activity wherein the creative thread is brought into> full use. This personality use of the thread—as distinguished from racial> use—is characteristic of the Aryan race. It is only during the past five> thousand years that it has gradually become the outstanding quality of> mankind. In the other two races, and in the early stages of the Aryan race,> although great creative monuments appeared everywhere upon the planet, they> were not the product of the minds of the men of the time, but were the> imposition of the creative will of the planetary Hierarchy upon those who were> sensitive to the higher impression. The responsive sensitivity to creative> impression was the outstanding quality of the later Atlantean consciousness> and of the early Aryan period. It is today giving place to individual> creativity, and consequently to the conscious creation of the bridging [479]> antahkarana, which is the outcome of the fused and blended threefold thread.This brief summation of the past process is intended simply to give a syntheticbackground to all the work now to be done, and to convey to you an almost visualconcept of the method whereby man has reached the stage of conscious life, offull self-awareness and creative expression. All of these were the expression ofdivine energy as it poured into his mechanism, via the silver thread of divinepotency. This might be regarded as a threefold demonstration of the verticallife which becomes the horizontal life through the expression of creativity. Manthen indeed becomes the Cross. When, however, he succeeds in constructing therainbow bridge (which can only be done when man is upon the Fixed Cross), thenfinally the Cross gives place to the line. This takes place after the fourthinitiation—that of the Crucifixion. There remains then only the vertical line“reaching from Heaven to Hell.” The goal of the initiate (between the fourth andthe seventh initiations) is to resolve the line into the circle, and thusfulfill the law and the “rounding out” of the evolutionary process.Another summation of the entire process may be found in the lines from Stanzasfor Disciples which I gave out some time ago (June 1930) and which will also befound elsewhere in this volume.> “In the Cross is hidden Light. The vertical and horizontal in mutual friction> creates a vibrant Cross scintillates, and motion originates. When the vertical> assumes the horizontal, pralaya supervenes. Evolution is the movement of the> horizontal to upright positiveness. In the secret of direction lies the hidden> wisdoms in the doctrine of absorption lies the healing faculty in the point> becoming the line, and the line becoming the cross is evolution. In the cross> swinging to the horizontal lies salvation and pralayic peace.”It might be said that few, very few, people are today at the Lemurian stage ofconsciousness wherein the life thread, [480] with its physical implications, isthe dominant factor. Many, very many, people are at the Atlantean stage ofdevelopment of “auric sensitivity.” A few—a very few in comparison with theuntold masses of human beings—are utilising the results of the tripleconstruction of energy within their own aura of awareness and their area ofinfluence, in order to build, construct and utilise the bridge which links thevarious aspects of the mental plane. These three aspects they must employsimultaneously, and then later supersede them in such a manner that personalityand ego disappear and only the Monad and its form upon the physical planeremain. In this connection, my earlier statement on the nature of form may beuseful and lead to increased insight and understanding:> The physical plane is a complete reflection of the mental; the lowest three> subplanes reflect the abstract subplanes, and the four etheric subplanes> reflect the four mental concrete planes. The manifestation of the Ego on the> mental plane for the causal body) is not the result of energy emanating from> the permanent atoms as a nucleus of force, but is the result of different> forces, and primarily of group force. It is predominantly marked by an act of> an exterior force, and is lost in the mysteries of planetary karma. This is> equally true of man's lowest manifestations. It is the result of reflex> action, and is based on the force of the group of etheric centres through> which man (as an aggregate of lives) is functioning. The activity of these> centres sets up an answering vibration in the three lowest subplanes of the> physical plane, and the interaction between the two causes an adherence to or> aggregation around, the etheric body of particles of what we erroneously term> 'dense substance.' This type of energised substance is swept up in the vortex> of force currents issuing from the centres and cannot escape. These units of> force, therefore, pile up according to the energy direction around and within> the etheric sheath till it is hidden and concealed, yet interpenetrating. An> inexorable law, the law of matter itself, brings this [481] about, and only> those can escape the effect of the vitality of their own centres who are> definitely 'Lords of Yoga' and can—through the conscious will of their own> being—escape the compelling force of the Law of Attraction working on the> lowest cosmic physical subplane.A T REATISE ON C OSMIC F IRE, PAGE 789I have earlier told you that the astral body is an illusion. It is eventuallydiscovered to be nonexistent by the man who has achieved the consciousness ofthe initiate. When buddhi reigns, the lower psychic nature fades out.When the antahkarana is built, and the mental unit is superseded by the manasicpermanent atom, and the causal body disappears, then the adept knows that thelower mind, the mental body, is also an illusion and is, for him, non-existent.There are then—as far as his individual consciousness is concerned—only threefocal points or anchorages (both of these expressions are inadequate to expressthe full meaning):> 1. Humanity, in which he can focus himself at will through the medium of what> is called technically the “mayavirupa”—a bodily form which he creates for the> fulfillment of monadic purpose.> > He then fully expresses all the energies of the Mutable Cross.*> 2. The Hierarchy . Here, as a focussed unit of all-inclusive buddhic> awareness, he finds his place and mode of service, conditioned by his monadic> ray.> > He then expresses the values of the Fixed Cross *> 3. Shamballa. This is his highest point of focus, the goal of the exertions of> all initiates of the higher degrees and the source of the sutratma, through> which (and its differentiations) he can now consciously work.> > Here he finds himself still crucified, but on the Cardinal Cross*.> *(A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol III, Esoteric Astrology, Chapter VI.)The task with which the human being in all his stages [482] of unfoldment hasbeen occupied might therefore be stated to be the bridging of the gap between:> 1. The Mutable Cross and the Fixed Cross.> 2. Humanity and the Hierarchy.> 3. The lower triplicity, the personality, and the Spiritual Triad.> 4. The Monad on its own plane and the outer objective world.This he does through a process of Intention, Visualisation, Projection,Invocation and Evocation, Stabilisation and Resurrection. With these variousstages, we will now deal.The Construction of the Antahkarana in the Aryan Race. PresentI would like to pause here and make a few remarks anent this relatively newprocess of building the antahkarana. It has been known and followed by those whowere training for affiliation with the Hierarchy, but it has not been given outbefore to the general public. There are two things which it is essential thatthe student should note: one is that unless it is borne in mind that we areconcerned with energy , and with energy which must be scientifically used, thiswhole teaching will prove futile. Secondly, it must be remembered that we aredealing with a technique and process which are dependent upon the use of thecreative imagination . When these two factors are brought together (consciouslyand deliberately)—the factor of energy substance and the factor of plannedimpulse—you have started a creative process which will be productive of majorresults. The human being lives in a world of varied energies which are sometimesexpressing themselves as dynamic, positive energies, as receptive, negativeenergies, or as magnetic, attractive forces. An understanding of this statementwill substantiate that made by H.P.B. that “matter is spirit at its lowestpoint,” and the reverse is equally true. The whole process is one ofestablishing constructive relations between negative and positive energies andthe subsequent production of magnetic force. This is the creative [483] process. It is true of the activity of a solar Logos, of a planetary Logos and of ahuman being—the only conscious creators in the universe. It must prove true ofthe disciple, who is attempting to bring into a constructive relation the Monadand the human expression in the three worlds of human evolution.There has been much emphasis upon the life of the soul and its expression uponthe physical plane; this has been necessary and a part of the evolutionarydevelopment of the human consciousness. The kingdom of souls must eventuallygive place to the rule of the spirit; the energy of the Hierarchy must become aforce, receptive to the energy of Shamballa, just as the force of humanity hasto become receptive to the energy of the kingdom of souls. Today all threeprocesses are going on simultaneously, though the receptivity of the Hierarchyto the second aspect of the Shamballa energy is only now beginning to berecognisable. The Hierarchy has for long been receptive to the third or creativeaspect of the Shamballa energy, and—at some very distant period—it will beresponsive to the first aspect of that same energy. The triple nature of thedivine manifestation must also express itself as a duality. This can beunderstood in a faint way when the disciple realises that (after the thirdinitiation) he too must learn to function as a duality—Monad (spirit) and form(matter)—in direct rapport with the consciousness aspect, the mediating soulbeing absorbed into both of these two aspects of divine expression, but notfunctioning itself as a middle factor. When this has been achieved, the truenature of Nirvana will be comprehended, the beginning of that endless Way whichleads to the One; this is the Way whereon duality is resolved into unity, theWay that Members of the Hierarchy are seeking to tread and for which They arepreparing.The initial step towards bringing about this dualism is the building of theantahkarana, and this is consciously undertaken only when the disciple ispreparing for the second initiation. As I have already said, there are literally[484] thousands so preparing, because it can be assumed that all earnest andtrue aspirants and disciples who work undeviatingly for spiritual advancement(with pure motive), and who are oriented unswervingly towards the soul, havetaken the first initiation. This simply connotes the birth of the infant Christwithin the heart, speaking symbolically. There should be many who are preparingto begin this task of building the rainbow bridge and who, under the influenceof the Ageless Wisdom, are grasping the necessity and the importance of therevelation which this process conveys. What I am here writing has, therefore, adefinite and useful purpose. My task has been for a long time the giving out, inbook form, information anent the next stage of intelligent and spiritualrecognition for humanity. Therefore, again, the understanding of the method ofbuilding the antahkarana is essential if humanity is to move forward as planned,and in this moving forward the disciples and aspirants must and do form thevanguard. Humanity will awaken steadily and as a whole to the incoming spiritualurge; an overwhelming impulse towards spiritual light and towards a majororientation will take place. Just as the individual disciple has to reversehimself upon the wheel of life and tread the Way counter-clockwise, so musthumanity; and so humanity will. The two-thirds who will make the goal ofevolution in this world cycle are already beginning to do so.In the process, however, the third divine aspect—that of the CreativeActor—comes into activity. It was so in the creative process where the tangibleuniverse was concerned. It must also be when the individual disciple becomes thecreating agent. For aeons, he has built and has used his vehicles ofmanifestation in the three worlds. Then came a time when advanced people beganto create upon the mental plane; they dreamed dreams; they saw a vision; theycontacted intangible beauty; they touched the Mind of God and returned to earthwith an idea. To this idea they gave form and became creators upon the mentalplanet they became artists in some form of creative effort. In the task [485] ofbuilding the antahkarana the disciple has to work also on mental levels, andthat which he there constructs will be of so fine a substance that it may notand cannot appear on physical levels. Because of his fixed orientation, thatwhich he builds will “move upwards toward the centre of life,” and not“downwards toward the centre of consciousness or toward light appearance.”Herein lies the difficulty for the beginner. He has, so to speak, to work in thedark, and is not in a position to verify the existence of that which he isattempting to construct. His physical brain is unable to register his creationas an accomplished fact. He has to depend entirely upon the proved technique ofthe work outlined, and to proceed by faith. The only evidence of success may beslow in coming, for the sensitivity of the brain is involved, and frequentlywhere there is very real success the brain cells are not of the calibre whichcan register it. The possible evidences at this stage may be a flash of thespiritual intuition or the sudden realisation of the will-to-good in a dynamicand group form; it may also be simply an ability to understand and to makeothers understand certain spiritual and occult fundamentals; it may be a“facility of revelation,” both receptive and conditioning or distributing, andso world effective.I am attempting to make a very abstruse subject clear, and words proveinadequate. I can but outline to you process and method and a consequent hopefor the future; on your side, you can only experiment, obey, have confidence inthe experience of those who teach, and then wait patiently for results.The Six Stages of the Building ProcessI have employed six words to express this process and its resultant condition.It might prove useful to study them from the angle of their occultsignificance—a significance which is not usually apparent except to the traineddisciple who has been taught to penetrate into the world of meaning and to seeinterpretations not apparent to the neophyte. [486] Perhaps by the time we haveinvestigated these words, the method of construction and the means whereby theantahkarana is built will appear with greater clarity.These words cover a building technique or a process of energy manipulation whichbrings into being a rapport between the Monad and a human being who is aspiringtowards full liberation and is treading the Path of Discipleship and Initiation;it can create a channel of light and life between the higher and the lowerdivine aspects and can produce a bridge between the world of spiritual life andthe world of daily physical plane living. It is a technique for producing thehighest form of dualism and of eliminating the threefold expression of divinity,thereby intensifying the divine expression and bringing man nearer to hisultimate goal. Disciples must always remember that soul consciousness is anintermediate stage. It is also a process whereby—from the angle of the subhumankingdoms in nature—humanity itself becomes the divine intermediary and thetransmitter of spiritual energy to those lives whose stages of consciousness arebelow that of self-consciousness. Humanity becomes to these lives—in theirtotality—what the Hierarchy is to humanity. This service only becomes possiblewhen a sufficient number of the human race are distinguished by the knowledge ofthe higher duality and are increasingly soul-conscious and not justself-conscious. They can then make this transmission possible, and it is done bymeans of the antahkarana.Let us, therefore, take these six aspects of a basic building technique andendeavour to arrive at their occult and creative significance.1. Intention. By this is not meant a mental decision, wish or determination. Theidea is more literally the focussing of energy upon the mental plane at thepoint of greatest possible tension. It signifies the bringing about of acondition in the disciple's consciousness which is analogous to that of theLogos when—on His much vaster scale—He concentrated within a ring-pass-not(defining His desired [487] sphere of influence) the energy-substance needed tocarry out His purpose in manifesting. This the disciple must also do, gatheringhis forces (to use a common expression) into the highest point of his mentalconsciousness and holding them there in a state of absolute tension. You can nowsee the purpose lying behind some of the meditation processes and techniques asembodied in the words so often used in the meditation outlines: “raise theconsciousness to the head centre”; “hold the consciousness at the highestpossible point”; “endeavour to hold the mind steady in the light”; and manysimilar phrases. They are all concerned with the task of bringing the discipleto the point where he can achieve the desired point of tension and ofenergy-focussing. This will enable him to begin the conscious task ofconstructing the antahkarana. It is this thought which really lies unrecognisedbehind the word “intention,” used so often by Roman Catholics andAnglo-Catholics when preparing candidates for communion. They indicate adifferent direction, however, for the orientation they desire is not thattowards the Monad or spirit, but towards the soul, in an effort to bring aboutbetter character equipment in the personality and an intensification of themystical approach.In the “intention” of the disciple who is consciously occupied with the rainbowbridge, the first necessary steps are:> a. The achievement of right orientation; and this must take place in two> stages: first, towards the soul as one aspect of the building energy, and> second, towards the Triad.> b. A mental understanding of the task to be carried out. This involves the use> of the mind in two ways: responsiveness to buddhic or intuitional impression> and an act of the creative imagination.> c. A process of energy gathering or of force absorption. in order that the> needed energies are confined within a mental ring-pass-not, prior to the later> process of visualisation and projection. [488]> d. A period of clear thinking anent process and intention. so that the> dedicated bridge-builder may clearly perceive what is being done.> e. The steady preservation of tension without undue physical strain upon the> brain cells.When this has been accomplished there will be found to be present a focal pointof mental energy which previously had been nonexistent; the mind will be heldsteady in the light, and there will also be the alignment of a receptiveattentive personality and a soul oriented towards the personality and in a stateof constant, directed perception. I would remind you that the soul (as it livesits own life on its own level of awareness) is not always constantly aware ofits shadow, the personality, in the three worlds. When the antahkarana is beingbuilt, this awareness must be present alongside the intention of thepersonality.2. Visualisation. Up to this point the activity has been of a mental nature. Thecreative imagination has been relatively quiescent; the disciple has beenoccupied within the mind and upon mental levels, and has “looked neither up nordown.” But now the right point of tension has been reached; the reservoir orpool of needed energy has been restrained within the carefully delimitedring-pass-not, and the bridge-builder is ready for the next step. He thereforeproceeds at this point to construct the blue print of the work to be done, bydrawing upon the imagination and its faculties as they are to be found upon thehighest level of his astral or sensitive vehicle. This does not relate to theemotions. Imagination is, as you know, the lowest aspect of the intuition, andthis fact must be remembered at all times. Sensitivity, as an expression of theastral body, is the opposite pole to buddhic sensitivity. The disciple haspurified and refined his imaginative faculties so that they are now responsiveto the impression of the buddhic principle or of the intuitiveperception—perception, apart from sight or any recorded possible vision.According to the responsiveness of the astral vehicle to the [489] buddhicimpression, so will be the accuracy of the “plans” laid for the building of theantahkarana and the visualising of the bridge of light in all its beauty andcompleteness.The creative imagination has to be stepped up in its vibratory nature so that itcan affect the “pool of energy” or the energy-substance which has been gatheredfor the building of the bridge. The creative activity of the imagination is thefirst organising influence which works upon and within the ring-pass-not ofaccumulated energies, held in a state of tension by the “intention” of thedisciple. Ponder upon this occult and significant statement.The creative imagination is in the nature of an active energy, drawn up intorelationship with the point of tension; it there and then produces effects inmental substance. The tension is thereby increased, and the more potent and theclearer the visualisation process, the more beautiful and strong will be thebridge. Visualisation is the process whereby the creative imagination isrendered active and becomes responsive to and attracted by the point of tensionupon the mental plane.At this stage the disciple is occupied with two energies: one, quiescent andheld within a ring-pass-not, but at a point of extreme tension, and the otheractive, picture-forming, outgoing and responsive to the mind of thebridge-builder. In this connection it should be remembered that the secondaspect of the divine Trinity is the form-building aspect, and thus, under theLaw of Analogy, it is the second aspect of the personality and the second aspectof the Spiritual Triad which are becoming creatively active. The disciple is nowproceeding with the second stage of his building work, and so the numericalsignificance will become apparent to you. He must work slowly at this point,picturing what he wants to do, why he has to do it, what are the stages of hiswork, what will be the resultant effects of his planned activity, and what arethe materials with which he has to work. He endeavours to visualise the entireprocess, and by this means sets up a definite rapport (if successful) betweenthe buddhic intuition and the creative imagination [490] of the astral body.Consequently, you will have at this point:> The buddhic activity of impression.> The tension of the mental vehicle, as it holds the needed energy-substance at> the point of projection.> The imaginative processes of the astral body.When the disciple has trained himself to be consciously aware of thesimultaneity of this threefold work, then it goes forward successfully andalmost automatically. This he does through the power of visualisation. A currentof force is set up between these pairs of opposites (astral-buddhic) and—as itpasses through the reservoir of force upon the mental plane—it produces aninterior activity and an organisation of the substance present. There thensupervenes a steadily mounting potency, until the third stage is reached and thework passes out of the phase of subjectivity into that of objectivereality—objective from the standpoint of the spiritual man.3. Projection. The task of the disciple has now reached a most critical point.Many aspirants reach this particular stage and—having developed a real capacityto visualise, and having therefore constructed by its means the desired form,and organised the substance which is to be employed in this later phase of thebuilding process—find themselves unable to proceed any further. What then is thematter? Primarily, an inability to use the Will in the process of projection.This process is a combination of will, further and continued visualisation, andthe use of the ray Word of Power. Up to the present stage in the process, themethod for all the seven rays is identical; but at this point there comes achange. Each disciple, having successfully organised the bridge substance,having brought into activity the will aspect, and being consciously aware ofprocess and performance, proceeds now to move the organised substance forward,so that from the centre of force which he has succeeded in accumulating thereappears a line of light-substance or projection. This is sent forward upon a[491] Word of Power, as in the logoic creative process. This is in reality areversal of the process of the Monad when It sent forth the thread of life whichfinally anchored itself in the soul. The soul, in reality, came into beingthrough the means of this anchoring; then came the later process, when the soulin its turn sent forth a dual thread which finally found anchorage in the headand the heart of the lower threefold man, the personality. The disciple isfocussed in the centre which he has constructed upon the mental plane, and isdrawing all his resources (those of the threefold personality and the soulcombined) into activity; he now projects a line towards the Monad.It is along this line that the final withdrawal of the forces takes place, theforces which—upon the downward way or the involutionary path—focussed themselvesin the personality and the soul. The antahkarana per se, completed by the bridgebuilt by the disciple, is the final medium of abstraction or of the greatwithdrawal. It is with the antahkarana that the initiate is concerned in thefourth initiation, called sometimes the Great Renunciation—the renunciation orthe withdrawal from form life, both personal and egoic. After this initiationneither of these aspects can hold the Monad any more. The “veil of the Temple”is rent in twain from the top to the bottom—that veil which separated the OuterCourt (the personality life) from the Holy Place (the soul) and from the Holy ofHolies (the Monad) in the Temple at Jerusalem. The implications and theanalogies will necessarily be clear to you.In order, therefore, to bring about the needed projection of the accumulatedenergies, organised by the creative imagination and brought to a point ofexcessive tension by the focussing of the mental impulse (an aspect of thewill), the disciple then calls upon the resources of his soul, stored up in whatis technically called “the jewel in the lotus.” This is the anchorage of theMonad—a point which must not be forgotten. The aspects of the soul which we callknowledge, love and sacrifice, and which are expressions of the causal body, areonly effects of this monadic radiation. [492]Therefore, before the bridge can be truly built and “projected on the upwardway, providing safe travelling for the pilgrim's weary feet” (as the OldCommentary puts it), the disciple must begin to react in response to the closedlotus bud or jewel at the centre of the opened lotus. This he does when thesacrifice petals of the egoic lotus are assuming control in his life, when hisknowledge is being transmuted into wisdom, and his love for the whole isgrowing; to these is being added the “power to renounce”. These three egoicqualities—when functioning with a measure of potency—produce an increasedactivity at the very centre of soul life, the heart of the lotus. It should beremembered that the correspondences in the egoic lotus to the three planetarycentres are as follows:> Shamballa. . . . The jewel in the lotus.> Hierarchy . . . . The three groups of petals.> Humanity . . . .The three permanent atoms within the aura of the lotus.Students should also bear in mind that they need to rid themselves of the usualidea of sacrifice as a process of giving-up, or renunciation of all that makeslife worth living. Sacrifice is, technically speaking, the achievement of astate of bliss and of ecstasy because it is the realisation of another divineaspect, hidden hitherto by both the soul and the personality. It isunderstanding and recognition of the will-to-good which made creation possibleand inevitable, and which was the true cause of manifestation. Ponder on this,for it is very different in its significance to the usual concepts anentsacrifice.When the disciple has gained the fruit of experience which is knowledge and islearning to transmute it into wisdom, when his objective is to live truly and inreality, and when the will-to-good is the crowning goal of his daily life, thenhe can begin to evoke the Will. This will make the link between the lower andthe higher minds, between spirit and matter and between Monad and personality adefinite and existent fact. Duality then supervenes upon [493] triplicity, andthe potency of the central nucleus in the egoic vehicle destroys—at the fourthinitiation—the three surrounding expressions. They disappear, and then theso-called destruction of the causal body has taken place. This is the true“second death”—death to form altogether.This is practically all that I can tell you anent the process of projection. Itis a living process, growing out of the conscious daily experience and dependentupon the expression of the divine aspects in the life upon the physical plane,as far as is possible. Where there is an attempt to approximate the personalitylife to the demands of the soul and to use the intellect on behalf of humanity,love is beginning to control; and then the significance of the “divinesacrifice” is increasingly understood and becomes a natural, spontaneousexpression of individual intention. Then it becomes possible to project thebridge. The vibration is then set up on lower levels of divine manifestation andbecomes strong enough to produce response from the higher. Then, when the Wordof Power is known and rightly used, the bridge is rapidly built.Students need feel in no way discouraged by this picture. Much can happen on theinner planes where there is right intention, as well as occult intention(purpose and tension combined), and the bridge reaches stages of definiteoutline and structure long before the disciple is aware of it.4. Invocation and Evocation. The three preceding stages mark, in reality, thethree stages of personality work. The remaining three are expressions ofresponse from higher levels of the spiritual life; beyond briefly indicatingthem, there is very little that I can put into words. The task of Invocation,based on Intention, Visualisation and Projection, has been carefully undertakenby the disciple and he has at least some measure of clear perception as to thework he has done by the dual means of spiritual living and scientific,technical, occult work. He is therefore himself invocative. His life effect isregistered upon the higher levels of consciousness and he is recognised as “apoint of invocative tension.” This tension and this [494] reservoir of livingenergy, which is the disciple himself, is set in motion by projected thought,the use of the will and a sounded Word or Phrase of Power.The result is that his developed potency and its radius of influence are nowsufficiently strong to call out a response from the Spiritual Triad. There isthen a going forth towards the aspect of the antahkarana, constructed by thedisciple, along which the life of soul and body can travel. The Father (Monad),working through the thread, now goes forth to meet the Son (the soul, enrichedby the experience of personality life in the three worlds), and from the higherlevels a line of responsive projection of energy is sent forth which willeventually make contact with the lower projection. Thus the antahkarana isbuilt. The tension of the lower evokes the attention of the higher.This is the technical process of invocation and evocation. There is a gradualapproach from both the divine aspects. Little by little, the vibration of bothbecomes stronger reciprocally. There comes then a moment when contact betweenthe two projections is made in meditation. This is not a contact between souland personality (the goal of the average aspirant), but a contact between thefused soul and personality energy and the energy of the Monad, working throughthe Spiritual Triad. This does not constitute a moment of crisis, but is in thenature of a Flame of Light, a realisation of liberation, and a recognition ofthe esoteric fact that a man is himself the Way. There is no longer the sense ofpersonality and soul or of ego and form, but simply the One, functioning on allplanes as a point of spiritual energy and arriving at the one sphere of plannedactivity by means of the path of Light. In considering this process, words provecompletely inadequate. At this stage, when very advanced, there is no formattracting the Monad outwards into manifestation. There is no way in which thecall of matter or of form can evoke a response from the Monad. There remainsonly the great pull of the consciousness of humanity as a whole and to this,response can be made via the completed antahkarana. Down—or rather [495]across—this bridge, descent can be made at will, in order to serve humanity andto carry out the will of Shamballa.This is a statement of the final consummation. But before that can take place inits perfected completion, there must be a long period of gradual approach of thetwo aspects of the bridge—the higher, emanating from the Spiritual Triad, inresponse to monadic impulse, and the lower, emanating from the personality,aided by the soul—across the chasm of the separating mind. Finally, contactbetween that which the Monad projects and that which the disciple is projectingis made, and then come the fifth and sixth stages.5 and 6. Stabilisation and Resurrection. The bridge is now built. Thin andtenuous may be its strands at the beginning, but time and active understandingwill slowly weave thread after thread until the bridge stands finished, stableand strong and capable of being used. It must perforce be used, because there isnow no other medium of intercourse between the initiate and the One Whom he nowknows to be himself. He ascends in full consciousness into the sphere of monadiclife; he is resurrected from the dark cave of the personality life into theblazing light of divinity; he is no longer only a part of humanity and a memberalso of the Hierarchy, but he belongs to the great company of Those Whose willis consciously divine and Who are the Custodians of the Plan. They areresponsive to impression from Shamballa and are under the direction of the Headsof the Hierarchy.The “freedom of the three Centres” is Theirs. They can express at will thetriple energy of Humanity, the dual energy of the Hierarchy, and the one energyof Shamballa.Such, my brothers, is the goal of the disciple as he begins to work at thebuilding of the antahkarana. Reflect upon these matters and proceed with thework.(In some Talks to Disciples , the Tibetan makes the following remarks whichapply here with peculiar force. A.A.B.) [496]> “Your major need is for an intensification of your inner spiritual aspiration.> You need to work more definitely from what might be called a point of tension.> Study what is said about tension and intensity. It is intensity of purpose> which will change you from the plodding fairly satisfactory aspirant into the> disciple whose heart and mind are aflame. Perhaps, however, you prefer to go> forward steadily, with no group effort, making your work for me and for the> group an ordered part of the daily life, which you can adjust pretty much as> you like, and in which the life of the spirit receives its reasonable share,> in which the service aspect is not neglected, and your life presentation is> neatly balanced and carried forward without much real strain. When this is the> case, it may be your personality choice or your soul decision for a specific> life, but it means that you are not the disciple, with everything subordinated> to the life of discipleship.“I would like here to point out two things. First: if you can so change yourtension that you are driven by the life of the spirit, it will entail a galvanicupheaval in your inner life. For this, are you prepared? Secondly: it will notproduce any outer change in your environing relationships. Your outerobligations and interests must continue to be met, but I am talking in terms ofinner orientations, dynamic inner decisions, and an interior organising forservice and for sacrifice. Perhaps you prefer the slower and easier way? If thatis so, it is entirely your own affair, and you are still on your way. You arestill a constructive and useful person. I am simply here facing you with one ofthe crises which come in the life of all disciples, wherein choices have to bemade that are determining for a cycle, but for a cycle only . It ispre-eminently a question of speed and of organising for speed. This meanseliminating the non-essentials and concentrating on the essentials—the inneressentials, as they concern the soul and its relation to the personality, andthe outer ones as they concern you and your environment.“I would give you three key thoughts for deep reflection [497] during the nextsix months; will you ponder on them, one each month for three months, within thehead, and during the second three months brood on them in the heart. These keythoughts are:> 1. The necessity for speed.> 2. The reorganisation of standards of thought and of living.> 3. The expression of: Sincerity, Sacrifice, Simplicity.” (Discipleship in the> New Age. Vol I, p 358)In the many strands of light, woven by the aspirants, disciples and initiates ofthe world, we can see the group antahkarana gradually appearing—that bridgewhereby humanity as a whole will be able to abstract itself from matter andform. This building of the antahkarana is the great and ultimate service whichall true aspirants can render.The immediate Task aheadWhat I have now to say is in the nature of a generalisation. I would like toindicate, as far as possible (asking you to remember that all generalisationsare basically sound but erroneous in detail), the point where humanity stands inrelation to the antahkarana. It might be said that the whole goal of normalevolution is to bring humanity to the point where a direct line of contact isestablished between the personality and the Spiritual Triad, via the soul—orrather, through the medium of using the soul consciousness to achieve thisawareness. This is consummated at the time of the third initiation. We will nowfor a minute consider the Monad.I would remind you that there is an analogy in the relation between personalityand soul, to that between the Triad and the Monad. This is an analogy that isessentially complete, from the standpoint of consciousness, but not from thestandpoint of form. What finally takes place at the most advanced stage ofdevelopment is the complete fusion of the unified personality and soul with theunified Monad and Spiritual Triad. Only when this has been truly [498]accomplished is there the complete release of the Lives informing our solarsystem from all form control. Bear this carefully in mind, realising thesignificance of the word Service, used so frequently in the occult science, andrealising also the fact that, for aspirants and disciples, the immediate taskahead is:> 1. To bring about the at-one-ment of soul and body, through the medium of> alignment.> 2. To build the antahkarana, using the six modes or means outlined by me> previously, and thus evoke response to the Triad. The thought of> Alignment-Invocation-Evocation are the three major ideas for you to hold in> mind as we proceed with this study.The reason that I am giving out what was earlier regarded as some of thepreparatory work prior to the third initiation is due to the fact that the raceis now at the point of development which warrants complete change in theapproach to divinity as taught by the Hierarchy. This does not mean that pastteaching is abrogated, but it is shifted back to the earlier stages on the Pathof Discipleship, whilst the teaching given in those stages now becomes the workdone by the aspirants upon the Probationary Path. Emphasis has been laid uponpurification, upon the need for the development of the Christ life, upon themystical vision and upon philosophy. Occult truths have been given to the raceand have evoked much interest, criticism and discussion; they have appealed toall types of mind; they have been distorted and misapplied. Nevertheless, theyhave been instrumental in aiding advanced aspirants to move forward on to thePath of Discipleship, with a paralleling moving forward of accepted disciples.Once firmly established upon the Path, the truths become self-evident andindividual application and verification can be made, leading the discipleinevitably to the Portal of Initiation.The race as a whole stands now at the very entrance to the Path of Discipleship.The racial gaze is forward to the vision, whether it is the vision of the soul,a vision of a better way of life, of an improved economic situation, or of [499]better inter-racial relationship. That this vision is oft distorted, that it ismaterially oriented or only partially seen is sadly true; but in some form oranother there exists today an appreciable grasp of the “new and desirable” bythe masses—a thing hitherto unknown. In the past, it was the intelligentsia orthe elect who were privileged to have the vision. Today, it is the mass of men.Humanity, therefore, as a whole stands ready for a general alignment process,and that is the spiritual reason which lay behind the world war. The “sharpshears of sorrow must separate the real from the unreal; the lash of pain mustawaken the sleepy soul to exquisite life; the wrenching away of the roots oflife from the soil of selfish desire must be undergone, and then the man standsfree.” So runs the Old Commentary in one of its more mystical stanzas. Thus itpoints prophetically to the close of the Aryan Race—not a close in the sense ofcompletion, but a closing of a cycle of mental perfecting, preparatory to acycle wherein the mind will be rightly used as an instrument of alignment, thenas the searchlight of the soul, and as the controller of the personality.For the masses—under the slow processes of evolution—the next step forward isthe aligning of the soul and the form, so that there can be a blending inconsciousness, following on a mental appreciation of the Christ principle andits deep expression in the life of the race. This is something which can be seenquite clearly emerging, if you have the eyes to see. It is evident in theuniversal interest in goodwill, leading eventually to peace; this desire forpeace may be based on individual or national selfishness, or upon a true desireto see a happier world wherein man can lead a fuller spiritual life and base hisefforts on truer values; it can be seen in all the planning which is going onfor a new world order, based on human liberty, belief in human rights and righthuman relations; it is demonstrating also in the work of the great humanitarianmovements, the welfare organisations, and the widespread evocation of the humanmind through the network of educational institutions throughout the world. TheChrist spirit is expressively present, [500] and the failure to recognise thisfact has been largely due to the prevalent human effort to explain and interpretthis phrase solely in terms of religion, whereas the religious interpretation isbut one mode of understanding Reality. There are others of equal importance. Allthe great avenues of approach to Reality are spiritual in nature andinterpretive of divine purpose, and whether the religious Christian speaks ofthe Kingdom of God, or the humanitarian emphasises the brotherhood of man, orthe leaders against evil head the fight for the new world order or for the FourFreedoms or the Atlantic Charter, they all express the emergence of the love ofGod in its form of the spirit of Christ.Humanity in the mass has therefore reached a point of emergence from darkness;it has itself evoked the reaction of the powers of evil, and hence their attemptto arrest the progress of the human spirit and to stop the onward march of thegood, the true and the beautiful.Aspirants and probationary disciples are occupied with a definite process offocussing their consciousness in the soul. This process falls into two parts:> An intensification of the personality life, so that it is developed to its> highest individualistic powers.> A process of moving forward into the light and of conscious soul contact.This involves the earlier stage of the alignment process, which is a mode offocussed, concentrated effort, according to the ray and life purpose of thesoul. This may take the form of a profound application to some scientificendeavour or a deep concentration on the spiritual work of the world, or it maybe a complete dedication to humanitarian effort; it matters not. I would callyour attention to that statement. In every case the motivating power must bebetterment; it must be carried forward by extreme effort; but—given right motiveand the effort to develop simultaneously a good character and a stablepurpose—the aspirant or probationary disciple will eventually find that he hassucceeded in establishing a definite soul relation; he will have discovered that[501] the path of contact between soul and brain, via the mind, has been opened,and that he has mastered the first stage in the needed alignment process.When this has been accomplished, the man passes on to the Path of Discipleshipand can undertake the work I am outlining for you in this treatise. Thus you cansee how the entire human family has reached a central and most important pointupon the evolutionary path. The immediate path ahead for all—each in his ownplace—is to stand with right orientation, undeterred by circumstances, and thenunflinchingly move forward.I have given you the six methods of building the antahkarana, and as we proceedto take up our next point, I would have you refer to them at frequent intervals.The ray methods with which we shall be concerned are the methods, uniquelypossible on the seven major lines of emanatory energy, which differing ray typeswill bring to bear on these six stages of the building process. All disciples onall these seven rays use the same building technique of Intention,Visualisation, Projection, Invocation and Evocation, Stabilisation andResurrection. Of these the first two are uniform in technique for all the rays,but when the stage of Projection is reached, then the ray techniques begin todiffer, and it is these techniques or methods of ray work, coupled with theseven Words of Power, which we shall now proceed to consider.The Seven Ray Methods used in the Construction ProcessUntil the stage of projection is reached, the methods employed by all discipleson all rays are identical. Their intention is one, and they all have to attainthe same measure of tension and of preparation for the construction of thebridge by gathering the needed energy from two sources—the personality and thesoul. By this focussing and its resultant tension, by thus evoking the SpiritualTriad and starting the dual process of building from both ends of the bridge (ifsuch a phrase is possible and permissible), the work goes forward uniformly. Theuse of the creative imagination [502] is now called forth and this forms thesecond stage. This presents a real difficulty for the first ray and the seventhray aspirants. Neither type can with facility organise the material energy,orient energy currents, and see their objective clearly in the mind's eyepictorially. It is a process which is profoundly difficult for them. It must,however, in some way be done, because the use of the visual imagination is anessential factor in the building process and one of the major means offocussing, prior to projection.This process of projection falls into three main activities:1. After due focussing and after careful, sequential and systematic picturingthe “rainbow bridge,” the disciple—by a distinct and separate effort—calls inthe will aspect of his nature, as far as he can in this incarnation. It is inthis connection that the differing ray methods make their appearance, thedifference being determined by the quality of the ray life.2. The disciple has to preserve steadily the triple consciousness, not simplytheoretically but also factually, so that three paralleling lines of thought, orthree streams of active energy, are used by him simultaneously:> a. He is aware of himself, personality and soul, as occupied with the process> of bridge building. He never for one second loses his sense of conscious> identity.> b. He is aware of the point of focussed tension which he has succeeded in> producing and that three streams of energy have contributed to it—the focussed> energy of the personality, poised in the lower concrete mind, the inflowing> magnetic energy of the soul, streaming out from the twelve petals of the three> tiers plus the innermost tier of the egoic lotus, and the energy of the “jewel> in the lotus”—all streaming into the centre of tension on the mental levels of> the lower mind.> c. He is aware of as much of the consciousness of his ray energy as can enter> into his awareness; this is his egoic ray energy and not personality force. He> endeavours to see himself as a point of particular energy [503] coloured by> his ray life, and carefully bears in mind that the energy of his egoic ray is> the major energy through which the Monad is attempting to express itself, and> also that his threefold egoic vehicle is a reflection of and closely related> to the three aspects of the Spiritual Triad. It is this relation (and its> conscious interplay and effect) which is evoked by the building of the> antahkarana, and which eventually (when it is powerful enough) brings into> radiant activity the “jewel in the lotus.”3. When these three stages of realisation have been completed as far as thedisciple feels he is capable of carrying them, then and only then does heprepare himself for the distinctive use of his ray method in preparing for the“projecting sound” or Word of Power.You can see from all the above that this constitutes a definitely plannedprocess of a basic scientific nature, and requires as careful following as theprocedure of any scientist in search of some advanced chemical formula. The onlydifference, scientifically speaking, is that the whole process is carriedforward upon subjective levels and in the realm of consciousness, thus requiringa consciousness and a concentration not needed when working more tangibly on theouter plane of awareness. At first it seems complicated, as the disciple triesto master the different stages of the process, but it all becomes entirelyautomatic when once mastered. Here is a summary of process up to the point ofdefinite projection:> I. Intention, producing focussing and tension.> II. Visualisation, produced by:> 1. The buddhic activity of “impression.”> 2. The tension of the mental body.> 3. The imaginative processes of the astral body.> III. Projection:> 1. The calling in of the Will aspect.> 2. The preservation of a triple state of awareness in order that: [504]> > a. The disciple is aware constantly of his own identity.> > b. He is conscious of a fixed point of tension.> > c. He is aware actively of his soul ray or his soul energy.> 3. He starts in to use that distinctive ray energy correctly.> 4. He then, when all the above is completed, uses the Word of Power which is> the agent of his Will.This short tabulation should aid in the process, and you can see how stage growsout of stage and how, once familiarity has been established, it should bepossible for the preliminary work to be rapidly carried forward.When, however, the distinctive methods of the ray energy of the disciple reachthe point of definite use, it is not so simple as it sounds. Success in thebuilding process is dependent upon the ability of the disciple to do threethings:1. Hold the mind steady in the light, i.e., preserving the point of tension atits highest possible point at any given time in the disciple's unfoldment andbuilding activity.2. Register consciousness of soul contact, thus bringing about an increasingfusion between the soul and the personality, so that complete at-one-ment isincreasingly attained. Technically, this means that the energy of the soul rayand of the personality ray merge together, with the soul ray dominating always.3. Hold in mind, specifically and in detail, the method to be employed inbuilding the bridge, according to the particular ray technique, and with theobjective in view of relating (in a new and significant manner, factually andnot just theoretically) the Spiritual Triad and the personality.The soul, therefore, as a separate entity, is fading slowly out of the picturebecause it is being absorbed into and by the personality, which is becoming moreand more the soul in incarnation. Eventually the relation is established between[505] spirit (Monad) and personality (form or matter), with a tiny point ofconsciousness eternally present which is aware of both these factors and yetpreserves inviolate its own identity. This latter realisation is the result ofaeonian work, carried forward by the soul. Paradoxically, we say that the soulfades or drops out, yet in the last analysis it remains, for in this solarsystem there is naught else but only this consciousness of being .One point I would touch upon here before taking up the seven ray methods ofprojection. The bridge to be built is called frequently the “rainbow bridge”because it is constituted of all the colours of the seven rays. Speakingspecifically and from the angle of the disciple, the bridge which he buildsbetween the personality and the Spiritual Triad is composed of seven strands ofenergy, or seven streams of force; he uses all the seven rays, having gainedfacility in so doing because again and again his personality has (in the longcycle of incarnations) been on all the seven rays many times. But his soul raydominates eventually, and in the rainbow bridge the “colours of his rays areheard vibrating; the note of his ray is seen.” The bridge built by humanity as awhole is one bridge composed of the multiplicity of individual bridges, built bythe many disciples. It is therefore formed eventually of seven strands orstreams of energy coming from the seven egoic groups (one group of each raytype). To this bridge the creative work of all human beings who reach the stageof soul contact contributes. Their dominant strands of light fuse into one wholeand their lesser strands are lost to sight in the radiant light of the sevenfoldbridge which humanity will eventually complete.Even in this finally completed bridge—at the end of the world cycle—one raylight and colour will predominate, the second ray, with the fourth ray as thesubsidiary ray. The fourth ray might be symbolically called “the main cable” forhumanity, because it is the dominant note of the Fourth Creative Hierarchy. Nowlet us take up the seven ray methods, one by one.[506] As we consider these seven ray techniques with their accompanying Words ofPower, you must bear carefully in mind that we are dealing entirely with theWill aspect. This necessitates a higher process of alignment and the evocationof a divine aspect hitherto relatively quiescent, except in so far as the willfinds its reflection in the activity of the sacrifice petals of the egoic lotus,plus its distorted shadow in the mind nature. This consequently posits a fairlyhigh stage of spiritual unfoldment upon the part of the builder of theantahkarana; it means that there are indications of it (to say the least)between the mind, the sacrifice petals and the atmic principle. This may besimply the most tenuous thread imaginable, a thousand times finer than agossamer web, but it must inevitably be present. When, from the angle of theesotericist, this is a tangible fact, you will then have the following directcontact:> [Image00008.jpg]This contact, when completed, marks an entire unit of spiritual work, if I mightso word it, bringing the man upon the physical plane into complete alignment;this unity is consummated at the time of the fourth initiation, the GreatRenunciation at which time the first aspect begins to dominate the other two.Then the soul life—as hitherto understood—fades out and the causal bodydisappears. The sum total of memory, [507] quality and acquirements is thenabsorbed into the Monad. The words “I and my Father are one” become true. Theastral body also vanishes in the same great process of renunciation, and thephysical body (as an automatic agent of the vital body) is no longer needed,though it persists and serves a purpose when so required by the Monad. From theform aspect, you then have the Monad, the sphere of the Spiritual Triad and theetheric body upon the physical plane. I would here remind you that the levels ofconscious existence which we regard as formless are only relatively so, becauseour seven planes are the seven subplanes of the cosmic physical plane. Thecentre of consciousness is now in the Will nature, when this point of attainmentis reached, and is no longer in the love nature. Activity and love are stillpresent in full measure, but the focus of the initiate's attention is in thewill aspect of divinity.It has been said in an ancient book belonging to the Masters' Archives that:“The preservation of values is the task of the initiate of the first ray; theattainment of positivity is the goal of the initiate of the second ray. He whoworks upon the third ray must reach the path from here to there.The initiate of the fourth ray arrives at the will aspect when conflict stepsinto its rightful place and causes no undue concern. These four attainments markthe goal for men and sway them all upon the lower point of consciousness. Theray of vision and of application indicates the way direct, evokes the will tofollow, and welds the love of God, the love of man and all that breathes intothe purpose underlying all, and towards that purpose and its earthlyconsummation the seventh ray gives all it has.”It has not been easy to put these abstruse ideas, expressed in the most archaiclanguage and symbolism, into modern terms and words. I have but conveyed thegeneral idea—the collaboration of all the seven rays in the building processesof Deity and their planned interaction, on a tiny scale, [508] infinitesimal incomparison with the great Whole. Man responds within the circle of humanity,enclosed within the greater circle of the Hierarchy, and becomes conscious ofthis fusion and uses the potencies of both groups of lives, through the mediumof the antahkarana. The moment the disciple approaches that point inconsciousness and the antahkarana is firmly anchored (even if as yet but atenuous structure), he becomes aware of the factor of the greater circle whichencloses the other two—Shamballa, the Secret Place where the will of God isformulated for the immediate present and for the long range future.With this vision and suggested preamble let us now ascertain the seventechniques to be employed at the projection stage of the building process.Ray One...Will or PowerTo understand the first ray technique, the basic quality of the ray must begrasped. It is dynamic. The point at the centre is the First Ray of Power, andits technique is never to move from the centre but from that point to workdynamically. Perhaps the word that would best express its mode of work isInspiration. The Father inspires response from the material aspect, or from theMother if you like that symbolism, but it accomplishes this by remainingimmovably itself. From the point where he is, the Builder (human or divine)works, not by the Law of Attraction, as does the second ray, but by the Law ofSynthesis, by a fiat of the will, based on a clearly formulated purpose andprogramme. You will see, therefore, that the first ray personality has toascertain (as in fact do all disciples) which aspect he himself is of aparticular ray. It is not possible for any disciple who has not taken the thirdinitiation to ascertain his monadic ray, but any disciple building theantahkarana, and who has reached the stage of projection, should know his soulray and his personality ray, and should remember that their fused or blendedpotency must perform the act of projection. The energy of the Monad can beevoked, but it results in a down-pouring towards its [509] working agent and itis not an act of projection per se. The act of projection is the work of the“shadow and the reflection.” The Old Commentary says in this connection, whendealing with the Word of Power for each ray:“When there is no shadow, for the Sun is clear, and no reflection for the wateris no more, then naught remains but the one who stands with eyes directing lifeand form. The threefold shadow now is one. The three of self exists no more. Thehigher three descends and all the nine are one. Await the time.”When, therefore, the ray of the soul dominates the ray of the personality, thenthe self becomes the acting agent, aided by the ray of the lower self. The raysof the three vehicles are no longer active, but only the basic duality of souland personality remains, and there is no lesser differentiation.In considering all these seven rays, I seek to do three things in every case:1. Give the technique of projection. This technique falls into four stages:> a. The preparatory stage in which the consciousness becomes focussed in the> soul ray.> b. An interlude in which the projecting agent realises with intensity the> existence of the “point of tension” and the finished product of the> visualisation process.> c. A focussed activity of the will, according to the ray, in which a line of> light or of living substance is imaginatively and creatively sent out or> projected from the mental unit, as far as possible towards the Spiritual> Triad, using constantly the creative imagination.> d. This line of light (this strand or bridge) is then pictured as coloured by> the two ray qualities, and it is held stably aligned in the light of the> Spiritual Triad—not the light of the soul. This corresponds to the much> earlier stage of development in which the mind was held steady in the light.> The mind still is held in this manner, but the mind (as the agent of the soul> and the [510] personality) is no longer quiescent, but itself becomes an> active holding agent.2. Indicate briefly the effect of the Word of Power. When adequate stability hasbeen acquired, the disciple utters a Word of Power which serves to carry thelight still further on and up. When correctly uttered, this Word produces threeeffects:> a. It keeps the channel for the descending light of the Spiritual Triad clear> of all impediments.> b. It reaches (by means of its vibratory activity) the centre of power which> we call the Spiritual Triad, focussed temporarily in the manasic permanent> atom, and evokes a response in the form of a thread of descending triadal> light.> c. It causes a vibration throughout the antahkarana which in its turn evokes> response from the “rainbow bridge” as built by all other disciples. Thus the> work of constructing the racial antahkarana is furthered.I am here doing two things—speaking to you in symbols. There is, literallyspeaking, no up or down or higher and lower, as you know, nor do any of theseparative actions as outlined by the occult sciences exist. Yet the truth hasto be thus presented owing to the mind consciousness of the disciple. I havealso been giving in human terms the outline of a process which, if adequatelyfollowed, will enable you to make real progress in the preparatory understandingrequired by all who hope some day to take initiation.3. This brings us to the third point, the nature of initiation. Initiation fallsreally into three major expansions of consciousness.> a. The expansion of consciousness of the dedicated personality into that of> the soul; this is completely consummated at the third initiation.> b. The expansion of this fused and blended consciousness [511] into that of> the Spiritual Triad, completely consummated at the fifth initiation.> c. The expansion of consciousness toward which the Masters are working, which> is consummated at the seventh initiation.Students today have made much progress towards the control of the personality,and the disciples in the world are now so numerous that the hierarchicalemphasis is today upon the states of consciousness which follow the thirdinitiation. Hence the giving out to the public of the teaching upon theantahkarana.You will find below, in tabulated form, the teaching anent the six stages sothat you may have a visual picture of the intended process. The following of theprocess is, of course, another matter and its success is dependent upon morethan a theoretical grasp of process. It is dependent upon your ability to livemore definitely in the world of meaning than hitherto, upon your knowledge ofyour soul and personality rays and upon your capacity to focus in your blendedconsciousness, and from that point—holding the mind steady in the light—utterthe Word of Power which will carry your created thread of light forward towardsthe Spiritual Triad.OUTLINE FOR REFLECTIVE CONTEMPLATION ON CONSTRUCTING THE ANTAHKARANAI. Points to have in mind.This work of construction concerns the handling of energy. Students shouldponder upon the distinction between energy and force.It is dependent upon the use of the creative imagination. Students would do wellto reflect upon the relationship of the imagination to the intuition and of bothto the mind.The work of building the antahkarana must be done with as much consciousunderstanding as possible. [512]II. The six steps or methods of building the Antahkarana.1. Intention.> a. The achieving of right orientation> Towards the soul> Towards the Spiritual Triad> b. A mental understanding of the work to be done is necessary.> c. A ring-pass-not of consciously gathered energies must be created and held> in a state of tension.> d.

Resurrection and Ascension.> This is the rising up of the consciousness out of soul and personality> limitations (from the angle of the monad) and its passing into that of the> Spiritual Triad.Here I would touch upon one important point connected with all Words of Power. Icould give you these words in their ancient Sensa form, but it would not bepossible for me to teach, through the medium of writing, their ancient andpeculiar pronunciation or the note upon which they should be sounded forth. Thisused to be regarded of supreme importance. Today, disciples are being taught towork far more upon the inner planes of meaning and not to depend, as heretofore,upon the outer activity of sound. Remember that you are not creating now uponthe outer plane. The physical sound or sounds are therefore of relatively noimportance. What does matter is the ability of the disciple to fee l the meaningof the Word of Power as he silently utters it. It is the quality of his ideawhich will bring the right effect, and not the way in which he makes a soundwith the aid of his vocal cords and his mouth. Students have been taught thatthe A.U.M. sounded inaudibly and listened for, is of greater potency than whensounded audibly. This was preparatory to the utterance of these Words of Power.They have been learning the significance of the O.M., even if they did notrealise it. This was all in preparation for the use of the Ray Words. It is thethought behind the form, the registered feeling anent the words, and theunderstanding of their significance which are of importance; it is the abilityto think, to feel and silently to send out the call of quality to quality, ofmeaning to meaning, of nature to nature, of form to spirit which matters,remembering ever that that which is found upon the physical plane is not aprinciple. The physical sound is not that which will lead to a successfulbuilding of the antahkarana. It is the quality of a particular [514] type ofsubjective nature (the soul ray as it dominates the personality ray) which makesappeal to that which is still more subjective; that is what in truthaccomplishes the work. It should be borne in mind that from the angle of theSpiritual Triad the soul nature is definitely objective. This is a statement ofoccult fact which will be better understood when the nature of man (as taught inthe occult sciences) is admitted by thinkers, scientists and psychologists.The point I wish to make is that no particular word is going to be given by me,because it would be useless. The O.M. is useless to most people, even thoughtrained students may now be deriving benefit from its use. This generaluselessness is caused not only because people do not use the Word correctly, butalso because, even when using it they are not holding its significance firmly intheir consciousness. So it is with a Word of Power. Of what use would it be if Iattempted to give the Word of the first ray, which looks (when presented in itssymbolic written form) something like this—UKRTAPKLSTI? Certain sounds in thisword-form are omitted because there is no way of depicting them, since they areneither vowels nor consonants. Correctly sounded, the above forms three words.But I can give, as far as possible, the English equivalent in meaning , and itis this meaning which I ask you to have in mind as you mentally utter the soundor Word of Power and visually attempt to see it performing the esoteric miracleof bridge building.The first ray disciple has, therefore, to meet the requirements to the best ofhis ability and to follow the four stages of the technique of projection (pages489-493, 509). When he has faithfully followed this outlined routine,personality and soul fusion has to be consciously attempted and to some measureachieved, and then these blended factors are held steady in the triadal light.Another point of focussed intention is now brought about, resulting in a new andstill more dynamic tension. In the completed silence which results, the act ofprojecting the antahkarana is performed, [515] and it is then carried forward onthe impetus of a Word of Power. The symbolism connected with this lies behindthe Masonic usage of the words, translated into English, “So mote it be,”uttered with the right hand stretched forth and signifying the embodied will ofthe Lodge, itself a symbol of the Will and Purpose of the Most High.The meaning of the Word of Power to be used at this point of accomplishedprojection might be summed up in the words: “I ASSERT THE FACT.” This is thenearest form I can give you for the word-form earlier mentioned. A little deepreflection on these words will show that if uttered with an understanding oftheir meaning, they are of terrific potency. The disciple who utters themassumes and then asserts:> 1. The Spiritual Triad is a fact.> 2. The relation between the fused and blended personality and the soul is a> fact.> 3. The antahkarana is also a fact.> 4. The dual expression of the basic duality of manifestation—personality or> form and Monad or Spirit—is a fact.> 5. The will of the Monad is the factor to be evoked.> 6. The knowing, purposeful One can be depended upon to contact the instrument> of its will upon the physical plane.> 7. The work is done.This factual assumption is not faith, but knowledge and conviction, and uponthis realised conviction the disciple rests, acts and depends. It becomes anunalterable and unchangeable attitude. The meaning of the above seven-foldstatement will become clearer if the disciple will ponder the distinctionbetween faith and conviction. It is this divine assertion which holds theuniverse in being; it is this divine assertion which is the embodied summationof all knowledge and love, and the first ray disciple must begin to use thistechnique, resting back upon his divine prerogative of assertion. Ponder on thisstatement. It is the [516] technique of Shamballa and the established right,prerogative and privilege of all first ray souls.Ray Two...Love-WisdomAgain the first two stages of Intention and Visualisation have been carefullyfollowed and the four stages of the Projection have been carried through totheir highest point. The vivid light of the second ray soul (the most vivid inthis second ray solar system) dominates the light of form and radiates out tothe triadal light. Then comes a moment of intense concentration and the peculiarWord of Power of the second ray is enunciated. Of this Word, the dual symbolSXPRULXS takes form in the mind of the disciple and signifies the assertion: “ISEE THE GREATEST LIGHT.” This statement has relation to the Central SpiritualSun and not to the Heart of the Sun; it involves, if I might so express it, themost intense effort to see in the light the relation of the whole, and this isone of the most potent experiences to which the disciple can be subjected. It isnot vision or even aspiration to see the vision. It is complete sight and ofthis the Masonic symbol of the “Eye of God,” the “All-Seeing Eye,” is theexpression. It involves realisation of the light of the divine countenance; ofthis the light of the soul is the dim reflection. The disciple has learnt thesignificance of solar and lunar light (soul and form light), but this issomething other. It is the great obliterating light of reality itself, revealingthe fact of the higher Lighted Way which leads to Nirvana; Of this, theprojected antahkarana is the stage first consciously realised by the disciple.I am faced with difficulty in making these Words of Power clear to you, becauseessentially it is the Word made flesh or the soul in incarnation which at thispoint registers power; it is the symbol (the form aspect) and the power (theSpirit aspect) which acts as a great creative agency and bridges across allbarriers and separative states of consciousness, thus establishing completeunity.I have indicated to you certain vowels and consonants [517] which are thenearest approach which I can make to making these Words clear, and I have doneso in the case of the first and second rays. I shall give you no others, as itis entirely useless. I shall only give you the significances, the conceptsinvolved and the meaning of which these archaic word-forms (which I haveattempted to portray in Anglo-Saxon letters) are the embodiment. As the racepasses more and more into the world of meaning, these word-forms assume less andless importance, and only the concentrated thought, based on understandingcomprehension, can achieve the results. It is into this somewhat new form ofwork we are now pioneering.Ray Three... Active IntelligenceThe processes of Intention and Visualisation have been followed, and again thefour stages of the Projection technique have been concluded. At the point ofhighest tension, the disciple utters the Word of Power for the third ray. It isnot easy for the disciple on this ray to achieve the necessary focal point ofsilence; his intense fluidity leads to many words or to great mental activity,frequently carried forward under the impulse of glamour. This lessens thepotency of what he seeks to do. But when he has succeeded in achieving “mentalsilence” and is simply a point of intelligent concentration, then he can use theWord of Power with great effectiveness. The difficulty is that he has toovercome the tendency to use it with the idea of physical plane results in hisconsciousness. Always he works from the angle of that divine quality whichcharacterises matter; just as the second ray disciple works always from theangle of quality and the first ray disciple from the positivity of spirit. Butonce he intuitively comprehends and factually grasps the concept thatspirit-matter are one reality, and once he has achieved within himself thesublimation of matter, then he can divorce himself from all that the human beingunderstands in relation to form. He can then utter the Word of Power which willmake possible his complete identification with spirit, via the antahkarana. Thisword is “PURPOSE ITSELF AM I”[518] As regards the other and remaining Words of Power connected with the fourRays of Attribute, I shall simply list them, as there is little that I can sayabout them. They can be comprehended in the light of what I have said anent thethree Words of Power used upon the Rays of Aspect.> Ray Four...Harmony through Conflict> “TWO MERGE WITH ONE”> Ray Five...Concrete Knowledge or Science> “THREE MINDS UNITE”> (This asserts the fact that the Universal Mind, the higher mind and the lower> concrete mind are blended through the projected antahkarana.)> Ray Six...Devotion or Idealism> “THE HIGHEST LIGHT CONTROLS”> Ray Seven...Ceremonial Law or Order> “THE HIGHEST AND THE LOWEST MEET”You will note that in all these Words of Power, two obvious thoughts emerge;first, that the goal of all activity is the complete fusion of the threeAspects, and secondly, that consciousness of this comes through the building anduse of the bridge between the Spiritual Triad and the Personality. You will notethat these are all definite assertions, based on knowledge leading toconviction. The various schools of affirmation found today throughout the worldare but the distorted efforts of humanity to arrive at the affirmative positionwhich the blended soul and personality always necessarily assumes, anddemonstrate a kind of instinctual reaction to a new realisation which is cominginto the consciousness of humanity, via its disciples and initiates.We have practically concluded our study of the antahkarana; however, I want toenlarge a little further upon the three final stages of the building process asdealt with and outlined earlier. These three stages were most brieflyconsidered, owing to their abstract nature. They are part, however, of the sixbuilding methods. The first [519] three were considered in greater detail thanthe last three, and I have felt that it might serve a useful purpose if I gavemore teaching anent Invocation and Evocation in particular, for it willcondition—consciously and exoterically—the new world religion, as it hashitherto conditioned it esoterically and unconsciously.Invocation and Evocation (continued from pages 493-495):These two words are descriptive of that mysterious something—emanation,voiceless appeal, inherent urge towards the light—which is innate in all forms,which produces interplay and relationship, and which is the cause of allprogress or pushing forward along the path of an expanding consciousness and apenetration into the light. This is true of a plant pushing its way out of thedarkness of earth into the light of the sun, a child extricating itself underthe life impulse from the womb of its mother, of the human being pushing himselfinto realms of greater knowledge and effective physical living, of the aspirantdriving forward out of the Hall of Learning into the Hall of Wisdom, of thedisciple penetrating into the realm of soul light and life, of the initiatepassing from grade to grade in the Hierarchy of Liberation, of the Christ movingon into the Council Chamber of Shamballa, and of the Lord of the World Himselfundertaking those processes which will lead Him into realms of divine life—ofwhich even the highest initiate on our planet has no conception. All comes aboutas part of a great system of invocation and evocation, of appeal and response,and all are distinctive of the “mode of Life” which governs the entire gradedhierarchy of Being upon our planet.This evolutionary pushing forward along the Lighted Way, out of darkness intolight, from the unreal to the real, and from death to immortality, is aninherent urge in all forms. It constitutes one of the most subtle and one of theleast understood laws of the universe, being related to the Life principle, ofwhich we know as yet naught; it underlies the Law of Evolution as well as theLaw of Karma [520] and is, in reality, the Law of the Life Purpose of theplanetary Logos; it is an expression of His dynamic intention as it forces allsubstance in manifestation and in time and space to act and react in conformityto His Will. He thus enables His form—the planet which is a compound of all theseven kingdoms in nature—to express logoic intention for the “duration of theGreat Breath”; of this breath, time and space are the two aspects. It affectsthe tiniest atom and the most exalted Being within the sphere of Hisconsciousness and the scope of His livingness; it affects the subhuman kingdoms,unconsciously to them, and is (in relation to them) sometimes spoken of as “theLaw of Life of the Sun.” The human family, after the stage of personalityintegration is reached, reacts with increasing consciousness of the divinepurpose. Once the antahkarana is constructed and the higher initiations aretaken, the initiate then cooperates with that purpose in full understanding andintention. He no longer simply reacts to his own interior urges, which force himever to invoke the higher aspect of life and of consciousness which he senses onahead. He now knows. He sees; he participates in the Plan; he relates himself tothe divine Intention through an understanding of the doctrine or Science ofTension; he makes the divine Intention his, as far as he can grasp it. Thisreciprocal interplay produces the mutability of form and the immutability of thedivine nature which is distinctive of those liberated Consciousnesses which havefreed Themselves from the prison of form.Elsewhere (The Reappearance of the Christ. p 157-158) I said that “Thedefinition of religion, which will in the future prove of greater accuracy thanany yet formulated by the theologians, might be expressed as follows:> Religion is the name given to the invocative appeal of humanity and the> evocative response of the greater Life to that cry.It is, in fact, the recognition by the part of its relationship to the Whole,plus a constantly growing demand for increased [521] awareness of that relation;it draws forth the recognition of the Whole that the demand has been made. It isthe impact of the vibration of humanity—oriented specifically to the Great Lifeof which it feels itself a part—upon that Life, and the responsive impact ofthat “All surrounding Love” upon the lesser vibration. It is only now that theimpact of the human vibration can dimly be sensed in Shamballa; hitherto itsmost potent activity has only reached the Hierarchy. Religion, the science ofinvocation and evocation as far as humanity is concerned, is the approach (inthe coming New Age) of a mentally polarised humanity. In the past, religion hashad an entirely emotional appeal. It concerned the relation of the individual tothe world of reality, of the seeking aspirant to the sought-for divinity. Itstechnique was the process of fitting oneself for the revelation of thatdivinity, of achieving a perfection which would warrant that revelation, and ofdeveloping a sensitivity and a loving response to the ideal Man, summarised forpresent day humanity in the Christ.Christ came to end the cycle of this emotional approach which had existed sinceAtlantean days; He demonstrated in Himself the visioned perfection and thenpresented to humanity an example—in full manifestation—of every possibilitylatent in man up to that time . The achieving of the perfection of theChrist-consciousness became the emphasised goal of humanity.”The activity of all previous Teachers and demonstrating Sons of God became onlythe presentation of the various aspects of a divine perfection which the Christsummarised in Himself. But He did far more than just this. Had this been allthat He accomplished, He would have presented to humanity a picture of a staticachievement, a culmination of perfection such as the evolutionary status of manat that time demanded; He would have given us, in fact, a Figure of very great,but at the same time, arrested development. This was of course impossible, butthe religion which He founded has never recognised this fact or considered whatlay beyond Christ, what was the nature of His [522] subjective background andwhat was His point of achievement, and whether He still had other possibilities.This was perhaps an unavoidable omission owing to the fact that the idea ofevolution was unknown until relatively very late, in the human consciousness.Orthodox religion has been preoccupied with an emotional and aspirationalapproach to this Figure of Perfection; it has not looked beyond the Figure tothe Reality which He represents. This Christ Himself foresaw as a possibility,and sought to obviate when He pointed out to His disciples that they could do“greater things” than He had done, because He was going “to the Father.” He, inthose words, pointed beyond Himself to the One Who was responsible for HisBeing, and to the Way of the Higher Evolution—a subject with which the churchhas never satisfactorily dealt. In the above words He indicated a state of beingwhich He had never demonstrated on earth, owing to the unpreparedness of man,and also to the fact that He Himself was only “on His Way.”The Way of the Higher Evolution has also its two phases, as has the Lighted Way.In the early stages of the unfoldment of the Christ consciousness and in theattainment of the third initiation, the Transfiguration, the aspirant and theinitiate-disciple pass along the first part of the Path of Discipleship. In thetreading of the Way of the Higher Evolution (for which we have as yet only thissomewhat cumbersome name) the initiate-disciple treads the Way of Antahkaranaand the Way of the Higher Initiations. In making this statement I would againremind you that the third initiation is regarded by the Hierarchy as the firstmajor initiation, whilst the two previous initiations are considered as onlypreparatory in their nature. The training given in preparation for them, and theconsequent expansions of consciousness, reveal to the initiate the nature of thesoul, the scope (widespread and universal) of the divine consciousness, and hisrelation to the Father, the Monad. They enable him to become the soul inmanifestation to such an extent that his awareness is definitely and unalterably[523] that of the soul; at the fourth initiation the soul-body, the causalvehicle, is no longer needed, and it then disappears, dissipates, and isentirely destroyed, thus leaving the initiate free to tread the Way of theHigher Evolution and to follow in the footsteps of the Christ. He was the firstof our planetary humanity to blaze the trail (is not that a phrase much used?)to the higher spheres of revelation.I would here also remind you that, during this stage of human evolution, allthese various phases exist simultaneously; this largely accounts for therelative differences and difficulties which characterise all the religions ofthe world and all relationships. Emotional appeal is needed by the masses, andtheir goal—some way ahead—is soul consciousness and soul control. It is themystical way and the way of the early and preparatory stages of the science ofInvocation and Evocation. It is the method to be followed by average humanity atthis time, because men are largely Atlantean in their approach and theirnatures; they must learn to tread the Path by becoming the Path Itself, and inthis way develop the mechanism and the capacities which are inherent in thedivine Mind, which “spins the thread of connecting light and relates all beingswithin the planetary ring-pass-not into Itself.”By becoming the Path, symbolically speaking, and by a process of reorientation,the aspirant who is seeking to tread the Lighted Way of purification and ofdiscipleship reaches a point where that light and that path have brought him toa specific goal. Then the light which he has generated from within himself, andis learning rapidly to use, reveals to him the Way of the Higher Evolution, thefact of a still greater goal further on ahead—called by the Christ “the Father'sHouse.”At the fourth initiation he becomes aware, for the first time in his experience,that there is a hiatus or gap separating him from his distant goal. Thisconstituted the major part of the agony upon the Cross. There was a fusion ofagonies at that supreme moment, if I might attempt to express what occurred. TheMaster Jesus, crucified there, [524] felt the agony of human need and renouncedHis own life and gave His all (again symbolically speaking) to meet that need.The Christ, at that time over-shadowing His great Disciple, also passedsimultaneously through a great initiatory experience. The agony of His yearningfor revelation and increased enlightenment (in order to enhance His equipment asWorld Saviour) revealed to Him the new possibilities, from which—when confrontedwith them dimly in the garden of Gethsemane and later upon the Cross—His wholenature shrank.Great as is this mystery to you, and impossible as it is for you to comprehendthat whereof I speak, it is wise to establish the fact in your consciousnessthat at the Crucifixion initiation, the Master Jesus took the fourth initiationand the Christ took the sixth initiation. The Master Jesus reached theculminating experience of the Lighted Way, whilst the Christ made that finaleffort which enabled Him entirely to complete and traverse the “rainbow bridge”and to “go to the Father” (as He told His disciples), thus moving forward on tothe first stage of the Way of the Higher Evolution.The practical point for aspirants and disciples to remember is that the Scienceof Invocation and Evocation entered a new phase when Christ came and presentedHimself before humanity; He then gave the teaching which summarised all the pastand indicated the new aspects of the future teaching. He opened the door to theWay of the Higher Evolution, hitherto closed, just as the Buddha epitomised inHimself the achievements of the Lighted Way and the attainment of all knowledgeand wisdom. Christ, in opening this “greater door beyond the lesser door,”anchored—if I may so inadequately express it—the Will of God on Earth,particularly in relation to the consciousness of men. He lifted the entireScience of Invocation and Evocation to the mental plane and made possible a newapproach to divinity. It is difficult to give you a symbol which could clarifythis matter in your mind. But the one given may carry some enlightenment: [525]> [Image00006.jpg][526] It must be remembered that intelligence and love were present upon Earth,the first in greater degree than the second, and that the task of all the greatWorld Saviours (emerging from the Secret Place, from the illimitable past untilthe present time) has been to anchor, organise, and implement these divineaspects, energies, attributes, and to further their development within the bodyof the planetary Logos. They also, from time to time, demonstrated to thehumanity of Their period of appearing, the point in that development which hadbeen reached. These Representatives of Deity have been of all grades, degreesand differing points of spiritual unfoldment; They have been chosen for Theiraptitude to respond to invocation, to manifest certain divine qualities, and toattract around Themselves those who had latent the same divine qualities, andwho could therefore step down the teaching that the World Saviour came to give,and translate into human equivalents as much of the divine inspiration as waspossible. Many of Them have been forgotten even if Their work was successful.Others have been resolved into myths by the thoughtform-making faculty of manbut Their work is still thereby remembered, and to this, monuments and traditionconstantly testify; greater Sons of God possessed a potency and a love ofhumanity which, even at the close of many centuries, evokes the attention ofmankind and conditions even yet the reactions of millions of people.Vyasa —the original Vyasa, Who was the Great Individuality evoked by theinvocation of the early animal-men—is still more than just a name, even thoughHe has passed out of our planetary scheme millions of years ago. He opened adoor into the human kingdom through His response to the animal kingdom in itshigher invocative ranks; His work brought about the process known asindividualisation. Down through the ages, these Sons of God have come, evoked byhuman invocation; in Their turn, They have invoked certain aspects of the divinenature, deeply hidden in mankind—all related hitherto to consciousness and toresponsiveness of the part to the Whole. [527] Eventually Hercules came forthand opened the door on to the Path of Discipleship, His work being preserved forus in the Twelve Labours of Hercules. These epitomised the various tests towhich all disciples are subjected, prior to the various initiations. ShriKrishna came and opened the door through which mankind could pass to the SecondInitiation. The Buddha , a still greater Figure, the One Who is known as the“Enlightened One,” also came and demonstrated to humanity the nature of theLighted Way, its revelations and its effects in consciousness. He enacted for usthe supreme achievements of the mystic way. Then came the Christ and performed atriple work:> 1. He opened the door to the third initiation.> 2. He anchored on Earth “the Will of God in the matrix of love” (as it has> been esoterically called).> 3. He pointed the way through “the needle's eye” which gives entrance to the> passage through the Pyramid (the symbol of the Spiritual Triad in this case.> A.A.B.) which leads out on to the Way which terminates in Shamballa.His work was of a major consummating nature; He demonstrated in Himself twodivine aspects, thus giving “shape and substance to love”; this had beensequentially fostered by several preceding lesser World Saviours, of Whom ShriKrishna was the greatest.The Christ completed the work of the Buddha by manifesting in its fullness thenature of love, thus permitting the full expression of love-wisdom in its dualaspect—the one aspect demonstrated by the Buddha and the other by the Christ.But His greatest work has not yet been emphasised in the worlds of thought andof religion—the revelation of the Way of the Higher Evolution. This entails thebringing through of pure divine will and the relating of the spiritual Hierarchyto the great Council at Shamballa. It will be apparent to you, therefore, thatHe was the first to carry through—from stage to stage—the complete revelation ofhumanity to the Hierarchy and of the Hierarchy to Shamballa. This He did byvirtue of a [528] completely finished and constructed antahkarana, and thus Hefacilitated the work of all future aspirants and disciples. He made possibletheir unimpeded progress, as far as the opening of each stage of the planetaryantahkarana is concerned. He presented the “first thread of living substance,irradiated by love, intelligently woven and energised by will” which any humanbeing of our Earth humanity had interwoven with the planetary antahkarana. Herelies the secret of the sixth initiation, which has not yet received theattention of the occultist—it is that of the Ascension.Here comes a climaxing note. The whole evolutionary scheme is based upon aseries of ascensions . These ascensions are the result of a process, atechnique, a method (choose which word you will) of invocation by the lesserindividual, group or kingdom, and the evocation of that which is greater, moreinclusive and more enlightened. This is true, whether it concerns a lonelyaspirant upon the Way or an entire kingdom in nature. The greatest of theincarnating Sons of God are necessarily Those Who can include whole kingdoms orstates of divine Being in Their consciousness. Here is the key as to why theinvocation by a group “standing with massed intent” can bring forth, and hasdone so many times in our planetary history, One Who could meet the need whichthe invocation voiced, upon “a way of escape,” and embody in Himself therequired vision or goal.You will note here that I have carried the teaching (earlier given upon thesubject) into the realm of the whole. Previously, I dealt with the process as itapplied to the disciple invoking his soul; later I carried the concept farther,and we considered the disciple invoking his Father in Heaven, the Monad. Now, wehave briefly touched upon humanity as a whole, standing at a great point ofinvocation wherein the entire human kingdom is involved. Thus you have the finalthree of the six great stages in the process we are considering: Invocation,leading to Evocation, to Revelation (at the Fifth initiation) and to Decision(at the sixth).[529] To sum up. We have carried our study of the esoteric aspects of mentalunfoldment to a point where we have lifted the entire spiritual man into realmswhich are neither those of the soul nor of the personality; they are those whichmake him an integral part of monadic experience. We are therefore dealingdefinitely with initiate experience. That the personality remains as aninstrument or vehicle of expression for the one universal soul in its manypersonality aspects upon the physical plane has been duly emphasised; that thesoul per se has been lost to consciousness in the sea of universal realisationhas also been made clear; that the state of being which the initiate has nowreached, as a result of the six stages of conscious building of the antahkarana,has been detailed; but I have pointed out in this connection that what hastranspired lies beyond what we call consciousness, and is consequentlyundefinable by the human intellect. We have dealt with certain high stages ofunfoldment which remain impossible to any human comprehension outside that ofThose Who can function in the Courts of Shamballa. When these stages have beenpassed, then the goal of all the evolutionary processes has been reached, as faras humanity is concerned. These concepts cover our presentation of truth and ofour theme up to the present point. Further we cannot go, for it would beprofitless; nor would the human constitution prove adequate to the imposed task.I have in these previous sections carried our theme to the point where itclimaxes all that has been hitherto given out anent the human mind and itscapabilities. I have indicated the method whereby the mind, trained inmeditation, and therefore soul-conscious, can—through the construction of theantahkarana—reach heights and stages of inclusiveness which will introduce to itcertain aspects of the so-called Universal Mind, the mind of God, as it isfamiliarly called. What I have really done is to deal very briefly with the modewhereby the disciple or the initiate can, with increasing power, tune in on themind of the planetary Logos, Sanat Kumara. Just as the disciple can, [530] whensoul conscious, tune in on the mind of his Master, so the initiate, upon ahigher turn of the spiral, can register the thoughts of the divine Being in Whomwe all live and move and have our being.Through the development of the antahkarana and its conscious, scientific use,the initiate becomes aware of what transpires in the Council Chamber ofShamballa; he can then efficiently begin to work as an exponent of the Willaspect of divinity. Yet all this time we have confined ourselves entirely to theconsideration of the mind aspect in its three phases upon the mental plane, andwith their extension into states of being unknown to all except traineddisciples and initiates. It has been my intention thus to give a theoretical,though not yet practical insight into modes of activity and possible states ofbeing to which you can some day aspire and eventually attain.THE MEANING OF THE INITIATORY PROCESSBefore proceeding with our next point concerning the fusion of the Master'sconsciousness with that of His disciple, I would like to refer to thesignificance of the words I earlier emphasised, “the initiatory process.” I havedealt at length with the theme of initiation in many of my books and haveendeavoured to present the subject in such a manner that it becomes apparentthat it fits into the evolutionary process as a normal and inevitable procedure.Initiation has been so frequently presented as being a ceremony that I have feltit necessary to offset strenuously that erroneous significance. If, however, youare to comprehend that which I have to say, you will have to call in whatmeasures of enlightened understanding you may possess.Initiation is only a ceremony in so far that there comes a climaxing point inthe initiatory process in which the disciple's consciousness becomesdramatically aware of the personnel of the Hierarchy and of his own position inrelation to it. This realisation he symbolises to himself—successively and on anincreasingly large scale—as a great [531] rhythmic ceremonial of progressiverevelation in which he, as a candidate, is the centre of the hierarchical stage.This is definitely so (from the ceremonial angle) in the first two initiations,and in relation to the Christ as the Initiator. After the third initiation, theceremonial angle lessens in his consciousness because the higher initiations arenot registered by the mind (with its ability to reduce realisation into symbolicform) and thus transmitted to the brain, but they reach the brain and are thereregistered via the antahkarana; the results of the experience of expansion arenow definitely of such a nature that they cannot be reduced to symbols or tosymbolic happenings; they are formless and remain in the higher consciousness.I am not here saying that the teachings given in the past by various occultgroups, or in my book Initiation, Human and Solar, are not correct or do notrecount accurately what the candidate believes has taken place. The point I seekto make is that the ceremonial aspect is due to the thoughtform-making capacityof the disciple and (which is of major importance) constitutes his contributionto the future externalisation of the initiatory process in its earlier stages.When an adequate number of disciples will have succeeded in relating theSpiritual Triad to the soul-infused personality and have occultly “precipitated”the energies of the Monad through the medium of the antahkarana, then the firstand second initiations can be “ceremoniously” enacted on earth.The higher initiations cannot be thus presented but will be enacted on themental plane, through the medium of symbols and not through the details ofceremonious happenings. This symbolic representation will hold good for thethird, the fourth and the fifth initiations. After these five great expansionshave taken place, the initiations will no longer be registered as factualceremonials on earth or as symbolic visualisations on the mental plane. It ishard to find a word or a phrase which can express what occurs; the nearest I canapproach to the truth is the “existence of illumination through revelation.” You[532] will note in this connection that the fifth initiation is given the nameof Revelation. You therefore have a sequence of consequences or of the resultsof spiritual attainment which are as follows:> 1. Factual Ceremonials , based on externalisation.> Initiation 1—The Birth.> Initiation 2—The Baptism.> 2. Symbolic Representation, based on spiritual visualisation.> Initiation 3—The Transfiguration.> Initiation 4—The Renunciation.> Initiation 5—The Revelation.> 3. Illumination through Revelation, based on living Light.> Initiation 6—Decision.> Initiation 7—Resurrection.> Initiation 8—Transition.> Initiation 9—Refusal.It will be obvious that these three attempts to define the process of initiationpresent only the outer form aspects each initiation has three aspects, as hasall else in nature, for initiation is a natural process. There is first, itsform aspect; then its soul or consciousness aspect; and finally, its lifeaspect.The form aspect culminates experience and presents the disciple's comprehensionof the initiatory process; the consciousness aspect indicates in a mysteriousmanner the rate of expansion as the disciple has undergone the process; the lifeaspect permits of extra-planetary contact, thus indicating the possible futureand the eventual processes of identification. It might be added that the factualceremonial admits the disciple into full fellowship with the Hierarchy; that thesymbolic representation indicates to the disciple the Way into Shamballa, andthat illumined revelation presents to the initiate the bridge between our cosmicphysical plane and the inner subjective and cosmic worlds; this entrance to thebridge (I am speaking in symbols) [533] reveals the existence of the cosmicAntahkarana, created by the Lord of the World and His group of Executives.This information concerning the initiatory process is coordinating in its natureand is of service to you only in this connection. It demonstrates the underlyingsolar synthesis which was the fundamental platform I gave out in A Treatise onCosmic Fire. Beyond that implication, the information is of no use to you. Itenables you, however, to begin to develop the esoteric sense of synthesis.These three grades of appreciation or of comprehension of the initiatory processare hinted at in the Masonic Work. The ceremonial aspect can be related to thedegrees of Entered Apprentice and of Fellow Craft, plus certain little-practiceddegrees, as for instance that of Mark Mason degree and one or two others; theseare expansions of the implied teaching. The initiations, covered by the termsymbolic representation, find their first hint in the sublime third degree, thatof Master Mason, in the Holy Royal Arch and in one or two succeeding degrees;the higher degrees of the Scottish Rite constitute a vague and nebulous attemptto hold before the Masons of the world those expansions of consciousness and ofgrowth into the Light which are experienced in the remaining higherinitiations—those subject to the process called illumination through revelation.The Masonic Work is an ancient and laudable attempt to preserve in some germinalform the spiritual truth anent initiation. In spite of distortion, some loss ofthe Ancient Landmarks and a deplorable crystallisation, the truth is there andat a later date (in the early part of the next century) a group of enlightenedMasons will re-arrange the rituals and adapt the present forms and formulas insuch a manner that the spiritual possibilities, symbolically indicated, willemerge with greater clarity and a deepened spiritual potency; the coming form ofMasonry in the New Age will necessarily rest upon the foundation of a newlyinterpreted and enlightened Christianity, having no relation to theology andbeing universal in [534] nature. Its present form, resting as it does on aJewish foundation which is nearly five thousand years old, must disappear. Thismust take place, not because it is Jewish, but because it is old and reactionaryand has not followed the evolutionary passage of the sun through the zodiac.That passage should and does symbolise human evolution, and just as the sin ofthe children of Israel in the wilderness was their reverting to a dispensationand religious ritual which had passed and gone (the religion of the people inthe time of Taurus, the Bull, symbolised by their falling down and worshippingthe golden calf), so today modern Masonry is in line to do the same; and theancient usages and forms, consistent and right in the Jewish dispensation, arenow obsolete and should be abrogated. It is equally true of the Jewish race thatin the rejection of the Christ as the Messiah they have remained, metaphoricallyand practically, in the sign of Aries, the Ram, or of the Scapegoat; they haveyet to pass into the sign (again speaking symbolically) of Pisces, the Fishes,and recognise their Messiah when He again comes in the sign Aquarius. Otherwisethey are repeating their ancient sin of non-response to the evolutionaryprocess.Let us now consider what the initiatory process signifies to the disciple as heseeks to lead the dual life which it demands. You will note that I call it aprocess in contradistinction to the theosophical definition which regards it asa culminating ceremony of a period of training.The initiatory process is in reality the result of the activity of threeenergies:> 1. The energy generated by the disciple as he seeks to serve humanity.> 2. The energy made available to the disciple as he succeeds in building the> antahkarana.> 3. The energy of the hierarchical Ashram into which he is being “absorbed” or> integrated.It is these three energies, each with its own mode of expression and eachproducing its own specific results, which implement or engineer the initiatoryprocess; these [535] energies are evoked by the disciple himself, and theirincreasing strength and revelatory capacity depend largely upon the disciple'sdetermination, purpose and will, his persistence and spiritual integrity. It isthrough his understanding of the word “process” that the disciple discovers thetrue meaning of the occult statement that “before a man can tread the Path hemust become that Path himself.” Increasingly the disciple finds what it is tobecome a creative agent, using the creative faculties of the mind and conformingincreasingly (as he creates) to the Plan of the Creator, the Lord of the World.The first three initiations are definitely and in a most mysterious wayconcerned with the creative work, and with the spiritual expression in a humanbeing of the third aspect of divinity, that of intelligent activity. The fourth,fifth and sixth initiations are as definitely related to the second aspect oflove-wisdom as it expresses itself through created forms; the seventh, eighthand ninth initiations are occultly “inspired” by the first divine aspect, thatof the Will. Only, therefore, at the ninth initiation is the human being a fulland true expression of divinity; he then realises that in him all the divineaspects meet. Through them he is consciously, creatively and constructively enrapport with the consciousness of the One in Whom we live and move and have ourbeing. All this is the result of a process and the effect of the inherentlivingness which is found in all forms of life from the tiny atom up to Thosegreat Lives Who are little more than names to the disciple.This initiation process governs the dual life of the disciple in three ways:1. It is expressed in the results effected in the three worlds and in thetangible and growing proof he gives of definitely defined areas of attainment.2. It is demonstrated as effects in his consciousness in the form of anincreasing fusion of soul and personality as well as growing power to invoke theinflow of the higher light, through the medium of the antahkarana. [536]3. It is revealed both through the Spiritual Triad and the soul-infusedpersonality as they unitedly prove the livingness of the divine Love-Nature. Asthis revelation takes hold of the disciple's consciousness and conditions hisexpressive form of service, it initiates him into that mysterious area of thedivine consciousness which we call the “Heart of God”; this is our planetarycorrespondence to the “Heart of the Sun.” The heart of God, i.e., of ourplanetary Logos, and the heart of the Sun, i.e., the solar Logos, aremysteriously related, and it is through this sustained relation that it becomespossible for human beings to enter the Hierarchy. Forget not that the Hierarchyis the expression of the energy of love. The relationship also enables themeventually to pass off the cosmic physical plane on to the cosmic astral plane.Each divine aspect has three subsidiary aspects, and in our planet and on thecosmic physical plane the lowest aspect of love (that which we call theWill-to-Good) is revealed. For humanity, struggling upon this cosmic physicalplane, we subdivide unconsciously this will-to-good into three aspects; these weare only today beginning to grasp as existent possibilities. The lowest aspectwe call goodwill. little realising the attitude to the universal goal which itsets; the second aspect we vaguely call love and hope to demonstrate that we dodemonstrate love through our affiliation with the Hierarchy; the highest we callthe will-to-good and leave it undefined because it is in no way possible, evenfor initiates of the fifth initiation, truly to comprehend what is the natureand purpose of the will-to-good which conditions divine activity.The emphasis in the earlier teaching was upon character as the determiningfactor in deciding whether a man could “take initiation” (as it was called), andthis was another of the presentations which have greatly misled aspirants.Character is of major importance—of such recognised importance that it is notnecessary to dwell upon it. It is character, however, which enables a man tobecome a disciple with the aim in view of eventually entering [537] the Ashramof a Master and passing then through the processes of initiation. It ischaracter which is rightly regarded as the first requirement when a man stepsoff the Probationary Path on to the Path of Discipleship. But he is still,however, a long way from his goal, and a long way from being accepted by aMaster as a disciple. The truth might be expressed this way: When the disciple'seyes are removed from himself and his functioning in the three worlds isbecoming spiritually controlled (or is in process of being controlled), then heis faced with becoming a truly mental being, with the focus of his life upon themental level where it is subject to soul control; it then in turn becomes thedirecting agent of the man upon the physical plane. This does not mean that heis occupied with making his lower concrete mind active, directing and illumined;that is taking place gradually and automatically through the pressure of thehigher influences pouring into and through him. He is occupied with the task ofbecoming aware of the activities of his higher or abstract mind and of the purereason which controls and animates the buddhic plane, and which is itselfsusceptible to impression from the Monad. That plane has to become the onetoward which his mental consciousness looks and upon which it focusses itsattention. There it must be polarized, in the same sense as the consciousness ofaverage humanity is today polarised on the plane of the emotions and of astralactivity but is shifting with rapidity on to the mental plane.This involves a dual activity; the lower mind becomes a potent factor indirecting the service activities of the disciple. These activities become themajor motivating potency in the disciple's life and are a consequence of agrowing soul fusion with the personality, thus developing and unfolding hissense of inclusiveness. Inclusiveness is the supreme key to the understanding ofconsciousness. At the same time, the higher mind is impressing the lower mindand drawing it into a higher fusion with itself.This process of unfoldment creates certain major points of successive fusions,with consequent points of tension; [538] these points of tension (whenconsciously attained) become the actuating energy which enables the disciple to“stand in the light and in that light see greater Light; within that greaterLight he knows and sees, grasps and absorbs that which has hitherto been darkand secret and unknown.” This is initiation.Periods of search, periods of pain, periods of detachment, periods of revelationproducing points of fusion, points of tension and points of energyprojection—such is the story of the Path of Initiation.Initiation is in truth the name given to the revelation or new vision which everdraws the disciple onward into greater light; it is not something conferred uponhim or given to him. It is a process of light recognition and of lightutilisation in order to enter into ever clearer light. Progress from a dimlylighted area in the divine manifestation into one of supernal glory is the storyof the Path of Evolution.In the Masters' Archives there are some Rules for Disciples of very ancientorigin. Among them is one that is so old and so abstruse that it is only nowpossible to bring it to the attention of humanity, owing to the increased mentaland Spiritual perception of the modern aspirant. It can be inadequatelytranslated as follows:> “The light is seen, a tiny point of piercing light. This light is warm and> red. It nearer draws as it reveals the things that are, the things which may> be. It pierces the third centre and removes all glamour and desire.> “A light is seen through the medium of the lower light—a light of warmth and> heat. It pierces to the heart and in that light all forms are seen pervaded by> a glowing light. The world of lighted forms is now perceived, linked each to> each by light. This light is blue, and flaming is its nature. Between the warm> and reddish light and this clear light there burns a glow of flame—a flame> which must be entered, ere the light of blue is entered and is used. [539]> “Another light is then perceived, the clear cold light which is not light but> darkness in its purest purity—the LIGHT of God Himself. It renders dark all> else beside Itself; all forms fade out and yet the whole of life is there. It> is not light as we know light. It is that pure essential essence of that Light> which reveals Itself through light.”It was the second light to which the Buddha and the Christ both referred whenThey said: “I am the light of the world.” It is the Light of God Himself, theLord of the Worlds, in which the Lives within the Council Chamber of Shamballalive and move and have Their Being.It is the recognition of the varying “lights” upon the Lighted Way thatsignifies readiness for initiation. The initiate enters into light in a peculiarsense; it permeates his nature according to his development at any point in timeand space; it enables him to contact and see the hitherto unseen, and on thebasis of the newly acquired knowledge to direct his steps still further.I am not here speaking in symbols. Each initiation dims the light alreadyacquired and used, and then immerses the initiate in a higher light. Eachinitiation enables the disciple to perceive an area of divine consciousnesshitherto unknown but which, when the disciple has familiarised himself with itand with its unique phenomena, vibratory quality and interrelations, becomes forhim a normal field of experience and activity. Thus (if I may so express it) the“worlds of living forms and formless lives become his own.” Again duality entersinto his mental perception, for he is now aware of the lighted area from whichhe comes to the point of tension or of initiation; through the initiatoryprocess he discovers a new and more brilliantly lighted area into which he maynow enter. This involves no leaving of the former field of activity in which hehas worked and lived; it simply means that new fields of responsibility and ofopportunity confront him because he is—through his own effort—able to see morelight, to walk in a greater light, to prove more adequately than [540]heretofore his capacities within the greatly increased area of possibility.Initiation is, therefore, a constant fusion of the lights, progressivelyentered, thus enabling the initiate to see further, deeper and more inclusively.As one of the Masters has said: “The light must enter vertically and be diffusedor radiated horizontally.” This creates the cross of service upon which thedisciple is pendant until the Cross of Sanat Kumara is revealed to him; he knowsthen why this planet is—for wise and adequate reasons—the planet of distress,dispassion and detachment. When he knows this, he knows all that our planetarylife can tell him and reveal to him. He has transmuted knowledge into wisdom.It is at the centre of this cross of service that the point of fusion and thepoint of tension must be found. The point of fusion is created by the focussingof all the power, aims and desires of the disciple dynamically upon the mentalplane; the point of tension is created when the invocative power of this focalpoint becomes capable of evoking response from that which is invoked. For theaverage aspirant and for the disciple, this is either the soul or the SpiritualTriad. The meeting of the two focussed energies produces a point of tension.Disciples should not focus their attention upon the task of producing a point oftension. They should remember the life of dual activity; i.e., that which he isat any given moment of endeavour, and that with which he can fuse and blend thissum total of his achieved development. The potency of his thinking along thesedual lines will automatically produce the point of tension, through the mediumof the fusion of the appropriate dualities. It is through the activity of thelower mind that fusion with the soul is brought about, with successive,intensifying points of tension; it is through the activity established betweenhigher and lower mind that fusion with the Spiritual Triad becomes possible,with points of tension arising at many points along the bridge, the antahkarana;it is through the activity of pure reason that fusion with the Hierarchy becomespossible, and it [541] is that which produces those points of tension which wecall Initiations. There are necessarily still higher points of tension, but itis with those called initiations that we are dealing at this time.Light may enter your mind in this connection if you will constantly bear in mindthe essential duality of manifestation itself; the negative and the positivepoles present within the consciousness of every form. The achieved point offusion (the result of active and positive work and effort) is rendered negativeto that which is being invoked, and by this means another and positive point oftension can be achieved. Initiation—a dramatic and a major point oftension—connotes essentially the fusion of the negative and the positiveaspects. Owing to this, in all initiatory processes, it is the will of thedisciple which is active and which produces, first of all, a fusion and (as aconsequence) the appearance of a point of tension.Let me illustrate. In the work of creating the antahkarana, the disciple firstof all and as far as in him lies, through the medium of positive mental labour,focusses himself upon the mental plane. The fusion of the soul and of timepersonality is then present and is the result of a positive activity. Thequality and the vibratory nature of that positive focal point is then renderednegative to that higher vibration or contact which is invoked by the existentradiance and potency. The response from the opposite pole is (if the disciplecould but realise it) immediate and to the extent possible, determined by thedisciple's point of attainment.This invocative-evocative activity produces a point of tension but not—as yet—apoint of fusion with the positive pole. From that point of tension the discipleworks at the creation of the antahkarana; this will eventually bring about thedesired fusion between the soul-infused personality and the Spiritual Triad. Thesame general process dictates all the desired fusions and produces those pointsof tension which are the secret of all growth. These [542] points of fusion andof tension the disciple consciously endeavours to bring about.These are the broad and general lines governing the initiatory process; the workhere indicated is followed by all disciple-initiates of all degrees, and even bythe Lord of the World Himself. He, in His high Place, holds the manifested worldof energies in a state of fusion; points of tension successively occur as aconsequence of a growing divine realisation within these forms of intelligentactivity, of love-wisdom and of the will-to-good. These points of tension varyaccording to the divine purpose and the individual initiatory problem of SanatKumara Himself, as He submits to a cosmic initiatory process. Such a point oftension, of stupendous magnitude, is present in the world today; the intentionbehind this realised fusion and tension is to enable humanity (as an integralpart of the divine body of manifestation) to move forward into greater light andnearer to the “heart of love,” which is the Hierarchy. As this takes place—andit is taking place—the Hierarchy Itself moves nearer to a conscious fusion withHumanity. The point of tension thereby achieved—and this has not yetappeared—will produce the Kingdom of God on Earth in exoteric form.We will now consider one of the lesser, though essential, fusions which must beachieved by the disciple, producing consequently in his life a point or pointsof tension.Fusion of the Master's consciousness with that of the discipleEarlier I stated that the disciple's private life automatically falls (once hehas been accepted by the Master) into three stages:> a. The stage in which the lower concrete mind and the higher mind are related> in such a manner that the lower mind is not only soul-illumined but is subject> also to impression from the Spiritual Triad.> b. His relation to the Master is the next and sometimes paralleling stage and> involves the bringing together [543] of the Master's consciousness and his> own. This has to be slowly developed and consciously grasped, with very> interesting consequences.> c. Later comes the stage when the disciple's consciousness can be gradually> brought into a rapport with the Hierarchy as a whole. It might be mentioned,> in clarification somewhat of this rather vague statement, that the disciple is> absorbed into the Hierarchy and—at the same time—he assimilates in a new and> mysterious manner certain united hierarchical impressions.The disciple by now has made his approach to the Ashram and has demonstrated hisability to serve and thereby utilise any ashramic energy which he may contactand occultly include. He is slowly becoming aware of three vibratory impressionswhich are slightly differing though coloured by the ray which they express.First of all, he is aware of the vibration of his own soul; then he registersthat of the Ashram, in the early stages focussed for him through the mediationof some disciple senior to him; and finally, he becomes conscious of thevibration of the Master. Slowly he learns to distinguish them and know them asconstituting three different channels whereby energy reaches him. They contacthis consciousness upon the mental plane; later, he discovers that contact withthem is facilitated once he can register them consciously upon their appropriateplane and through the appropriate centre; it naturally takes time to developthis facility and (until he passes through the third initiation when majorchanges take place) he is expected to “retain the impression” upon the mentalplane.The development of sensitivity to contact, and the registering of “that which isother than the Self and yet which is the Self Itself,” are part of the greatScience of Impression. This development—in the early stages of humanevolution—is carried forward through the medium of the five senses and is to befound in the animal kingdom also. With this well-known and well-studiedunfoldment I shall not deal, beyond saying that these five (in reality [544]seven) senses constitute avenues of spiritual approach to varying aspects of thedivine manifestation in the three or five worlds of human evolution. It mighthere be pointed out that (in a mysterious manner) the seven centres in theetheric body are correspondences to the seven senses, for they are responsive tovibrations coming from the world soul or the human soul, from the Ashram andfrom the Master, as well as registering eventually the energies of all the sevenrays; these pour into the disciple and through him as part of the greatcirculatory system of the sevenfold divine energy which is the basis ofmanifestation. I dealt with these senses and the circulating energies somewhatat length in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire .With the theme of the fusion of the soul and the personality I have dealtadequately in other writings and in the teaching on the antahkarana. I willconfine myself here to the fusion of the Master's consciousness (as it isconditioned to the human kingdom ) with that of the disciple. There is no fusionpossible or comprehensible between the Master's higher or Shamballicconsciousness and that of any disciple who has not taken the fourth initiation.The completeness of the fusion to which I refer is not possible in the earlystages of the disciple's unfoldment; there again, the teaching hithertopresented by occult groups in connection with a Master's relation to Hisdisciple has been erroneous and the result of wishful thinking.The disciple is only permitted to have contact with the Master's mind when hisspiritual life has become habitual to him and when he can, at will, flood hispersonality with soul energy. Those who make occasional and rare soul contacts(and there are many who do) in their meditation work are not so privileged. Itis the disciple who has established a usable contact with his soul, of which hecan avail himself at any time he so chooses, who can begin to registerimpressions coming directly to him from the Master.Aspirants must not confuse teaching given to them by the Master in the work ofthe Ashram with this later [545] fusion of consciousness. In group formation,disciples are gathered together at times to receive instruction and are therebyprotected within the group aura from the tremendous potency of the Master'spresence. It is difficult for the average aspirant to realise the necessity forthis, yet even disciples themselves, and in the early stages of their admissionto the Ashram and of their training, have a potent effect upon those whom theymay contact. The effect is produced without intention and is caused by thehigher quality of the disciple's vibration or radiance to that of the person orgroup he contacts. The impression he makes produces stimulation—a stimulationwhich the person frequently finds it very difficult to handle, evoking not onlygood but also bad effects.The application of this radiant energy is a definite mode of spiritual serviceand activity, but until a disciple has advanced in knowledge and can control hisradiation (permitting only those streams of energy to escape from him which areappropriate to the need) the “passing-by” of a disciple can produce muchdifficulty, both for the individual and for the group.It will be obvious to you, therefore, that the presence of a Master will have apotent effect where an individual disciple is concerned. I have employed thatseparative term “individual disciple” because it indicates the cause of thepossible difficulty or even danger. Such difficulty is always possible as longas any separative or self-centered instincts exist in the disciple; it takes along time for a disciple to attain that disinterestedness and that inclusivespirit which will enable him to stand in the presence of the Master and presentno barriers to direct contact with the Master's mind. This contact, leading tothe desired fusion, falls into certain clearly defined stages:1. Occasionally in the disciple's hours of meditation, at a moment of greattension or in a crisis (related to his service activities), there may occur amomentary fusion of the minds of the disciple and the Master. This can only[546] occur when the mental focus is so steady and so firmly directed inintention that emotional reactions or the intrusion of personality affairs areeliminated.2. Later on in his training, the Master may attempt to impress his mindunexpectedly, and thus train him to recognise what we might regard as a directcall from the Centre of the Ashram.3. As the disciple proves his value and demonstrates that he is desiring nothingfor the separated self, the interrelation between the two minds—of the Master ofthe Ashram and the disciple—finds no impediment; there is consequently no riskof overstimulation, of self-satisfaction or of the emergence of qualities whichwould disturb the rhythm of the Ashram. There can take place (as the Masterwills it) a flow of thought between the two. At first, the impression is carriedforward entirely on the side of the Master, and the disciple is simply an agentwho can be impressed by ideas and instructed along some particular line whichmay be of service to humanity; he can, however, produce no current of thoughtflowing back to the Master. Later on, as a disciple moves forward into light andis simultaneously a server, he can be permitted to reach the Master with his ownreaction to the impression.4. Then comes the final stage wherein the disciple can be trusted to be theinitiatory agent of impression and of contact and is allowed to evoke theMaster's attention and to penetrate to the Centre of the Ashram. Students woulddo well to relate these four stages to the Six Stages of Discipleship, dealtwith in the latter part of Discipleship in the New Age, Vol. I ; these fourstages correspond to the final four considered in that book.These contacts are naturally in the field of telepathy, which is an aspect ofthe Science of Impression, and are entirely in the realm of mental interplay. Ihave dealt with the basic science itself in the book Telepathy and the EthericVehicle . The relation considered above is between the instrument of contactused by the Master—that of the higher or abstract mind, for the Masters do notwork [547] through the lower mind at all—and the lower or concretising mind ofthe disciple. The Masters are therefore dependent upon the use of theantahkarana which the disciple is in process of building; this is rapidlybecoming a part of the group Antahkarana, built by disciples (working in thethree worlds but on mental levels) who have been admitted into the Ashram. Youcan see why, therefore, the teaching anent the Antahkarana was deemed by us tobe timely and wise. Relationship to the Ashram and contact with the Master aredependent upon the existence of the Antahkarana. In the early stages of itscreative construction, the Antahkarana is adequate to permit some contact withthe Ashram and with certain of the disciples, though not with those of very highdegree. Later, as the Antahkarana perfects itself, higher and more durablecontacts become possible.The results of these developed and registered contacts are finally seen in thecomplete impressibility—at any time and without any effort on either side—of thedisciple's mind. It is now so attuned to the Ashram and to the Master's rayquality that his mind is one with that of the Master at the centre. Reciprocalactivity becomes possible.It is needless, surely, for me to point out that the theme of all impressionscoming from the Master to the disciple, and from the disciple to the Master, isthe service of the Plan, the problems connected with group work in the AquarianAge, or with the life and relationships within the Ashram. Forget not that theAshram has its own objectives, intentions and inner techniques which areunconnected with the disciple's life and his service in the three worlds. Thework of the disciple in preparation for initiation is not basically concernedwith his daily world service, though there would be no initiation for him ifthat life of service were lacking. His life of service is, in reality anexpression of the particular initiation for which he is being prepared. This isa theme too vast for us to consider here, but it is an idea upon which you couldwell ponder. [548]One hint I will give you, based on the life of the Christ. The life history andthe experiences of the great Initiates are rarely given, but much has beencommunicated to us anent the life of the Christ, both in the Gospels and inconnection with His earlier incarnations. As you know, He took one of thegreatest of the initiations (the sixth initiation, that of Decision). Thisinitiation is related to the throat centre and also to its highercorrespondence, the throat centre of the planetary Logos; this is the centrewhich we call Humanity. Thus “the Word came forth.” He had a dual mission tofulfill in order to prove His fitness (if one may use such a word in connectionwith an initiate of His exalted standing). He had, first of all, to give a greatimpetus to human evolution by proclaiming two things:> 1. That “the blood is the life.”> 2. That all men everywhere are sons of God, and therefore divine.Secondly, He had to bring to an end the Jewish dispensation which should haveclimaxed and passed away with the movement of the sun out of Aries into Pisces.He therefore presented Himself to them as their Messiah, which was His reasonfor manifesting through the Jewish race. They not only rejected Him, but havesucceeded in perpetuating the Jewish dispensation through the medium of itsreligious presentation throughout the era of the Christian dispensation. Thislies at the root of their trouble and is the cause of their constant emphasisupon the past—a past which is based on their experiences in Aries and not upontheir growth in Pisces.This entire subject of the telepathic interplay between the disciple and theAshram, and between the Master and the disciple, is one of unique interest. Itis part of the dual life which all disciples must lead. It is that whichintensifies the life of introspection which is only rightly understood andcarried forward when the man is in truth a soul-infused personality. It is thesource or origin of the extraverted life which the disciple must also lead,producing an intense activity in the three worlds—an activity [549] which in noway disturbs the calm procedures of the life of ashramic contacts. Rightlyfollowed, it produces the possibility with which our third point deals.Impression on the mind of the disciple of hierarchical intentThis is something far greater and more inclusive than the ability of the mind ofthe disciple to register the content of the minds within the Ashram with whichhe is affiliated or even the mind of the Master. The purpose aspect of the Planbegins to impress his now highly illumined abstract mind, for the integratedpurpose—as far as the Hierarchy is concerned—begins slowly to impress him.Little by little, he begins to register impressions from Shamballa. With this Icannot deal; it concerns the growth which follows the fourth and fifthinitiations, and therefore training given to a Master. With it you have noconcern.Your major task, as aspirants, is to cultivate the higher sensitivity; to renderyourselves so pure and selfless that your minds remain undisturbed by thehappenings in the three worlds; to seek that attentive spiritual sense whichwill enable you to be impressed, and then to interpret correctly the impressionsreceived.I have said that initiation is in reality a great experiment with energy. Thelife of the occult student is consciously lived in the world of energies. Thoseenergies have always been present, for the whole of existence in all thekingdoms of nature is manifested energy, but men are not aware of this. They arenot conscious, for instance, when they succumb to irritation and find themselvesvoicing that irritation in loud words or in angry thoughts, that they are takingastral energy and using it. The use of this energy admits them with ease to alevel of astral living which is not suitable for them; continual use of thisenergy brings about what the Master Morya has called “habits of residence whichimperil the resident.” It is when the aspirant recognises that he himself iscomposed of energy units—held in coherent expression by a still stronger energy,that of integration—that he begins consciously to [550] work in a world offorces similarly composed; he then begins to use energy of a certain kind, andselectively, and takes one of the initial steps towards becoming a trueoccultist. This world of energy in which he lives and moves and has his being isthe living, organised vehicle of manifestation of the planetary Logos. Throughit energies are circulating all the time and are in constant movement, beingdirected and controlled by the head centre of the planetary Logos; they creategreat vortices of force or major points of tension throughout His body ofmanifestation. The Spiritual Hierarchy of our planet is such a vortex; Humanityitself is another, and one which is today in a condition of almost violentactivity, owing to its becoming a focus of divine attention.Certain great readjustments are going on in that centre, for it is beginning toconform at long last to divine intention. I have elsewhere pointed out that forthe first time in the long history of human development, energy from Shamballahas made a direct impact upon this third planetary centre. This is not dueentirely to the point in evolution attained by mankind; this attainment is onlya secondary reason or cause. It is due to the will of Sanat Kumara Himself as Heprepares for a certain cosmic initiation. This initiation requires thereorganisation of the energies flowing through and composing that “centre whichwe call the race of men”; this creates a rearrangement within the centre itself,and thus brings into manifested expression certain aspects and qualities—alwaysinherent in those energies—which have not hitherto been recognised. Thiscreative crisis has been made possible by three major happenings:1. The conclusion of a twenty-five thousand year cycle or movement around whatis called the lesser zodiac. This connotes a major cycle of experience in thelife of our planetary Logos. It is related to the interplay between theplanetary Logos and the solar Logos as the latter responds to energies emanatingfrom the twelve zodiacal constellations. [551]2. The end of the Piscean Age. This simply means that the energies coming fromPisces during the last two thousand years are now being rapidly superseded byenergies coming from Aquarius. These result in major changes in the life of theplanetary Logos and potently affect His body of manifestation through the mediumof His three major centres: Shamballa, the Hierarchy and Humanity.3. The increasingly dominant activity of the seventh Ray of Order or CeremonialMagic, as it is somewhat erroneously called. This ray is now coming intomanifestation and is in close cooperation with the two above factors; itproduces also the lessening of the power of the sixth Ray of Idealism. This hashad a long cycle and has greatly hastened the evolutionary process; itdemonstrates its effective work in the emergence today of the great worldideologies. I am necessarily considering these energies only in relation to thehuman consciousness.There are other factors present in our planet today, but these are the oneswhich will (in a vague sense) mean something to you, as you think and seek tounderstand.The great cosmic initiation through which our planetary Logos is passing (forgetnot my words, “initiatory process ”) produces an entire reorganisation of allthe energies of which His body of manifestation is composed; it heightens thequality or the vibration of certain of the ray energies, and lessens the potencyof others. Direction also enters in; certain planetary centres become therecipients (in a new and vital manner) of the redirected ray potencies. Amongthese, at this time, the human family (or the third vital centre) becomes aprime objective. The three major centres in the body of the planetary Logos are:> The head centre—Shamballa—1st Ray of Will> The heart centre—Hierarchy—2nd Ray of Love-Wisdom> The throat centre—Humanity—3rd Ray of Active IntelligenceThe impact of the new incoming energies upon Humanity [552] will result from aplanned redirection. This will bring in an era of greatly enhanced creativeactivity; it will be an activity such as has never been seen before, and whichwill express itself in every department of human living.In this connection I would remind you of the relation existing between thesacral centre (the physical creative centre) and the throat centre, and of theteaching anent the raising of the energies from this lower centre to the throatcentre. This can be seen happening in the human being as he progresses along thePath of Evolution, and is equally present in the life and experience of theplanetary Logos.This progressive “creative raising” necessarily produces a cycle of tremendousdifficulty in the life of the aspirant to initiation, for the microcosmundergoes—in his minute living process—what the planetary Logos undergoes in acosmic process. When—as is the case today—Humanity itself is in process ofbecoming creative in the higher sense, and when this synchronises with a majorcreative planetary activity, then a cycle of very great disturbance eventuateswhich necessarily affects every individual within “the race of men.” Hence thesexual disturbance to be seen everywhere, with the license present in everycountry and the apparent breakdown of the marriage relation. This indicates theemergence eventually of a creativity of such wondrous dimensions that the worldwill stand amazed; nothing like it will have been seen before. A creativeplanning for human well-being and a political expression, implementing thisplanning, will demonstrate in every country; a creative thinking will beapparent which will express itself in writing and in poetry; creative imaginingwill produce the new art, the new colours, the new architecture and the newculture; a creative responsiveness to the “music of the spheres” will bringforth the new music. All this will be in response to the creative reorganisationand the newly directed energies which are engaging the attention of theplanetary Logos at this time.[553] All this reorganisation and redirection of energies is carried forward inthe realm of the divine third aspect, that of divine active intelligence.Therefore the human centre registers this major aspect and becomes intenselyinvocative; this invocative appeal, being unitedly directed towards the secondmajor centre, the Hierarchy, inevitably evokes a response. Invocation,accompanied by the creative imagination, will produce that new creative activitywhich will bring “the new heavens and the new earth” into being.Three points I would like to make here; they have a definite bearing upon oursubject:1. This intense creative activity falls into two parts:> a. A destructive cycle, wherein the old order passes away and that which has> been created—human civilisation with its accompanying institutions—is> destroyed. With this destructive action Humanity is today occupying> itself—mostly unconsciously. The major creative agents are the intelligentsia> of the race.> b. A cycle of restoration, with many accompanying difficulties in which the> mass of men take part, under the influence and inspiration of a regenerated> intelligentsia.2. This process received its initial impulse as a result of a group decisionwithin the Hierarchy itself. Certain Masters Who were facing the sixthInitiation of Decision at the time—a relatively small but powerful group—decidedtogether to tread the Path of Earth Service (technically understood) in order tobring about the changes which They sensed as desirable and as already existingwithin the consciousness of the One Initiator, the planetary Logos. It was Theirdecision, taken early in this century, which precipitated—in the centre which wecall “the race of men”—those potencies and stimulating energies which producedthat major destructive agency, the world war (1914-1945). As these energiesoccultly “fell into the centre,” the effect produced was both good and bad.Human unity and unanimity, human planning for group welfare, and human [554]creativity (expressed primarily at this time through science) received atremendous stimulation. Simultaneously, the entering potencies released by thisdecision produced an up-surging of evil in the hearts of men so inclined,leading to an analogous or paralleling unity, unanimity and creative activity ofseparative and hateful evil. This, in its turn, “opened the door where evildwelt” and let loose on earth the full fury of the Black Lodge.That this would be the result the Masters knew when making Their decision; Theyconsciously struck a blow at the materialism which was binding humanity andimprisoning the human spirit. This evoked a prompt reaction from the Forces ofEvil which had created and “held in being” the modern materialistic world, withits emphasis upon forms and money. The Masters had confidence that the humanspirit would be able to live through the period of upheaval and emergeeventually into the new era, ready to build the new world and to reorganise allhuman resources—material, mental and spiritual.3. The response of humanity, from the angle of a spiritual realisation of thepresented opportunity, was the emergence of the New Group of World Servers. Theyappeared in every country, conscious of their task of crystallising and makingeffective human goodwill, though generally unconscious of their hierarchicalrelationship. Their appearance evoked an immediate reaction from the SpiritualHierarchy, and experienced disciples made their appearance in the ranks of theNew Group of World Servers, directing their efforts, voicing their aims andstimulating their understanding. The new group worked in and through everydepartment of human thinking, human welfare and human planning; as a result, andalmost immediately, the men of goodwill everywhere in the world took heart ofgrace (a most appropriate phrase) and became active.The three points made here will demonstrate to you the factual nature of thecirculation of energies. All these happenings are part of a process of planetaryinitiation; [555] such an initiation cannot take place without importanteffects, both in the Hierarchy and in the human family. In old Atlantean days,it was the Masters (facing the same sixth initiation) Who “decided” to bringthat ancient civilisation to an end; They therefore sacrificed the form aspectof manifestation and created a situation in which the soul of humanity wasliberated from the prison in which it found itself. Today, a materialcatastrophe, such as the flood, has not been deemed necessary; it is believedthat humanity can and will find its own way out of the world difficulties."},{"pageContent":"SECTION TWO - THE ASPIRANT AND THE MAJOR INITIATIONSWe now approach the second part of our theme, dealing with the majorinitiations; we will do so primarily from the standpoint of the ray energies,considering the subject from the initiate's point of view. I wonder if yourealise, my brother, that this has never before been done? The teaching hithertogiven out on initiation has been pictorially and symbolically presented; theunderstanding of the process was dependent upon right interpretation. In thismaterialistic age, that interpretation has been largely material in nature;emphasis has been laid upon the tangible and supposed form aspect of initiation.I here propose a different approach, and would ask you to keep in mind somewords out of the ancient Archives which are as follows:> “Energy is all there is, O Chela in the Light, but is not known. It is the> cause of knowledge and its application and its comprehension lead to expanded> understanding.> Through energy the worlds were made and through that energy they make> progression; through energy the forms unfold and die; through energy the> kingdoms manifest and disappear below the threshold of the world which ever is> and which will be forever.> Through energy the Cross is mounted and from the vortex of the four uniting> forces, the initiate passes through the door and is propelled into the Light—a> light which grows from cycle unto cycle and is known as supernal Energy> Itself.”I shall not be able to avoid a measure of symbolic approach and I am forced touse words which will fail to express the truth. The extent of your understandingwill be based upon your point in evolution, upon your attitude [557] of mind asyou approach this theme, and upon the point of tension you are able to achieve.Initiation is (in its simplest definition) an understanding of the Way, forunderstanding is a revealing energy which permits you to achieve. Initiation isa growth in experience and the attainment thereby of a point of tension. Holdingthat point of tension, the initiate sees that which lies ahead. Initiationpermits a progressive entry into the mind of the creating Logos. This lastdefinition is perhaps one of the most important I have ever given. Ponder on mywords.Initiation is a system or a scientific process whereby the septenate of energieswhich compose the sum total of all the existences within our planetary Life arerealised and consciously used for the working out of the divine Plan. It mightalso be stated that initiation is a method whereby the circulation of energiesis furthered by the opening or the awakening of certain planetary and humancentres to the impact of their ray quality, potency and divine intention. It isthis statement which lies at the heart of the teaching on Laya Yoga or theScience of the Centres.THE RELATION OF THE SEVEN RAYS TO THE INITIATIONSIt will be obvious to you that, as energy is the basis of our entire manifestedworld, an initiation is a condition of consciousness wherein the fully prepareddisciple utilises the available energies (at the time of initiation) to bringabout changes within consciousness of a momentous and revelatory nature. Eachinitiation puts the initiate in a position to control certain related energiesand enables him to become increasingly a trained manipulator of those energies;each initiation gives him understanding of the related energy and of its fieldof activity; each initiation reveals to him the quality and the type ofstimulation to be evoked when brought into contact with any particular rayenergy; each initiation establishes relationship between the initiate and theray energy involved, so that gradually [558] (no matter what may be his soul rayor his personality ray) he can work with the quality and the creative aspect ofall the rays, though ever retaining a greater facility to work on his own soulray, and later with the ray of the Monad—one of the three major Rays of Aspect.I would ask you to remember that all human beings must finally express thequality and livingness of one of the three Rays of Aspect, even if—in time andspace—their souls may originally be upon one of the four Rays of Attribute. Itmight be useful here to enumerate the rays, and thus refresh the memory of theneophyte:Rays of Aspect:> 1. The Ray of Power, Will or Purpose> 2. The Ray of Love-Wisdom> 3. The Ray of Active Creative IntelligenceRays of Attribute:> 4. The Ray of Harmony through Conflict> 5. The Ray of Concrete Science or Knowledge> 6. The Ray of Idealism or Devotion> 7. The Ray of Order or Ceremonial MagicIt is contact with the energy of the third Ray of Active Intelligence or (as itis sometimes called) the “acute energy of divine mental perception” which admitsthe consciousness of the initiate into the “secrets of the Mind of God”. It isthe four Rays of Attribute which, in the evolutionary cycle, condition hischaracter (or apparatus of contact) and evoke his essential quality. The threeRays of Aspect enable him to take the four higher initiations—initiations 6, 7,8, 9—and are connected purely with Shamballa. The four Rays of Attribute,particularly as they are synthesised through the medium of the third Ray ofAspect, are related more definitely to the Hierarchy, and therefore are relatedto the first five initiations. The Rays of Aspect are essentially related to thelife or will aspect of divinity; the Rays of Attribute are related to theconsciousness aspect.Every human being, in the earlier stages of his development (in ancient Lemuriaand Atlantis, or possessing [559] today the Lemurian or Atlantean state ofconsciousness—and there are many such), comes into incarnation upon one of thefour Rays of Attribute, because these rays are peculiarly and uniquely relatedto the fourth kingdom in nature, and therefore to the fourth Creative Hierarchy.During the long, long cycle of the present fifth race, the so-called Aryan race,there came a period (lying now in the far distant and forgotten past) whenindividuals who had attained a certain state of consciousness transferred on toone of the three Rays of Aspect, according to the predominance of the energy orthe line of force which was conditioned by these rays. One of the Rays of Aspectand two of the Rays of Attribute (rays 3, 5, 7) are conditioned by the first Rayof Power of Will, whilst rays 4 and 6 are conditioned by the second Ray ofLove-Wisdom. This I much earlier pointed out. A cycle of lives upon the thirdRay of Creative Intelligence (as I prefer to call it) always precedes thistransference. This ray experience covers a vast period of time. Except in theoccult teaching and the Archives which remain in the custody of the Masters,history—as we know it and as it expresses the emergence from primitive andprimeval times—does not exist. From the angle of occultism, history only coversthe emergence of those cultures and civilisations which are called the fifthrootrace, only a small part of it being recognised as Aryan; the latter issimply a modern and scientific nomenclature covering a small period of modernhistory. The Aryan cycle covers the period of the relation between groups andnations though positing (as a necessary hypothesis) previous but unknown cyclesof human living wherein primitive man roamed the earth; or positing sometimesthe existence of previous civilisations which have completely disappeared,leaving behind them faint traces of ancient organised civilisations and culturalremains, plus indications of interworld relationships of which there is nopositive proof; these, it is suggested, must have existed owing to thesimilarity of architecture, language roots, traditions and the myths ofreligions. [560]During these earlier periods all human beings were conditioned by the four Raysof Attribute; both as souls and as incarnated persons they were upon one ofthese four rays. Towards the middle of the Atlantean cycle (untold millions ofyears ago) the influence of the third Ray of Active Intelligence becameexceedingly potent. Certain of the advanced humanity of the period graduallyfound their way on to, or rather into, the stream of divine energy which we callthe third ray. The possibility, therefore, of their becoming integratedpersonalities was for the first time recognised, and humanly recognised. Such anintegration must ever precede conscious human initiation.Forget not my earlier statement that all the Rays of Attribute are focussed inand absorbed by the third Ray of Aspect. A study of the charts which I gave andpermitted to appear in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire will help you to understandthis. They will prove helpful, provided that you remember always that they areonly symbolic in nature and constitute attempts to indicate visually a truth.The Atlantean race was predominantly a race wherein its leading exponents (the“flower of the race” or the “crest wave,” as it is called) expressed an activeintelligence. It was intelligence which its initiates had to demonstrate, andnot love-wisdom, as is the case today. This expressed itself in a mental focus,a trained mind capable of illumination, and great creative ability. In the Aryanrace, which from the occult point of view can be regarded as encompassingpractically the totality of history as we have it, the influence of the secondRay of Love-Wisdom is slowly becoming the dominating factor; men are rapidlyfinding their way on to that ray, and the number of people found upon that lineof energy is already very great, though not yet as great as those upon the thirdray, as it today expresses itself through one of the four Rays of Attribute.This latest of the human races (again through its foremost exponents) has tomanifest the spirit of love through wisdom; the basis of this expression is anunfolding inclusiveness, a developing understanding, and a heightened spiritualperception [561] which is capable of envisaging that which lies beyond the threeworlds of human evolution.It might here be said that the one-pointed life of the focussed intellectual(that life which the higher initiates demonstrated in the Atlantean initiations)and the extensive inclusive life of the modern or Aryan initiate, is theobjective held before the disciple upon the Path of Discipleship and in theMasters' ashrams. The presence in humanity today of an ardent intelligence and agrowing inclusiveness is symbolised under the words “the vertical and thehorizontal life”; it is therefore visually portrayed under the symbol of theCross. I have here indicated to you, therefore, that the Cross is strictly thesymbol of Aryan unfoldment. The symbol of old Atlantis was a line, indicatingthe vertical line of mental unfoldment and aspiration. The Christianconsciousness, or the consciousness of the soul, is the perfecting and controlof the mind, plus the demonstration of love in service; these are theoutstanding characteristics of the Hierarchy and the essential qualities ofthose who form the kingdom of God.In the coming race, which lies still far ahead and of which only initiates ofdegrees higher than the fifth are the expression, the Ray of Aspect whichembodies the Will of God will gradually become dominant. Its symbol cannot yetbe revealed. There will then come a blending of divine will energy with thedeveloped and manifesting energies of intelligence and love. In the final race(lying untold ages ahead) there will appear a creative synthesis of all thesethree Rays of Aspect. Then all souls will be upon one of these three rays, andall personalities on one of the four Rays of Attribute. There will then be aperfect expression—through Humanity, the third divine planetary centre—of thelivingness, the quality and the creative potency of all the rays.These are facts which I would have you bear in mind as we consider the relationof the seven rays to initiation in this particular world period and during thecycle of treading the Paths of Discipleship and Initiation. Great [562]transitions are then made; the power to include and to love in the trulyesoteric sense automatically produces changes and a basic refocussing in thelife of the accepted disciple and of the initiate; these changes, transitionsand reactions are brought about by the action of the ray potencies during theperiod of initiation; the initiate then enters into relationship with rays whichare conditioning him at the time. They affect his soul-infused personality, andalso the ashram with which he is affiliated. The quality and potency of anashram is definitely affected by the admission of an initiate; he brings into itnot only his own potency and ray qualities as a soul, but also the energy of therays which produced the changes and which conditioned him during the initiatoryprocess he has just undergone. He then moves into a new stage of consciouscontact within the Ashram . This new state of perceptive spirituality permitsthe initiate to enter into a relation with all those who have undergone asimilar initiation. He therefore becomes increasingly a constructive andcreative agent in the ashram.It is this which necessitates his careful preparation, which must be paralleledby a demonstration of his understanding of the initiatory process upon the outerplane of activity in service. He cannot be permitted to enter the life of theashram and become the recipient of exceedingly active energies until he hasproved that these energies will not be “occultly retained” by him but willbecome the “strength and potency” of his service among men.We are entering now upon a somewhat close analysis of the energies of the sevenrays and their effects upon the initiatory processes which face the disciple.Every initiate enters upon the period of initiatory process possessed of acertain definite energy equipment. His personality is expressing itself withinthe periphery of the three worlds through clearly defined ray forms andrelationships. He is a personality through the integration of his mind, hisemotional nature and his physical body—the energy of the latter phenomenalfactor being focussed in the physical [563] brain. All of these are composed ofand conditioned by the energy units of which they are constituted, and all ofthem “focus their intention” through the medium of the physical brain, thusenabling the personality to be a self-directed entity upon the physical plane.To this personality a fifth major energy must be added: the energy of the soul.Each of these personality expressions is composed of and governed by one of theseven ray energies, so that a great and dynamic synthesis is present which—atthe time when the initiatory process is begun—is in reality a composite of fiveenergies:> 1. The energy of the soul, in itself a threefold energy.> 2. The energies of the personality which is of such a potency (being a fusion> of three ray energies) that it has evoked a ray which dominates the> personality and is called the personality ray:> a. The energy composing the mental vehicle.> b. The energy which demonstrates as the emotional nature.> c. The energy of the physical body, focussed on the physical plane and> conditioning the brain.All this information is elementary, but I repeat it for the sake of clarity andin order that we may know what it is that we are considering. In the case of theaccepted disciple who is in preparation for initiation, the term applied to thissystem of integrated energies is “soul-infused personality.” The fusion isnecessarily not complete, but enough soul energy is present to guarantee thatminimum of soul control which will make the initiatory process effective.It might also be said that this system of integrated energies is (through theinitiatory process) confronted with still higher fusions, because initiation isa process whereby successive integrations—attended by consequent expansions ofconsciousness—become possible. These are—in their broader significance, seven,though entailing many minor points of integration—as follows: [564]> 1. Fusion of the energies of the soul-infused personality with the triple> energies of the Spiritual Triad.> 2. Fusion with the Monad—of which the Spiritual Triad is an expression.> 3. Fusion with the world consciousness of the planetary Logos to a degree> which makes the planetary life, with all its states of consciousness and> phenomena, a major confining and constricting form for the initiate.In connection with this final fusion, it is worth while to point out that, whenthis stage of development is attained, it then becomes possible to enter intothe “exalted state of mind” which holds the planetary Logos focussed in theconsciousness of the sacrifice which He has made by means of the entire processof manifestation. As The Secret Doctrine has pointed out, this sacrifice whichHe has made on behalf of the untold myriad of lives which compose His body ofmanifestation, holds Him in physical expression until “the last weary pilgrim”has found his way home.The extent and essential purpose of this divine sacrifice become increasinglyclear to the initiate after the fifth initiation and constitute one of the primefactors which are considered by him when he faces the Initiation of Decision(the sixth initiation). At no stage of his unfoldment does he comprehend thebasic purpose and (speaking occultly) the “dynamic extent” of this sacrifice, asit is implemented by the will of the planetary Logos. Nevertheless, he doesrespond to a mental understanding of the lowest objective aspect of thissacrifice and to the nature of the periphery, or to the imprisoning form (thesum total) in which the planetary Logos has chosen to imprison Himself. For thefirst time in his life experience he arrives at a comprehension of the principleof limitation. Beyond this exalted state of mental perception the initiate isnot yet able to penetrate; he is limited by that sphere of activity which wecall the seven planes, and which in their totality constitute the cosmicphysical plane.Many lesser fusions take place within the phase of initiatory development whichintervenes between initiation [565] and initiation—a triple mental fusionbetween the three aspects of the mind (the lower mental vehicle, the soul or theSon of Mind, and the higher or abstract mind), fusion with the Master'sconsciousness, fusion with the ashram created by the ray energy which conditionshis soul, fusion in consciousness with the sum total of the integrated ashramswhich form the Ashram of Sanat Kumara. These successive and subsidiary fusionsreveal to him the phenomena and quality of the two higher states ofconsciousness of the Spiritual Triad: the buddhic or the state of pure reasonand the atmic or state of spiritually direct will intention. In giving you someinsight into the relationship of the rays and the initiations, I find itessential to discover new and arresting words and word phrases by which toexpress the familiar hints and indications given by the occult groups who havesought to awaken the modern consciousness to the fact and purposes ofinitiation.Initiation is a progressive sequence of directed energy impacts, characterisedby points of crisis and of tension and governed—in a sense not hithertorealised—by the Law of Cause and Effect. This Law of Cause and Effect (from thespiritual angle) appears to the progressing initiate to reverse the processwhich has up till now governed his life. Instead of his being impelled forwardon the path of evolution by spiritual energies which from higher spheres invokeand evoke his response and a developing expansion of consciousness, eachsuccessive initiation undergone, understood and demonstrated upon the physicalplane becomes the cause and influence which propels the initiate forward uponthe Path of Initiation. In one case the cause of progression is a streamingdownward of the energies, producing effects in that which is thus stimulated; inthe other case, the cause is to be found in the soul-infused personality andconstitutes an upward movement of the initiatory self-directed activity, of themeasure of love energy which his soul can express, and of the energy of willwhich is in itself the result of all the fusions he has at any given moment beencapable of consciously focussing [566] and using. These are points which it willbe difficult for you to grasp but which are of major importance.The human being is influenced upon the path of evolution from above downwards;the initiate is directed from within upwards. It is this which formulates theunderlying significance of the energy of free will and is something only trulypossible through self-direction; this can be seen struggling for expressiontoday in that great world disciple, Humanity.These concepts are worthy of your careful consideration. The sevenfold energywhich is today agitating mankind marks a turning point in human history andindicates the possibility of the transition of humanity on to the Path ofDiscipleship; on that Path freedom of expression and conscious self-directedliving will become increasingly possible.THE RAYS AND THE FIVE INITIATIONS CONFRONTING HUMANITYLet us now consider our theme of the rays and initiation. This signifies inreality a study of the rays as they actively condition the Path of Initiation.Forget not, we are dealing here with the Path of Initiation and not primarilywith the Path of Discipleship, even though the two paths are very closelyrelated; we are not dealing with the disciple's character and actions. We areconsidering one thing only: the type of ray energy which makes any specificinitiation possible, irrespective of the rays of the initiate.We are in fact considering initiation as a planetary process, and not thatprocess as it affects the individual initiate. That we shall consider under ourpoint “The Significance of the Initiations.” Then we shall take each initiationand consider it as outlined on page 340. This you will probably find moreinteresting, but you will comprehend what I then say with greater facility ifyou grasp some of the implications—as far as in you lies—of what I have now toimpart. [567]These five initiations are under the energy impulses of Rays 7, 6, 5, 4, plusthe dynamic influence of Ray 1 at the time of the fifth initiation. You willnote, therefore, that these initiations which confront average humanity are allof them conditioned by a minor ray, yet finally bring in the energy of thehighest Ray of Aspect, that of Will or Power. This dynamic electric energy hasto act in a new and different sense if the four higher initiations are to becomeliving objectives in the initiate's consciousness. It is for this reason thatthe fifth initiation is called the Initiation of Revelation. Some understandingof the first or will aspect is “conceded” at this initiation, and for the firsttime the nature of divine Purpose is revealed to the initiate; hitherto he hasbeen preoccupied with the nature of the Plan, which is after all an effect ofthe Purpose.In these five preliminary initiations the true nature of the minor rays, intheir creative aspect and as expressions of the quality of the manifested world,begins progressively to dawn upon the initiate. In the higher four initiationshe slowly arrives at a dim understanding of the purpose of creation; the truepurpose, however, and the nature of the will of the planetary Logos will only berevealed in the next solar system wherein the soul-infused Personality of theplanetary Logos will demonstrate living purpose within the ring-pass-not of thethree lower cosmic planes.With these abstruse ideas we need not concern ourselves. Let us study the energyconditions wherein the initiate proceeds from one initiation to another until hestands at the portal of revelation.Initiation I. The Birth at Bethlehem. Ray VII.> The Energy of Order or Ceremonial Magic.First of all, let us consider the type of energy which the seventh ray expressesand wherein lies its potency and efficacy, from the angle of the initiation. Aswe study these initiations and their conditioning rays, we will divide our ideasinto three parts:B [568]> 1. The type of energy and its quality in relation to the processes of the> particular initiation with which it is associated.> 2. Its effect upon humanity, regarding humanity as a world disciple.> 3. The stimulating nature of the energy as it expresses itself:> a. In the three aspects of the initiate's nature—mental, astral and physical.> b. Through the soul-infused personality, the initiate “in good standing” a> phrase of the deepest occult implication.At this particular time in world history, seventh ray energy is of a growingpotency because it is the new and incoming ray, superseding the sixth ray whichhas for so long held sway. When we speak of ray energy we are in realityconsidering the quality and the will-purpose aspect of a certain great Life toWhom we give the name “Lord of a Ray.” You will find much about these Ray Lordsin the earlier volumes of A Treatise on the Seven Rays. His divine intention,will, purpose, or the determined projection of His mind, creates a radiation orstream of energy which—according to type and quality—plays upon all forms ofmanifested life within our planetary ring-pass-not. These Lords of the Rays arethe creating and sustaining energies which implement the Will of the planetaryLogos. They cooperate with Him in the defining and the expression of His supremepurpose. Their radiating emanations are cyclically objectified and arecyclically withdrawn. As they radiate forth into the three worlds, the impactingenergies produce changes, disturbances, progress and unfoldment; they create theneeded new forms and vitalise and qualify that through which the immediatedivine intention is expressing itself; they intensify both the quality and thereceptivity of consciousness.At other times, during the process of being withdrawn “to their own place,” theycause the fading out or the dying of form aspects, of institutions, and the“organising [569] organisms” (to use a peculiar phrase); they therefore producecycles of destruction and of cessation and thus make room for those new formsand life expressions which an incoming ray will produce. It has been the gradualwithdrawing of the sixth Ray of Idealism and of one-pointed Devotion which hasbeen responsible for the ferment, crystallisation, destruction, death andcleavages of the past century; old things are passing away as the Lord of thesixth Ray withdraws His attention, and therefore His energy; His radiation istoday no longer centred or focussed in the life of the three worlds.Simultaneously, the energy and radiation of the Lord of the seventh Ray arebecoming steadily more powerful in the three worlds.This incoming of a ray always produces an intensified period of initiatoryactivity, and this is the case today. The major effect, as far as humanity isconcerned, is to make possible the presentation of thousands of aspirants andapplicants for the first initiation; men on a large scale and in mass formationcan today pass through the experience of the Birth Initiation. Thousands ofhuman beings can experience the birth of the Christ within themselves and canrealise that the Christ life, the Christ nature and the Christ consciousness aretheirs. This “new birth” initiation of the human family will take place inBethlehem, symbolically understood, for Bethlehem is the “house of bread”—anoccult term signifying physical plane experience. These great initiations,implemented by the ray energies, must be registered in the physical brain andrecorded by the waking consciousness of the initiate, and this must be the casein this amazing period wherein—for the first time since humanity appeared onEarth—there can take place a mass initiation. The experience need not beexpressed in occult terms, and in the majority of cases will not be; theindividual initiate who takes this initiation is aware of great changes in hisattitude to himself, to his fellowmen, to circumstances and to hisinterpretation of life events. These are peculiarly the reactions which attendthe first initiation; a new orientation to life and a new [570] world of thoughtare registered by the initiate. This will be equally true on a large scale wheremodern man, the world initiate of the first degree, is concerned. Men willrecognise the evidences in many lives of the emergence of theChrist-consciousness, and the standard of living will increasingly be adjustedto the truth as it exists in the teachings of the Christ.This developing Christ-consciousness in the masses of men will createnecessarily a ferment in the daily life of peoples everywhere; the life of thepersonality, oriented hitherto to the attaining of material and purely selfishends, will be at war with the new and inner realisation; the “carnal” man (touse the words of Paul, the initiate) will be battling the spiritual man, eachseeking to achieve control. In the early stages, after the “birth” and duringthe “infancy of the Christ-Child” (again speaking in symbols), the materialaspect is triumphant. Later, the Christ life triumphs. This you well know. Eachinitiation indicates a stage in the growth and the development of this newfactor in the human consciousness and expression, and this continues until thethird initiation, when there emerges the “full-grown man in Christ.” Theinitiate is then ready, at the fifth initiation, to register, realise and recordthe long awaited revelation.In connection with the individual and the first initiation, the seventh ray isalways active and the man is enabled consciously to register the fact ofinitiation because either the brain or the mind (and frequently both) arecontrolled by the seventh ray. It is this fact which is of importance today inconnection with humanity, for it will enable mankind to pass through the dooradmitting them to the first initiatory process. It will be apparent to you whythe present period in which human beings (in large groups) can take the firstinitiation corresponds to a situation in which bread is the major interest ofmen everywhere. Humanity will pass through this “birth” initiation and manifestthe Christ life on a large scale for the first time during a period of economicadjustment of [571] which the word “bread” is but a symbol. This period startedin the year 1825 and will continue until the end of this century. The unfoldmentof the Christ life—as a result of the presence and activities of the seconddivine aspect of love—will result in the ending of economic fear, and the “houseof bread” will become the “house of plenty.” Bread—as the symbol of materialhuman need—will eventually be controlled by a vast group of initiates of thefirst initiation—by those whose lives are beginning to be controlled by theChrist-consciousness, which is the consciousness of responsibility and service.These initiates exist in their thousands today; they will be present in theirmillions by the time the year 2025 arrives. All this re-orientation andunfoldment will be the result of the activity of the seventh ray and of theimpact of its radiation upon humanity.The seventh ray is, par excellence, the medium of relationship. It bringstogether the two fundamental aspects of spirit and matter. It relates soul andform and, where humanity is concerned, it relates soul and personality. In thefirst initiation, it makes the initiate aware of that relation; it enables himto take advantage of this “approaching duality” and—by the perfecting of thecontact—to produce upon the physical plane the emergence into manifestation ofthe “new man.” At the first initiation, through the stimulation brought about byseventh ray energy, the personality of the initiate and the hoveringovershadowing soul are consciously brought together; the initiate then knowsthat he is—for the first time—a soul-infused personality. His task is now togrow into the likeness of what he essentially is. This development isdemonstrated at the third initiation, that of the Transfiguration.The major function of this seventh ray is to bring together the negative andpositive aspects of the natural processes. It consequently governs the sexrelationship of all forms; it is the potency underlying the marriage relation,and hence as this ray comes into manifestation in this world cycle, we have theappearance of fundamental sex [572] problems—license, disturbance in themarriage relation, divorce and the setting in motion of those forces which willeventually produce a new attitude to sex and the establishing of thosepractices, attitudes and moral perceptions which will govern the relationbetween the sexes during the coming New Age.The first initiation is therefore closely related to this problem. The seventhray governs the sacral centre and the sublimation of its energy into the throator into the higher creative centre; this ray is therefore setting in motion aperiod of tremendous creative activity, both on the material plane through thestimulation of the sex life of all peoples and in the three worlds through thestimulation brought about when soul and form are consciously related. The firstmajor proof that humanity (through the medium of the majority of its advancedpeople) has undergone the first initiation will be the appearance of a cycle ofentirely new creative art. This creative urge will take forms which will expressthe new incoming energies. Just as the period governed by the sixth ray hasculminated in a world wherein men work in great workshops and factories toproduce the plethora of objects men deem needful for their happiness andwell-being, so in the seventh ray cycle we shall see men engaged on an evenlarger scale in the field of creative art. Devotion to objects will eventuallybe superseded by the creation of that which will more truly express the Real;ugliness and materiality will give place to beauty and reality. On a largescale, humanity has already been “led from darkness to light” and the light ofknowledge fills the land. In the period which lies ahead and under theinfluencing radiation of the seventh ray, humanity will be “led from the unrealto the Real.” This the first initiation makes possible for the individual andwill make possible for the mass of men.Seventh ray energy is the energy needed to bring order out of chaos and rhythmto replace disorder. It is this energy which will bring in the new world orderfor which all men wait; it will restore the ancient landmarks, indicate [573]the new institutions and forms of civilisation and culture which human progressdemands, and nurture the new life and the new states of consciousness whichadvanced humanity will increasingly register. Nothing can arrest this activity;all that is happening today as men search for the new ways, for organised unityand peaceful security, is being implemented through the incoming Ray of Order orCeremonial Magic. The white magic of right human relations cannot be stopped; itmust inevitably demonstrate effectively, because the energy of this seventh rayis present, and the Lord of the Ray is cooperating with the Lord of the World tobring about the needed “reforming.” Soul-infused personalities, acting underthis ray influence, will create the new world, express the new qualities andinstitute those new regimes and organised modes of creative activity which willdemonstrate the new livingness and the new techniques of living. It is thedistortion of these seventh ray ideals and the prostitution of this incomingenergy to serve the unenlightened and selfish ambitions of greedy men which hasproduced those totalitarian systems which today so terribly imprison the freespirit of men.To sum up what I have said:> 1. The energy of the seventh ray is the potent agent of initiation when taken> on the physical plane, that is, during the process of the first initiation.> 2. Its effect upon humanity will be:> a. To bring about the birth of the Christ-consciousness among the masses of> intelligently aspiring human beings.> b. To set in motion certain relatively new evolutionary processes which will> transform humanity (the world disciple) into humanity (the world initiate).> c. To establish in a new and intelligible manner the ever-existent sense of> relationship and thus bring about upon the physical plane right human> relations. The agent of this is goodwill, a reflection [574] of the> will-to-good of the first divine aspect. Of this first Ray of Will or Purpose,> goodwill is the reflection.> d. To readjust negative and positive relationships, and—today—this will be> carried forward primarily in connection with the sex relation and marriage.> e. To intensify human creativity and thus bring in the new art as a basis for> the new culture and as a conditioning factor in the new civilisation.> f. To reorganise world affairs and so initiate the new world order. This is> definitely in the realm of ceremonial magic.> 3. The stimulation of this seventh ray will, in relation to the individual> initiate,> a. Bring into being upon the mental plane a widespread and recognised relation> between the soul and the mind.> b. Produce a measure of order in the emotional processes of the initiate, thus> aiding the preparatory work of the second initiation.> c. Enable the initiate—upon the physical plane—to establish certain service> relationships, to learn the practice of elementary white magic, and to> demonstrate the first stage of a truly creative life.As far as the individual initiate is concerned, the effect of seventh ray energyin his life is potent in the extreme; this is easily realised, owing to the factthat his mind and his brain are conditioned by the seventh ray at the time thatthe initiatory process is consciously taking place. The effect of this upon themental plane is similar to that seen—on a much larger scale—in the planet, forit was this ray energy which the planetary Logos utilised when He broughttogether the major dualities of spirit and matter at the commencement of Hiscreative work. The two aspects of the mind (the lower concrete mind and thesoul, the Son of Mind) become more closely related and enter eventually into aconscious, recognised association on the [575] astral plane ; it is the seventhray which restores order within the astral consciousness, and (on the mentalplane), it is this influence which produces creativity, the organising of thelife, and the bringing together “within the head” of the lower and higherenergies in such a manner that “the Christ is born.” This latter point we shallconsider in some detail when we take up the significance of the initiations; weshall then find that the relationship between the pituitary body and the pinealgland is involved.Finally, it is seventh ray energy which—in the initiatory process between thefirst and the second initiations—enables the initiate (in his physical planelife) to demonstrate a developing sense of order and of organisation, to expressconsciously and increasingly a desire to help his fellowmen, and therebyestablish relationship with them, and to make his life creative in many ways.All these factors are embryonic in his nature, but he now begins to consciouslylay the foundation for the future initiatory work; the physical disciplines areat this time of great importance, though their value is frequentlyover-emphasised and their effect is not always good; the relationshipsestablished and fostered are sometimes of small value, owing to the disciplebeing usually self-centered and thus lacking—from ignorance and lack ofdiscrimination—complete purity of motive. Nevertheless, the changes broughtabout by the influence of this ray become increasingly effective from life tolife; the disciple's relation to the Hierarchy, the reorganising of his life onthe physical plane, and his growing effort to demonstrate the esoteric sense ofwhite magic will become more and more vital until he is ready for the secondinitiation.Initiation II. The Baptism in Jordan. Ray VI.> The Energy of Idealism and Devotion.In the initiatory process between the first initiation of the Birth of theChrist and the beginning of the conscious unfoldment of the Christ life andawareness, the life of the initiate has undergone a pronounced reorientation.[576] He is now capable of an equally pronounced and often fanatical adherenceto the programme of aspiration and of devotion to the good (as he sees it atthis stage). This is symbolised for us in the story of the twelve year old JesusWho was so conscious that He “must be about His Father's business” that Hedefied His parents, caused them distress, and astonished those older than He byHis spiritual poise and knowledge. This He offset by going down to Galilee andbeing “subservient” to His parents. A somewhat similar attitude (without thedeveloped and inclusive understanding manifested by the Christ) can be seenexpressing itself in the disciple during the period wherein the new orientationis taking place; the disciple is learning to discipline his lower nature and toachieve a measure of mastery over his physical inclinations; he thus releasesphysical energy and brings order into his life. This takes a very long time andmay cover a cycle of many incarnations. He is constantly fighting against hislower nature, and the requirements of his soul (as he somewhat ignorantlyinterprets them) are in constant session against the animal nature, andincreasingly in relation to the emotional nature.Above all, he becomes aware of a secondary relation, involving a most difficultproblem and one which enhances the fight and intensifies his problem. Hediscovers that his emotional nature, his lower psychic faculties, his astraldevelopment and the potency of glamour are now all arrayed against him.The reorientation with which he is now faced has to be brought about primarilyupon the astral plane, because that has been for untold aeons the level of hismajor polarisation and the sphere of activity and the state of consciousnesswhich has dominated him. The physical body is not a principle; his etheric bodyhas, since Atlantean days, been the agent of his astral energy, for the mindnature is not yet developed and cannot, therefore, adequately take control. Hediscovers that he lives in a chaos of emotional reactions and of conditioningglamours. He slowly begins [577] to realise that in order to take the secondinitiation he must demonstrate emotional control; he realises also that he musthave some knowledge of those spiritual energies which will dissipate glamour,plus an understanding of the technique whereby illumination from the mind—as thetransmitting agent of the light of the soul—can dispel these glamours and thus“clarify the atmosphere”, in the technical sense.I might emphasise that as yet no initiate demonstrates complete control duringthe intermediate period between any initiation and the next higher initiation;the intermediate period is regarded as “a cycle of perfecting” That which isbeing left behind and subordinated to the higher realisation is slowly dominatedby energies which are to be released into the consciousness of the initiate atthe initiation for which he is being prepared. This interim period is always oneof great difficulty. The energies being registered, made active and finallyused, are steadily increasing in number and potency at each initiation; theseimpacts upon the rays of the soul and the personality rays of the initiate, andon the subsidiary vehicles through which he works in the three worlds and upontheir individual conditioning rays, produce at first tremendous difficulties;these the initiate must master and the problems involved he must solve. Hethereby becomes a Master, and the process, as it goes forward from initiation toinitiation, becomes (after the third initiation, the Transfiguration) less hardand distressing; the reason for this is that he is increasingly master of hisown individual situation. He is, however, occultly involved in the difficultiesand the problems of the group and of that totality of groups which we callhumanity.The initiatory process between the first and the second initiations is for manythe worst time of distress, difficulty, realisation of problems and the constanteffort to “clear himself” (as it is occultly called), to which the disciple isat any time subjected. The phrase stating that the objective of the initiate is“to clear himself” is perhaps the most [578] arresting and illuminating of allpossible definitions of the task to be undertaken. The storm aroused by hisemotional nature, the dark clouds and mists in which he constantly walks andwhich he has created throughout the entire cycle of incarnated living, have allto be cleared away in order that the initiate can say that—for him—the astralplane no longer exists, and that all that remains of that ancient and potentaspect of his being is aspiration, a sensitive response to all forms of divinelife and a form through which the lowest aspect of divine love, goodwill, canflow without impediment.From the larger point of view, it is this struggle to clear the world atmospherewhich will confront humanity after the first initiation, so close at hand today.You will see, therefore, why the Christ must come at this time, for He is theOne Who presides at the first and second initiations, and it is His coming whichwill indicate that humanity has taken the first initiation, which will confirmand consolidate the work done and which will inaugurate the world cycle andperiod in which the task of reorganising the emotional and psychic life ofhumanity will take place; this period will release the energy of goodwill andthus automatically bring about right human relations.As regards humanity as a whole, polarised as it is in the emotional nature, theeffect of this sixth ray is potent in the extreme. Its energy has been playingupon men ever since it came into incarnation, and the last one hundred fiftyyears have seen that potency become extremely effective. Two factors haveenhanced this effect:> 1. The sixth Ray of Idealism or of Devotion is the ray which normally governs> the astral plane, controlling its phenomena and colouring its glamour.> 2. The stream of energy, coming into our planetary life from the constellation> Pisces, has for two thousand years conditioned human experience and is> peculiarly fitted to blend with and complement this sixth ray energy and to> produce exactly the situation which is today governing world affairs.[579] The united activity of these two great streams of cosmic energy, playingupon and through the third planetary centre, Humanity, has created the uniquecondition in which “the race of men” can stand before the planetary Initiator,the Christ, and under the focussed stimulation of the Hierarchy, pass throughthe appropriate initiation.It should here be remembered that the masses of men can and will take the firstinitiation, but that a very large group of aspirants (far larger than isrealised) will pass through the experience of the second initiation, that of thepurifying Baptism. These are the people who express the essential qualities ofideological recognition, devoted adherence to truth as sensed, profound reactionto the physical disciplines (imposed since they participated in the firstinitiation many lives earlier) and a growing responsiveness to the aspirationalaspect of the astral body; this aspiration is occupied with reaching out towardscontact with and expression of the mental principle. This particular group inthe human family are “kama-manasic” initiates, just as those taking the firstinitiation are “physico-etheric” initiates.It is the activity of this sixth ray which has brought out into the light of daythe growing ideological tendencies of mankind. These world ideologies (of whichthere are many present in the world today) are created by a triple reaction tothe two streams of energy mentioned above:1. The unfoldment of the mental principle in mankind during this Aryan Age hasforced desire into the form of great mass concepts; these unitedly are governingthe mass tendency toward mental unfoldment.2. The steadily growing soul influence, working like a leaven on the astralplane, has lifted kama or desire out of its purely self-centred focus andbrought in a new and hitherto unexpressed group emotional consciousness; thisleads the fused emotional nature of men into great ideological mass expression,still selfish; expressed and impulsed as yet by emotional excesses, butindicating new and better goals. These goals will assume clearer and moredesirable [580] outlines when the second initiation is undergone by the worldaspirant.3. The influence generated by the Shamballa energy which has, for the firsttime, made direct contact with Humanity, is producing an emotional vortex inwhich old ideals and institutions are seen divorced from their hithertocontrolling glamours, thus permitting the new and better ideologies to emerge inthe consciousness of the race.All these factors are responsible for the world situation at this time; greatideologies, potent groupings of workers and thinkers dedicated to the changingof the old order, and massed efforts to end separativeness are all presentsimultaneously. The essential etheric world unity (of which the telephone, theradio and the airplane are the tangible expression) is swinging vast groups ofmen everywhere into united emotional activity, thus creating those preliminarytestings which ever precede initiation, and by means of which those capable oftaking the second initiation are today passing.I cannot here enlarge upon the various ideologies which are presentingthemselves to the world of men—impulsed by the Hierarchy, precipitated into thehuman consciousness from the mental plane by the new group of world servers,implemented by the energy of the sixth ray, by the dominant Piscean energy andby the organising energy of the incoming seventh ray, and responded toemotionally by the masses of men focussed on the astral plane. To allintelligent observers, this ideological situation is clear; it is a needed andpreliminary stage to the creation of the new world order; it provides a point ofcrisis and the required point of tension which will enable those aspirants whoare ready today, in their thousands, to pass through the experience of thesecond initiation and to undergo the purification of the fluid emotional naturein the Baptism Initiation. Through this experience the kama-manasic aspirantwill be in a positive and spiritual condition to bring about (on the astralplane) those fundamental changes, rearrangements and readjustments which will[581] bring that level of planetary consciousness into line with the immediatedivine purpose: the manifestation of the Kingdom of God.The work of sixth ray energy, the result of the long cycle of Piscean energy,and the impact of the incoming Aquarian energy will bring a potenttransformation in the “watery realm” of the astral plane. The symbol of thatplane has ever been water—fluid, stormy, reflecting all impressions, the sourceof mist and fog, and yet ever essential to human living. The Piscean Age, now inprocess of passing away, is also closely related to this plane and to the symbolof water; it fixed in the human consciousness the realisation that “men are asfishes, immersed in the sea of emotions.” Aquarius is also known by the symbolof water, for Aquarius is the “water-carrier.” The sixth ray will bring togetherall these energies in time and space: ray energy, Piscean energy, Aquarianenergy and the energy of the astral plane itself; this again produces a vortexof force which is invocative of mental energy; it is a controlling factor, whichhas plunged humanity into a tumultuous awareness of clashing ideologies, whichhas precipitated a reflected vortex in the world war, and which is responsiblefor the present crisis and point of tension. This critical point of tension willenable groups of aspirants who—having passed through the first initiation—canundergo the Baptism experience, again a word identified with water.Simultaneously, large masses of men will take the first initiation and “in thehouse of bread” stand before the Initiator.The coming Christ will therefore initiate two groups of aspirants within thenear future and in preparation for His coming; it is the closer approach of theChrist and of the Hierarchy of Masters to humanity which is implementing theinitiatory energies, which is crystallising the ideologies present today in thehuman consciousness, and fostering—if I may so express it—the latent ideology ofthe Kingdom of God.As regards the individual initiate who is to undergo the initiation of theBaptism, the effect of sixth ray energy [582] upon his nature is easilyapparent, owing to the extreme potency of the second aspect of the personalityin the three worlds, his astral body or nature. In the early stages of theimpact of sixth ray energy upon his emotional nature a perfect vortex of forceis generated, his emotional reactions are violent and compelling, his glamoursare intensified and controlling, and his aspiration steadily mounts, but is atthe same time limited and hindered by the strength of his devotion to somesensed ideology. Later, under the influence of an increasing soul contact(itself the second aspect of his essential divinity), his emotional, kamic andaspirational nature becomes quieter and is more controlled through the agency ofthe mind; his alignment becomes astral-mental-soul. When this state ofconsciousness has been achieved and the “waters” of the astral body are quietand can reflect the beautiful and the true, and when his emotions have beenpurified by intense self-effort, then the disciple can step into the baptismalwaters; he is then subjected to an intense purificatory experience which,occultly speaking, enables him “for ever to step out of the waters and be nolonger in danger of drowning or of submergence”; he can now “walk on the surfaceof the sea and with safety proceed onward towards his goal.”The effect of sixth ray activity upon the mental nature is, as you may imagine,a tendency—first of all—to the crystallising of thought, a reaction toimprisoning ideologies, and a fanatical mental adherence to mass ideals, with nounderstanding of their relationship to the need of the time or to their intendedcreative aspects. Later, as the disciple prepares for the second initiation,these tendencies are transformed into spiritual devotion to human welfare and toa one-pointed adherence to the Plan of the Hierarchy; all emotional reaction tothe Hierarchy of Masters fades out, and the disciple can now work without beinghindered by constant astral disturbances.The effect of sixth ray energy upon the integrated personality of the disciplecan only be described as producing a condition wherein he is definitelyastral-buddhic [583] in his nature; gradually his one-pointed emotional efforttowards orientation to the soul makes him “an aspiring point of tension,oblivious of crisis and firmly anchored in the love which streams forth from thesoul.”Let me sum up what I have said anent the effect of sixth ray energy:1. The energy of the sixth ray produces two major results:> a. An embryonic realisation of the will nature which determines the life of> the initiate.> b. A pronounced conflict between the lower and the higher self. This reveals> to the initiate the ancient conflict between the emotional nature and true> realisation.This brings about a basic reorientation of the life of the initiate and ofhumanity as a whole.2. In connection with humanity, the effects of the sixth ray are as follows:> a. The development of a tendency to clarify the world atmosphere, thus> releasing the energy of goodwill.> b. The production of a condition wherein “the race of men” can take either the> first or the second initiation.> c. The sudden and powerful emergence of the world ideologies.> d. A basic transformation within the astral plane itself which is producing> points of crisis and a point of tension.3. In relation to the individual initiate, the sixth ray produces:> a. An acute situation wherein a vortex of force is generated.> b. In this vortex all the emotional and ideological reactions of the aspirant> are intensified.> c. Later, when this subsides, the initiate's alignment becomes> astral-mental-soul.> d. There takes place, in connection with his mental vehicle, a crystallisation> of all thought and a fanatical adherence to mass idealism. [584]> e. These tendencies are later transformed into spiritual devotion to human> welfare.> f. The personality becomes definitely astral-buddhic in nature and expression.You will see, therefore, how immediate and important is the opportunityconfronting humanity today. Vast numbers of men will take the first step towardsthe unfolding of the Christ consciousness and thus pass through the firstinitiation. This often (I might well say usually) takes place without theconscious realisation of the physical brain. This first initiation is—and alwayshas been—mass initiation, even when individually registered and recorded.Thousands of aspirants in every country (as a result of conscious effort tounderstand) will stand before the initiator and undergo the Baptism Initiation;bread and water are the symbols of these first two initiations; both are basicessentials for life in the physical sense, and are equally basic in theirimplications spiritually; this the initiate knows. These two initiations are theonly two of significant importance at this time, owing to their relativeimmediacy.It is the return of the Christ which has brought these subjective spiritualtendencies of mankind to the surface and made these two initiations possible; itis the activity of the seventh Ray of Order and of the sixth Ray of Idealismwhich has generated the tendency in humanity towards the white magic of righthuman relations. They have fostered the trend to ideological control of thehuman consciousness. It is the passing out of the Piscean Age with its type ofenergy, and the coming into power of the Aquarian Age (with its potentpurificatory energies and its quality of synthesis and universality) which willmake the new world order possible. It is therefore apparent that the opportunityconfronting humanity has never been so promising and that the corporate relationand fusion of all these energies makes the manifestation of the Sons of God andthe appearance of the Kingdom of God an inevitable happening in our planetarylife. [585]As we study the other ray energies and their initiatory effect, we shall not beable to indicate a great deal in relation to humanity itself. Only the first twoinitiations which are implemented by the Christ and which are “under thesupervisory probation of the spiritual Hierarchy” are as yet possible tohumanity. The initiation of the Transfiguration is not yet for the mass of men.We can, however, study the effects of these rays where the individual discipleis concerned, because the later initiations—from the third initiation onward—areadministered by the Lord of the World from His high place in Shamballa; in thepresent world period, these initiations are individually administered andregistered, and are undergone consciously and with an entirely awakenedawareness.It will be apparent to you that I shall necessarily have more to say anent thefirst three initiations and the ray effects upon the initiate and upon humanitythan will be possible when the higher initiations come under consideration. Theeffects of ray impacts in the first three initiations come via the soul, and theinitiate is—during this period—a struggling aspirant, under the inspiration andthe stimulation of the Hierarchy of which he is becoming increasingly aware.After the third initiation, which is in reality as you well know, the firstmajor initiation, the ray energy is applied (if I may use such an inadequateword) via the Spiritual Triad, utilising the antahkarana.After the fourth initiation, the effects are felt predominantly in theinitiate's group and in his field of service; there, he constitutes a point oftension and precipitates great points of crisis. His own points of crisis and oftension are existent but, mysteriously, only in relation to his consciousness ofthe group in which he plays an increasingly potent part.The groups affected by the progressive initiatory process to which the discipleis being subjected are three in number, and these effects differentiate andcondition his group service, according to the initiation being undergone; it isfrom this angle we must study the initiation, [586] the ray effects, and theresults produced within the three groups. These are:1. The group in which the initiate is working upon the physical plane and whichis an externalisation (existing on the mental and astral planes) of some phaseof work sponsored by the New Group of World Servers. All disciples and initiatesin physical manifestation are at this time members of that group, which is thefocal point of the present effort being made by the Hierarchy. Through itspiritual energy from five of the Ashrams is flowing. These five are:> a. The Ashram of the Master K.H., particularly in regard to the work of> education.> b. The Ashram of the Master D.K. (myself), particularly in regard to aspirants> for initiation.> c. The Ashram of the Master R., particularly in regard to the reorganising and> the reconstruction of Europe, from the point of view of economics.> d. The Ashram of the Master Morya, as He seeks to find, influence and direct> the activities of workers in the political field throughout the planet.> e. The Ashram of the Master Hilarion, as He supervises the discoveries (and> the application of such discoveries) of the scientific movement in the world> today.You will note, therefore, the profound and widespread interest of this field ofenergy wherein ray energy is now active.2. The group which may regard itself consciously as the initiate's own group, inthe sense that he is slowly influencing those around him, collecting thepersonnel and forming the nucleus of the Ashram by means of which he may someday serve the world. All those who are taking initiation do not necessarilycreate their own ashrams, though a large number do so. The work of thoseinitiates who do not form an ashram is mysterious in the extreme, from the pointof view of aspiring humanity, and there is little that I may say about thesubject. These initiates work [587] in connection with plans emanating fromShamballa, of which humanity can know nothing; they work with the three subhumankingdoms in nature, each of which has its own peculiar and specific band ofinitiate-workers. If they do not do this, they transfer into certain groups ofworkers who are engaged in activities connected with the deva or angelevolution, or in relation to the manifestation of energies about which I cantell you nothing. We shall deal only with the expansion of consciousness and theexperience of those initiates who remain—in their activities and aims—related tohumanity and to the Hierarchy. It might here be pointed out that:> a. The work of the deva evolution comes under the ray energy of the third> Buddha of Activity.> b. The work with humanity comes under the influence of the ray energy of the> second Buddha of Activity, Who embodies in a most peculiar sense the> conditioning energy of the Hierarchy.> c. The work with the subhuman kingdoms of nature is under the energy> stimulation of the first Buddha of Activity.Each of these great energising Lives works through certain Masters and Initiatesof the sixth initiation; these Masters work in full consciousness upon the atmicplane, the plane of the spiritual will; from that high level, They function astransmitting agents for the energy of one of the three Buddhas of Activity.These three Buddhas are the creative Agents of the planetary Logos and areWielders of the Law of Evolution.3. The ashramic group of which the initiate is a part and within which hisinfluence or spiritual radiation is increasingly felt.The awareness of the initiate and his ability to work consciously within thistriplicity of groups becomes the major objective of all his efforts, once thethird initiation is left behind. His magnetic radiation and the expression ofhis controlling energies-prior to this stage of unfoldment—is [588] that of thesoul, working through the personality. After the third initiation this radiationand the energy expressed become increasingly monadic and subject to threestages:1. The stage wherein the lowest aspect of the Spiritual Triad (that of theabstract mind) becomes potent as the conveyor of ideas; these are transformed bythe initiate into ideals for the service of humanity.2. The stage wherein pure reason, plus the spiritual will, makes him aneffective server of the Plan and a transmitter, in a progressive manner, of thePurpose underlying the Plan.3. The stage wherein pure monadic energy pours through him, focussing thewill-to-good, as registered by the Hierarchy, and the sense of universality (nota vague phrase, but a specific potency) upon the physical plane. A close studyof these developing ranges of activity and of expanded consciousness willindicate why and how our planetary life is one immense synthesis of orderedactivity.The ray energies, utilising the created form world and the “world of formlessforms” (that is, the cosmic etheric levels of activity), constitute a great andapplied process of initiatory activity, governing, controlling and conditioningevery expression of divine life in all the kingdoms of nature—subhuman, humanand superhuman. It is into this world of active moving energies that theinitiate penetrates and within which he must consciously play his part. As youwell know, the work of the aspirant today is to become a conscious,self-controlled and spiritual worker in energy within the ring-pass-not of thethree worlds and—as I have frequently pointed out—to function, first of all, incontrol of his physical instrument, demonstrating this at the first initiationand during the succeeding initiatory processes; secondly, to control hisemotional, feeling nature, demonstrating that control at the second initiation;at the third initiation, he has to bring into visible activity the mentalelement, and thus function in the three worlds as a soul-infused personality,utilising the illumined mind as the fusing and synthesising factor. These things[589] accomplished, he can—again in full consciousness—begin to be active as “aradiating point of crisis and a producer of the needed tension.”These three groups are essentially points of planetary tension and are producersof crisis in the lives of the individuals influenced and in the Hierarchy, aswell as in the planetary life. Thus the conditions are created which makeevolution possible. Some day the story of the evolutionary process will bewritten by an initiate of the great White Lodge, from the angle of its points ofcrisis and the subsequent points of tension. This enables the living forms,under this dual impact, to emerge into larger areas of consciousness. Eachkingdom in nature can itself be regarded as a point of tension within the sphereof Being of the planetary Logos, and each—in time and space—is in process ofgenerating those points of crisis which will produce a potent (and often sudden)moving forward upon the Path of Evolution. Humanity is today, in its presentsituation as a point of planetary crisis, generating such a point of tensionthat it will shortly be enabled to move forward into the new age dispensation,culture and civilisation. The study of the individual aspirant parallels this.These thoughts and ideas must be borne in mind as we study the remaining threemajor initiations confronting average humanity.Initiation III. The Transfiguration. Ray V.> The Energy of Concrete Knowledge.As all disciples have to be focussed on the mental plane and must operate fromthat level of consciousness, the understanding of this type of consciousness isone of major importance. It is glibly and most easily said that disciples and(necessarily so) initiates must use the mind, and that their polarisation mustbe mental. But what does this mean? Let me give you some concise definitions ofthis ray energy, leaving you to make your own individual application, and fromyour study of these concepts anent the mind, learn to gauge your own mentalcondition. [590]1. The energy of what is so peculiarly called “concrete science” is the qualityor the conditioning nature of the fifth ray.2. It is pre-eminently the substance of the mental plane. This plane correspondsto the third subplane of the physical plane, and is therefore gaseous innature—if you care to use its correspondence as a symbol of its nature. It isvolatile, easily dispersed, is the receptive agent of illumination, and can bepoisonous in its effect, for there are undoubtedly conditions in which “the mindis the slayer of the Real.”3. This energy is characterised by three qualities:> a. The quality which is the result of relationship with the Spiritual Triad.> We call this “abstract mind” and the impact which affects it comes from the> atmic level of the Spiritual Triad, that of spiritual will.> b. The quality which in this solar system is easily responsive to the major> ray of the planet, that of love-wisdom. So responsive is it that—in> conjunction with emanations from the three worlds—it has produced the one> existent form upon the mental plane. This form (in the planetary sense) is> that of the Kingdom of God and, in the individual sense, is that of the ego or> soul.> c. The quality which is basically related to the emanations or vibrations> arising from the three worlds; these creatively result in the myriads of> thoughtforms which are found upon the lower levels of the mental plane. It> might therefore be said that these qualities or aspects of the fifth ray of> spiritual energy produce:> > Pure thought> > The thinker or the Son of Mind> > Thoughtforms4. This energy (as far as mankind is concerned) is the thoughtform makingenergy, and all impressions from the physical, etheric and astral planes forceit into activity on the level of concrete knowledge, with a resultantkaleidoscopic presentation of thoughtforms. [591]5. It is fundamentally the most potent energy at this time in the planet,because it was brought to maturity in the first solar system, that of activeintelligence.6. It is the energy which admits humanity (and particularly the trained discipleor initiate) into the mysteries of the Mind of God Himself. It is the“substantial” key to the Universal Mind.7. It is profoundly susceptible to the energy of Love-Wisdom, and its fusionwith the love aspect is given the name of “wisdom” by us, because all wisdom isknowledge gained by experience and implemented by love.8. This energy, in its three aspects, is related in a peculiar sense to thethree Buddhas of Activity. These great Lives reached Their present state ofdevelopment in the previous solar system.9. This energy, in so far as it is considered as the mental energy of a humanbeing—and this is one of its minor limitations though a major one for a humanbeing—is the higher correspondence of the physical brain. It might be said thatthe brain exists because the mind exists and needs a brain as its focal pointupon the physical plane.10. The quality of this energy of concrete knowledge or science is twofold:> a. It is extraordinarily responsive to impressions coming from some source or> other.> b. It is rapidly thrown into forms in response to impression.11. The impressions received come from three sources and are sequentiallyrevealed to man. These three are:> a. Impressions from the three worlds; these come, first of all, from the> individual and then, secondly, from the levels of planetary consciousness.> b. Impressions from the soul, the Son of Mind, upon the level of mentality> itself.> c. Impressions from the Spiritual Triad, via the antahkarana; these come when> the antahkarana is constructed or in process of construction. [592]12. This energy is essentially a light-bearer. It responds—again sequentially intime and space—to the light of the Logos. It is for this reason that the mind isregarded both as illumined when higher contacts are present and as anilluminator where the lower planes are concerned.13. This energy is (from the human standpoint) awakened and brought intoactivity through the action of the five senses which are the conveyors ofinformation from the three worlds to the mental plane. It might be said that> a. Five streams of informative energy, therefore, make their impact upon the> concrete mind and emanate from the physico-astral plane.> b. Three streams of energy, coming from the soul, also make an impression upon> the concrete mind.> c. One stream of energy—during the initiatory process—contacts the mind. This> comes from the Spiritual Triad and utilises the antahkarana.14. The energy of this fifth ray might be regarded as the commonsense, becauseit receives all these impacts of varying energies, synthesises them, producesorder out of the many ceaseless impacts and interprets them, thus creating themultiplicity of forms to which we give the name of “world thought”.15. This energy transforms the divine ideas into human ideals, relating theknowledges and sciences of humanity to these ideals, thus making them workablefactors in human evolution, its cultures and civilisations.There is much more that I could add, but the above gives you a series of simpledefinitions of value as you study the mental unfoldment of the disciple, as heundergoes the initiatory process which is our theme at this time. It also throwslight upon the ray effects upon humanity as a whole . This ray energy is indeedsadly concrete in its expression in our Aryan race—a race, however, which willsee more people take initiation than ever before in human history, and whichwill, in a peculiar sense, see the descent of the Kingdom of God to Earth as aresult of the ascent of so many upon the ladder of evolution. Just as thedisciple [593] or the initiate is a soul-infused personality, so willhumanity—upon the physical plane—be also soul-infused, thus precipitating theKingdom of God and giving birth to a new kingdom in nature. This great spiritualdescent will be prefaced (if I may use such a word) by the appearance of theChrist among the peoples of the world and by a stupendous inflow of love-wisdom.There is a tendency in the minds of esotericists always to refer to the greatlines of force: 1-3-5-7 and 2-4-6. I would have you remember with still greateremphasis the relation of rays II and V and of the second plane, the monadicplane, and the fifth plane, the mental plane; it is the relation of these majorenergies which makes the initiation of the Transfiguration possible.What is the effect of this ray upon humanity as a whole and at this time? Theeffect of these influences is very great and of supreme importance in this fifthroot race, the Aryan race, in this second solar system. Again you can see theclarity of the correspondences which are emerging. I would have you note themagain.> 1. Ray II, the Ray of Love-Wisdom; and Ray V, the Ray of Concrete Knowledge or> Science.> 2. The second plane, the monadic plane; and the fifth plane, the mental plane.> 3. The second solar system of love; and the fifth root race, the Aryan race,> of active intelligence.In all these basic relationships, that which is the fifth in order is destinedto be the instrument, the vehicle or the implementing factor for the second. TheUniversal Mind, as it works through all the planes of our conscious planetarylife, is the creative agent and the form-building factor which makes therevelation of love possible.Today in our Aryan age and race, we see the vital expression of this fifth rayenergy. When I use the word “race” I deal not with man-made or pseudo-scientificdifferentiations of nations and races or types. I deal with a state ofconsciousness which is the Aryan or mental consciousness or state of thinking;this finds its exponents and [594] its “race members” in every nation, withoutany distinction or omissions. This I would have you carefully remember, forthere is no new race in process of appearing, from the territorial angle; thereis only a general distribution of those persons who have what have been calledthe sixth root race characteristics. This state of consciousness will find itsexpression in people as far apart racially as the Japanese and the American orthe Negro and the Russian. It posits an ability to function with clarity uponthe mental plane, to collate information, rightly to interpret and relate thatinformation, and to create the needed thoughtforms or concepts for thoseinterpretations.These thoughtforms fall into three major fields of thought or thoughtform areasof consciousness:> 1. Science. Under this word I include all that which the educational processes> cover or are supposed to cover, and such a useful science as medicine.> 2. Philosophy , with its presentation of great conditioning ideas.> 3. Psychology, with its effort to account for humanity and to discover what> man is essentially and how he functions.You will note that I have not included religion in this analysis. The reason forthis is that IF the world religions were really controlled by concrete knowledgeor science, they would not be the vague, speculative, mystical andglamour-controlled systems which they are at present. Some day the minds ofmen—illumined by the light of the soul—will formulate the One universalreligion, recognisable by all. Then the Kingdom of God will be known for what itis, another kingdom in nature. Speculation, wishful thinking and hopefulaspiration will disappear. The science of occultism is the first step upon theway of true religion, and the scientific investigation of human psychology willgreatly help toward this end.Today we find this ray energy expressing itself mainly through science—a sciencesadly debased and corrupted by materialism and human greed, but a science which(when [595] animated entirely by goodwill) will lift humanity on to higherlevels of consciousness, thus laying the foundation for that time when humanityon a large scale can pass through the Transfiguration Initiation. Steps in thisdirection are already being laid and the existence of the press, the radio andthe rapid means of transportation have done much to further the revelation ofthat unity and that Oneness which is the major characteristic of the UniversalMind.These developments can be regarded as the initial steps of the initiatoryprocess for the third initiation—far ahead as that initiation may lie for themass of men. It is unification and a growing sense of oneness which is requiredin order to take this initiation, and it is the integrated personality whichtakes it. The major sin of Russia, and that which has prostituted and warped theinitial divine impulse underlying the ideology of that country, is thedetermination she demonstrates at this time to be separative and to shut theRussian people away from world contact, using the implements of deception andthe withholding of information. It is not the totalitarian nature of the Russiangovernment which is the prime disaster; it is the refusal to develop theuniversal consciousness. Many governments today are totalitarian in nature,either openly or subtly, but—at the same time—their peoples have free access topress and radio and are not kept in ignorance of world events. Russia isdrifting into a pronounced expression of the great heresy of separateness. Therelies her problem—a problem which is refused recognition by her rulers.The existence of a closed mind on a national scale is dangerous in the extreme,just as the individual is in a dangerous “state of mind” when he closes it toworld contact, world news and world understanding, and when he refuses to admitnew ideas and new modes of behaviour. Fortunately, the influence of this fifthray energy—which is always present, whether the ray is in incarnation or not—issteadily leading humanity towards illumination. [596]This ray energy operates always in connection with the Law of Cleavages. Today,tremendous cleavages between the past and the present are in order. Theimportance of this statement is to be found in the fact that—for the first timein human history—humanity is aware of cleavage at the time it is being broughtabout. Hitherto cleavages have been noted during an historical retrospect.Today, all men everywhere are conscious of the fact that the old order, the oldcultures and civilisations are rapidly passing away, and they are universallyclamouring for the new. Everywhere men are laying the foundation for the neworder, the coming of which is threatened only by one country, Russia, owing toits separativeness (and not because of its ideology), and by one world group inevery country, those guilty of financial greed and consequent aggressiveness.Before humanity can pass through the Transfiguration Initiation the new worldorder must be functioning and the coming civilisation must be at its height. Itis useless for me to consider with you this third initiation in connection withhumanity as a whole, or its preparatory or subsequent initiatory process. Allthis lies too far ahead for even advanced humanity to consider; there are,however, senior disciples who are preparing for this initiation, just as thereare a few who are passing through the initiatory process, prior to taking thefourth initiation.The outstanding expression of this fifth ray energy can be seen in the rapidformulating of the many ideologies which have taken place since the year 1900.Such words as Fascism, Communism, National Socialism, Socialism as the Britishaccept it, and the names of many schools of psychology and philosophy, wereunknown one hundred years ago; today they are the common talk and phrases of theman in the street. The inflow of this mental energy into the world of men, theattainment in consciousness of mental ability by many thousands, and theachievement of mental polarisation by aspirants all the world over, are all dueto the activity of this fifth ray energy; this may be [597] regarded aspreparatory work for the first and the second initiations. Some of this successis due also to a little-realised function of this fifth ray energy—that oftelepathic interplay. Few people realise in the slightest degree how naturallytelepathic every human being is or how impressionable are their minds; thisagain is an effect of fifth ray influence.The creation (and, I should add, the over-creation) of the millions of materialthings which men everywhere regard as essential to their well-being is also theresult of the creative activity of the fifth ray consciousness. This is, ofcourse, as it demonstrates upon the physical plane. When it demonstrates uponthe mental plane, we then talk of ideas, concepts, philosophies and ideologies.When it demonstrates upon the astral plane, we are aware of the religiousimpulse, of mysticism and of the emotional and conditioning desires. All theseaspects are present in the consciousness of men everywhere today. Everything iscrystallising in human consciousness, and this takes place in order to make manaware of where he stands upon the ladder of evolution, and of what is wrong andwhat is right. All this again is due to the influence of fifth ray energy. Thiswill begin to transform human living and human desires and also human affairsand attitudes, and will lead eventually (in the middle of the sixth root race)to the great Transfiguration Initiation in which the reality that lies behindall human phenomena will stand revealed.Let us now consider the effect of this ray energy upon the life of theindividual, as he faces the third initiation. This third initiation is, asearlier said, the first initiation, from the angle of the Hierarchy; it is theone in which the spiritual man demonstrates his complete control of thepersonality. The physical body has been controlled through the medium of thephysical disciplines; the emotional nature has been reorganised and madereceptive to spiritual impression coming from the plane of pure reason (thebuddhic plane) through the transforming processes of the mind or the fifthprinciple. In this connection, the mind has acted as an organiser of astralreaction and as a dispeller [598] of glamour. The disciple is now focussed inhis everyday consciousness upon the mental plane, and the triangular relation ofthe three aspects of the mind upon this plane is now dominant. In the nextinitiation, the Renunciation, this relationship becomes a dual one instead of atriangular one, through the destruction of the soul vehicle which is no longerneeded. Soul fusion with the personality is now completed.During the initiatory process preceding the third initiation, the mind works ina new manner. Its transmuting work with the physical body has been accomplished;its transforming work with the emotional nature has been successful, and now itstransfiguring work with the personality as a whole is carried forward, makingthe initiation of the Transfiguration possible. It is of value to the student toconsider these three activities of the mind. The transmuting agent in the firstcase is the lower or concrete mind; the transforming agent is the soul, whilstthe transfiguring agent is the Spiritual Triad, working through the higher orabstract mind. You will here note the wonderful synthesis of the spiritual work.When this work is concluded, you have the initiation of the third degree madepossible. This produces impelling and new contacts. It should here be rememberedthat when I use the word “new” I mean that which is new in consciousness , forthe basic synthesis and fundamental relationship always exists in factualrecognition, but is only progressively realised by the evolving spiritual man.It is well nigh impossible to differentiate the results of fifth ray energy inthe various aspects of the personality, for the reason that the initiate is nowfunctioning as a soul-infused personality, and therefore the three aspects ofthat personality are nothing more or less than agents of the soul, and thus areprogressively responsive to the inflow of triadal energy. It might therefore besaid that, as a result of the Transfiguration Initiation—the culminating pointof strictly human unfoldment—the three types of energy which are expressedthrough the Spiritual Triad [599] man begin—only begin—to flow through thereflection of itself in the three worlds. Let me state this as follows:1. The directing energy of the higher mind is—as a result of the TransfigurationInitiation and via the antahkarana—thrown into the brain; therefore the man uponthe physical plane is guided, directed and controlled by group purpose and bythe hierarchical plan.2. The illuminating energy of pure reason, emanating from the buddhic plane,pours down into the clarified and organised body of sensitive response which isall that remains of what has been called the astral body. This produces completefreedom from glamour and the creation of “a limpid pool of such reasonableresponse to the love of divine relationship” that the initiate becomes asensitive revealer of that love.3. The dynamic energy from the atmic plane (the highest aspect of the SpiritualTriad) pours into the mind and begins slowly to reveal the will-to-good, whichis essentially the will of God.Behind these three differentiations which are all of them expressions or aspectsof the divine or the universal mind, the initiate dimly senses or becomesconsciously aware of what has been called the Monad or Spirit or Life. This issubtly revealed in the Transfiguration Initiation of the Master Jesus Whore-enacted all the five human initiations for the benefit of humanity. In thisdramatic picturing of the third initiation, the three disciples (or the threevehicles of the personality) prostrate themselves upon the ground and the MasterHimself (the glorified personality) is transfigured before them. At thisclimaxing point they hear that which is called “the voice of the Father”speaking to the transfigured Jesus.The personality is now possessed of knowledge, for fifth ray energy has done itsneeded work; the disciple is also aware that he is in possession of the wisdomwhich enables him to use knowledge in the furtherance of the Plan, and thereforeto work as an illuminating factor in the world of men. He knows clearly what hasbeen accomplished [600] and senses something of what lies ahead. The greatprinciple of cleavage (which the fifth ray governs) is the dominating factor inhis time sense; he now differentiates sharply between past and present and thatwhich has to be ascertained in the future. Cleavage, in the sense ofseparateness, is finished for him and he now feels and knows something of theessential unity of all manifested life; therefore, from the angle of space, hehas dominated and overcome cleavage and division; in the sense of time he hasnot. The great heresy of separateness no longer exists in his consciousness; theconsciousness of the initiatory process is not yet over, however for thatinvolves the recognition of time.During the initiatory process between the second and the third initiations, theinitiate has to battle with illusion in exactly the same sense as he earlier hadto battle with glamour. Illusion is, in the last analysis, the control of themental processes by great and massive thoughtforms; this conflict persists fromthe moment that the disciple has achieved mental polarisation (at a midway pointbetween the second and the third initiations) until he stands before theInitiator at the sixth Initiation of Decision, when the last illusiondisappears. You will feel and comment that the Masters are therefore subject toillusion. This They definitely are, and there are great and basic illusionsgoverning life within the Hierarchy. Nevertheless, they are illusions of such ahigh order that—for advanced humanity—they would signify achievement. I may notgive you more than one instance of such illusion, but that should prove clearand sufficient. It is not until the sixth Initiation of Decision that theillusion of the planetary ring-pass-not finally disappears. The Master thenknows that such a limitation is non-existent. For Him, the choice between theseven Paths becomes possible. This basic illusion constitutes for mankind agreat hierarchical mystery and is based upon the Principle of Privation, bymeans of which the planetary Logos chooses to circumscribe His freedom and tolimit His activities. [601]This curious freedom from successive limitations is experienced at the third,the sixth and the ninth initiations; these are, all three of them, related in amysterious manner to each other. Transfiguration leads eventually to Decision,which culminates in due time with a final refusal to accept any planetarylimitations whatsoever.It will be obvious to you that the higher the initiation, the less will anyinvolved energy have a personality control or connection. Progressive andrecognised fusions have taken place as one initiation after another isundergone; the effect of the energy involved will be noted in relation tohumanity as a whole, to the work of the Ashram within the Hierarchy and to theplanetary life. This must ever be borne in mind and must necessarily limit thescope of the teaching which I am able to give you.Let me now summarise the effects of this fifth ray energy in relation tohumanity and to the individual initiate:1. I gave, first of all, fifteen items of information anent this fifth rayenergy, or fifteen definitions of its activity. These will warrant carefulstudy.2. The effect of this fifth ray energy upon humanity in this fifth root race wasconsidered; it was noted that this Aryan effect was dominant and dynamic in theextreme and that it has greatly hastened human evolution.3. I pointed out the close relation between love and mind, as follows:> a. Ray II and Ray V> b. Plane II and plane V> c. Solar system II and root race VIn all of these relationships, the fifth in order is the prime agent and therevealer of the second type of spiritual energy4. The fifth ray energy produces three major areas of thought, or three primeconditions wherein the thought-form-making energy expresses itself:> a. Science ... education ... medicine> b. Philosophy ... ideas ... ideals> c. Psychology ... in process of modern development[602] 5. This fifth ray energy operates in connection with the Law of Cleavages.6. It is also responsible for the rapid formation of great conditioningideologies.7. This fifth ray energy is the important factor in making possible the firstmajor initiation, the Transfiguration Initiation.8. Fifth ray energy works in three ways in connection with the three aspects ofthe personality:> a. As the transmuting agent ... the physical body> b. As the transforming agent ... the astral body> c. As the transfiguring agent ... the mental bodyThis gives you much food for thought; it indicates the personality goal and themode whereby it is attained. After the third initiation, we reach out inconsciousness to higher expansions of consciousness and will then enter a realmof ideas which are not yet easy for the disciple to appreciate or to understand.Much that I will have to say anent ray energy and the higher initiations willmean little to many, but it will mean much to the initiate-consciousness. Theworld initiates will be coming into incarnation at this time, and will read mywords towards the end of this century with great understanding.—Initiation IV. The Renunciation. Ray IV.> The Energy of Harmony through Conflict.Our study today is of profound interest and has a great bearing on the presentworld situation. I would like to make clear two important facts:1. The fact that the world war (1914-1945) was quite unavoidable, though theconflict might have been retained upon mental levels, had humanity decidedrightly.2. The fact of the inevitability of the return of the Christ in this era and inthe relatively immediate future. We are here dealing with immutable law, for theenergies of the various rays move under law; humanity can therefore do naughtbut accept, determining only what I might [603] call the locale, or the sphereof activity, of both these major events. The determination of mankind to fightout the issues involved in the world war upon the physical plane, at the sametime automatically determined the sphere of Christ's activity—as I shall attemptto show you. In many ways, this particular instruction is one of the mostimportant I have yet given because of its essential and obvious implications. Wewill therefore study the fourth initiation and its relation to the fourth Ray ofHarmony through Conflict.This fourth ray, as you have several times been told, is out of incarnation, asfar as the reincarnating egos or souls of men are concerned. From another angle,however, it is always active and ever present, because it is the ray whichgoverns the fourth kingdom in nature, the human kingdom in the three worlds ofstrictly human evolution.It is the dominant energy, always exerting pressure upon the fourth kingdom;this pressure began to exert itself primarily towards the end of the fourthhuman race, the Atlantean race of men; at that time men began to give evidenceof a growing sense of responsibility, and therefore of the power to demonstratediscriminative choice. This led to the great war in the fourth race whichculminated in the Flood, to which all parts of the world testify and to whichthe majority of the world Scriptures bear evidence. In that era, in which thethen known world of men was extensively involved, the Black and the White Lodgesof adepts were also implicated, and the first major fight between thedemonstrators of evil and the Forces of Light took place; it was inconclusive,with the evidence for defeat to be found on the side of the good more than onthe side of evil. Under the symbolism of the Flood, it is apparent to studentsthat the fight was focussed primarily upon the astral plane, though fought outhistorically upon the physical plane; it resulted in the destruction of theworld by water, as it might be symbolically expressed.In the climaxing war of the immediate past, the mental plane was the focus ofthe amalgamated forces, for [604] the war was in reality a clash of ideologiesand has been far more the result of man's thinking than of man's emotionaldesires. It therefore automatically involved the three levels of human activityand was fought out upon the physical plane, although it was impulsed from themental plane. The symbol of fire was this time involved, instead of water, andthis fire led to the destruction of men and of cities by fire (literally, “firefrom heaven”), by the evocation of the fiery emotions so prevalent in thecouncils of men at this time, and by the drought of the year 1947 which burnt upthe terrain in Europe and in Great Britain, being—curiously enough—preceded bythe floods and waters of the earlier spring, thus evidencing the repetition ofcycles; this repetition is distinctive of natural process, leaving each stage ofman's evolution depicted, but producing a climaxing point which is indicative ofthe past and of the present, but leaving (as is the case today) the futurelocked in the determinative processes of man's thinking and planning. As manthinks and decides “in his heart,” so will the future of humanity prove to be,for it is the same process for mankind as a whole as it is for the individual.I would like to cover this theme by dividing my subject into the followingparts:> 1. The particular type of energy involved and its initiatory effect. This> concerns the Principle of Conflict as contained in the activity of this fourth> ray.> 2. The effect upon humanity as a whole. The “Renunciation Initiation” is an> expression of the result of the activity of this Principle.> 3. The factor of the second Ray of Love-Wisdom as it basically controls Ray IV> and implements the return of the Christ, because the potency of the heart> centre is involved.> 4. The effect of this Ray IV in the modern world of nations and of fundamental> organisations.> 5. The result of this fourth ray activity upon the individual disciple: [605]> a. In the three aspects of his nature, physical, emotional and mental.> b. Upon the soul-infused personality.> 6. Summation of the whole theme and a forecast of future possibilities.I shall attempt to deal with this as concisely as possible, and will keep thehandling of this subject exceedingly brief, or as brief as its historicalimportance will permit and its definitive angle will allow. The whole of humanhistory has been conditioned by the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict, andit is this ray which has determined the ring-pass-not within which humanity mustwork.At this time, the effect of this ray is predominantly of a group nature, andthere are—except in the ranks of disciples of the Great White Lodge—no fourthray souls in incarnation. Once humanity has decided upon the goal and the methodof reconstruction and of reorganisation which is to take place within theperiphery of the fourth ray ring-pass-not, then (if humanity's decision iscorrect and is not postponed) many fourth ray souls will resume incarnation, andso implement human decision. This will mark a great turning point in humanhistory and will enable seventh ray energy to be turned to the best advantage.The Particular Type of Energy involved and its Initiatory EffectHere we are confronted with a basic problem, i.e., the nature of the Principleof Conflict which is the outstanding characteristic of this fourth Ray ofHarmony through Conflict. This is by no means an easy subject to handle or tomake clear, for the correctness of conflict, its naturally separative andeliminative effect and its power to condition not only Humanity but also theHierarchy, will have to be considered. When we study the fourth initiation, thatof the Renunciation, the effects of its activity will emerge more clearly.Fundamentally, this fourth ray is that which is responsible [606] for thestrains and the stresses, and for the initial conflict between the major pair ofopposites to which we give the name of spirit-matter. It is this fourth rayenergy which makes apparent the distinction (so often misunderstood by man)between good and evil. In Atlantean days, the leaders of men, under theinfluence of this paramount fourth ray energy, made a decision which laid theemphasis upon the matter aspect, according to their desire and their emotionalreaction, which is present in the essential duality of manifestation, and thusinaugurated the Age of Materialism. This age has wrought itself out through itsaccompanying greeds, hate, separativeness and aggression. During the presentcentury, this materialism led to the world war which was in reality theexpression of a shifting orientation, and therefore to a certain extent, of acoming triumph of Good.The balance is slowly, very slowly, swinging over to the side of the spiritaspect of the duality; it has not yet swung, even in intention, completely over,but the issues are becoming increasingly clearer in men's minds and theindications are that man will eventually decide correctly, will attain a pointof balance or equilibrium, and will finally throw the weight of public opinionon the side of spiritual values, thus leading to a collective renunciation ofmaterialism, particularly in its grosser and physical forms. The time is notyet, but a great awakening is in process; men, however, will only see correctlywhen this Principle of Conflict is properly evaluated as a spiritual necessityand is used by humanity as an instrument to bring about emergence from the wrongcontrols and principles. Just as the individual disciple uses it to emerge outof the control of matter in the three worlds, beginning with the emergence fromthe control of the physical body, passing out of the control of the emotionalnature, and formulating for himself a spiritual ideology which enables him topass out of the control of the three worlds of forms, and so begin to functionas a soul-infused personality, so mankind also has to do the same in massformation. [607]This whole process culminates when the fourth initiation, the GreatRenunciation, is taken by man today, and by humanity in some distant future;this “point of emergence” is reached by right decision and as a result of aright use of the Principle of Conflict.It will be obvious to you that this Principle of Conflict is closely related todeath. By death, I mean extraction from form conditions—physical, emotional ormental; I mean cessation of contact (temporarily or permanently) with physicalform, with astral glamour and with mental illusion; I mean the rejection ofMaya, the name of that all-inclusive effect which overwhelms a man who isimmersed in materialism of any kind, and is therefore overcome (from the soulangle) by life in the three worlds. It is the Principle of Conflict, latent inevery atom of substance, which produces, first of all, conflict, thenrenunciation, and finally emancipation; which produces war in some form oranother, then rejection, and finally liberation. This principle is, as you canwell see, closely linked to the law of Karma; it is to this principle that Mrs.Besant refers when she speaks in one of her books of the fact that the substancewhereof all forms are made is already—from the very dawn of the creativeprocess—tinged with karma. There is deep occult significance to the thought,often voiced, that death is the great Liberator; it means that the Principle ofConflict has succeeded in bringing about conditions wherein the spirit aspect isreleased (temporarily or permanently) from imprisonment in some kind of formlife, either individual or group.You will all, as disciples or aspirants, be able to interpret the working ofthis principle as you watch the effect, in your own lives, of the action of thestrains and stresses, the points of crisis or of tension which the conflictbetween soul and personality produces. Conflict is always present prior torenunciation, and it is only at this fourth great spiritual crisis thatconflict, as we understand it, ends. In the realms of formless living whereinthe Hierarchy lives and moves and has its being, conflict, which has developed[608] in man the sense of discriminative choice, is superseded by crises ofdecision—not decision based upon discriminative perception between right andwrong or between spirituality and materialism, but crises of decision based uponperception of the Plan, participation in the Purpose, and the prevention ofevil. I would have you ponder on these three phrases which distinguish thecrises of decision which confront the Master after the fourth initiation, andwhich take the place of the crises of discrimination which precede that stage:> Perception of the Plan.> Participation in the Purpose.> Prevention of evil.These decisions are based, first of all, on goodwill to all forms in the threeworlds, and secondly, upon the will-to-good which impulses and implements thethree creative and manifesting aspects of divinity.These are deep things whereof we speak; it is wise to remember that all crisesin the material world—individual crises and those related to humanity as awhole—are governed by the Principle of Conflict, whilst crises in the spiritualworld are controlled by the esoteric Principle of Decision.The Principle of Conflict is the prime factor lying behind the evolution of formas the field of experience for the soul in the four kingdoms in nature: thehuman and the three subhuman. It is based on the intellectual factor ofdiscrimination which is inherent in the smallest atom of substance, and whichreaches its fullest expression in advanced humanity; the indications that it hasachieved its purpose, as far as humanity is concerned, are to be found in thepassing through the Initiation of Renunciation. The Principle of Decision whichcontrols the Master governs His work within the Hierarchy, in relation toShamballa and in connection with all the service rendered in the three worlds;it is based on the energy of the second Ray of Love-Wisdom, just as thePrinciple of Conflict is based on the energy of the third Ray of ActiveIntelligence. [609] This Principle of Decision, as a controlling factor, is putto the test at the sixth initiation, the Initiation of Decision; at that time,the will aspect of divinity summarises in a unique manner all past achievementsof the two principles and brings in a final cycle of unfoldment to which I cangive no truly appropriate name, but which climaxes in the ninth Initiation ofRefusal . You have, therefore, in relation to these principles (which are allrelated to the Law of Karma) three great initiations at which the effectivenessof the liberation brought about by their inherent action is finally tested:> 1. The Initiation of Renunciation . . . 4th Initiation> The Principle of Conflict> Governed by Ray IV> Active in the Human Kingdom, the 4th> Leading to right Discrimination> 2. The Initiation of Decision... 6th Initiation> The Principle of Decision> Governed by Ray III> Active in the Hierarchy> Leading to right Perception> and Participation> 3. The Initiation of Refusal... 9th Initiation> The Principle of liberated Being (shall we call it thus?)> Governed by all three major Rays> Active in Shamballa> Leading to one or other of the 7 PathsIn the above tabulation you have a wide and general picture of three majorPrinciples, leading to three great spiritual events, each of which is anexpression of the personality, the soul and the Monad. Where humanity as a wholeis involved, the effect is upon the reincarnating soul of the human kingdom,then on the liberated souls of the members of the Hierarchy, and finally on theBeing which is distinctive of the Council at Shamballa.A planned synthesis thus appears, producing immutability, [610] inevitabilityand correct prevision; it is also the result of the liberation of free will, andin no way infringes the right of the individual man or disciple to make freechoice, once the Principle of Conflict has made him aware of the basic dualismof the manifested worlds. This presents him with a battleground and a field ofexperience wherein he makes great experimental choices and comes eventually tocorrect orientation and to the door of initiation, progressively revealed to himas the result of right choice, right perception and right decision. Thus thenine initiations are covered.The Principle of Conflict has a close connection with the Path of Discipleship,and here lies the reason for the inclusive and synthetic aspect of the presentworld conflict; though the physical aspects of the conflict are today greatlylessened (but are still present on a small scale in various parts of the world),the conflict is by no means over or yet resolved. It is still being violentlywaged by advanced human beings upon the mental plane and by the masses upon theplane of emotional reactions; it will be some time before the war truly isbrought to a finish.There could, however, be no disaster more serious than a too abrupt ending ofthis clash of the emotional reactions of humanity and of the current ideologies.It is essential that the issues become still clearer in the minds of men, priorto any final choice or decision. This must be remembered, and students would dowell to avoid discouragement and train themselves to wait with spiritualoptimism for the way of humanity to clear. Too prompt a choice at this timemight prove only a makeshift decision and one based on expediency andimpatience. The Hierarchy is in no way discouraged, though somewhat concernedthat the factor of timing may not prove correct.This Principle of Conflict is a familiar one to every struggling aspirant andconditions his whole life, producing crises and tensions, sometimes almost pastendurance; they indicate nevertheless rapid development and steady progress. Theactivity of this principle is greatly increased [611] at this time through themedium of the following spiritual events (the full discussion appears on pages741-760):> 1. The crisis of the ideologies.> 2. The awakening of humanity to better understanding.> 3. The growth of goodwill which leads to the presentation of certain> fundamental cleavages which must be bridged by human effort.> 4. The partial “sealing of the door where evil dwells.”> 5. The use of the Great Invocation with its extraordinary and rapid effects,> at present unrealised by you.> 6. The gradual approach of the Hierarchy to a closer and more intimate> relation to Humanity.> 7. The imminent return of the Christ.There are other factors, but these will be adequate to demonstrate to you theincreased expression of conflict on all the three levels of strictly humanevolution. It is a conflict which has engulfed the masses in every land, whichis still producing physical conflict, emotional strain and tremendous mentalissues, and which will greatly lessen when the masses of people everywhere areconvinced that right human relations are of far greater importance than greed,human pride, territorial grabbing, and material possessions.The Effect of the Energy of Harmony through Conflict upon HumanityIt will be obvious that this ray energy, embodying the Principle of Conflict,has a unique and curious effect upon relationships . This is due to theinterrelation of this Ray of Harmony through Conflict and the second Ray ofLove-Wisdom; this second ray is primarily the ray of right human relations—asfar as the fourth kingdom in nature is concerned. The energy of love governs allrelations between souls and controls the Hierarchy, the Kingdom of Souls; theenergy of wisdom should govern all relations within the fourth kingdom, thehuman; some day it will inevitably do so, hence the emphasis laid upon the needfor soul-infused personalities in the world today, as promulgated by all trueesoteric schools. [612]It might be said that the effect of the Principle of Conflict, operating underRay IV and controlled by Ray II, will be—as far as humanity is concerned—tobring about right human relations and the growth of the universal spirit ofgoodwill among men. Only the most benighted and uncouth of thinkers would failto see that these two results of the conflict, engendered at this time, are thetwo most desirable factors for which all men of goodwill should work. The inflowof energy into humanity at this time is all in favour of such efforts, and thePrinciple of Conflict has worked so effectively that all men are desiringharmony, peace, equilibrium, right adjustment to life and circumstances, andright and balanced human relations.In every country and among all types of men—sincerely or insincerely—the talk ofthe newspapers, on the radio and upon the lecture platforms is on behalf ofharmony and a widespread recognition of the needed adjustments. Even the evilforces which still remain active hide their greedy purposes behind a spuriousdesire for world unity, world harmony and right human relations. The masses ofthe people in all lands have been convinced by the evidence made available bythe Principle of Conflict that basic changes in man's attitude and goals must bebrought about if humanity is to survive; they are, in their own ways (wisely orunwisely), seeking a solution.The war has produced much good—in spite of the destruction of forms. The causesof war are better understood; the issues involved are slowly being clarified;information about all nations—even when incorrectly presented—has awakenedmankind to the fact of the One World; the community of pain, sorrow, anxiety,starvation and despair have brought all men closer together, and this relationis a far greater breeder of harmony than man realises; the world of men today ismore closely knit subjectively (in spite of all outer cleavages and conflicts)than ever before in human history; there is a firmer determination to establishright human relations and a clearer perception of the factors involved; the newPrinciple of Sharing , [613] inherent in the second Ray of Love-Wisdom which isconcerned so fundamentally with relationships, is gaining ground, and itspotency is being released by the activity of the fourth Ray of Harmony throughConflict. This Principle of Sharing, though still divorced from any officialsanctions, is under consideration and will some day be the governing factor inthe economic life of the world, regulated and controlled by those men who arealert to human need upon the physical plane.This Principle of Conflict is also active in all institutions, groups andorganisations in all lands and in every department of human thought. Its resultsare, first, the awakening of humanity to certain major human developments andpossibilities, and secondly, it will lead to certain basic renunciations, oncethe issues are clearly seen and the cleavage which exists in reality between thedesirable spiritual values and the undesirable material values has been madeclear. In politics, for instance, the two-party system is based upon a correctpremise, but it is not at present a satisfactory system because of humanstupidity. It stands in truth for the reactionary groups in any land and alsofor the progressive party who are alert to the new possibilities; one party aimsat the holding back of the life of the spirit, at clarifying by obstruction andat holding back or preventing the too rapid rushing forward of the impatient andthe immature; the progressive party should be composed of those who are aware ofthe unneeded and old issues, and who pioneer all the time, even thoughfrequently without much still in action. Such a clear line of demarcationbetween the two basic world parties is not yet possible, nor are the spiritualvalues of either group appreciated by the unthinking masses. Today, partypolitics are as selfish, and therefore as reactionary, as are the mass of men;the real good of humanity is not the goal of the average politician in eithergroup, for usually only his own selfish ambition and the desire to preserve acertain political ideology which has put him into power are the goal of hisefforts. [614]The Principle of Conflict is working also in the churches, but more slowly,unfortunately, owing to the corruption and soporific effect of theologicalchurchianity; I would have you note my choice of words; I said not “ofChristianity,” for true Christianity, as Christ taught it, is free fromtheological abuses and must and will be restored or—perhaps moreaccurately—reach its first stage of expression.Everywhere the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict is active in the humanfamily and is dominating human affairs; everywhere in the life of theindividual, in the lives of groups, organisations and churches, in the life ofnations and in the life of mankind as a whole, the issues are being clarified,and humanity is being led from one renunciation to another, until some day thehuman kingdom will unitedly take the fourth initiation and the GreatRenunciation will be accepted; this step, lying far ahead as yet in the future,will affiliate humanity with the Hierarchy and release millions of men from thethralldom of materialism. This moment in human history will inevitably come. Thefirst indication that the distant vision has been glimpsed might perhaps benoted in the prevalent instinct to share , motivated at present by the instinctto self-preservation, but definitely developing as a possible mode of actionupon the far horizon of man's thinking. True sharing definitely involves manylittle renunciations, and it is upon these small renunciations that the capacityfor freedom is slowly being generated and the habit of renunciation caneventually be stabilised; this capacity and these habits, these unselfishactivities and these spiritual habitual attitudes are the preparatory stages forthe Initiation of Renunciation, just as the effort to serve one's fellowmen ispreparatory to the taking of the third Initiation, of the Transfiguration.The Factor of the Ray of Love-Wisdom as it controls the Ray of Harmony throughConflict and implements the Return of the ChristIn the first paragraph of this instruction, I ascribed the inevitability ofChrist's imminent return to the decision [615] of humanity to precipitate theexistent conflict on to the physical plane, thus determining the sphere ofChrist's activity. In earlier teachings also I have pointed out that He mightcome in one of three ways or in all three of them simultaneously. The issueswhich have emerged as the result of the conflict upon the physical plane, and ofits shifting (by man's decision) today on to the mental plane, have madecompletely evident the fact that the locale of Christ's influence will be,therefore, the entire three worlds Of human evolution, which naturally includesthe physical levels of experience and demands His physical Presence.Let me make the facts somewhat clearer and enlarge somewhat upon these threemodes of His appearing, of His coming, His advent and of His physicalrecognition by humanity:1. By His overshadowing of all initiates and disciples who are today, or will beat the time of His arrival, active in the three worlds of human evolution. Thisinvolves His influencing their minds telepathically. This overshadowing orinfluencing will be His primary work upon the mental plane. This will constituteone of His most effective methods in His proposed spiritual interference inworld affairs. Through the medium of these members or affiliates of theHierarchy, He will have outposts of His consciousness in every nation. Throughthem He can work.2. By the pouring out of the Christ life or consciousness upon the masseseverywhere and in every nation. This spiritual inflow will bring about thereorienting of human desire and will evoke the emotional reaction to HisPresence. This therefore brings the astral plane within the active sphere of Hisinfluence; this involves the release of the energy of goodwill into the heartsof men, predisposing them towards right human relations. It is this establishingof right relations which is the major objective of His coming triple activity.The masses everywhere will be responsive to the work and the message of theChrist, as it is [616] implemented from the mental plane by the disciples andinitiates, overshadowed by the mind of Christ.3. By His physical appearance among men . Through His Own immediate appearance,He can establish a potent focal point of hierarchical energy upon Earth in amanner not hitherto possible. He has never deserted humanity and has always keptHis promise to stay with us all the days, even unto the end of the age. Men inall lands will know where He can be found. The locale of this focal point of Histhreefold spiritual activity cannot here be disclosed, for it is contingent uponthe results of the sequential processes of overshadowing and outpouring.The first of the methods which will lead to the eventual physical reappearanceof the Christ has already been set in motion; disciples and initiates in alllands are starting the work preparatory to the outpouring of the Christspiritual force, leading to the awakening of the Christ consciousness (as it isusually called) in the hearts of men. This outpouring will come as the result ofthree activities:1. The work and the teaching of the trained disciples and initiates, as each ofthem, in his own way, points out the surety of Christ's coming and thusimplements the innate expectancy of the masses.2. The evocation of a united hierarchical response through the use of the GreatInvocation. You will note how this invocation can be interpreted in terms of thethree modes of the return of the Christ:> a. “Let Light stream forth into the minds of men.”> The influencing of the minds of disciples.> The enlightening of intelligent humanity.> The mental plane.> Stanza I.> b. “Let Love stream forth into the hearts of men.”> The influencing of the masses everywhere.> The outpouring of the Christ spirit.> The astral plane.> Stanza II. [617]> c. “The Purpose which the Masters know and serve.”> The anchoring of hierarchical energy on Earth.> The physical appearance of the Christ.> The physical plane.> Stanza III.What this divine purpose may be the Christ Himself will reveal upon His arrival;the focal point of His activity will be dependent upon the medium used by Him toimplement that purpose—known only to Him and to the senior members of theHierarchy. Should politics be the medium through which He best can serve, thatthen will determine the locality of the focal point; if it should be thereligious organisations of the world, it may prove to be elsewhere; if the fieldof economics or of the social sciences, then still another locality may proveappropriate. The determining factor in all cases, and that which will indicateto Him the appropriate place for this focal point, will be the number and theability and status of the disciples found active in the chosen field. More, Imay not suggest.3. The demand or prayer or outgoing desire of the masses for the appearance of aLiberator and for the establishing of right human relations, plus the work ofall the spiritually-minded people in all nations and of all faiths. All thesethree factors are today present but have not yet the needed potency to proveimmediately effective. This triple nucleus of determining factors is, however,already firmly established; in this fact is to be found a sure ground for a saneoptimism.It should be pointed out that the Principle of Conflict is motivated strongly bythese same factors. The over-shadowing of all disciples and initiates, and theconsequent stimulation of their natures and of their environment, mustinevitably produce conflict; the outpouring of the stimulating love of God intothe hearts of men must equally and inevitably produce conflict; the line ofcleavage between men of goodwill and the unresponsive natures of thoseuninfluenced by this quality will be made abundantly, usefully andconstructively clear. It will be obvious also [618] that when Christ establishesthe “centre or focal point of the divine Purpose” in some definite place onEarth, its radiation and implementary potency will also produce the neededconflict which precedes the clarification and the renunciation of obstructions.But there will come a point in all these three spheres of Christ's proposedactivity when conflict will be superseded by harmony; this is due to the factthat the energy of harmony through conflict is under the control or influence ofthe energy of the second Ray of Love-Wisdom. As far as humanity as a sum totalis concerned, the conflict of ideas and of emotional desire is today so acutethat it will finally exhaust itself, and men will turn, with relief and with alonging to escape from further turmoil, towards right human relations; this willconstitute the first major human decision leading to the longed-for harmony. Theattitude of the masses will then be soundly tending towards harmony, owing tothe work of the men and women of goodwill as they implement the “streaming forthof the love of God into the hearts of men.”We have now reached a point where the inevitability of Christ's return isestablished, scientifically and under law; this constitutes a call which He maynot deny and one which He must obey. This fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflictworks (where the initiatory process is concerned) through the heart, or throughwhat esotericists call “the heart centre”—the focal point through which theenergy of love can flow. When the Christ founds His focal point on Earth, itwill be in the nature of a tiny heart centre through which the love energy ofthe Hierarchy can persistently flow. The harmony (which the Principle ofConflict produces) causes an alignment, so that the love—streaming forth fromthe Heart of God—enters the hearts of men; so that the Hierarchy (which is theheart centre or the place where love prevails upon our planet) is brought intorelationship with humanity; so that the New Group of World Servers (implementingthe love of God and enlightened by the Mind of God) are brought also intorelation with the [619] men and women of goodwill in all lands whose task it isto make men's hearts responsive to and receptive of the love of God; this isanother way of saying receptive to the consciousness of the Christ.This alignment is now in process of being made; it will be brought aboutautomatically when the effectiveness of the Principle of Conflict in producingliberation is generally recognised. Thus the hearts of men, the heart of theplanet, i.e., the Hierarchy, and the heart of the Hierarchy, the Christ, are ina state of positive contact; when this channel is open and unobstructed, thenthe Christ will come. Nothing can stop His appearance and—under law—He may notturn His back upon the presented opportunity.Thus, eventually, the Lord of Love—in response to the invocative cry ofhumanity, aroused by the Principle of Conflict—must “proceed again to the highplace of sacrifice and walk openly with men on Earth.” His heart, embodying asit does the love of God, is drawn forth from the heart of the planet (theHierarchy) to the hearts of men, and the path of His return to Earth servicestands unchallenged and unobstructed. Again, under law, a profound optimism isengendered and may be rightly developed.The heart centre of humanity is created by the sum total of the hearts(symbolically speaking) of all those men of goodwill (in or out of the churchesand irrespective of their political concepts) who are serving their fellowmen,sponsoring human welfare movements, working for the establishing of right humanrelations, and constantly offsetting the separativeness of the human mindthrough the inclusiveness of the divine love nature. You have, therefore, as aguarantee of the return of Christ into public recognition, an implementing of agreat alignment. This alignment, when effectively concluded, will bring about aclear channel or pathway of return or line of light or magnetic power between:> 1. The centre where the will of God is known. This is Shamballa where the> will-to-good originates. This will-to-good is essential love. [620]> 2. The Hierarchy, which is the planetary heart centre.> 3. The Christ, the very heart of love within the Hierarchy.> 4. The initiates, disciples and aspirants who form the New Group of World> Servers, seeking to embody the love and light needed in the world today.5. The hearts of the men of goodwill in all lands who are responsive to love asit can express itself through right human relations.6. The focal point through which the Lord of Love will work on Earth.If you will study this sixfold progression of divine love from the highestmanifestation of Deity down to its appearance through the medium of some focalpoint in our known modern world, it will be apparent to you that a very definite“structure of approach” has been created, and that a “Path of Return” is beingconstructed which will bring the long-awaited Christ into our midst. Nothing canstop or prevent His return today; the evidence of this structure can be seeneverywhere.The Effect of the Ray of Harmony through Conflict in the modern world of NationsAs we approach what some may regard as a highly controversial subject, I wouldremind you that we must attempt to see the picture whole in some such manner asthe Agents of the divine Will see it, embracing the past of the nations involved(a past which is seldom good), seeing the effects of that past as they work outin the present and as they are the inevitable result of the Law of Cause andEffect, and attempting also to foresee the future in terms of lessons learnt andnew habits of a better nature established (written in 1948). I would remind youalso that the governing principle of this ray is conditioning all the nationsand has done so with increasing potency since the year 1850. Just in the samemanner as this principle of conflict controls the battling life of the aspirantand of the world aspirant, the entire human family, so it must [621] inevitablycontrol the life of nations to a greater or lesser degree, according to theirmaterialistic or their spiritual status, according to the type of energy whichmay be expressing itself through them, and according to the age of the nationunder consideration. From certain angles, the youngest of the nations areGermany and Italy, for they only arrived at nationhood in the nineteenthcentury; the oldest nation with the clearest unified record is Japan. The UnitedStates of America is always regarded as a young nation, but from the angle of aunified central government, the two Axis Powers are still younger, and this hashad a definite bearing on their activities.In the world at this time the two aspects of this fourth ray—the aspect orPrinciple of Conflict and the aspect or Principle of Harmony—are struggling tobring about the liberation into equilibrium of mankind. Until quite lately, thePrinciple of Conflict has grown increasingly in power, yet as a result of thisconflict a definite trend towards harmony can be seen emerging in humanthinking; the concept of harmony through the establishing of right humanrelations is slowly coming into recognition. The activities of mankind, andparticularly of governments, have been ignobly selfish and controlled by theconcepts of fighting, aggression and competition for untold millenia; theterritories of the planet have changed hands many times and the earth has beenthe playground of a long succession of conquerors; the heroes of therace—perpetuated in history, stone and human thinking—have been the warriors,and conquest has been an ideal. The world war (1914-1945) marked a culminatingpoint in the work of the Principle of Conflict and, as I have shown, the resultsof this work are today inaugurating a new era of harmony and cooperation becausethe trend of human thinking is towards the cessation of conflict. This is anevent of major importance and should be regarded as indicating a turning pointin human affairs. This trend is impulsed by a weariness of fighting, by achanging rating as to the values in human accomplishment, and by a recognitionthat true greatness [622] is not expressed through such activities as those ofAlexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Napoleon or Hitler, but by those who seelife, humanity and the world as one united whole, interrelated, cooperative andharmonised. Those who struggle for this world unity, and who educate the race inthe Principles of Harmony and of right human relations, will some day berecognised as the true heroes.The factor that must and will relate the Principle of Conflict to the expressionof harmony and bring about the new world order, the new civilisation andculture, is the trend and the voice of public opinion, and the opportunityoffered to people everywhere to bring about social security and right humanrelations. It is not the government of any nation which will bring this about,but the innate rightness of the people themselves when they have been educatedto see the issues clearly, the relationships which should be established, andthe immense subjective unity of mankind. This will not come about without anintensive period of planned education, of a truly free press and radio—both freeto speak the exact truth and to present the facts as they occur, without beingcontrolled or influenced by governmental interference, pressure groups,religious organisations, or by any dictating parties or dictators. The sin ofthe Roman Catholic Church is its effort to dictate to people what they shouldthink—theologically and politically—what they should do, read and wear; this, toa still greater extent, is the crime of Russia. The mass of the people in thestrictly Catholic countries are not as free in their thinking as are thoseliving in the Protestant lands; the Russian people know no freedom and have noopportunity to form their own point of view; commercial interests and expediencyimpose restrictions in other countries. By means of these sources of control,the growth of true understanding is prevented, distorted or stunted. Curiouslyenough, the intention of the dictating agents, in both the Catholic Church andin Russia, is basically good; they believe that the uneducated masses are notfitted to decide for themselves what they should hear, think or [623] decide;they must therefore be protected—in the one case by decrees and prohibitionsfrom the Vatican (via the organised priesthood) as to right attitude and rightaction to be followed without questioning; and in the other, by withholding thetruth as to events and happenings. But men are awakening everywhere and—givensome sound leadership, which at present is not to be found in any country in theworld—they can be trusted to swing the tide into a great harmonising andunifying movement.As we study the effect of the Principle of Conflict as the instigator ofeventual harmony in relation to the nations. let us remember that the widespreadextent of the conflict is indicative of climax, that the “points of crisis”which express the conflict are today well known to all men, that a “point oftension” has now been reached (of which the United Nations is a symbol) whichwill eventually prove to be the agent that will bring about a “point ofemergence.” I would ask you to keep these three phrases—descriptive of theworking of the Ray of Harmony through Conflict—constantly in mind in relation todevelopments in your own life, in the life of your nation or of any nation, andin the life of humanity as a whole. They embody the technique whereby thespiritual Hierarchy of our planet brings good out of evil without originatingthe evil or infringing the free will of mankind.There are certain nations which are necessarily more responsive to the energy ofthis fourth ray than some of the others, because it is either the energy whichis conditioning their personality activities or that which conditions their soulexpression. Forget not that nations are like individuals, expressive of soul andbody. The nations responsive to this ray energy are:India, whose personality or material ray is that of Harmony through Conflict.This could be seen in full expression in that unhappy country during the years1947-1948. India is old and crystallised in her separativeness, in her myriadsof diversified sects and religious groups, in her manifold languages and in herancient antagonisms; [624] it will be long before there is any basic synthesisor harmony. There lies her problem, and unfortunately she lacks puredisinterested leadership; as is the case elsewhere in the world, party politicsand religious cleavages condition her many peoples. The soul energy of India isthat of the Will to Power or government, but that spiritual energy will not comeinto true activity until she has resolved her many differences and has returnedto the old ways of spiritual understanding and of enlightened wisdom whichdistinguished her many centuries ago. India has nearly lost the light, but whenshe has passed through the coming points of crisis, and has achieved a point ofunited tension, then she will find the door or point of emergence into light.The ray governing the soul expression of the German race is that of Harmonythrough Conflict, but her materialistic personality, focussed in the emotionalnature and not yet under control of the soul, is conditioned by the first Ray ofPower. Germany as a nation is too young, immature, and negative to realise thetrue uses of power; she lacks the wisdom to use power, and her sense ofinferiority (based on youth) leads her to misuse it when she has it. The Germanrace is very old, and the German leaders during the past one hundred years haveconfused racial issues and national ambitions. Races are basically subjective,and nations are basically objective. Their leaders have permitted the ideal ofpower (which is a great spiritual responsibility) to lead them to make theGermanic race synchronise with the German nation. It was this immaturity andthis misguided and almost childish ambition which set the Principle of Conflictoperating violently through the world war (1914-1945) in order to bring to anend the increasing nationalism of Germany and of all the nations. Great Britainis at the point of emergence from the nationalistic thoughtform; the UnitedStates and Russia are arriving—the first at the point of tension where theconcept is concerned, and the other at the point of crisis. Germany's point ofcrisis and of tension led to the explosion of the world war; nevertheless, afterdue process of pain, of re-education [625] and of training in right humanrelations, the German people will discover their soul, and then the soul-infusedpersonality of the German people will demonstrate in a unique manner thesignificance of harmony. The basic and subjective synthesis of the Germanic racemust not be confused with the separate nation of the German people, and theunderlying emotional and sentimental unity (using the word “sentimental” in itscorrect sense) must not be confounded with territorial unity. There is a racialand subjective unity between the British Commonwealth of Nations and the UnitedStates of America, but this in turn must not be confused with the outer nationalgroupings and aims.Italy also is influenced by the Ray of Harmony through Conflict because herpersonality or material expression is conditioned by this ray. During the worldwar, Italy had a king, a dictator, and a pope, and this produced a vortex ofconflict in the highly intelligent Italian people. The dictator is no longerthere; the monarchy has also disappeared, and only the continuing voice of theVatican is left, but—curiously enough—receives less attention in Italy than inthe other Catholic countries. Conflict during the centuries has done much forthe Italian people, and their highly extraverted psychology has produced in thema balance which may prove most promising in the future. The conflict of thoughtthrough which they have passed during the past one hundred years has worked wellfor them. Torn as they are by party politics, in revolt against ecclesiasticism,and lacking leadership, they are nevertheless well on the way to the resolutionof their problem.When the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict is the energy expressing itselfthrough the soul, the indications are that the country concerned is nearing thePath of Discipleship or the Path of Probation. Austria and Germany are nearingthe Path of Discipleship; Brazil is on the Path of Probation and will rapidlymove forward; Austria is nearer true discipleship than is Germany and,spiritually, Austria has much eventually to give. Spiritual [626] leadershipwill not be lacking once a measure of security and better living conditions havebeen assured. Germany has a bitter price to pay because her immaturity andchildish interpretation of world affairs, her lack of thinking capacity and hercurious innate cruelty permitted the Forces of Evil (temporarily) to workthrough Germany and precipitate the world conflict. But Germany will recover,provided she does not again permit herself to become a battleground, owing toher strategic position in central Europe. It is for this recovery that all menof goodwill must work.It is perhaps appropriate to point out here that the spiritual forces of theplanet do not greatly fear a renewed outbreak of war upon the physical plane.There are many chances that it can be averted because the mounting revolt of themasses against physical plane war, the general fatigue of the nations and theuse of the United Nations councils for the ventilation of difficulties andproblems may prove effective.Each of the three Great Powers has its own internal conflict, conditioned by itshistorical tradition, its national emphases, and its developed habits of thoughtor—as the case may be—of feeling.The major conflict in Great Britain at this time is between the reactionarythinkers and those unskilled labourers in the political field who favour thesocialistic ideology. This conflict goes deep and is undermining and destroyingold forms and producing intense national friction in all groups and parties. Onegroup is fighting to preserve the old order; the other group is fightingfiercely to abolish all the old ways in the shortest possible time; other groupsare fighting for their various ideologies and complicating the problem. Theinteresting thing is that the conflict is largely between party leaders andtheir immediate convinced followers, with the mass of people questioning thewisdom, the capacity and the activities of both groups and slowly deciding thatthey like and desire neither of them, but (lacking real leadership) they knownot what [627] to do. The predisposing characteristic of the British is a senseof justice and it is for this that the people seek. They find, however, thatneither party has an effective plan or programme, that both are animated byparty politics, and that the interests of the people as a whole which could beserved by a wise coalition are not of major importance to the present partyleaders. This internal conflict is slowly, however, going to produce a harmonyof purpose and of intention within the mind of the population; this will largelybe the result of the increasing power of women in the land and their increasingpenetration in municipal and national politics. The quality of the Britishhistorical retrospect has been predominantly masculine. Today the balancingfactor of feminine interpretation and the feminine point of view is needed andwill be provided. Great Britain, from the angle of its personality or materialproblem, is governed by the energy or Ray of Will or Power, whilst the soul ofthe country is conditioned by the Ray of Love-Wisdom. In this you have thepresentation of a positive and a negative energy, and when they are fused andblended you will have a balance and a wisdom which is at present lacking.In France, where the contributing rays are both along the line of the intellect,you have necessarily and naturally a strong materialistic influence and theconflict there is hard to resolve. It is ever the mind aspect which produces allthe separativeness, the cleavages and the differences in the human arena inFrance, making it the playground of untold numbers of conflicting ideas, adiversity of groups and of clashing personalities, and leading to an intensepreoccupation with France and its welfare; there is small interest in anythingelse, or in any other nations or groups, except as they affect France or theFrench people. The French are in no way as yet ready to balance conflict withharmony, even interiorly. The qualities of the mind—pride, self-centredness, aseparative attitude, a selfish planning and a materialism which penetrates deepinto the mass consciousness—are dominating in their activity and are [628]focussed upon the material well-being of France. There is no dominant ideology,so that the conflict is not lifted on to the ideological level, and until arecognised idealism begins to sway the French mind and the mass consciousness,France cannot grow; there is no basic religious or spiritual sense to be foundon a large scale, because the mind which can so inspiringly illumine the planeof the spirit is focussed primarily upon the three worlds of material living.This pronounced activity of the intellect, of which the French are so proud, islargely responsible for the situation in the political and economic fields inFrance, plus the difficulties which they share with all the nations which wereimplicated in the war. Any prospect of internal harmony is still far away but itwill come . Forget not what I wrote much earlier in one of my books that it isFrance which will eventually reveal the true nature of the soul or of the psycheand inaugurate the era of true esoteric psychology. To do this she mustinevitably find her own soul, and in finding it—through the medium of theillumined mind—she will bring light to humanity. The conflict now raging inFrance will eventually be resolved into harmony, and France will awaken to thehigher spiritual values. Once her soul ray of pure knowledge is active, it willdominate her personality or material Ray of Active Intelligence, once the mostpowerful of all the rays. The task of the Ray of Harmony through Conflict is tobring this about, thus releasing France into the light.In the United States, this fourth energy is peculiarly active, because of theconflict of races, nations, ideas, political theories, immature development,corrupt politics, and childish selfishness; this is more prevalent among theleaders in the municipalities and in politics than it is among the masses oflittle people in every state, who are basically sound though easily misled bytheir so-called leaders; the southern states are, however, almost unbelievablydegenerated and deluded. Remember always, as we look at these various nationsdispassionately, that we are concerned with the same trends and ideas which areto be [629] found in each individual aspirant—the conflict of ingrainedpersonality habits and thoughts and faults, with a steadily increasing soulpressure. The United States, though one of the younger nations, is—owing to themany racial types represented—one of the oldest; this curious balancing mustinevitably lead to a rapid development, with a consequent assumption of power, agrowing incentive to love and a shouldering of responsibility.The conflict in the United States is between a love of freedom which amountsalmost to irresponsibility and license, and a growing humanitarian ideologywhich will result in world service and non-separateness. The rays of energygoverning the United States are the 6th Ray of Idealism, which is the energy ofthe country's personality, and the 2nd Ray of Love-Wisdom, which governs thesoul of the country. I would here point out to you that it is the soul ray ofthe United States which relates it to Great Britain. The sixth ray personalityenergy (at the present stage of unfoldment) produces an idealism which requirestransmuting and changing from an idealism intensely preoccupied with thepreservation of a high standard of living and physical comfort to an idealisticappreciation of the real spiritual values; these are at present veiled andhidden in the material philosophy of the country. The youthful interpretation ofthis idealism can be seen in the complete conviction of the American people thateverything in the United States is better than anything anywhere else, in itswillingness to tell all the world what should or should not be done, in itsrevolt from all controls, in its unthinking acceptance of any information whichfalls in with its preconceived ideas and prejudices; the mature aspect ofAmerican idealism leads its people to a prompt response to the good, thebeautiful and the true, to the expression of an active humanitarianism and aninvocative spiritual approach to reality.It is interesting to note the unusual alignment of ray energies to be found atthis time in the United States: [630]> The energy of the soul...Ray of Love-Wisdom...Ray II> The energy of the personality...Ray of Idealism...Ray VI> The energy relating the two...Ray of Harmony through conflict...Ray IVThese Rays—2, 4, 6—are all on the second line of spiritual energy and lack allthe stiffening and strengthening dualities of the first line of ray energy—l, 3,5, 7—which are governed by Will or Power. The American civilisation, with allits clamour of youthful precocity, is in reality the heir of the passing sixthray civilisation, the Piscean; therefore, you have here the reason for thetendency of the American people to adopt violently conditioning idealisms andideologies. It is the idealistic tendency in conflict with pronouncedmaterialistic trends of this particular modern era which will finally evoke theharmony which will liberate the spirit of America, which will reveal to itspeople that it is one world and which will enable the people of this land toharmonise with the rest of the world and draw forth the loving response of othernations. It is for this that the men of goodwill must work.Russia is, if you could but realise it, a battleground today within her ownsealed walls. Her iron curtain is to Russia what the Monroe Doctrine was to theAmerican people. In connection with all the three Great Powers—the U.S.S.R., theU.S.A. and the U.K.—certain major conflicts are being specifically precipitated;these will fundamentally affect the destiny of humanity. These three nationsconstitute the three points of a most potent world triangle of energy, and oncethere is a free circulation and a true understanding established between them,then world peace will be assured and the Christ can come. This understanding andthis free harmony (if I may use such a term) will come as the result of each ofthe three Nations arriving at a real measure of internal harmony as a result oftheir own particular conflict, and then moving forward in an effort to harmonisewith each other and the rest of the world.Russia has the same personality ray as the United [631] States and her seventhray soul (conditioned by the Ray of Order) is closely related to the personalityray of Great Britain, the first Ray of Will or Power; the will aspect ofdivinity works out on the physical plane as the seventh Ray of Order or ofconformity to the inner divine will.The interior problem of the U.S.S.R. is the conflict raging between the imposed,arrogant will of a handful of powerful dictators and the fluid, unstable andignorant reaction of a people from whom the truth is constantly withheld; theytherefore have to fight blindly for their freedom, to fight instinctively andwithout knowledge of the facts. They are not yet waging a successful fight.The point, however, which is of major importance to us is the recognition thateach of these three nations is distinguished by:> a. A similarity of problem.> b. A battleground which is leading to the formation of a triangle of> relationships brought about through the Principle of Conflict.The similarity of problems consists in the fact that each of these three nationsis essentially composite in nature and is formed by an amalgamation of manynations, of many peoples speaking many different languages, and is consequentlystaging a great experiment in fusion.1. The U.K. is the nucleus or the living germ of the British Commonwealth ofNations wherein a great experiment in free government is being tried out; thisgives complete internal freedom and choice to each related Dominion, plus anequally complete and free interrelationship. The Dominions are all of themindependent nations, but belong to a united Commonwealth; a pattern is therebypresented for world consideration.2. The U.S.A. is a fusing centre wherein all nationalities are represented andare being slowly blended into a miniature One Humanity. A great experiment inright relationships is being undertaken and is making real progress. A cultureand a civilisation will emerge which will be the [632] result of right humanrelations and which can provide a world pattern in relationships. I refer hereto the presentation of democracy. There is nothing satisfactory yet in thepresentation of the dreamed-of democracy. France and Great Britain are equallydemocratic, and more successful because more mature and experienced, but the“melting pot” of the U.S.A. will provide eventually the outstanding experimentin right relations because of its many races and nationalities—all blendedtogether within the borders of one country.3. The U.S.S.R. is also seeking to blend and unite into one great nationalproject many diverse nations and races—European and Asiatic—and the effort isstill largely embryonic. In Russia a world ideology is being wrought out which(when proven) can be presented to the world as a model system; this, however,will not come as a result of dictatorship, nor can it be presented aggressivelyto the world. Russia is in reality—whether She realises it or not atpresent—undertaking a great experiment in education and, in spite of evilmethods and sinning against the soul of human freedom, eventually thiseducational process will prove convincing to the world and provide a worldmodel. This can only take place when the present group of dictators and arrogantmen have passed away or been forced out of power by an awakening people.In these three great nations, therefore, the three major divine aspects arebeing brought into manifestation, thus laying the foundation for the new worldorder. All three are of equal importance.> In Great Britain—right human government—Will or Power> In the U.S.A.—right human relations—Love-Wisdom> In the U.S.S.R.—right use of the mind—IntelligenceThis must be remembered and taught, and men of goodwill everywhere should workfor a closer relationship between these three peoples. These three points of adivine triangle of energy should not be isolated points, each holding its ownpoint of tensions they should be related points, each point distributingstrengthening energy to the other [633] points and admitting a free circulationbetween all points around the triangle.These great world problems are also being worked out in each of these threenations:1. In Great Britain, the problem of socialism is being resolved and the soundjudgment of the people will eventually balance the two conditions of a socialistprogramme and free enterprise; this needs doing, for the extreme position ineither case is untenable. This today presents a conflict which all the world iswatching. The transition period between group living (in the true and spiritualsense) and the present and past period of an intense individualism is not easy,and in Great Britain the whole matter is being put to the test. The bridge willbe built.2. In the U.S.A. you have the problem of the relationship between capital andlabour awaiting solution; the conflict is fierce but a compromise willeventually be worked out if capital concedes certain arrogant powers, recognisesthe rights of other human beings and demonstrates less selfish greed, and iflabour will work with less selfishness, prove less exacting and evince a moreunderstanding spirit. The bridge between these two great groups must and will bebuilt.3. In the U.S.S.R. you have the problem of the levelling of the masses in allclasses; this levelling has produced a low standard of living and the work to bedone is to raise more than to bridge. This levelling produces serious conflictand one that is little realised by those who cannot penetrate into the sealedcitadel which is Russia. It is really a conflict between the mounting humanspirit and the force of the totalitarian regime which seeks to hold it down,killing individualism. The innate strength of the human spirit to rise has neveryet failed, and this conflict will prove the agent in harmonising many factors.Within the comity of nations, certain of them have ever been prime agents forproducing conflict. This is largely owing to their fiery temperament and theirstrong [634] emotional bias and condition. The Poles and the Irish are prime“catalysts of conflict” and are constantly instigating difficulties betweenpeoples. Such has ever been their history. French aggression in the Middle Ageshas also caused difficulty, and in later days, Germany became the prime agent ofconflict. Today the Jewish people are engineering trouble, and it is interestingto note that the main contention in the past of Poland, lately of the Irish, andtoday of the Jews, is territory, thus evidencing a most distorted sense ofvalues. There is in the last analysis but one world and one humanity, and in ashorter time than you may think boundaries and territories will mean but little.World citizenship will be the only factor of importance.The Jews are governed by the third Ray of Active Intelligence, the energy whichpermeates and controls matter or substance. They were also, during the yearsimmediately following the war, under the control of a glamour imposed by theZionist Dictators, who were attempting (somewhat unsuccessfully) to be to theJewish people what Stalin and his group, and Hitler and his gang, have been totheir people. They worked through the same methods—terrorising, withholdinginformation, browbeating their opponents, making false claims and bribing andcorrupting. They were and are a minority, but a powerful minority because oftheir great wealth and their being in positions of power. They are claiming aland to which they have no possible right and which the Jews have ignored fortwo thousand years. Their attitude is perhaps the culminating aggressive actionof the age and marks a climaxing point; it has produced a serious world tension,but out of this good may come and a “point of emergence for mankind” be reached.The issue of aggression can be more clearly seen because of their activities.Very few lands today are in the possession of their original inhabitants, and ifrestoration is made to all original inhabitants (which is not possible) animpossible situation would be brought about just as legitimate as the Zionistposition. If the Zionist claims are to be considered (and they have been) theyin their turn [635] should realise that (if The Old Testament is to be believed)they originally took the land of Palestine away from its original owners nearlythree thousand years ago, at the point of the sword and through an unprovokedaggression.This conflict which the Zionists have precipitated is basic and useful. Itconstitutes a test case, being based upon physical plane aggression, beingfought with the most violent emotional disturbance and being founded uponcompletely illogical premises. The Jew has ever been (could he but usefullyremember it) the symbol of humanity—evolving, seeking, restless, materialistic,separative and greedy. He is the symbol of the mass consciousness, presentingthis consciousness in an exaggerated form; he is ever seeking and searching ahome and is the true Prodigal Son of The New Testament.Curiously enough, the Jews have never been a fighting race since the time of thesorry story of the conquest of the early tribes in Palestine; they have beenpersecuted and repudiated down the centuries, but have retaliated simply bymoving on—the wandering Jew seeking a home, wandering humanity, saying always,“I must arise and go to my Father.” The motive given to the Prodigal Son in theGospel story is a strictly material one, and we have here an outstandinginstance of the prophetic knowledge of the Christ.The Jewish people have not only repudiated the Messiah (which their raceproduced), but they have forgotten their unique relation to humanity; theyforget that millions in the world today have suffered as they have suffered andthat—for instance—there are eighty per cent of other people in the concentrationcamps of Europe and only twenty per cent Jews. The Jew, however, fought only forhimself, and largely ignored the sufferings of his fellowmen in theconcentration camps.I have enlarged thus upon the Jewish conflict because it is the symbol of allpast conflicts in human history, based upon universal selfishness and the greedof undeveloped humanity, and because the crucial test of the nations and [636]of the United Nations Assembly is to be found in the decisions which they madeand may make concerning Palestine.The test, as far as the nations are concerned, lies in their willingness to giverefuge to the Jews, and such a refuge would have been offered if thepartitioning of Palestine had been refused. The unwillingness of the nations toadmit the Jews (though many have willingly offered), and particularly therefusal of the United States to admit them, is separative, wrong and based uponpolitical expediency. The test, as far as the United Nations is concerned, waswhether they would endorse partition, and thus perpetuate the spirit ofaggression and territorial greed, against which the Forces of Light were arrayedin the last war. The United Nations has already made a major mistake by theiroriginal admittance of Russia—a totalitarian power, as was Germany—to theircouncils. Now they have made another. In the first mistake they precipitatedinto the United Nations the element of conflict and that spirit of “fanaticalimposition” which is distinctive of the totalitarian ideology; in this secondcase, through the endorsement of partition, they perpetuate the ancienttechnique of taking what is wanted (with force of arms, if necessary) from therightful owners. It was a test for the United States, for it is the AmericanJews who have created the situation, with relatively little help or endorsementfrom the Jews of other nations. The United States, urged by expediency, by thefinancial weight of the Zionists, and by the strategic position of Palestine,have thrown the weight of their influence into the conflict on the side ofaggression and of territorial theft. They could have worked for the Principle ofHarmony and permitted time and the non-separativeness of the nations to adjustand solve the Jewish problem.More I will not say; the symbolic nature of this basic world problem and itsdynamic importance to humanity have led me thus to enlarge. The decision anentthe Jews is one of hierarchical importance, owing to the karmic relation of theChrist to the Jewish race, to the fact that they repudiated Him as the Messiahand are still doing so, [637] and of the interpretive nature of the Jewishproblem as far as the whole of humanity is concerned.The Results of the Fourth Ray Activity upon the individual DiscipleThe disciples of the world today are submerged in an ocean of warring energies;the Principle of Conflict touches every life, is potent in the consciousness ofeach individual aspirant, and is conditioning the mass consciousness of mankind.Emotionally and physically, the masses in every land are roused by thisconflict; the disciples on earth and the thinking people everywhere are arousedmentally, as well as emotionally and physically, and hence the intensity oftheir problem. The points of crisis in the lives of disciples have—during thepast few decades—been many; a point of tension has now been reached of anextreme nature; how rapidly can this tension bring about the needed point ofemergence ?It is not my intention to deal at length with the effect of this conflict in thelife of disciples. It deals with the most familiar story to all of them; theaspirants and the disciples are, from the angle of evolution, the most strictlyhuman beings to be found in the fourth kingdom in nature, for the reason thatmind, emotion and physical activity are integrated or are in process ofintegration into one functioning whole. The disciple knows, however, that—as aresult of conflict—the complete harmonising of his entire nature will be broughtabout; the fusion of soul and personality will be consummated, and for this heworks. The same principle can also be applied by him in his consideration ofgeneral human affairs; he needs to see in all world conflict the needed stepstowards an eventual harmony—a harmony based upon a true mental perception and asound idealism. It is this process of developing mental understanding and asound rational yet spiritual attitude which is now going on; the emergence ofthe many ideologies are the guarantee that the true idealism will eventuallyappear and control—the ideal of right human relations; it is the [638] strugglebetween emotional control and a steadily developing mind control which isconditioning mankind at this time. When a mental, an emotional and a physicalconflict are raging simultaneously, the results must necessarily be difficult,but they are surmountable.Today, the conflicts are numerous, vital and unavoidable; they are present inthe individual consciousness and in the mass consciousness; they presentconstant points of crises and are today bringing about a point of world tensionwhich seems well-nigh unbearable. But ahead of the individual disciple and ofhumanity lies a point of emergence.What must the disciple do whilst the point of tension is dominating him and hisfellowmen? The answer is a simple one. Let each disciple and all groups ofdisciples develop the ability to think sanely, with right orientation and abroad point of view; let them think truly, evading no issues, but preservingalways a calm, dispassionate and loving understanding; let them demonstrate intheir environment the qualities which will establish right human relations andshow on a small scale the behaviour which will some day characterise enlightenedhumanity; let them not be discouraged, but let them hold firmly to theconviction of the inevitable spiritual destiny of humanity; let them realisepractically that “the souls of men are one” and learn to look beyond theimmediate outer seeming to the inner (and sometimes remote) spiritualconsciousness; let them know that the present world conflict will be terminated.The perfect outcome of the conflict will necessarily be lacking, for perfectionis not yet possible to man; nevertheless, a situation can be brought about whichwill permit the return of the Christ into objective relation with mankind, andwhich will enable Him to set about His task of resurrecting the human spirit,out of the tomb of materialism into the clear light of spiritual perception. Forthis, all men must work. [639]A Summation and ForecastLet me now summarise for you some of the points of importance in thisinstruction:1. The fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict is a controlling factor in humanaffairs at all times, and peculiarly today.2. The Principle of Conflict is the agent of the Principle of Harmony andproduces the strains and the stresses which will lead, finally, to liberation.3. The great initiation of the Renunciation, plus the many smallerrenunciations, is the result of inner conflict and ever precedes liberation intoharmony and peace.4. Conflict produces: War-Renunciation-Liberation.5. Humanity is subjected to crises of discrimination, leading to right choice.That is the problem confronting humanity today, leading to a crisis within theUnited Nations.6. The Hierarchy is subjected to crises of decision, leading to perception ofthe Plan, participation in the Purpose, and the prevention of evil.7. The Principle of Conflict is today active in all nations, in all religions,in all organisations, leading to the emergence of the New Age.8. Conflict produces points of crisis , then a point of tension, and eventuallya point of emergence.9. This Principle of Conflict is preparing the way for the return of the Christ,Who will inaugurate the new era of harmony.10. Christ will come in three different ways:> a. Through the overshadowing, on the mental plane, of all disciples and> aspirants.> b. Through the pouring out of love or of the Christ consciousness upon the> masses on the emotional plane.> c. Through His recognised physical Presence upon Earth.11. Certain nations are today torn with conflict but are [640] moving towardharmony. Other nations are focal points of discord and thereby serve thePrinciple of Conflict.12. The U.S.S.R., the U.S.A., and the U.K. constitute a governing triangle ofenergy which, when right relations have been established, can and will createand foster right human relations among men.13. The Jewish race is a symbol of humanity in its mass sense; in the resolutionof its conflict and in the taking of right action, a great step forward in humanliberation will take place.14. As the individual disciple learns to harmonise himself through conflict, hesets an example which is of definite aid to humanity as a whole.What can I prophesy? What may I foretell in relation to human affairs and of thefuture ahead of the race?I would remind you that even the Hierarchy of spiritual and liberated souls, theChurch of God invisible, knows not the way that humanity will choose to go.General trends are watched and possibilities are considered; the energiespouring into the human family are directed and manipulated, and conditions canfrequently be adjusted, but men decide for themselves direct action; they maketheir own choices and exert unimpeded the free will with which they may at anytime be equipped. I prophecy not, because I do not know. I can, however, saythat the issues at stake are now becoming so clear that right decision is morepossible than at any other time in human history. Unless, therefore, emotionalstresses are too acute, humanity will decide upon right action eventually.Emotions are, however, running high and the spiritual people of the world arenot sufficiently aroused as yet to handle them. It is the arousing and theawakening to the critical nature of the time and to the world problems which isimmediately needed, and this all men of goodwill should regard as theirparamount duty.As I earlier remarked, if the trends which are today being established arerightly developed, the Hierarchy does not foresee the immediacy of war; war canbe averted if [641] the nations are fully occupied with the task ofreconstruction and if an educational programme in right human relations islaunched and systematically and most carefully carried out. If the subjectiverelations between the nations are emphasised and the outer frictions and theobjective disagreements are ignored, a great fusion of human interests can takeplace; this will be binding and lasting; if the cleavage between separatenessand right relations is clearly to be seen, men will know of themselves whataction they should take.In the war raging today between conflicting ideas, it is essential that thiscleavage be made abundantly clear. Only the voice of a trained public opinionand the intelligent demand of the masses for right human relations can save theworld from chaos. If this is so, then the duty of each individual disciple, manof goodwill and intelligent thinker is also clear. Let me bring the theme to aclose with this thought and this indicated action.THE RAYS OF ASPECT AND THE HIGHER INITIATIONSWe completed our consideration of the effect of the four Rays of Attribute uponhumanity as a whole and upon the individual disciple. If you will study therelationship of these rays to each other, you will discover that the energieswhich made their impact upon the would-be initiate were, first of all, two rays:the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Order and the fifth Ray of Science which are bothalong the line of the first Ray of Will or Power, plus two other rays, the sixthRay of Devotion or Idealism and the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict,which are both along the line of the second Ray of Love-Wisdom. All these Raysof Attribute were—in connection with the initiations concerned—functioningwithin the realm of knowledge ; it is a knowledge, however, dedicated eventuallyto spiritual intent and attained through conflict.We come now to the consideration of the three Rays of Aspect and their generaland momentous effect upon [642] mankind in this cycle, and upon the disciplepreparing for initiation. We are dealing, therefore, with> Ray 1. Will or Power, active in connection with the 5th Initiation.> Ray 2. Love-Wisdom, active in connection with the 7th Initiation.> Ray 3. Active Intelligence, active in connection with the 6th Initiation.The united activity of these rays lifts humanity to the higher, spiritual realmand concerns those initiations which lie a long way ahead of mankind. They liealso a considerable distance on the Path from the present point of the averagedisciple. I am dealing with them, however, as best I can, because the next onehundred years will see a demonstrable orientation of trained disciples towardsthe higher perception. You must make what you can of this information; itconcerns primarily action within the Ashram—action which is, however, concernedwith human development and welfare.The 8th and the 9th initiations, governed by the four Rays of Attribute workingin synthesis with the three Rays of Aspect (and working simultaneously), willnecessarily be far beyond our comprehension; there is little I shall be able totell you because I know but little myself.Does this last remark surprise you? It should not. From the exoteric angle,evolution means growth and development and is largely applied to the form sideof nature, and the term “evolution” might thus be confined entirely to theevolution of the form nature. It might also be applied to development within thethree worlds and to the third aspect of the divine Life. However, from theesoteric angle, evolution means a steadily increasing sensitivity to light andillumination. A Master may not possess all knowledge possible from the exotericangle; this He does not need because (after evolution, along the line ofknowledge, decided for Him by His ray type) He is on the “way of light,” and thelight which is in Him and in which He lives and moves and functions serves adual purpose: [643]1. It can be used to ascertain whatever is needed in the realm of knowledge bythe revelation of where the needed information can be found; this is far moreliterally so than you realise. (It was through the use of this form of lightthat I, for instance, found A.A.B.; I was searching for a secretary with morethan the usual education and perception generally to be found, and the lightrevealed her from the personality angle in the three worlds.)2. It can be used also to reveal to the Master that which lies ahead for Him,and those further reaches of awareness to which He knows He must eventuallyattain.The lower aspects of this light are in reality generated by the soul, whilst thehigher are those which emanate from the Monad. When an initiate takes the fifthinitiation (with which we are now going to deal) he has to demonstrate hisfacility in using the “light available” by initiating some new project in linewith the hierarchical Plan and in tune with his own ray impulses. This projectmust have both an exoteric side and esoteric. (To illustrate further: Theexoteric side of the work which I—as a newly made Master—had purposed to do canbe seen in the activities which I have been enabled to accomplish in the outerworld through the books which A.A.B. has taken down for me and by theestablishing of the Service Activities, associated with the Arcane School. Theesoteric side is of course known to me, but an analysis of it would be of noservice to you, as you are not yet of the required initiate-consciousness.)You can see, however, how the above information can throw light upon ourimmediate theme:Initiation V. Revelation. Ray I.> The Energy of the Will-to-Good. Power.This initiation has always been called in the Christian church by the name ofthe Resurrection, whereas it is the seventh initiation which is the trueresurrection. The correct name for the fifth initiation is the Initiation ofRevelation; this signifies the power to wield light as [644] the carrier of lifeto all in the three worlds, and to know likewise the next step to be taken uponthe Way of the Higher Evolution. This Way is revealed to the initiate in a newlight and with an entirely different significance when the fifth initiation istaken. It is the true time of emergence from the tomb of darkness andconstitutes an entrance into a light of an entirely different nature to anyhitherto experienced.Development and revelation or (if you so prefer it) a developing revelation,form essentially the entire theme and objective of all activity upon our planet.This gives us a clue to the goal of the planetary Logos. All life, from thefirst descent of the soul into incarnation, is only a series of revelations, allof which lead up to the revelation accorded at the fifth initiation. Therelation between the fifth and the seventh initiations is exceedingly deep andmysterious. It is the revelation accorded in the fifth initiation which makesthe seventh initiation possible. The Master, as He emerges at the fifthinitiation into the light of day, realises in that light:1. The true and hitherto unknown significance of the three worlds which he hasviewed almost entirely from the angle of meaning . Now its significance isapparent, and the revelation is so tremendous that “he withdraws into the worldof light and joins his brothers. He gathers all his forces and seeks new lightupon the Plan . That light shines forth and with the force of its revealingpower, new loyalties arise, new goals are seen, and that which shall be and thething which is, both become lost in the radiant light of revelation.”2. That the first vibration or influencing energy of the cosmic ray ofprevailing energy in its highest aspect is the Ray of Love-Wisdom, and this isnow contacted; this is made possible by the Master's response to the first Rayof Power or of the Will-to-Good, experienced in its second aspect at the fifthinitiation. Forget not that all rays have three aspects, and that all three canbe contacted by the human consciousness of the spiritual man, thus [645] placingat his disposal the energies of the seven rays and of the twenty-one forces. Itis this synthesis which is revealed at the fifth initiation and—as I saidabove—the combination of these forces produces the Ascension; this is anexceeding great mystery and one which cannot as yet be grasped by you. From theheight of the Mount of Ascension light is thrown upon the hierarchical Plan insuch a manner that the purpose in the mind of the planetary Logos is (for thefirst time) truly grasped.3. From that height also, the mystery of the human soul is revealed and a greattriangular pattern will be seen, relating the human spirit to the world offorms, to the united Hierarchy and to the Council Chamber of the Lord. Upon thisI may not here enlarge, for we must not diverge too far from our study. Onething only can be said: from that high place, atma-buddhi-manas (will, love andintelligent action) can be seen in united activity and the theory of an existingPlan and the belief in the three divine aspects, or in the Trinity of Energies,is factually demonstrated.The first Ray of Will or Power is distinguished by the highest known divinequality (there are others still higher). In the word, GOODWILL, the secretpurpose of the planetary Logos is hidden. It is being slowly brought to theattention of humanity by means of the three phrases: God is Love. Goodwill. TheWill-to-Good. These three phrases, in reality concern the three aspects of thefirst ray.When a Master takes the fifth initiation He already knows the significance ofthe first two aspects, and must become consciously aware of the highest aspect:the Will-to-Good. He has developed in Himself “the love necessary to salvation,His own and that of those He loves, His fellow-men;” all His actions and Histhinking are qualified by goodwill, in its esoteric sense, and the significanceof the Will-to-Good lies ahead of Him and will be later revealed.As this first ray is not in incarnation at this time, and therefore souls whocan fully express it are absent, the entire theme anent this type of energy, andits influence [646] and quality when related to the energies and the forces, ismost difficult to express. Each great ray, as it comes into incarnation,transforms the speech of the cycle, enriches the existent vocabulary, and bringsnew knowledge to humanity; the many civilisations—past and present—are theresult of this.I would ask you to consider the relation of the fifth initiation, the fifth Rayof Science and the first Ray of Will, for there lies the key to the revelationaccorded to the initiate-Master.As you can see, we are venturing into realms far beyond your comprehension; butthe effort to grasp the unattainable and to exercise the mind along the line ofabstract thought is ever of value.It must be remembered therefore (and I reiterate) that the revelation accordedto the disciple-initiate is along the line of the first Ray of Will or Power,and that is a ray which is as yet a long way from full manifestation. From oneangle, it is of course always in manifestation for it is the ray which holds theplanet and all that is upon it in one coherent manifesting whole; the reason forthis coherent synthesis is the evolutionary effort to work out divine purpose.The first ray ever implements that purpose. From another angle, it is cyclic inits manifestation; here I mean from the angle of recognised manifestation—andsuch is the case at this time.The Effect of Ray I on Humanity TodayOwing to extra-planetary stimulation, to the immediate planetary crisis and tothe present invocative cry of humanity, energy from Shamballa has been permittedto play upon the “centre which is called the race of men” and has produced twopotent results: first, the world war was precipitated and, secondly, the fissionof the atom, resulting in the atomic bomb, was brought about. Both these eventswere made possible by the pouring-in of the energy and power of the third aspectof the first Ray of Power or Will. This is the lowest aspect, and definite [647]material effects were produced. The destroyer aspect was therefore the firstaspect to take effect. It split the thought-form of materialistic living (whichwas governing and controlling humanity everywhere) upon the mental plane and, atthe same time, it produced a great agent of destruction upon the physical plane.Thus was the new era ushered in; thus was the stage set for a better future.This was the intent and the purpose of Those Who compose the Council Chamber ofthe Lord. It rests with humanity itself to take advantage of the profferedopportunity which this destructive manifestation made possible.Shamballa having acted in this manner, it is nevertheless the Hierarchy whichwill bring into expression a measure of the second aspect of the first Ray ofWill or Power, and it is for this that the Hierarchy is preparing; it is forthis event that the Christ is fitting Himself to be the distributing Agent andthe directing Factor, with the concentrated assistance of the united Hierarchy;it is this that will begin to manifest when He appears. You have here the truereason for His proclaimed Coming or Reappearance. The distinction betweenmaterial living and spiritual living will be clearly demonstrated. This is madepossible by the cleavage of the ancient materialistic thoughtform on mentallevels; the reorientation of human thinking, as this fact is grasped, will haveits first results upon emotional levels through the focussed expression of humangoodwill; this is the lowest aspect of the second Ray of Love-Wisdom,implemented and strengthened by the second aspect of the first Ray of Will.On the physical plane, the great scientific discovery, called colloquially the“splitting of the atom,” will be turned eventually to the production of thoseconditions which will enable mankind to follow the good, the beautiful and thetrue. This men will then be able to do, freed from the dread presence of purelymaterialistic thinking. This is no idle vision or vague dream. Many scientiststoday (and particularly those who love their fellowmen) [648] are not onlyvisioning the non-destructive aspect of atomic energy but are already engaged inharnessing—for the good of humanity—some of its products and its radioactiveproperties.Curiously enough, it is the wise, controlled use of the results of thisscientific adventure in connection with the atomic bomb which will eventuallybring about a specific revelation of the nature of certain forces in relation tolight; this event will transform world thinking and lead to a new type oftransmutative process, as far as man is concerned.It must not be inferred from the above that humanity, as a whole, will be takingthe fifth initiation, for such is not the case. Many advanced souls (perhapsamounting to many thousands) may and will take this initiation, but the massesof men everywhere, constituting the sum total of the world disciple willeventually take either the first or the second initiation. The effect however ofhierarchical happenings, in conjunction with Shamballa, will lead finally to thegreat stimulation of the fifth Principle of manas, the intelligence principle inman. A revelation which is not perceived, which remains unrelated andunexpressed, is of no true service to mankind, except from a purely subjectivestandpoint; nevertheless, through the proposed stimulation, through the effortsof those who have taken or who will take the fifth initiation, and through thenew direction of first ray energy from Shamballa, the mental plane will receivesuch an inflow of energy that the thinking principle, the reasoning factorwithin humanity, will reach new heights. Thus will the “light stream forth intothe minds of men,” and the first stanza of the Invocation prove that it can anddoes receive an answer to its invocative appeal.It would be good to let your spiritual imagination look forward into the future,and then vision—if you can—what is the true significance of the tremendousactivity of the Hierarchy. One of the signs of the coming of this new light andenergy inflow is a definitely curious one; it is [649] to be found in theinstability of the human mental mechanism and the human thinking processes atthis time. This is due to their premature response to the new incoming potency.It is a mass reaction, and therefore the statistical returns are somewhatmisleading. It is the unready who thus react, and this entails no possiblereflection upon those thus distressed (and they are to be found today in allclasses and nations). The Law of Rebirth will take care of this reaction, and inthe next incarnation these same people will enter a physical body with a betterequipment. In reality, it is this energy from Shamballa in its third anddestructive aspect which is acting upon certain members of the human family andunfortunately evoking a ready response. I tell you this for your encouragement;destruction always evokes questioning in minds attuned to human welfare and inthose thinkers who are apprehensive of the suffering to which their fellowmenare subjected.One of the most difficult things for the average thinking man to understand andto interpret is the destructive processes of what he (for lack of a better name)calls “the will of God.” This is one of the results (and only one) of a purelymaterialistic civilisation which has laid all its emphasis upon the form side ofexperience and thus regards physical well-being and physical comfort, plusmaterial possessions, as the true goal of all human effort. It is upon thiswidespread attitude and reaction that the new incoming light will concentrateitself; as the light reveals reality, the world of phenomena and the world ofspiritual values will enter into a better, directed relation.From all the above, you will note that some of the effects upon humanity as awhole and the skeleton structure of the new and beautiful future will take placeas a result of the new incoming first ray activity. No details can yet be given,but enough has been written down anent the basic, predisposing cause to enableyou who read to ponder upon the possible effect, spiritually speaking. What iscoming is a civilisation of a different yet still material nature, but animatedby a growing registration by the masses [650] everywhere of an emergingspiritual objective which will transform all life and give new value and purposeto that which is material.Next we must consider what will be the effect of this first ray energy upon theindividual disciple as he prepares for and undergoes the fifth initiation, andkeys himself up for the promised revelation, thus laying himself open to anentirely new inflow of force. This he must do consciously. It is consciousabsorption of energy and its conscious assimilation, plus its conscious usewhich distinguishes the initiate from the rest of mankind; there are of coursemany degrees of this desired consciousness. What the initiate will receive as aresult of first ray energy will be an inflow of the second aspect of this ray—ablazing forth of the light which will focus clearly for him, and in a flash oftime, the significance of that which is slowly being revealed on Earth; he seesthis vision in toto for the first time. At the fourth initiation, he responds tothe third aspect of this ray, the aspect of destruction; this divested him ofeverything, and finally and eternally destroyed all that which held him in thethree worlds of human endeavour. Thus was harmony produced through conflict, andthe success of the individual initiate is the guarantee of the final success ofthe world disciple.When it comes to a consideration of the effect of this ray at the time of thefifth initiation, you must bear in mind that the disciple has passed, in aprevious incarnation, through the Initiation of Renunciation, and hasestablished within himself a condition of complete harmony as a result ofconflict—a conflict which has been raging for millennia of years and whose goalhas ever been revelation. Just as a camera has to be correctly focussed in orderto register correctly that which is visioned, so this harmony, once finallyachieved, can be regarded as a form of focussed orientation. Throughout the manylives the disciple has lived, there have been many such moments, but they werebrief and passing, serving only to stir the aspiration into activity. With thedisciple of the fourth initiation, submitting [651] himself to the fifthinitiation, the orientation and the focus attained remains a permanent condition. This prefaces an entirely new cycle of spiritual experience—the experience ofthe higher evolution—leading to that great moment when the revelation of theseven Paths is accorded to him at the following or sixth Initiation of Decision.Where the ordinary everyday man is concerned, the propelling aspiration (if Imay use such an unusual phrase) is of a material nature and concerns hissuccessful progress in the world of everyday physical plane life. It might bewise to consider ambition as the lower expression of aspiration; this ambitioncovers all the many phases of the Path of Evolution, from the ambition of theraw savage in primeval times to gain food and shelter for himself and family tothe ambition of the modern business man to reach the height of financial gain orpower. Having achieved that goal, it frequently happens that, on the way to thehigher octave of ambition (aspiration), there may come a cycle of lives wherethe ambition is directed to the creative arts. Next comes gradually thetransmutation of all these ambitions into a steadily growing and consciouslyspiritual aspiration. The man treads then the Probationary Path and eventuallythe Path of Discipleship, and as his spiritual ambition grows and is paralleledby an equally steady growth in mental realisation, he passes from initiation toinitiation, until there comes the culminating fifth initiation.All his past realisations—both his material and also his spiritualrealisation—have been renounced. He stands entirely free from every aspect ofdesire. The spiritual will has been substituted for desire. Then, reinforced bythe inflow of the first ray Shamballic energy, and offering no obstructions orhindrances from within himself, as a personality, he is in a position to receivethe stimulation which will enable him “to see that which is to be revealed andto accept revelation,” transmuting it into that definite realisation which willenable him to live by means of its light. You have, therefore, certain wordswhich are concerned [652] with the method whereby the vision is accorded andrevelation given:> 1. Ambition, implemented by determination.> 2. Aspiration, implemented by devotion or one-pointed attention.> 3. Revelation, implemented by the will in its two lower aspects.> 4. Realisation, implemented by the will in its highest aspect.That, briefly, is the evolutionary story of the “initiate in good standing” andit is basically the story of the will to self-betterment, the will to humanservice, goodwill, and finally, the will-to-good. You can see, therefore, howthe great first aspect of divinity, through its three aspects, is the hidden,basic, motivating potency of life and of evolution, from the very dawn of theevolutionary cycle.The initiate in good standing looks into the heart of things; he has forced hisway to the very “Heart of the Sun” (using those words in a “planetary” and notin a “solar” sense) and—from that vantage point—he becomes aware of the “CentralSpiritual Sun” and the Way of the Higher Evolution which leads inevitably tothat assured centre of the Most High. The three worlds of material living andthe inner world of meaning which the soul has revealed to him are now leftbehind; he is suddenly confronted with the world of significances, with the trueworld of causes and of origination, and by the realm of the universal. Hediscovers that all he had thought anent the Law of Cause and Effect was solimited that—in the light of this Higher Evolution—it has practically becomemeaningless, except as the A B C whereby he can teach the children of men. Herealises, through the revelation accorded, more clearly than has hitherto beenpossible, the Purpose of the planetary Logos. From the time of the thirdinitiation, this purpose has been gradually revealing itself; he sees itexpressing itself through Sanat Kumara, Who is the Personality expression of theplanetary Logos. During the coming interval and cycle of preparation for thesixth [653] initiation, that purpose will burst upon him in blazing andsynthetic glory.The way to the Central Spiritual Sun is therefore revealed to him, and he knowsthat he faces a period of intense preparation (not training, as that word isusually understood) for a length of time determined by world need, the nature ofhis service and certain undefinable ray conditions.He has to fulfill the magnetic condition which will enable him to form his ownAshram; he has to unfold a new phase of selective spiritual discrimination. Theword discrimination is, however, misleading, because the form of it which he cannow express carries no quality of rejection or of separation. It is a rightknowledge and understanding of those karmically linked to him, a right use of animpelling attractive force which will, occultly speaking, attract the attentionof those who should enter his Ashram, plus an esoteric process of blendinghimself and his Ashram into the full body of the Hierarchy. New Ashrams withinthe Hierarchy present much the same type of difficulty and problems as theentrance of a new disciple into an Ashram.It might be said that that which holds the Hierarchy together, and that whichproduces a coherent Ashram, is the revelation, received in the light which thatrevelation produced and which leads to realisation. Ashramic responsibility,constant service within the planetary Life and the subjection of Himself and ofHis Ashram to cyclic stimulation from Shamballa, plus certain mysteriousprocesses which have naught to do with form or consciousness, but with the“sensitivity of the universe,” occupy the interim between the fifth and thesixth initiations.Initiation VI. Decision. Ray IIIWe have concluded our study of the rays and the five initiations, and there islittle more that I can tell you about the remaining four initiations, except oneor two points anent the sixth Initiation of Decision; this initiation [654] isgoverned by the third Ray of Active Intelligence. The only reason that I ammaking a few comments upon the sixth initiation is that at this time a number ofthe Masters are taking this great step, and it has a most peculiar applicationto the time of the reappearance of the Christ.At this Initiation of Decision the Master concerned decides usually which of theseven Paths He intends to tread; some Masters decide to remain until the closeof our planetary Life, at which time the “last weary Pilgrim will have found hisway home”; the Earth can then be prepared for a new Humanity. When this happens,our planet will no longer be known as the planet of sorrow and of pain, but willbe distinguished by a quality of tranquillity and by an aura of calm potencywherein the will of God (to be demonstrated in the next solar system) will befocussed; this—in some mysterious way—will enable the solar Logos (not theplanetary Logos) to bring the first great divine aspect, that of Will or Power,into expression throughout the solar system. Instead, therefore, of thestatement which explains our present solar system, “God is Love,” we shall havea dynamic expression of the will-to-good—an energy which will have beengenerated to some extent upon our Earth. This is the reward which the presentEarth humanity will reap, and this is the consummation of the preordained taskof our planetary Logos. He undertook, when He came into incarnation (through themedium of our little planet), to aid the work of the Solar Logos in expressingthe will aspect of divinity.It might be simpler if I said that the experiment of manifesting the firstdivine aspect, through the medium of form and through a humanity which hasbehind it the experience of five initiations (and is therefore expressingintelligent love), will be attempted. This statement is necessarily misleading,but it embodies a truth and indicates the unfinished story of solar expression.Today, however, in taking this sixth initiation, all of the Masters so doing andunder the suggestion of the Christ, [655] continue to make the decision whichwill control Their future progress on one of the seven Paths of the HigherEvolution, but—at the same time—all of Them are postponing this proposedprogress upon Their chosen Path in order, for a brief time, to implement and aidthe work of the Christ and help towards the externalisation of the Hierarchy,through the medium of certain of its Ashrams; They will also form a protectingwall around the Christ, and act as liaison officers between Their great Leaderand the Avatar of Synthesis.Christ Himself took this initiation some time ago and passed through theResurrection Initiation and the experience of the seventh initiation. TheseMasters can, in a mysterious fashion, implement the expression of the divinewill-to-good on Earth. They will work in collaboration with Those Masters WhoseAshrams will be the first to be anchored on Earth in the sense of physicalexpression because, esoterically speaking, it is “the will of God which holdsthem there.”For ages, the potency of that which lies behind the fifth initiation—in theplanetary sense and not in connection with the individual initiation with itsrevelation indicating first ray purpose—has held sway on Earth. Knowledge, therevealing of the Mysteries, the attainment of scientific achievement, producingthe activity of the fifth plane of mind, has governed human thinking andadvancement; God in nature (i.e., the planetary Logos in concrete and materialexpression) has been revealed, and this has culminated in that tremendousexpression of power—the atomic bomb.Now, the potency of that which lies behind the sixth initiation will take holdof the evolutionary process and will implement divine purpose. What that potencyin truth may be, we cannot yet know; we do know, however, that it is closelyrelated to the will-to-synthesis; this will enable the Christ to break down thebarriers and the separating walls which selfish, self-centred and materialistichumanity (largely with the aid of the churches of the world, with theirmaterialistic bias) has built, thereby letting in the [656] light ofunderstanding and clearing the way for a fuller expression of the will of God.I felt that the practical aspect of what the Masters are doing might proveuseful to you. As to the remaining three initiations:> Initiation VII...The Resurrection...Ray II> Initiation VIII...The Great Transition...Rays IV, V, VI, VII (the four minor> Rays)> Initiation IX...The Refusal...Rays I, II, III (the three major Rays)an analysis of them would prove to you that your comprehension has not yet beendeveloped to the point where understanding is possible; it would therefore be awaste of time further to consider them. If you will re-read the instructionsearlier given upon the seven Paths (pp. 395-427) you may glean some ideas aboutthese later initiations; they would still, however, be impossible of applicationand practical usefulness at your particular stage of evolutionary development."},{"pageContent":"THE SEVEN AND THE NINE INITIATIONS OF OUR PLANETARY LIFENow let us look at these initiations from the angle of the planetary Life, asfar as in us lies. We have for long looked at them from the angle of humanity,the world disciple, as well as from the angle of the individual initiate, but itmust not be forgotten that these initiations have also a planetary significance.From the standpoint of the Hierarchy and of Shamballa, they constitute the majorfactors which make possible the initiatory process on Earth among men.This naturally means in relation to our planetary Logos. It must never beforgotten that it is the progress forward upon His chosen cosmic Path whichmakes the entire evolutionary process possible. Just as a Master Who has takenthe fifth initiation has to project His own specific undertaking, through themedium of His Ashram, thus [657] proving His response to the will aspect of theplanetary Logos and making Himself responsible for a phase of the planetaryPlan, so a planetary Logos has likewise—under the Law of Synthesis—to carryforward a specific project in line with the will of the Solar Logos. This ourplanetary Logos, Sanat Kumara, is in process of doing, providing a definiteculture wherein the germ of the solar will can be fostered in one of itsaspects. Then—in conjunction with a similar project going on in two otherplanets, thus fostering two other aspects—the nucleus of the third solar systemwill be brought eventually into expression.It is hard for the human mind to appreciate this basic synthesis and thisrelationship which exists throughout the entire solar system, with the planetaryLogoi implementing divine purpose; men cannot yet grasp the relations within thepersonality aspect of our planetary Logos—the Earth and all that is therein. Butthat synthesis exists and is the relating factor between our Earth and the Sun,between the various planetary Logoi and the Solar Logos. All that we can do isto get a general picture of the planetary initiations, the seven initiations andthe nine.The only manner in which we can grasp even a small measure of planetaryintention is through a study of the great civilisations which have beendeveloped by humanity under impression from the highest spiritual sources on ourplanet; these have hitherto reached us via the Hierarchy. To these civilisationsmust be added the cultures which have evolved out of them. This obviously wecannot do, for it would require research into all the known and the unknownhistorical periods and cycles, plus a consideration of all theevidence—anthropological, architectural and sociological. To this approach tothe intent and the purpose of the planetary Logos must be added a considerationof certain crises in the life of mankind which are in the nature of minorinitiations to which the planetary Logos has subjected Himself, in the sensethat He is the Initiator. Humanity, being the most highly developed evolutionaryproduct upon our planet, reacts to these initiations; they [658] produce worldevents, and those stupendous points of crisis which (up to date) have workeddestructively where the form aspect is concerned, but which have developed intothose stages of sensitive unfoldment and progression when the work of theBuilders (the second divine aspect) is added to and takes advantage of theliberty or release brought about by the Destroyer (the first aspect). There arealways these two phases.Through the past civilisations and their eventual catastrophic destruction, theplanetary Logos has gradually prepared the ground or planetary field for the“planting of the germ of Will”—the nurturing of which is a future part of humandestiny. The seven major phases of the unfoldment of the human race (of whichour modern Aryan race is the fifth) are in the nature of seven planetaryinitiations or unfoldments; the word “initiation” is not to be understood in theexact sense in which human initiations are understood and interpreted. Men areinitiated into phases of the divine consciousness through applied stimulation,whereby their vehicles evidence readiness; in connection with the planetaryLogos, it is He Who initiated a new process in seven phases, preparatory to theexpected divine planting. It must be borne in mind that the use of the word“planting” is purely symbolic. Each phase brings the original divine purpose orspiritual project nearer to fruition, and it is for this that Sanat Kumara cameinto manifestation or incarnation.Each of these phases affects all the four kingdoms in nature, producing a higherstage of sensitivity in each successive one, but it is only in the fourthkingdom, the human, that there exists the possibility of a conscious registeringand recognition of divine intent and a faint vibrating response to the willaspect of divinity. It has taken a millennia of years to bring this about. Whenyou remember that it has only been in the present world crisis that theplanetary Logos dared subject the forms in all the four kingdoms to the directstimulation of His impelling will, you will realise the long, long patiencewhich is perhaps [659] His most distinctive characteristic. Patience is aquality of will; it is of the nature of a strict adherence to a fixed intention.At each transition from one civilisation to another (each being built upon thecultural seed of the preceding one, after a due flowering of the civilisation)we could say of Sanat Kumara what has been said of the Christ, that “He sees ofthe travail of His soul and is satisfied.” So blind are men that when acivilisation comes to an end, when the familiar mode of cultural expression isbrought (as is usual) under the hand of the destroyer, humanity regards it as amajor disaster and dreads and fears the ruin which usually surrounds such anevent. But from the standpoint of the world of significances, progress is seenand the day of fulfillment draws much nearer.Our modern civilisation today (under the hammer of the destroyer aspect) isbeing changed; old things are passing away, having served their purpose. The newthing is not yet noted or appreciated, though already present. The work ofpreparation for the planting of the germ or seed of the divine will on Earth isnearly over; when the Hierarchy is externalised, and men as a whole recognisethe position on Earth of the Christ and of His church “invisible” (the union ofall souls made perfect, which is a true description of the Hierarchy), then—in amanner unforeseen by humanity—Shamballa will assume control, and from theCouncil Chamber of Sanat Kumara will issue forth the Sower of the seed; He willsow it within the ground prepared by humanity , and thus the future is assured,not for the planetary Logos alone, but for that greater Whole in which ourplanet plays its little part. That moment lies ahead in the civilisation whichshall be, and in the next great race which will emerge out of all our modernraces and nations, the sowing will take place. The next race will be a fusion ofthe whole, and a world-wide recognition of the One Humanity is an essentialprerequisite of the sowing. It is the creation of this universal recognitionwhich will be one of the major tasks of the reappearing Christ and His attendantHierarchy. When the “little wills of [660] men” are beginning to respond on ameasurably large scale to the greater Will of the divine Life, then the majortask of Shamballa will become possible; nevertheless, prior to that, humanitymust respond to the light and the love which are the preparatory streams ofspiritual energy and which are already pouring forth in response to humaninvocation.In comprehending the planetary initiatory processes as instituted by theplanetary Logos, men must relate them to the great crises which have occurred inall the races of men. Just as the initiate-disciple passes from one initiationto another through a process of continuously leaving behind those aspects of theform life which have been destroyed by him as useless, so humanity leaves behindcivilisation after civilisation under the stimulus of the evolving purpose ofSanat Kumara Who initiates constantly that which is new and that which willbetter serve His will. Men are apt to think that the whole evolutionaryprocess—including the development of the subhuman kingdoms in nature—is merely amode whereby men can reach perfection and develop better forms through which tomanifest that perfection. But in the last analysis, human progress is purelyrelative and incidental. The factor of supreme importance is the ability of theplanetary Logos to carry out His primary intention and bring His “project” to asound consummation, thus fulfilling the task given to Him by His great superior,the Solar Logos.The eighth and the ninth initiations (of which neither you nor I can knowpractically anything) relate to the initiations of those methods and techniqueswhereby the “seed of will,” which will later flower into the third solar system,can be nurtured and fostered and its growth promoted. This nurturing andfostering will be the task of a group of Masters (to be developed in the nextmajor race) Who, at the Initiation of Decision, the sixth initiation, willdedicate Themselves, as a group , to the Path of Earth Service. They willspecifically and with full enlightenment pledge Themselves to the promotion ofSanat Kumara's project. With this our present group of Masters are notspecifically [661] concerned; Their task is the application of the evolutionaryprocess with a view to the preparation of the field of the world for the futuredivine sowing.More I cannot tell you. All I have done is to give you a hint as to thesignificance of the initiations, instituted by the Lord of the World. These arenot, may I repeat, initiations to which the planetary Logos is Himselfsubjected. The world crises, which ever precede initiation on a planetary scale,are part of the preparatory work, tests and trials which make possible somecosmic initiation to which He has been and will eventually be subjected. Withthem we have no concern, nor would you understand if I were to be in any wayexplicit. The Law of Analogy and of Correspondences breaks down at a certainpoint upon the path of understanding, and something new and utterly differententers in. The Law of Analogy holds good when considering the microcosm withinthe life of the Macrocosm, but if you ventured outside that limited andmanifested Life (if that were possible, which it is not) you would contact otherLaws and other approaches to truth, existent on cosmic levels.There is little more that I can tell you anent the planetary initiations or—asthey might be more correctly called—the planetary initiatory processes. Theseaffect our entire planetary life but are not essentially initiations as weunderstand the term, or as that word could be applied to Sanat Kumara. They area definite part of cosmic process and particularly of solar evolution, but theyare, as we have seen, only preparatory to that initiation for which our worldwas made—the manifestation on Earth of the highest of the three aspects: theWILL of God, as it is universally called.THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE INITIATIONSWe now start our consideration of the nine initiations, only this time we shallbe occupied with the relationship and the detail connected with each initiation,[662] viewing them when possible from the angle of the Hierarchy and its efforton behalf of the evolutionary progress of the race, and not so much from theangle of the soul-infused personality of the disciple. It must be rememberedfrom the start that no disciple can pass through the initiatory experienceunless he is a soul-infused individual and is consciously aware on soul levelsof the various happenings, possibilities, undertakings and implications.In all the many books which I have given to the world I have taught much anentinitiation; I have sought to bring a saner, more reasonable presentation ofthese great crises in the life of every disciple. It is wise to note that aninitiation is in reality a crisis, a climaxing event, and is only truly broughtabout when the disciple has learnt patience, endurance and sagacity in emergingfrom the many preceding and less important crises. An initiation is aculminating episode, made possible because of the self-inspired discipline towhich the disciple has forced himself to conform.Much has been said in the occult books about the preparatory work to be done andthe effort which such a task entails, plus the realisation of the consequencesinitiated and expressing themselves through the individual aspirant. Little hasbeen said anent the more important truth that initiation admits a man into somearea or level of the divine consciousness—into a plane or rather a state ofbeing hitherto regarded as sealed and closed.I shall not touch upon the ray effects, because we have already considered them,and because each level of consciousness, each phase or revealed area of the“lighted Way” is open to souls on all the rays and to every type of initiate.From the standpoint of the Hierarchy, it is not the individual initiate who isof importance, but the groups in every land who face initiation, and who fallinto three categories:1. Those in the group who have caught the vision, who accept the fact of theHierarchy and of proffered opportunity, [663] but who are nevertheless quiteunready for their next step and must be taught and prepared to take it. Yet theyare “set apart for fulfillment,” as it is esoterically called, and in spite offluctuations and the many vicissitudes of the Path, they will eventually attaintheir goal.2. Those in preparation for some specific initiation, particularly the firstinitiation to the third (inclusive). They have set their hands to theplow—another way of saying symbolically that they are toiling for and servingtheir fellowmen.3. Those who have had the needed training and await the hour of initiation. As Ihave said, the first two initiations—those of the Birth and the Baptism—are notregarded by the Hierarchy as major initiations. They are in the nature ofinitiations of the threshold and are simply phases of, or preparatory to, thethird initiation (as occult students call it), which is in reality the firstmajor initiation. This must be most carefully held in mind, for theseinitiations indicate the process through which the personality can becomesoul-infused and the energy of the Spiritual Triad can make its presence felt.For the sake of clarity, however, and because the Birth and Baptism initiationshave been counted in with the true major initiations by the modern teachers oftheosophy and similar occult bodies, and because people are therefore accustomedso to consider them, we will preserve the old method of counting them. Thethought of soul-infusion must be held in mind—a soul-indwelling which culminatesat the third initiation, and of monadic control which increasingly possesses thesoul-infused personality. This higher possessiveness steadily increases from thetime of the third initiation until the seventh initiation; after the seventhinitiation a condition can be seen which is extra-planetary in nature and ofwhich little can be known. This brings in—for the first time—a registration orrecognition of cosmic consciousness.Let us now consider these initiations, one by one. [664]Initiation I. The Birth at BethlehemI have preserved the above Christian nomenclature because of its familiarity andbecause (symbolically speaking) it conveys an aspect of a major truth. Just asthe birth of a child is an entrance into light, literally speaking, and thebeginning of an entirely new way of life, so each successive initiation is in anexactly similar manner an entrance into light, involving the revelation of adifferent world to the one hitherto known, and the undergoing of entirely newexperiences. If students would keep this symbology and this definition carefullyin mind, they would arrive at a keener concept of the processes which lie aheadof them. This is particularly true in connection with this first initiation; theanalogy holds good from the very dawn of history, where humanity is considered.In ancient Lemuria, with the coming in of the mental idea and mechanism, the lowgrade animal life (which, to a certain extent, looked human but was definitelymindless, unknowing and unseeing) became suddenly aware of that which threwlight upon its way. It meant little to the animal men of those days, but it cameincreasingly to have significance as millennia of years elapsed; civilisationscame and went; races developed and disappeared. In Lemurian days , theindwelling light of perception (though it was a perception so remote from oursas to be practically inconceivable) revealed the physical world and that foundupon it which the human being of that time would deem desirable. Later, inAtlantean times, that same indwelling light and unfolding light of the mindserved to reveal the world of emotions, and in the later half of that period itrevealed the more aesthetic values; the arts began to flourish; colour andbeauty were registered. In our more modern Aryan race , the light has revealedthe world of thought and has brought us to a synthesis of the senses; thesesenses were developed in earlier cycles of human living. Each of these threeraces, in a mysterious manner, has a correspondence on a racial scale to thefirst three initiations.[665] Today, as we enter the new era, the symbology of the fourth initiation,that of the Renunciation, has application; men face the necessity of renouncingthe material values and of substituting the spiritual. The ferment of theinitiation process goes on all the time, undermining the materialism of the raceof men, revealing more and more of the reality underlying the phenomenal world(the only world recognised by the Lemurians) and—at the same time—providing thatcultural field of experience in which those sons of men who are ready to do socan undergo the five initiations, technically understood. This is the factor ofimportance. This, therefore, is our starting point.The historical process can (and will) reveal the gradual entrance of mankindinto ever-expanding “lighted areas” of consciousness; into these areas the wayof evolutionary unfoldment has led the race of men right up to the point wherethere are many, many thousands (and millions if you consider all ofhumanity—those in incarnation today and those that are out of incarnation uponthe inner planes) who have been enabled to step out of the lighted field of thethree worlds into another area where the light of the mind can be blended withthe still greater light of the soul. They have (in past lives, even thoughrecollection may be lacking) undergone the birth experience and initiation, andas a result of this, that which can reveal what the mind is unable to illumineis now developing and functioning within them. The “light of life” is nowavailable, in a sense far more literally true than you can at this timeperceive, and each successive initiation will see this fact more clearlydemonstrated. The Birth Initiation lies behind in the experience of many, andthis is factually proved by the lives of those who are consciously and willinglyoriented towards the light, who see a wider world than that of their own selfishinterests, who are sensitive to the Christ life and to the spiritualconsciousness in their fellowmen and who see an horizon and vistas of contactunperceived by the average man; they realise a possible spiritual achievement,unknown and undesired by those whose [666] lives are conditioned entirely byeither the emotions or the lower concrete mind. At this stage of unfoldment theyhave a sense of conscious dualism, knowing the fact of the existence of that“something other” than the phenomenal, emotional and mental self.The first initiation might be regarded as the goal and the reward of themystical experience ; it is fundamentally not an occult experience in the truesense of the term, for it is seldom accurately realised or consciously preparedfor, as is the case of the later initiations, and this is why the first twoinitiations are not considered major initiations. In the mystical realisationthere is naturally and normally an emphasis upon dualism, but in the new area ofunfoldment—visioned and later to be struggled for and attained, initiation byinitiation—unity is achieved and dualism disappears. Students should thereforehave in mind the following definite occult concept: The mystical Way leads tothe first initiation. Having achieved its purpose, it is then renounced, and the“lighted Way” of occultism is then followed, leading to the lighted areas of thehigher states of consciousness.Thus both ways are seen to be essential; the mystical way is for the majority atthis time, and an increasingly large number of mystics will emerge out of themodern masses of men; paralleling this, the occult way is attracting more andmore of the world intelligentsia. Its experience is not basically religious, asthe orthodox churchman understands the word. The way of science is as deeplyneeded by mankind as is the way of religion, for “God” is found equally on bothways. The scientific way leads the aspirant into the world of energies andforces, which is the true world of occult endeavour, revealing the UniversalMind and the workings of that great Intelligence which created the manifesteduniverse. The “new man” who has come to birth at the first initiation must andwill tread the occult or scientific way, which inevitably leads him out of theworld of mysticism into the scientific and assured perception of God as life orenergy.[667] The first initiation marks the beginning of a totally new life and mode ofliving; it marks the commencement of a new manner of thinking and of consciousperception. The life of the personality in the three worlds has for aeonsnurtured the germ of this new life and fostered the tiny spark of light withinthe relative darkness of the lower nature. This process is now being brought toa close, though it is not at this stage entirely discontinued, for the “new man”has to learn to walk, to talk, and to create; the consciousness is now, however,being focussed elsewhere. This leads to much pain and suffering until thedefinite choice is made, a new dedication to service is vouchsafed, and theinitiate is ready to undergo the Baptism Initiation.Members of the New Group of World Servers should watch with care for all thosewho show signs of having passed through the “birth” experience and should helpthem toward a greater maturity. They should assume that all those who truly lovetheir fellowmen, who are interested in the esoteric teaching, and who seek todiscipline themselves in order to attain greater beauty of life, are initiateand have undergone the first initiation. When they discover those who areseeking mental polarisation and who evidence a desire and aspiration to thinkand to know, coupled with the distinguishing marks of those who have taken thefirst initiation, they can, in all probability, safely assume that such peoplehave taken the second initiation or are on the verge of so doing. Their dutywill then be clear. It is by this close observation on the part of the worldservers that the ranks of the New Group are filled. Today, the opportunity andthe stimulation are so great that all servers must keep alert, developing inthemselves the ability to register the quality for which search must be made,and giving the help and guidance which will weld into one cooperative band thosedisciples and initiates who should prepare the way for the Christ.The first initiation should be regarded as instituting a new attitude towardsrelationships. This is not yet the case. The relationships hitherto recognised,speaking generally, [668] have been those karmically, physically and emotionallyinstituted; they are largely objective and predominantly concern the phenomenalplane with its contacts, duties, responsibilities and obligations. The newrelationships however, to be increasingly recognised, are subjective and mayhave but little phenomenal indication. They embrace the recognition of those whomust be served; they involve the expansion of the individual consciousness intoa growing group awareness; they lead eventually to an eager response tohierarchical quality and to the magnetic pull of the Ashram. Such a developmentin the recognition of relationships leads finally to a recognition of thePresence of the Christ and to relationship with Him. With the recognition of andthe relationship to the planetary Logos we need not at this point deal. Allthese relationships begin, in their truest connotation and with a correctlyrealised objective, at the birth of the “new man.” To this the Christ referredwhen He said: “Except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God.” Iam here using the Christian terminology but prefer to speak of the “new man”rather than the strictly Christian phrase “the birth of the Christ Child in theheart.” It is by means of the touchstone of relationships that world servers cancontact the initiates and the accepted disciples in the world, and can discoverthose aspirants who can be helped and trained.Let me bring another point to your attention. In the phenomenal world of theaverage human being who has not yet passed through the initiatory experience ofthe rebirth, the emphasis has ever been and is today upon the dual relationshipof the sexes and to this our novels, plays, movies and affairs of all men beartestimony. Creativity expresses itself mainly through the propagation of therace, brought about through the relation of male and female, or of the positiveand negative poles in the human family. This is right and good and part of thedivine Plan. Even though men have prostituted their capacities and debased theirrelationships, the basic plan is divine and ideal. After the first initiation,the entire sex relationship shifts gradually [669] and steadily into its properplace as simply a natural phase of existence in the three worlds and as one ofthe normal and correct appetites, but the emphasis changes. The higherexperience and correspondence, that of which physical sex is only the symbol,becomes apparent. Instead of male and female, there emerges the magneticrelationship between the now negative personality and the positive soul, withconsequent creativity upon the higher planes. Of this relationship the headcentre and the centre between the eyebrows (the ajna centre) are the agents andeventually—through the medium of the pituitary body and the pineal gland—theycondition the personality, rendering it soul-infused.I have given you so much information anent initiation and the rays and centresin my many books that there is no need for me to repeat it here; there is,however, great need for you to collect and tabulate the scattered information sothat you can register it as a whole. Many who read these instructions and whostudy the books I have written are in process of preparation for one or other ofthe initiations, and the entire theme should therefore be of major interest toyou. You should decide (at least tentatively) which initiation lies ahead of youand then discover all you possibly can about it and its prerequisites,endeavouring to make practical application of the imparted information; eitherthat which I give to you is true or it is not; if true, it is vital to yourfuture progress and you should aim at achieving a measure of real understanding.You have been taught that the activity or the inactivity of the centresconditions the personality, working through the endocrine system; the energieswhich the centres channel and the forces which they generate can be controlledand directed by the soul, by the spiritual man. You have likewise been told thatthe energy of the sacral centre (the centre most implicated and active at thetime of the first initiation) has to be transmuted and raised to the throatcentre, thereby transforming the physical creative act into the creative processof producing the good, [670] the beautiful and the true. This is the A B C ofyour fundamental knowledge: the transmutation of sex. In that transmutativeprocess men have greatly erred and have approached the subject from two angles:1. They have sought to stamp out natural desire and have endeavoured toemphasise an enforced celibacy; they have thus frequently warped the nature andsubjected the “natural man” to rules and regulations which were not of divineintent.2. They have tried—at the other extreme—to exhaust normal sexual desire bypromiscuity, license and perversions, damaging themselves and laying up thebasis for trouble for many incarnations ahead.True transmutation is in reality the achieving of a correct sense of proportionin relation to any phase of human life, and for the race of men today hasparticular reference to the sacral centre and the energies which bring it intoactivity. When a proper recognition of the place the sex life should play in thedaily life is paralleled by the concentration of thought anent the throatcentre, that centre becomes automatically magnetic and attracts the forces ofthe sacral centre upward through the spine into “the place of creativebuilding”; the normal sex life is then regulated and not atrophied, and isrelegated to its rightful place as one of the usual faculties or appetites withwhich man is endowed; it is brought under control through the lack of directedinterest and is subordinated to the law of the land as regards its relation toits opposite pole—either negative and feminine or masculine and positive. To theaspirant it becomes mainly the agent for the creation of the vehicles needed forreincarnating souls. Thus by force of example, by the avoiding of all extremes,by the dedication of the bodily energies to the higher uses, and by theacceptance of the law of the land in any given country and at any given time,the present disorder and the current misuse of the sex principle will give wayto orderly living and to the right use of this major bodily function.This regulated physical life comes about when the [671] personality issufficiently integrated and coordinated and the ajna centre (the centre betweenthe eyebrows) is active and is coming under the control of the soul. This has animmediate effect—automatically induced—upon the gland associated with thiscentre; it becomes a balanced part of the general endocrine system and pastimbalance is avoided. Simultaneously, the head centre becomes active as a resultof the aspirant's mental perception, meditation and service; this brings theallied gland, the pineal gland, into action. All this is again only the A B C ofoccultism.What is oft omitted from normal consideration is the fact that the increasingactivity of these two “points of light within the head” is basically related towhat is occurring in the sacral and throat centres, as the transmutative processproceeds and the energies of the sacral centre are gathered up into the throatcentre—without, however, withdrawing all the energy from the lower centre; thusits normal activity is properly preserved. The two centres in the head thenbecome correspondingly active; the negative and the positive elements affecteach other, and the light in the head shines forth; a line of light, permittingfree interplay, is established between the ajna centre and the head centre, andtherefore between the pituitary body and the pineal gland. When this line oflight is present and there is an unobstructed relation between the two centresand the two glands, then the first initiation becomes possible. When this takesplace, it must not be inferred that the task of transmutation going on betweenthe lower and the higher centres and the relationship between the two headcentres is fully and finally completed and established. The line of light isstill tenuous and unstable, but it is in existence. It is the energy let looseat the first initiation and distributed into the sacral and the throat centres(via the slowly awakening head centre) which brings the transmutation process toa successful conclusion and stabilises the relationship within the head. Thisprocess may take several lives of steadily intensifying effort on the part ofthe initiate-disciple.[672] Thus the work of magical reformation starts, and it is here that theinfluence of the seventh ray (which governs the first initiation) enters in; oneof the functions of this ray is to bring together soul and body, the higher andthe lower, life and form, spirit and matter. This is the creative taskconfronting the disciple who is engaged in lifting the energies of the sacralcentre to the throat centre and of establishing a right relation between thepersonality and the soul. Just as the antahkarana has to be constructed andestablished as a bridge of light between the Spiritual Triad and thesoul-infused personality, so a similar bridge or correspondence is establishedbetween the soul and the personality, and, in connection with the mechanism ofthe disciple, between the two head centres and the two glands within the head.When that line of light has related the higher spiritual aspects and the lower,and when the sacral centre and the throat centre are in true related alignment,the initiate-disciple becomes a creative worker under the divine Plan and a“magical exponent” of the divine building work; he is then a constructive force,wielding energy consciously on the physical plane. He creates forms asexpressions of reality. This is the true work of magic.You can see, therefore, that in the creative work three energies are broughtinto a related activity:1. The energy concentrated in the ajna centre and which is indicative of thepersonality life.2. The energy concentrated in the head centre as a result of soul activity.3. The energy of the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Order or Magic, making possibletrue creative activity under the divine Plan.There is nothing spectacular to be told anent the first initiation; theinitiate-disciple still works in the dimly lit “cave of the spiritual birth”; hehas to continue his struggle to reveal divinity, primarily on the physicalplane—symbolised for us in the word “Bethlehem” which means the “house ofbread”; he has to learn the dual function of [673] “lifting up the lowerenergies into the light” and—at the same time—of “bringing down the higherenergies into bodily expression.” Thus he becomes a white magician.At this initiation he sees, for the first time, what are the major energieswhich he must bring into expression, and this vision is summed up for him in theOld Commentary in the following words:“When the Rod of Initiation descends and touches the lower part of the spine,there is a lifting up; when the eyes are opened in the light, that which must belowered into form is now perceived. The vision is acknowledged. The burden ofthe future is assumed. The cave is lighted up and the new man issues forth.”That this may be true of all of you who read these words is the prayer and thewish of your friend and counsellor.Initiation II. The Baptism in JordanThe initiation which we are now to study is perhaps one of the most important,because it concerns that aspect of the personality which gives the mostdifficulty to everybody: the emotional or astral body. Today the mass of men areswept by the emotions and by a sensitive response to circumstance; they are notswept usually by an intelligent reaction to life as it is . The normal andusually violent reaction serves only to increase the confusion and the attendingdifficulties, producing vortices of uncontrolled energies, glamour and delusion.Even though it may at the same time produce a saving aspect in some cases, theviolence of the astral testing and the potency of the astral temptation (as itmight well be called) leads to a greatly increased sphere of suffering. To thismust be added the materialistic bias of the many presented solutions, bringingin the force of the world maya and thus greatly complicating the problem.Distressing as all this may be, and significant of the end of this age and thecessation of the Atlantean vibration and quality which has carried over sopotently into [674] this Aryan cycle, it is however indicative of the attainmentof a definitely racial opportunity. Humanity—on a relatively large scale—facesthe second initiation, or the Baptism Initiation.The concept of baptism is ever associated with that of purification. Water hasever been the symbol of that which purifies; it is also the symbol of the astralplane, with its instability, its storms, its tranquillities, its overwhelmingemotional reactions and its pliability, which makes it such a good agent for thedeceptive thought-forming faculties of the unregenerate man. It reacts to everyimpulse, every desire and every possible magnetic “pull” coming from thematerial or substantial form side of nature. In its cycles of tranquillity itreflects equally the good as well as the bad; it is the agent, therefore, ofdeception when manipulated by the Black Lodge, or of aspirational reaction wheninfluenced by the great White Lodge, the spiritual Hierarchy of our planet. Itis the battleground between the pairs of opposites; the problem is complicatedby the fact that men have to learn to recognise these opposites before rightchoice, leading to spiritual victory, is theirs.Today, desire for peace at any price, for adequate food, warmth and housing, forthe restoration of stability and security and for the cessation of anxietycontrols the mass of human reactions and makes the astral plane loom so large inmen's affairs and in world decisions. This is so dominantly so that therealisation which the mind could reveal and of which the intelligentsia are thecustodians is lost to sight and has small influence.At the third initiation the control of the soul-illumined mind is finallyestablished, and the soul itself assumes the dominant position and not thephenomenal form. All the limits of the form nature are then transcended. It isthe vision of this transcendence which is communicated at the time of the secondinitiation under the symbolism of a positively applied purification.I am not here emphasising the Biblical account of that purificatory process.That summarised symbolically [675] the watery nature of the astral plane and the“washing by water” of the initiate. It expressed the purely Atlantean form ofthe initiatory process, giving us the concept of a descent into water and ofascent out of water in response to a Word of Power from on high. The Aryanapproach to this same initiation has not yet been fully understood.This second initiation—as now undergone—is to some extent one of the mostdifficult. It involves purification, but it is purification by fire,symbolically understood. The occult “application of fire to water” producescertain most serious and devastating results. The water, under the action offire, “is resolved into steam and the initiate is immersed in the fogs andmiasmas, the glamours and the mists” thus caused. Out of this fog and out of theglamours, the initiate must emerge; out of the present fog of human affairshumanity will also emerge eventually. The success of the individual initiate isthe guarantee of the racial destiny. The complications, produced by water inconjunction with fire in these Aryan days, are far greater than those producedentirely by water in Atlantean times; this age is kama-manasic and not simplykamic or strictly astral. Remember therefore as you read these words that I amspeaking symbolically. The fire of mind today has to be reckoned with inconjunction with the water of desire, and it is owing to this that much ofhumanity's problem develops. It is because of this that the second initiationhas become one of the most difficult which the modern disciple has to take.The result, however, of the modern initiatory process is of a much higher order.This statement is related to the emerging fact that the Hierarchy and itspersonnel in process of assembling will be of a much higher order than thatpreviously responsible for human guidance. A more advanced humanity demands amore advanced Hierarchy and hierarchical supervision; this has ever been thecase. The evolutionary process covers all that is. Even Sanat Kumara is learningand advancing from a relative imperfection to perfection.This baptism of fire (to which reference is made in [676] the WesternScriptures) carries with it inevitably the connotation of pain, and this to anextent hitherto unknown. Even a casual glance at world affairs will reveal thetruth of this statement.What, therefore, is really happening, and what are the major facts involved?Much will depend upon my answer and upon your interpretation of it. I would askyou consequently to give careful consideration to my reply to these twoquestions.Under the influence of the Piscean cycle which is now in process of termination,the sixth Ray of Idealism or Devotion was predominantly active. This is the rayof one-pointed determination and—from one angle—it is the ray of blindprocedure. The individual, the group or humanity, sees only one aspect ofreality at any one time, and (because of man's present point in the evolutionaryprocess) usually the least desirable aspect. All else is sealed to them; theyvision only one picture; their horizon is limited to only one point of thecompass (speaking esoterically). To the mass of humanity, the aspect of realitywhich was visioned and for which men lived and died was the material world,material comfort, material possessions and material enterprises; to this thelabour movement today and the tendencies already apparent in the United Nationsbear incontrovertible testimony. To a much smaller group of human beings theworld of the intelligence appears paramount, and the concrete mind is thedesired ruler or controlling factor. All, therefore, remains within the area ofmaterial control and interest.The solar plexus centre is consequently the dominant factor, because—even in thecase of the intelligentsia—it is desire for material well-being, for territorialpossessions and for planned governmental and economic material decisions whichcontrol and motivate the individual, the group or the nation. These are notnecessarily wrong, but (under the present emotional-desire concept) they areplaced in the foremost position and are regarded as causal in their nature;nevertheless they are fundamentally secondary [677] in their nature, and areeffectual in their essential nature, placing the emphasis upon the word“effect.” Humanity, even in its advanced brackets, is not yet able to think oncausal levels.What is the basic goal of the initiate who has taken the second initiation? Iwould ask you to transit in consciousness from the concept that the process ofinitiation is a consummation of effort, to the higher and better concept that itis initiatory in effect and marks a beginning and not a consummation. What,therefore, lies ahead of the initiate who has entered the purificatory water, orrather, fire? To what is he pledged? What is to happen within “the area oflivingness” (I want you to familiarise yourselves with that phrase) and whatresults will take place within the mechanism with which he approaches the placeof initiation? These are the factors of importance, and these are the aspects ofthe life process which should condition him. At the close of the initiatoryprocess certain energies and divine aspects should be recognised by him as nowplaying a part in his thinking and his purposes—energies which heretofore (evenif present) were quiescent and not controlling.Before him lies the third Initiation of the Transfiguration. Facing him is agreat transition from an emotional aspirational focus to an intelligent,thinking focus. He has, theoretically at least, cast off the control of theastral body and nature; much still remains to be done; old desires, ancientastral reactions and habitual emotions are still powerful, but he has developeda new attitude to them and a new perspective to the astral body. Water, fire,steam, glamour, delusion, misinterpretation and emotional continuity still meansomething specific and undesirable to him. He is now negative to their appealand positive to the higher demanding focus. That which he now loves and longsfor, desires and plans for, lies in another and higher dimension. He has,through his willingness to pass through the second initiation, struck the firstblow at his innate selfishness and has demonstrated his determination to think[678] in wider and more inclusive terms. The group begins to mean more to himthan himself.What has happened, technically speaking? The energies of the solar plexus centreare being transferred from the major clearing house below the diaphragm to theheart centre—one of the three major centres into which all the lower energiesmust transfer. At the first initiation he was granted a vision of a highercreativity and the energy of the sacral centre began its slow ascent to thethroat centre. At the second initiation, he is granted a vision of a higherfocus, and his place in the larger whole begins slowly to reveal itself. A newcreativity and a new focus become his immediate goals, and for him life cannever again be the same. The old physical attitudes and desires may still attimes assume control; selfishness may continue to play a potent part in his lifeexpression, but—underlying these and subordinating them—will be found a deepdissatisfaction about things as they are and an agonising realisation offailure. It is at this point that the disciple begins to learn the uses offailure and to know certain fundamental distinctions between that which isnatural and objective and that which is supernatural and subjective.Do these ideas make the concept of initiation more useful to you and morepractical? Any initiation which does not find interpretation in daily reactionsis of small service and basically unreal. It is the unreality of itspresentation which has led to the rejection of the Theosophical Society as anagent of the Hierarchy at this time. Earlier and prior to its ridiculousemphasis upon initiation and initiates, and prior to its recognition of theprobationary disciples as full initiates, the Society did good work. It howeverfailed to recognise mediocrity and to realise that no one “takes” initiation andpasses through these crises without a previous demonstration of a wideusefulness and of a trained intelligent capacity. This may not be the case wherethe first initiation is concerned, but where the second initiation is involvedthere must ever be the background of a useful dedicated life and an expresseddetermination [679] to enter the field of world service. There must also behumility and a voiced realisation of the divinity in all men. To theserequirements, the so-called initiate of the Theosophical Society (with theexception of Mrs. Besant) did not conform. I would not call attention to theirprideful demonstration, were it not that the same claims are being made and thesame delusions presented to the public.The problem of freedom from the limitations of matter should now be consideredand the entire theme be rendered practical.There is perhaps an ultimate opinion that it is the realm of the emotions andthe susceptibility to emotional reactions which constitute the major humanlimitation—both from the individual angle and also from that of the nationalangle. It is everywhere realised that the demagogue, for instance, who swayspublic opinion, is one who also and emphatically plays on human emotions as wellas upon human selfishness. As the race progresses towards mental expression,this distorting influence will become increasingly less important, and once themasses (composed of the millions of so-called “men in the street”) begindefinitely to think, the power of the demagogic approach will have disappeared.The major battle in the world today is that of the freedom of the averagecitizen to think for himself and to come to his own decisions and conclusions.It is here that the major quarrel between the Great White Lodge and the BlackLodge is to be found. It is a battle in which humanity itself is the decisivefactor, and for this reason the Black Lodge is working through the group whichis controlling the destiny of Russia and also through the Zionist movement. Theleaders of the U.S.S.R. are working intelligently and potently against humanfreedom and particularly against freedom of thought. Communism per se has nosuch objective; it is the totalitarian policies of the national rulers which areso disastrous, plus their ambition and their hatred of true freedom. Zionismtoday stands for aggression and for the use of force, and the keynote ispermission to take what you want irrespective [680] of other people or of theirinalienable rights. These points of view are against the position of thespiritual leaders of humanity, and therefore the leaders of the Zionistmovement, and the group of men who direct and control the policies of Russia,are against the policies of the spiritual Hierarchy and are contrary to thelasting good of mankind.The freedom of the human spirit, the freedom to think, govern and worship asinnate, human, instinctual human desire may dictate, under the influence of theevolutionary process, the liberty to decide on the required form of governmentor of religion—these are the rightful prerogatives of mankind. Any group of menor any form of government which fails to recognise this inherent right runscounter to the principle which governs the Great White Lodge. The menace toworld freedom today lies in the known policies of the rulers of the U.S.S.R. andin the devious and lying machinations of the Zionists. In neither group is thereany true spiritual potency, and both are doomed to failure even though they maysucceed from the angle of material gain; from the spiritual angle, they aredoomed. The leaders of the Russian enterprise against the freedom of theindividual are doomed, because inherently man is free and fundamentally divine,and it is assured (from the long range vision) that masses of men in Russia andin the communistically inclined “satellite states” will inevitably reactdivinely and potently. The true communistic platform is sound; it is brotherhoodin action and it does not—in its original platform—run counter to the spirit ofChrist. The imposition of intellectual and formal communism by a group ofambitious and sometimes evil men is not sound; it does not adhere to the truecommunistic platform, but is based on personal ambitions, love of power and oninterpretations of the writings of Lenin and Marx which are also personal andrun counter to the meaning of these two men, just as the theologians of theChurch interpret the words of Christ in a fashion which has no relation to Hisoriginal intention. The rulers of Russia are not truly working for the good ofthe people, any more [681] than academic Zionism is working and carrying out itsprojects for any humanitarian reasons. But the people hold the ultimate triumphin their hands, for the heart of the people in all nations is basically sound,fundamentally good and God-inclined. This the rulers of the communistic regimeforget.The leaders of the Zionist movement of aggression constitute a real danger toworld peace and human development and their activities have been endorsed by theexpediency policy of the U.S.A. and, in a secondary degree, by Great Britain,under the influence of the U.S.A. It is the Zionists who have defied the UnitedNations, lowered its prestige and made its position both negative and negligibleto the world. It is the Zionists who have perpetrated the major act ofaggression since the formation of the United Nations, and who were clever enoughto gain the endorsement of the United Nations, turning the original“recommendation” of the United Nations into an order. The rule of force, ofaggression and of territorial conquest by force of arms is demonstrated today bythe Zionists in Palestine, as well as the demonstration of the power of money topurchase governments. These activities run counter to all the plans of thespiritual Hierarchy and mark a point of triumph of the forces of evil. I amemphasising the activities of these two countries because through the leaders ofthese groups of aggressive men the forces of evil—dammed back temporarily by thedefeat of the evil group which Hitler gathered around him—have again organisedtheir attack on the spiritual development of humanity.The world today still remains divided into people of evil intention and greatpower and their victims, plus the negative reactions of the remaining nations.There is no nation in the United Nations which has attempted to swing the tideof evil by ranging itself and other nations on the side of freedom. There areonly groups of unillumined men who seek to control national destinies. There isstill emotional reaction to situations and the emotional exploitation ofindividuals and nations by those who are in [682] no way emotional but who arementally convinced that certain lines of activity must be followed, leading totheir own individual good but which—in the long run—are not good for the peoplesinvolved.We therefore come back to the problems of the astral plane, of the emotionallevel of consciousness, and to the second initiation; this initiation releasesmen from emotional control and enables them to shift their consciousness on tomental levels, and from that higher point of focus to control their normal andwell developed emotional attitudes.If you will turn back to page 340, you will find that the three keynotes aregiven for this second initiation and for its technique. I would like to callyour attention to them because they present those keynotes which give us theclue to the world problems and indicate at the same time the solution and theway out of the present impasse. These three words are: Dedication. Glamour.Devotion.It is the dedication of the aspirant which invokes the fire. You have here astatement of major importance. The aspirant upon the higher levels of the astralplane is swept by the “fire of dedication.” This immediately focusses his willas it demonstrates on the mental plane, and this focussing in due time startsthe serious undertaking of the shifting of his consciousness on to mentallevels. Then immediately the “fire” works, and the first reaction (as I haveearlier pointed out) is the “meeting of fire and water,” and consequently theproduction of fog, mist, of glamour and illusion. All of these four words mustbe understood symbolically. The glamours thus induced are dependent upon the rayand the point of evolution of the individual and the nation. It is essentialthat you learn to think in the widest possible terms. With these I shall notdeal. Individuals are rapidly discovering the nature of their glamours, oncetheir “spiritual intention” is determined; also national glamour is wellrecognised by onlookers, though seldom yet by the nations involved. The factorwhich leads to the dissipation of glamour is devotion—devotion to an [683]individual, to a Master (as taught by the Theosophical Society) or to someidealistic project. It is finally an unlimited devotion to the Way, to thetreading of the Path at any cost, and to the unswerving attachment to service—asconstituting the major technique of the Path.Dedication, resulting in glamour, which is dissipated by devotion—these are thekeynotes of the second initiation. Forget not that nationalism is the result ofdedication to a particular national set-up and produces the glamours which leadto world difficulty.These three aspects of evolutionary unfoldment must be recognised by everyaspirant; their existence determines his place upon the Path, the initiation forwhich he is being prepared and the nature of his service for humanity.And what will be the result of the combination in one's life of these threefactors? Primarily two things:1. The solar plexus centre will be brought, first of all, into a condition ofalmost violent and compelling activity. This activity is induced by dedicationand produces glamour inevitably.2. The violent energies of the solar plexus centre will eventually be controlledby the quality of devotion. It is this quality which transforms the solar plexuscentre into the great clearing house for all emotional reactions and for allglamours, and makes it temporarily a cause of disaster, of conflict, of pain andof distress.As a result of both of these, a great transforming agency is set in motion bythe quality of devotion, and the solar plexus centre becomes not only a clearinghouse but the main factor in lifting both physical and emotional active energiesfrom below the diaphragm into the heart centre. This constitutes a long processwhich the aspirant is forced to face in the interim between initiations. We aretold (and it is factually true) that the longest period between initiations isthat to be found between the first and the second initiations. This is a truthwhich must be faced, but it should also be remembered that it is by no means thehardest period. The hardest period for the sensitive, feeling [684] aspirant isto be found between the second and the third initiations.It is a period of intense suffering, of the penalty of applying factors ofglamour and illusion, of pronounced involvement in situations which, for a longtime, remain unclarified, and of a steady moving forward as best the beleagueredaspirant can—under the influence of right direction and spiritual determination.This he has usually to do in the dark, working under the action of the logicaland understanding mind, but seldom under the influence of inspiration.Nevertheless, the good work goes on. The emotions are brought under control, andnecessarily the factor of the mind assumes an increasingly right importance.Light—flickering and as yet uncertain and unpredictable—pours occasionally infrom the soul, via the mind, adding frequently to the complications butproducing eventually the needed control which will lead to and result infreedom.Ponder on these things. Freedom is the keynote of the individual who is facingthe second initiation and its aftermath—preparation for the third initiation.Freedom is the keynote for the world disciple today, and it is freedom to live,freedom to think and freedom to know and plan, which humanity demands at thistime.The initiation (that of the Transfiguration) which we are next to study is oneof the most important of them all. From one particular angle, it is peculiarlyrelated to the fifth Initiation of Revelation and to the seventh Initiation ofResurrection. All three are concerned with freedom: freedom from thepersonality, freedom from blindness, or freedom from all the seven planes of ourplanetary existence—the planes which are sometimes referred to as the planes ofhuman and superhuman evolution. You will have noted that lately I have beenemphasising an aspect of initiation hitherto little emphasised—the aspect offreedom. The Path of Initiation has at times been called the Path of Liberation,and it is to this essential aspect of the initiatory process that I am seekingto call your attention. I have [685] pointed out continuously that initiation isnot really the curious mixture of self-satisfied attainment, ceremonial, andhierarchical recognition as portrayed by the major occult groups. It is far morea process of excessively hard work, during which process the initiate becomeswhat he is. This may entail hierarchical recognition, but not in the formusually pictured. The initiate finds himself in the company of those who havepreceded him, and he is not rejected but is seen and noted and then put to work.It is also a graded series of liberations, resulting in the attainment ofincreased freedom from that which lies behind in his experience; this carrieswith it the permission (soul enjoined or given) to proceed further on the WAY.These freedoms are the result of Detachment, Dispassion, and Discrimination. Atthe same time Discipline enforces and makes possible the hard work required topass the grade. All these four techniques (for that is what they are) arepreceded by a series of disillusionments which, when realised and comprehended,leave the aspirant no choice but to move forward into greater light.I would like to have you study initiation from the angle of liberation, lookingupon it as a process of strenuously attained freedoms. This basic aspect ofinitiation—when realised by the initiate—ties his experience into a firmrelation with that of the whole of humanity, whose fundamental struggle is theattainment of that freedom “whereby the soul and its powers can unfold and allmen be free because of an individually attained freedom.”If you will study the nine initiations and look upon them from this angle, youwill see how each does most definitely mark a point of attainment, and thereforethe entire subject of initiation takes on a new beauty and appears more worthyof the pain and struggle of attainment. Let me give you an indication (no morethan that) of what I mean.> Initiation I. Birth. Freedom from the control of the physical body and its> appetites.> Initiation II. Baptism .

One of the most spiritually exciting things taking place in the worldtoday is the use, in every country, of the word FREEDOM; it was that greatdisciple, F. D. Roosevelt, who “anchored” the word in a new and more universalsense. It now has a fuller and deeper meaning to humanity.Initiation III. The TransfigurationThere is no need for me to enter into the symbolic details anent thisinitiation. The whole theme is adequately dealt with in a book written by A.A.B.entitled From Bethlehem to Calvary —a book to which I gave my approval andendorsement as presenting the subject of the five initiations in a form suitablefor the Christian West. I would like to recall to you the fact that this thirdinitiation is in reality the first of the major initiations and is so regardedby the emanating Source of our planetary Logos, Sanat Kumara, and in the twogreat planetary centres, Shamballa and the Hierarchy. I refer to that stupendousSource of our entire planetary life, the sun Sirius, and to the Lodge of DivineBeings Who work from this heavenly Centre.The first two initiations—regarded simply as initiations of the threshold—areexperiences which have prepared the body of the initiate for the reception ofthe terrific voltage of this third initiation. This voltage is passed throughthe body of the initiate under the direction of the planetary Logos, before Whomthe initiate stands for the first time. The Rod of Initiation is used as thetransferring agent. The second initiation freed the initiate from the astral[688] level of consciousness, the astral plane—the plane of glamour, of illusionand of distortion. This was an essential experience because the initiate(standing before the One Initiator for the first time at the third initiation)must be freed from any magnetic or attractive “pull” emanating from thepersonality.The mechanism of the personality must be so purified and so insensitive to thematerial attractions of the three worlds that there is henceforth nothing in theinitiate which could offset the divine initiatory activity. The physicalappetites are subdued and relegated to their rightful place; the desire natureis controlled and purified; the mind is responsive primarily to ideas,intuitions and impulses coming from the soul, and begins its true task as aninterpreter of divine truth and a transmitter of ashramic intention.You will note, therefore, how this third initiation is a climaxing point andalso inaugurates a new cycle of activity leading to the seventh Initiation ofResurrection. I would call your attention to the fact that the third, fifth andseventh initiations are under the control of the fifth, first and second rays.These, as you might expect, will constitute the emanating energies transmittedthrough the application of the Rod of Initiation.Initiation III. The fifth Ray of Science. This inflowing energy produces itsmajor effects upon the mind, or upon manas, the fifth principle; it enables theinitiate to use the mind as its major instrument in the work to be done, priorto passing through the fourth and fifth initiations.Initiation V. The first Ray of Will or Power. At this initiation the discipleappreciates for the first time the significance of the will and uses it torelate the head centre and the centre at the base of the spine, thus completingthe integration started at the third initiation.Initiation VII. The second Ray of Love-Wisdom is here active, as the majorplanetary ray. The application of the Rod of Initiation by the Initiator(working this time from the highest plane, the logoic plane) produces in a [689]mysterious way an effect on the totality of humanity and—to a lesser extent—uponthe allied kingdoms. The effect is similar to that produced in the individual atthe fifth initiation, wherein the head centre and the centre at the base of thespine became closely en rapport—through the use of the will.Aspirants and disciples should remember that after the third initiation, theeffects of the initiation which they may be undergoing are not confined simplyto the individual initiate, but that henceforth at all the later initiations hebecomes the transmitter of the energy which will pour through him withincreasing potency at each application of the Rod. He acts primarily as an agentfor the transmission, for the stepping down and for the consequent safedistribution of energy to the masses. Each time a disciple achieves aninitiation and stands before the Initiator, he becomes simply an instrumentwhereby the planetary Logos can reach humanity and bring to men fresh life andenergy. The work done prior to and at the third initiation is purely preparatoryto this type of service required from an “energy transmitter.” That is why, atthe seventh initiation, the dominating ray of our planet—the second Ray ofLove-Wisdom—is employed. There is no energy upon our planet of equal potency,and no expression of it has so pure and constructive a quality as that to whichthe initiate is subjected at the seventh initiation. This seventh initiatoryclimax marks another culminating point in the career of the initiate, andindicates his entrance into an entirely different cycle of experience.You will have noted, if you are comparing these instructions with the outlinegiven by me on page 340, that in this third initiation it is the ajna centre(the centre between the eyebrows) which is stimulated. This is a fact of greatinterest, because it is at this initiation that the disciple begins consciouslyand creatively to direct the energies being made available to him, doing so viathe ajna centre and directed towards humanity as a whole. These energies are:[690]1. The energy of his own soul. This has a purely group effect and though workingthrough his personality, is consciously directed outward into the world—afterthe transforming process brought about as the energy received permeates histhreefold mechanism.2. The energy of the Ashram to which he belongs. Both this energy and the oneabove mentioned are necessarily the energy of his soul ray and of the Ashramwhich is representative of that ray. The effect produced—according to hiscapacity of absorption and direction—will further the working out of the divinePlan.3. The energy of the Hierarchy Itself. The Hierarchy is primarily controlled bythe energy of the second Ray of Love-Wisdom, though this dominant ray ismodified and enriched through blending with the other six rays. His use of thisenergy will at first be largely an unconscious use and he will register at thispoint no definite intention. This is due to the magnitude of the great reservoirof energies; he is a recipient of the incoming energy largely because he is aninitiated member of the Hierarchy and is also a pure channel for transmission.4. The peculiar energy which is transmitted to him by Sanat Kumara at the timeof his initiation. This is a totally different energy to that transmitted to himat the earlier initiations. It comes from Shamballa and is uniquely (in a senseundefinable and hence incomprehensible to you) the energy of the planetary LogosHimself. He directs extra-planetary energy (in the initiations which follow thethird initiation) from the ajna centre of which He is possessed, to the headcentre of the initiate and from thence immediately to the ajna centre of theinitiate. Then this energy is directed outward into its destined field ofservice. This energy is of so high a quality that there is nothing of aregistering mechanism in the initiate's equipment capable of registering itsadmission and circulation through his three head centres. Nevertheless, thisenergy does pour through him and out into the world, in spite of the fact thathe remains unconscious of its presence.[691] The ajna centre is the “centre of direction”; it is placed symbolicallybetween the two eyes, signifying the twofold direction of the life energy of theinitiate—outward into the world of men and upward towards the divine Life andSource of all Being. Where the direction of the energy is consciously undertaken(and there are certain energies of which the initiate is constantly aware), theajna centre is controlled and dominated by the indwelling spirit of man; thisspiritual man bases all action in relation to these entering energies on theancient premise that “energy follows thought.” His thought life becomes,therefore, the field of his major effort, for he knows that the mind is theagent of direction; he endeavours to concentrate within himself so thateventually he may consciously control and direct all the incoming divineenergies. This is, in reality, the major hierarchical endeavour and the work towhich the Masters are pledged and for which They are in constant training. Asthe evolutionary process proceeds, new and higher energies become available.This is particularly the case now, as They prepare for the reappearance of theChrist.There are three words which are directive words for the disciple as he handleshis life, his environment and his circumstances. They are: Integration,Direction, Science. His task—as he faces it after the third initiation—is toproduce a greater personal integration so that he becomes increasingly asoul-infused personality, and also to integrate himself with his environment forservice purposes. To this must be added the subtler task of integrating himselfinto the Ashram so that he becomes an integral part of the Master's band ofworkers.As the work of integration proceeds, he is striving all the time to learn theuses of the ajna centre and consciously and with right understanding to workwith, absorb, transmute and distribute energy as his major ashramic service. Hiskeynote is right direction as the result of right reaction to hierarchicalintention and the injunctions of his own soul. Both integration and direction,he discovers, require [692] understanding of occult, scientific knowledge. Heworks then as a scientist, and for this reason all the three keynotes of hislife as an initiate—before and immediately after the third initiation—areconditioned by and directed by the mind; the mental plane becomes the field ofhis major endeavour as a server.Again you see that I am presenting you with no glamorous picture of theinitiatory process but only one of hard work, constant effort and strenuousmental and spiritual living. There is much here for you to consider, and what Ihave here given warrants sound reflection and much thought. It is my earnesthope and wish that you may realise that the teaching here given can beappropriated by you and that the initiatory process is one that eventually youwill understand and in which you will participate.Initiation IV. The Great Renunciation or CrucifixionThis initiation of renunciation (called “The Crucifixion” by Christianbelievers) is so familiar to the majority of people that I am hard put to it tosay that which will arrest your attention, and thus offset a familiarity whichnecessarily lessens the importance of the theme in your consciousness. The ideaof crucifixion is associated in your minds with death and torture, whereasneither concept underlies the true meaning. Let us consider some of thesignificances connected with this fourth initiation.The sign of the Cross—associated in the Western world with this initiation andwith the Christian faith—is in reality a cosmic symbol, long ante-dating theChristian era. It is one of the major signs to be found in the consciousness ofThose advanced Beings Who, from the distant sun, Sirius, the seat of the trueGreat White Lodge, watch over the destinies of our solar system, but Who payparticular attention (why They do so is not yet revealed) to our relativelylittle and apparently unimportant planet, the Earth.The word “crucifixion” comes from two Latin words signifying to “fix on a cross”(I have asked A.A.B. to look this word up in the dictionary so that you can havea sense [693] of surety). The cross referred to in reference to this particularinitiation is the Cardinal Cross of the heavens. It is to this cross that thedisciple shifts at the fourth initiation, from the Fixed Cross of the heavens .This fixed cross is the one on which he has been crucified from the moment hefound himself upon the Path of Probation and passed from thence on to the Pathof Discipleship. On that Path—having transcended the world of phenomena andestablished an unbroken contact with the Monad, via the antahkarana—he renouncesthe Mutable Cross of existence in the three worlds (the world of appearances),and after a period of time he transfers from that cross on to the Fixed Cross,which is set up in the world of meaning where he has steadily learnt to dwell.This covers the period of the first three initiations. Now, being liberatedthrough renunciation, he needs no longer to undergo the tests, trials, anddifficulties which crucifixion on the Fixed Cross inevitably entails; he can nowtake his place upon the Cardinal Cross, with all its cosmic implications andopportunities which are then conferred. This—as far as the individual isconcerned—is necessarily symbolic and figurative in its teaching. As far as theHeavenly Man is concerned, however, the application is not symbolic. It is farmore factual. From the angle of the supreme Masters on Sirius, our planetaryLogos, Sanat Kumara, is still on the Fixed Cross; He mounted the Mutable Crossin the first solar system; the Fixed Cross still holds Him in this solar system“fixed in His place”; in the next solar system, He will transfer Himself to theCardinal Cross, and from “thence return to that High Place from whence He came.”You can see, therefore, why I emphasise the fact that these three crosses aresimply symbols of experience in relation to the individual disciple. Let usconsider this a little more closely:1. The Mutable Cross governs the three worlds and the astral plane inparticular. On this cross the average man is “crucified” until he achieves theneeded experience and consciously reorients himself to another phase ofunfoldment. [694]2. The Fixed Cross governs the five worlds of human development and conditionsthe experiences of all disciples. Through the discipline and the experiencesthus gained whilst on this cross, the disciple passes from one renunciation toanother until complete freedom and liberation has been achieved.3. The Cardinal Cross governs the Master as He passes through the remaining fiveinitiations; the fourth initiation is, curiously enough, governed by neither theFixed Cross nor the Cardinal Cross. The disciple is descending from the FixedCross and seeking to mount the Cardinal Cross, and it is this transition periodand experience which practically govern Him. It might therefore be noted thatthere are three initiations which test the disciple as to knowledge andexperience: the first, the second and the third; then there comes an initiationof transition, followed by five initiations which the Master undergoes upon theCardinal Cross.It should be remembered that the distinctive nature of the man upon the MutableCross is that of self-consciousness; that the disciple upon the Fixed Cross israpidly becoming group conscious when the experiences undergone have beenrightly assimilated; and that the Master on the Cardinal Cross is distinguishedby a universal consciousness which passes finally into cosmic consciousness—astate of being unknown to you, even in the wildest flights of your imagination.The first hint of the growth of cosmic consciousness comes when the disciplepasses through the sixth Initiation of Decision. He determines then (by means ofHis enlightened will and not His mind) which of the seven Paths He will decideto follow. From that time on, the consciousness of the greater Life whichenfolds our planetary Logos, as He enfolds humanity within His consciousness,increasingly controls the attitude, the awareness and the activities of theMaster.You can see, therefore, how this initiation of crucifixion (which the Christianworld has appropriated for itself) is far vaster in its implications thanstudents suspect. [695] Yet this appropriation was intentional under the divinePlan of the Hierarchy, for always some great Teacher—by His life andteaching—will call attention to some particular initiation. The Buddha, forinstance, in His Four Noble Truths, stated in reality the platform upon whichthe initiate of the third initiation takes his stand. He desires nothing of apersonal nature; he is liberated from the three worlds. The Christ pictured forus and emphasised the fourth initiation with its tremendous transition from theFixed Cross to the Mount of Ascension, symbol of transition, through initiation.This crucifixion initiation has a major instructive feature. This is preservedfor us in the name which is frequently given to this fourth initiation: theGreat Renunciation. One tremendous experience is vouchsafed to the initiate atthis time; he realises (because he sees and knows) that the antahkarana has beensuccessfully completed and that there is a direct line of energy from theSpiritual Triad, via the antahkarana, to his mind and brain. This brings to theforefront of his consciousness the sudden and appalling recognition that thesoul itself, the egoic body on its own level, and that which for ages has beenthe supposed source of his existence and his guide and mentor, is no longerneeded; his relation, as a soul-infused personality, is now directly with theMonad. He feels bereft and is apt to cry out—as did the Master Jesus—”My God, myGod, why hast Thou forsaken me?” But he makes the needed renunciation, and thecausal body, the soul body, is relinquished and disappears. This is theculminating renunciation and the climaxing gesture of ages of smallrenunciations; renunciation marks the career of all aspirants anddisciples—renunciation, consciously faced, understood and consciously made.I have hinted earlier to you that this fourth or Renunciation Initiation isclosely linked with the sixth initiation and with the ninth. The sixthinitiation is only possible when the initiate has definitely made the neededrenunciations; the reward is that he is then permitted to make a [696] perfectlyfree choice and thus demonstrate his essential and gained freedom. The ninthinitiation (that of the Refusal) has in it no element of renunciation. It is nota refusal to hold, for the initiate is at the point where he asks and holdsnothing for the separated self. At that final planetary initiation the Master isbrought face to face with what might be called cosmic evil, with that reservoirof evil which cyclically overflows the world, and also with the massed group ofmasters of the Black Lodge. He refuses recognition. This I will deal with laterwhen we take up that particular initiation.In connection with this Initiation of Renunciation there are some mostinteresting correspondences which throw a bright, illuminating light upon itssignificance. They are known to you in some measure, because I have dealt withthe significance of the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict, and the fourthkingdom, the human, in my earlier writings; it might, however, serve some usefulpurpose if I bring some of them together and show how this Initiation ofRenunciation is of supreme importance to humanity and to the individual initiatewho is, of course, a member of the fourth kingdom. First of all, this great actof renunciation marks the moment when the disciple has nothing in him whichrelates him to the three worlds of human evolution. His contact with thoseworlds in the future will be purely voluntary and for purposes of service. Iprefer the word “renunciation” to the word “crucifixion” because the last wordsimply emphasises the suffering undergone by the initiate as he renounces allthat is of a material nature and becomes a permanent and (if I may use such aterm) a non-fluctuating and unchanging member of the fifth kingdom in nature,the kingdom of God, called by us the Hierarchy. Forget not that the three worldsof ordinary evolution constitute the dense physical subplanes of the cosmicphysical plane.Crucifixion embodies the concept of extreme physical suffering of a protractednature, its last “three hours” according to the Bible story, typifying the threeplanes of [697] our evolution. On all three planes, the disciple renounces; onall three planes he is, therefore, crucified. It connotes the ending of a lifeand—from the cosmic angle—of the personality life of the soul through manyincarnations. If it is a statement of fact that the time sense is the responseof the brain to a succession of states of consciousness or of events, and if itis equally true that (to the soul) there is no such factor in consciousness astime but only the Eternal Now is known, then the three worlds of incarnatedbeing constitute one unit of experience in the life of the soul —an experiencewhich ends at the crucifixion, because the soul in incarnation definitely,consciously and by the use of the enduring will, renounces all, and turns hisback upon the material world, finally and for ever. He has mastered all the usesof the three worlds of experiment, experience and expression (to use three termswith which I have familiarised you in my other books), and now stands liberated.Each initiate who makes this renunciation and undergoes the consequentcrucifixion is in a position to say with the first of our humanity to do so, “I,if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto Me.” So spoke the Christ. The initiateis lifted up by his renunciation—which he makes through the “blood of theheart”—out of the world of material phenomena, because he has freed himself fromany desire for them, from any interest in them and from any hold they may everhave had over him. He is completely detached. It is interesting to note that theMaster Jesus underwent the renunciation initiation whilst at the same time theChrist was raised up at the seventh or Resurrection Initiation. So the twostories of these two great Disciples are parallel—One so obediently serving theGreater, and the Christ submitting His will to that of His Father in Heaven.This initiation is therefore, in a unique sense, a culminating experience and apoint of entrance into a new life for which all the past has been a preparation.After the ninth initiation, the Refusal Initiation, there comes a cosmicrepetition of the Renunciation experience, this time [698] devoid of thecrucifixion aspect; the initiate at that great moment renounces or refusescontact with the cosmic physical plane on all its seven levels of awareness,unless he has chosen (at the sixth Initiation of Decision) the Path of WorldService.During the experience of the initiatory process in its first three phases, theinitiate rejects control of the energies which are seated in the three centresbelow the diaphragm; he renounces their use for personality or selfish reasons.The centre at the base of the spine has received and distributed the energy ofself-will (the will of the lower self) and is emptied and stands ready for thedynamic reception of the higher will which—using the spinal channel as thepathway or the symbol of the antahkarana—will pour into it from the highest headcentre. The sacral centre which has received and distributed the energy whichhas fed the physical appetites to a far greater extent than is at presentrealised, is also under control—a control which is related to normal and properdirection from the throat centre and to the preservation of life on the physicalplane, if the initiate chooses to incarnate for service ends. The solar plexuscentre, which has received and distributed the energy of the astral plane, theenergy of desire and of emotion, is likewise cleansed and purified; its energyis transmuted to such an extent that it can pass under the complete control ofthe heart centre, which henceforth and until the seventh Initiation of theResurrection is “that whereby the initiate performs his hierarchicalobligations.” Therefore, at the Great Renunciation, the three lower centresreach a point of utter purification or speaking symbolically—of utter emptiness.No energy of their own (related to the selfish aeonial past) is left; they aresimply pure receptacles for the energies of the three higher centres. The threelower centres are related to the three worlds of personality evolution; thethree higher centres are related to hierarchical work and living and are underthe control of the initiate—a control which becomes increasingly perfect untilthe seventh Initiation of Resurrection. At that momentous [699] resurrection,they become no longer of service; the Master needs no energy centres, and Hisconsciousness is transcended and transformed into a type of awareness of whichthose who have not experienced these initiations know nothing. If He chooses totake a physical vehicle (as many will when the Christ reappears and theHierarchy is externalised on Earth), the Master will “function from the above tothe below” and not (as is the case today with all disciples, though naturallynot with the Masters) on “the below towards the above.” I am here quotingancient phrases to be found in the archives of the Hierarchy. They willtherefore need no centres on the etheric levels of our planetary physical plane.At this fourth initiation the initiate begins to function entirely and alwaysupon the fourth plane, the buddhic levels of the cosmic physical plane—ourintuitional plane. This is the case whether you count from below upwards or fromabove downwards. You have here again an indication of the central position ofthis initiation and of its importance. It is preceded by three initiations andsucceeded by three initiations, leading up to that of the seventh or finalplanetary initiation, because the remaining two initiations are fundamentallynot related in any way to our planetary Life. It is because of this permanenttransition of the initiate's “living focus”—lifted out of the three worlds on tothe buddhic plane—that the concept of resurrection has crept into the Christianteaching so that the Crucifixion Initiation is portrayed as preceding theResurrection Initiation; this is in reality not the case, except in a lesserdegree and as symbol of future experience.In the same way, the concept of sacrifice has permeated all the teaching anentthe Crucifixion or the Renunciation Initiation, both in the East and in theWest. This is a sacrifice idea associated with the concept of pain, agony,suffering, patience, prolongation and death. Yet the true root of the wordremains the same and gives the true significance: “Sacer,” to make holy; that iswhat in truth happens to the initiate; he is “made holy”; he is “set apart”[700] for spiritual development and service. He is separated off from that whichis natural, material, transmitted and handicapping, trammelling and destructive,and from that which lessens right activity for that which is new. He learns todefine the Wholeness which is his divine right and prerogative.The beauty of the interpretation of this initiation and the reward to those whoattempt to penetrate to its true meaning and significance are untold; itrequires, however, the teaching of the East and of the West to arrive at thetrue understanding of the experience. The concept of a clean break with the oldlife in the three worlds of experience which has characterised the work of thesoul for so long is obvious. It is death in its truest and most useful form;every death, as it takes place today and on the physical plane, is thereforesymbolic in nature, pointing to the time when the soul finally “dies” to allthat is material and physical, just as the human being dies to all contact inthe three worlds before resuming incarnated living.On the buddhic or intuitional plane (the fourth level of the cosmic physicalplane) the mind nature—even that of the higher mind or the level of abstractthought—loses its control over the initiate and is henceforth only useful inservice. The intuition, the pure reason, complete knowledge illumined by theloving purpose of the divine Mind—to mention some of the names of this fourthlevel of awareness or of spiritual sensitivity—takes its place and the initiatelives henceforth in the light of correct or straight knowledge, expressingitself as wisdom in all affairs—hence the titles of Master of the Wisdom or Lordof Compassion given to Those Who have taken the fourth and the fifthinitiations; these follow very closely upon each other. From the buddhic levelof awareness, the Master works; on it, He lives His life, undertakes His serviceand furthers the Plan in the three worlds and for the four kingdoms in nature.Let this not be forgotten. Also, let it be remembered that this achievement offocus and this attained freedom are [701] not the result of a symbolic ceremony,but are the result of lives of suffering, of minor renunciations and ofconscious experience. This conscious experience, leading to the fourthinitiation, is a definitely planned undertaking , arrived at as true vision isgradually conferred, the divine Plan is sensed and receives cooperation, andintelligent aspiration takes the place of vague longings and sporadic efforts“to be good,” as it is normally expressed by aspirants.It will be clear to you, therefore, why this fourth initiation is ruled orgoverned by the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict. The harmonising of thelower centres with the higher, the harmonising or establishing of rightrelations between the three worlds of human evolution and the buddhic plane, therapport gradually being brought about by each succeeding initiation, betweenhumanity and the Hierarchy, plus the service of establishing right humanrelations among men—these are some of the results which you even now grasptheoretically; these you will also grasp practically and substantially one dayin your own experience. It is with this ray energy that the initiate works as hemakes the Great Renunciation and is transferred thereby to the Cardinal Cross ofthe Heavens. This is the energy which enables him to live in the Eternal Now andto renounce the bindings of time. Through the entire experience he fightsagainst that which is material; under the law of our planet (and, if you onlyknew, under the law of our solar system) nothing is achieved except by struggleand conflict—struggle and conflict associated on our planet with pain andsuffering but which, after this fourth initiation, is devoid of suffering. Ahint as to the purpose for which our little planet exists and its uniqueposition in the scheme of things can here be noted.As I mentioned earlier, the initiate now works from “above downwards.” This isonly a symbolic mode of speech. Like his great Master, the Christ, when he seeksto serve humanity he “descends into hell” which is the hell of materialism andof physical plane life, and there labours for the furtherance of the Plan. Weread in the Christian [702] teaching that “Christ descended into hell and taughtthe spirits which are in prison” for three days. This means that He worked withhumanity in the three worlds (for time and the process of events are regarded byphilosophers as synonymous in meaning) for a brief period of time, but wascalled (on account of His unique task of embodying for the first time in worldhistory the love principle of divinity) to be the Head of the Hierarchy.The same concept of working in the three worlds of physical plane existence (inthe cosmic sense) is embodied for us in the phrase found in the New Testamentthat “the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.” Thisis the Veil which, symbolically speaking, divides or shuts off humanity fromparticipation in the kingdom of God. This was rent by the Christ—an uniqueservice which He rendered both to humanity and to the spiritual Hierarchy; Hemade it easier for a much quicker communication to be set up between those twogreat centres of divine life.I would ask you to ponder this Initiation of Renunciation, remembering ever inyour daily life that this process of renunciation, entailing the crucifixion ofthe lower self, is only made possible by the practice of detachment every day.The word “detachment” is only the Eastern term for our word “renunciation.” Thatis the practical use of such information which I have here given to you. I wouldask you also (curious as it may seem) to get used to crucifixion , if you careto use that word; to permit yourself to get accustomed to suffering withdetachment, knowing that the soul suffers not at all, and that there is no painor agony for the Master Who has attained liberation. The Masters have each andall renounced that which is material; They have been lifted out of the threeworlds by Their Own effort; They have detached Themselves from all hindrances;They have left hell behind and the term “spirits that are in prison” no longerapplies to Them. This They have done for no selfish purpose. In the early daysof the Probationary Path, selfish aspiration is foremost in the consciousness[703] of the aspirant; however, as he treads the path, and likewise the Path ofDiscipleship, he leaves all such motives behind (a minor renunciation) and hisone aim, in seeking liberation and freedom from the three worlds, is to aid andhelp humanity. This dedication to service is the mark of the Hierarchy.You can see, therefore, how the Buddha prepared the way for the Initiation ofRenunciation or of Crucifixion by His teaching and His emphasis upon detachment.Think on these things and study the great continuity of effort and cooperationwhich distinguishes the Members of the spiritual Hierarchy. My prayer and wishis that your goal may be clear to your vision and that the “strength of yourheart” may be adequate to the undertaking.Initiation V. The RevelationAs we undertake the consideration of the next initiation, you will find thatthree factors will emerge in a new light in your consciousness. That they arefactors related to past experiences, and yet which have reference to experienceswhich lie far ahead of you upon the Path, will also be inferred from what I say;these will not necessarily meet with your real understanding. These factors are:> The factor of Blindness, leading to revelation.> The factor of the Will, producing synthesis.> The factor of the Purpose, externalising itself through the Plan.These are all implicit in this new initiatory experience, but they should beapproached by you with as much use of the intuition as you can employ; youreffort will have to be that you endeavour to think as if you had taken thehigher initiations. You have to bear in mind that each initiation enables theinitiate to “see ahead” a little further, for revelation is always a constantfactor in human experience. The whole of life is revelation; the evolutionaryprocess is, in relation to consciousness, a process of leading the blind out ofdarkened areas of consciousness into greater light, and therefore into a vastervision.[704] As you know, this particular initiation has been called the “Resurrection”by the Christian world, emphasising that aspect in the experience of theinitiate which leads to revelation; i.e., his “rising out of the ocean of matterinto the clear light of day.” The thought of revelation can be seen also in theChristian teaching anent the “Ascension”—an initiation which has no factualexistence and should not be called an initiation. You have, therefore, thefollowing sequence, connected with the fourth and fifth initiations:> 1. Renunciation, producing crucifixion and leading to> 2. Ascension, or a complete “rising out of,” or “mounting higher,” leading to> 3. Revelation, giving vision, the reward of the two above stages.Christian theologians have made three distinct episodes out of these twoinitiations, but this has in no way mattered (as the initiate in the West soonlearns); he now knows that the whole series of initiations, with their causes,their effects and their resultant intentions are only a sequence of processes,leading from the one to the other. A corresponding sequence can be seen in theunfoldment of the consciousness of the human being from infancy to fullmaturity; each unfoldment is part of a series of revelations, as his vision oflife and his capacity to experience develops. This is true of all men from themost primitive to the advanced initiate, the difference consisting in that whicheach brings to the experience as the result of past effort, his point inconsciousness and the quality of the vehicles through which that consciousnessis developing. With the initiate-disciple this is also the case; he entersconsciously into each experience; they are integral parts of his intention .Having renounced the three worlds, and having returned—back from a contact ofgreat importance and interest—to those three worlds and with all that isfamiliar in them, the initiate suddenly realises that he has indeed beenliberated, that he is indeed free, that he has been raised out of darkness andis now free in a new world of experiences. [705] He knows that he has climbed tothe mountain-top or has “ascended” to the buddhic plane, from which plane hemust permanently work and not just occasionally, as has been the methodhitherto.He can work through a physical body (with its subtler sheaths) or not, as hesees fit. He realises that he, as an individual, no longer needs a physical bodyor an astral consciousness, and that the mind is only a service instrument . Thebody in which he now functions is a body of light which has its own type ofsubstance. The Master, however, can build a body through which He can approachHis incoming disciples and those who have not taken the higher initiations; Hewill normally build this body in semblance of the human form, doing soinstantaneously and by an act of the will, when required. The majority of theMasters who are definitely working with humanity either preserve the old body inwhich They took the fifth initiation or else They build the “mayavirupa” or bodyof maya, of physical substance. This body will appear in the original form inwhich They took initiation. This I personally did in reference to the firstcase; i.e., preserving the body in which I took initiation. This the Master K.H.did in creating a body which was made in the form in which He took the fifthinitiation.It may interest you to know that the Christ has not yet decided what type ofphysical vehicle He will employ should He take physical form and work definitelyupon the physical plane. He waits to see what nation or group of nations do themost work, and the most convincing work, in preparation for His reappearance. Hewill not, however, take a Jewish body as He did before, for the Jews haveforfeited that privilege. The Messiah for Whom they wait will be one of Christ'ssenior disciples, but it will not be, as originally intended, the Christ.Symbolically, the Jews represent (from the point of view of the Hierarchy) thatfrom which all Masters of the Wisdom and Lords of Compassion emerge:materialism, cruelty and a spiritual conservatism, so that today they live inOld Testament times and are [706] under the domination of the separative,selfish, lower concrete mind.But their opportunity will come again, and they may change all this when thefires of suffering at last succeed in purifying them and burning away theirancient crystallisation, thus liberating them to the extent that they canrecognise their Messiah, Who will not , however, be the world Messiah. The Jewsneed humility more than any other nation. By humility they may learn somethingof value as well as a needed sense of proportion. They are dear to the heart ofthe Christ for—in the performance of His greatest work—He chose a Jewish body,but their materialism and their repudiation of spiritual opportunity has negatedHis use of their racial type again. It would provide too great a handicap. Theprobability is that the Master Jesus will assume (under instruction from theChrist) the part of the Messiah.The Master, standing symbolically upon the Mount of Ascension, is equipped witha full realisation of the past, with a sound appreciation of what He has tooffer to the service of humanity, and with a sense of expectancy. During thepreceding cycle of lives of initiatory service to humanity, He has several timesheard “the Voice of the Father.” This is a symbolical phrase, indicating contactwith that aspect of himself which was responsible for the appearance of his souland for its long long cycle of incarnation: the Monad, the Spirit, the One, theLife, the Father. Each time that that Voice spoke, it gave him recognition. Itis in reality the voice of the Initiator in Whom we live and move and have ourbeing. All of the Master's previous visions have led Him to this high point ofexpectancy; He knows now where His field of service lies—within the Hierarchy,working on behalf of all living beings. He knows also that He Himself has stillto make progress, to move forward, and that there faces Him a great Initiationof Decision (the sixth) for which He must prepare. He knows that this entailsfor Him right choice, but also that right choice depends upon rightunderstanding, right perception, right willingness and [707] right vision orrevelation. So He stands again upon the mountain-top, awaiting again thePresence. He realises that something more is needed if He is to serve rightlyand, simultaneously, make spiritual progress Himself.It is not possible for me here to indicate the nature of the revelation which isaccorded to the initiate of the fifth initiation. It is too closely related toShamballa, and I have not myself done more this life than take the fifthinitiation and climb the Mount of Ascension. The revelation for me is notcompleted and—in any case—my lips are sealed. I can, however, take up two pointswith you which may clarify your vision. I would remind you again that what I amhere writing in this last volume of A Treatise on the Seven Rays is written fordisciples and initiates. Disciples will see some of the significances behind thesymbol and will make interpretations according to the point they have attainedupon the Path. You need to remember that the world of men today is full of thosewho have taken one or other of the initiations and that there are greatdisciples, from all the rays, working on the physical plane as senior workersfor humanity under the Hierarchy; there will be many more during the next onehundred years. (Written in 1949.) Some of these do not know their particularhierarchical status in their physical brains, having deliberately relinquishedthis knowledge in order to do certain work. That which I here write isintended—during the next forty years—to find its way into their hands with thedeliberate intent of bringing to the surface of their brain consciousness whoand what they are in truth. This is a part of the programme planned by theHierarchy, prior to the externalisation of the Ashrams. The Masters feel thatthese senior disciples and initiates (being on the spot) should soon begin towork with more authority. This does not mean that they will assert theirspiritual identity and claim initiate status. This they could not do on accountof their point on the ladder of spiritual evolution. But—knowing who they arefrom the angle of the Hierarchy and what is expected of them—they willstrengthen their work, bring [708] in more energy, and point the way withgreater clarity. Their wisdom will be recognised as well as their compassion,but they themselves will recede into the background; they may even appear to beless active outwardly, and so be misjudged, but their spiritual influence willbe growing; they care not what others think about them. They recognise also themistaken views of all the modern religions anent the Christ; some may even bepersecuted in their homes or by those they seek to help. None of this willmatter to them. Their way is clear and their term of service is known to them.The two points with which I shall now deal are as follows:> 1. The part which energy plays in inducing revelation.> 2. The place the Will plays in the revelatory sequence: Revelation.> Interpretation. Intention. Will.These must be looked at from the angle of discipleship and are not to beconsidered on their face value or in the ordinary manner. They must beapproached from the angle of the world of meaning and, if possible, from theworld of significances; otherwise, the teaching will be so exoteric that itsoccult nature will not appear.The Part which Energy plays in inducing RevelationYou will get a hint as to what I have to say if you will refer back to anearlier statement (page 534). There you will find the inference that threeenergies are necessary for the initiate to employ if he seeks revelation; nomatter what the revelation may be or the status of the disciple or theinitiation he faces, these same three energies will be brought into play. Theyare:> a. The energy generated by the disciple.> b. The energy coming from the Spiritual Triad.> c. The energy of the Ashram with which he is affiliated.These are the three essential energies and without their synthesis in thedisciple's mind or in one of the three [709] higher centres, there can be notrue revelation of the higher order or related to the processes of initiation.In connection with the energy generated by the disciple , it will be obviousthat this will include the energy of the soul ray, until the fifth initiationwhen it will be superseded by the energy of the Monad. This will reach him,first of all, as the energy of the Spiritual Triad, and later that (in its turn)will be superseded by the direct energy of the Monad itself; the initiate willthen know practically (and not just theoretically) what Christ meant when Hesaid, “I and my Father are one.”In the earlier stages on the Path of Discipleship, the disciple works with thatmeasure of the energy of his soul ray to which he can be receptive, plus as muchof the energy of the personality ray as is responsive to that soul energy. Indoing this a great measure of discrimination can be developed, and it is one ofthe first places where the value of the injunction, “Know thyself” can be seen.The nature of the soul ray at this time determines the nature of the revelation;the nature of the personality and its ray is, at the same time, either helpfulor a hindrance.To the energies which he has generated within himself the disciple learns to addthat of the group which he has attempted to serve with love and understanding.All disciples of any standing gather around them the few or the many that theyhave found themselves able to aid; the purity of the energy generated by thisgroup depends upon their selflessness, their freedom from authority or thecontrol of the disciple, and the quality of their spiritual aspiration. As thedisciple or the Master has helped them to generate this energy, and as all willnecessarily synchronise with his, it becomes available as a pure stream offorce, flowing through him at all times. This he can learn to focus andincorporate with his own energy (also focussed) in order to prepare himself forfurther vision, provided always that his motive is likewise selfless.The second group of energies are those coming to the disciple from the SpiritualTriad. These are relatively new [710] to him and embody divine qualities ofwhich he has hitherto known nothing; even theoretically he knows little, and hisattitude towards them has hitherto been largely speculative. Since he first puthis foot upon the Path, he has been trying to build the antahkarana. Even thathas meant for him an act of faith, and he proceeds in the early stages with thework of building, yet scarcely knowing what he does. He follows blindly theancient rules and attempts to accept as factual that which has not been provento him to be a fact but which is testified to by countless thousands down theages. The whole process is in the nature of a culminating triumph of that innatesense of Deity which has driven man forward from the most primitive experiencesand physical adventures to this great adventure of constructing a pathway forhimself from the dense material world into the spiritual. These higher spiritualenergies have hitherto been recognised by him through their effects; now he hasto learn to handle them, first of all, by letting them pour into and throughhim, via the antahkarana, and then to direct them towards the immediateobjective of the divine plan.Hitherto he has worked primarily with the thread of consciousness; this isanchored in the head, and through that consciousness his personality and hissoul are linked together until he has become a soul-infused personality; he hasthen attained unity with his higher self. Through the building of theantahkarana another thread is added to the soul-infused personality, and thetrue spiritual individual is linked with and comes under the direction of theSpiritual Triad. At the fourth initiation the soul body, the causal body (socalled) disappears, and the thread of consciousness is occultly snapped; neitherthe soul body nor the thread are any longer required; they become now only thesymbols of a non-existent duality. The soul is no longer the repository of theconsciousness aspect as hitherto. All that the soul has stored up of knowledge,science, wisdom and experience (garnered in the life cycle of many aeons ofincarnation) are now the sole possession of the individual [711] spiritual man.He transfers them into the higher correspondence of the sensory perceptiveapparatus, the instinctual nature, on the three planes of the three worlds.Nevertheless he still possesses awareness of all past events and knows now whyhe is what he is; much of the information anent the past he discards; it hasserved its purpose, leaving him with the residue of experienced wisdom. His lifetakes on a new colouring, totally unrelated to the three worlds of his pastexperience. He, the sum total of that past, faces new spiritual adventures, andhas now to tread the Path which leads him away from normal human evolution on tothe Way of the Higher Evolution. This new experience he is well equipped toface.Three major energies begin to make an impact upon his lower mind. They are:1. The impulsive energy of ideas, coming to him from the abstract mind andtravelling along the antahkarana; these make contact with his now illuminedlower mind which, at this point, transforms them into ideals so that the divineideas—implementing the divine purpose—may become the heritage of the race ofmen. The better trained and the more controlled the mind, the easier it will beto handle this type of energy. It is by means of this impulsive energy that theHierarchy (upon the buddhic plane) leads humanity onwards.2. The energy of the intuition, which is the word we use to describe a directcontact with the Mind of God at some relatively high level of experience. Theeffect of this energy upon the soul-infused personality is to give to the mind(already receptive to the energy of ideas) some faint glimmering and briefrevelation of the purpose of the ideas which underlie all hierarchical activityon behalf of humanity. The intuition is entirely concerned with group activity;it is never interested in or directed to the revelation of anything concernedwith the personality life. The growth of what we might call the buddhic vehicle(though that is a misnomer) prepares the man for the ninth or the finalinitiation, which enables the initiate—in a manner incomprehensible [712] tous—to “intuit” (in a blazing light) the true nature of the cosmic astral plane.Forget not, the buddhic plane is closely allied with the cosmic astral plane,and that all intuitions when regulated require the use of the creativeimagination in their working out or in their presentation to the thoughts ofmen. Speaking generally, the Masters intuit those phases of the divine intentionwhich are immediate; these constitute the “overshadowing cloud of knowablethings.” These They transform into the Plan; then Their disciples—with theirintuitional capacity developing slowly but steadily—begin themselves to intuitthese ideas, to present them as ideals to the masses, and thus precipitate theneeded aspects of the Plan on to the physical plane.3. The dynamic energy of the will follows next, and (as the disciple perfectsthe antahkarana) it sweeps through the medium of contact into the mind of thesoul-infused personality, and from thence it finds its way to the brain. I am ofcourse referring here to the disciple in training and not to the MastersThemselves Who work at the centre of these energies; the Hierarchy is a greatreception point for these three aspects of the Spiritual Triad—the spiritualwill, the intuition or pure reason, and the abstract mind.It is in the Ashrams of the Masters that the disciple comes into direct relationwith these dynamic, revealing and impulsive energies. These three energies focusthrough and are directed by the three Heads of the Hierarchy: the Manu, theChrist, and the Mahachohan. The Manu is receptive to, and the agent of, theenergy of the divine will for humanity; the Christ is the agent for thedistribution of the energy which brings intuitive revelation; the Mahachohan isresponsible for the inflow of ideas into the consciousness of the disciple, theaspirant and the intelligentsia. I would beg you to remember that the maineffort of the spiritual Hierarchy is on behalf of humanity, because the fourthKingdom in Nature is the Macrocosm of the three-fold Microcosm of the threelower kingdoms in nature.This whole subject is too vast to be entered into here, [713] but I have givenyou much along these lines in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire. Much more than I canpossibly give you is revealed to the initiate at the time of the fifthinitiation. The clues, the thoughts, the abstract concepts, the fleeting ideasof which all disciples are aware are at this initiation resolved into certainty,and the Master can now take His place as a distributor of Triadal energy. Themajor problem confronting Him is not the distribution of ideas or the use of theintuition in grasping the stage of the divine Purpose at any particular time; itconsists in the development of the spiritual will, in its comprehension and itsuse in world service. Just as the disciple has to learn to use the mind in twoways:> As a common sense, a resolver of information so that a life pattern and a life> service, planned and directed, may eventuate, and a perception of> relationships.> As a searchlight, bringing into the light those ideas and intuitions which are> needed,so the Master has to learn the uses of the will. A natural sequence can be seenclosely related to the idea of revelation.On the mountain-top of Ascension, following the experience of “teaching thespirits which are in prison,” the Master receives a revelation; this is Hisright and due and something for which the long previous cycle of initiation hasprepared Him. The revelation must be followed by realisation and recognition:> 1. He realises that the right interpretation of the revelation is the first> essential.> 2. He then comes to the understanding that the next step is for Him to> formulate His intention, based upon the revelation and directed towards His> world service.> 3. Having received the revelation, interpreted it and determined within> Himself what He intends to do, He next realises that the factor of the will> must now be employed if He and those He seeks to help are to profit by the> revelation.[714] This opens up the whole subject of the Will, its nature and relationshipsand this we must study for a while: the sequence of Revelation. Interpretation.Intention. Will.The Place that the Will plays in inducing RevelationThere are three words connected with this initiation which are of realimportance to its correct understanding. They are: Emergence. Will. Purpose.With the emergence aspect we have already dealt under the term “raising up” orthe “transition” from the darkness of matter to the light of the Spirit. But ofthe Will, its uses and its function, as yet we know little. Knowledge as to thenature of the will in any true sense only comes after the third initiation. Fromthat time on the initiate demonstrates increasingly and steadily the firstdivine aspect, that of the Will and the right use of Power. This first aspect ofdivinity is necessarily closely associated with the first Ray of Power or Will.I shall, however, only consider the ray angle incidentally, for I want toelucidate for you the nature of the will in some clear measure, though completeunderstanding is not possible.The Lord of the World is, we are told, the sole repository of the will and thepurpose of His overshadowing, cosmic soul. These two words—will and purpose—arenot identical in meaning. Sanat Kumara and His Council at Shamballa are the onlyBeings upon our planet Who know just what is the nature of the divine purpose.It is Their function and obligation to work that purpose out into manifestation,and this They do by the use of the will. The will ever implements the purpose .The repository of the will aspect of man's innate divinity is to be found at thebase of the spine; this can only function correctly and be the agent of thedivine will after the third initiation. The head centre is the one which is thecustodian of the purpose; the centre at the base of the spine indicates the willas it implements the purpose. The purpose is slowly, very slowly, revealed tothe initiate during the final five [715] initiations and this only becomespossible after the Initiation of Renunciation. At that time the initiate says,in unison with the great head of the Hierarchy, the Christ: “Father, not my willbut Thine be done.” Then comes the initiation of emergence out of matter and,from that point on, the initiate begins to glimpse the purpose of the planetaryLogos; hitherto he has only seen the plan, and to the service of the plan he hasbeen dedicated. Hitherto also, he has only sought to be an exponent of the loveof God; now he must express, with increasing fullness, the will of God.Earlier in these pages (Page 410) we are told that the problem which confrontsthe Hierarchy as it seeks to prepare disciples for the successive initiations isthe right use of the will, both Their Own use of the will in relation to theinitiate, and the initiate's use of the will as he works for the Plan as thatPlan implements Purpose. To produce this, a direct, understanding and powerfulexpression of this first aspect is demanded. There are several reasons why thewill presents a problem. Let us list a few of them and thereby getunderstanding.1. This energy of the will is the most potent energy in the whole scheme ofplanetary existence. It is called the “Shamballa Force,” and it is that whichholds all things together in life. It is, in reality, life itself. This lifeforce or divine will (implementing divine intention) is that by means of whichSanat Kumara arrives at His goal. On a tiny scale, it is the use of one of thelowest aspects of the will (human self-will) which enables a man to carry outhis plans and attain his fixed purpose—if he has one. Where the will is lacking,the plan dies out and the purpose is not achieved. Even in relation toself-will, it is veritably the “life of the project.” The moment Sanat Kumarahas attained His planetary purpose, He will withdraw this potent energy, and (inthis withdrawing) destruction will set in. This Shamballa force is steadily heldin leash for fear of too great an impact upon the unprepared kingdoms in nature.This has reference to its impact also upon humanity.[716] You have been told that this force has—during this century—made its firstdirect impact upon humanity; heretofore, it reached mankind in the three worldsafter being stepped down and modified by transit through the great planetarycentre to which we give the name of the Hierarchy. This direct impact will againtake place in 1975, and also in the year 2000, but the risks will then not be sogreat as in the first impact, owing to the spiritual growth of mankind. Eachtime this energy strikes into the human consciousness some fuller aspect of thedivine plan appears. It is the energy which brings about synthesis, which holdsall things within the circle of the divine love. Since its impact during thepast few years, human thinking has been more concerned with the production ofunity and the attainment of synthesis in all human relations than ever before,and one result of this energy has been the forming of the United Nations.2. It will be apparent to you, therefore, that this energy is the agent for therevelation of the divine purpose. It may surprise you that this is regarded aspresenting a problem to the Hierarchy, but if this power—impersonal andpotent—should fall into the hands of the Black Lodge, the results would bedisastrous indeed. Most of the members of this centre of cosmic evil are uponthe first ray itself, and some of the divine purpose is known to a few of them,for—in their due place and in the initiatory regime—they too are initiates ofhigh degree, but dedicated to selfishness and separativeness. Their particularform of selfishness is far worse than anything which you can imagine, becausethey are completely detached and divorced from all contact with the energy towhich we give the name of love. They have cut themselves off from the spiritualHierarchy, through Whom the love of the planetary Logos reaches the forms in thethree worlds and all that is contained therein. These evil but powerful beingsknow well the uses of the will, but only in its destructive aspect.We have spoken much of the purpose of the planetary Logos. When I use the word“purpose” I am indicating the [717] answer to the question: Why did theplanetary Logos create this world and start the evolutionary, creative process?Only one answer has as yet been permitted to be given. Sanat Kumara has createdthis planet and all that moves and lives therein in order to bring about aplanetary synthesis and an integrated system whereby a tremendous solarrevelation can be seen. Having said that, we have not really penetrated anydistance into the meaning of the divine purpose; we have only indicated themethod whereby it is being attained, but the true objective remains still anobscure mystery—guarded rigidly in the Council Chamber of Sanat Kumara. It isthis mystery and this divine planetary “secret” which is the goal of all thework being done by the Black Lodge. They are not yet sure of the purpose, andall their efforts are directed to the discovery of the nature of the mystery.Hence the hierarchical problem.3. It is this energy of the will, rightly focussed, that enables the seniorMembers of the Hierarchy to implement that purpose. Only initiates of a certainstanding can receive this energy, focus it within the Hierarchy, and then directits potency to certain ends known only to Them. Speaking symbolically, theHierarchy has within it, under the custody of its most advanced Members, whatmight be called a “reservoir of divine intention.” It is the highercorrespondence of that to which Patanjali refers under the words, “the raincloudof knowable things” which hovers over the head of all disciples who can seesomewhat in the Light. Just as advanced humanity can precipitate the rain ofknowledge from this cloud of knowable things (the divine ideas, working out asintuitions in all the many areas of human thinking), so the lesser initiates anddisciples within the Hierarchy can begin to precipitate into their consciousnesssome of this “divine intention.” It is this reservoir of power which embodiessome of the Purpose and implements the Plan. One of the problems of theHierarchy is, therefore, right timing in the revelation of divine intention andin the direction of the thinking and the planning done in Their Ashrams by therecipients: initiates and disciples. [718] Again we come back to the samenecessity for right interpretation of the revelation or of the vision.4. The problem is also one that each Master has to face in connection with HisOwn spiritual development, for this energy is the needed dynamic or potencywhich enables Him to tread the Way of the Higher Evolution. On the way toliberation and in treading the Path of Discipleship and the Path of Initiation,the human being has to use the dynamic or the potency of the Love of God; on theWay of the Higher Evolution, it must be the dynamic and the potency of Will.I would ask you all, therefore, to ponder on the distinction which existsbetween:> 1. Self-will......................2. Determination> 3. Fixity of purpose.........4. The will> 5. The spiritual will.........6. The divine willI shall not attempt to discuss these words with you. They each indicate acertain aspect of the will; you will learn more on this point by doing your ownthinking and defining.All that I can hope and pray is that your individual will can be merged into thedivine will, that revelation will be increasingly yours, and that you will withincreased steadfastness tread the Path from darkness to light and from death toimmortality.Initiation VI. The DecisionWe have been studying along three lines which, in spite of the unavoidableabstruseness of the subject, have meant much to the earnest individual disciplebecause the words used to express the initiations concerned have been:Renunciation. Ascension. Revelation. All these convey practical and usefulconcepts to the mind, and yet—at the same time—their true meaning involves adetachment, a divine indifference and the spiritual perception of which nodisciple has had more than a glimpse and a dim sensing of possibility. I thenlifted these three ideas on to wider levels and endeavoured to show how thecrises through which humanity is today passing and will continue to pass [719]during the next fifty years (though with lessening effects of discomfort, ifright attitude is assumed) can also be related to these three words. I do notwish you to infer that mankind is, in fact, undergoing these initiatoryexperiences. The renunciation is being imposed by circumstances and is not afree undertaking; the moving onward is the result of a somewhat inchoate anduncontrolled momentum and is not the effort of a liberated soul. The revelationwhich is to come will be the result of hierarchical activity, focussed throughthe Christ, though not presented by His coming; it will come as a result of Hiswork and hierarchical activity.All these initiations have their lower correspondences, and the one we are toconsider at this time is no exception; all of them can appeal to the aspirant asembodying for him some immediate goal, but the concept is only preparatory inits nature; this can be illustrated by pointing out that the Great Renunciationbecomes possible because, for many lives, the disciple has learnt to renounceand—when treading the Path of Initiation—to renounce consciously and with aformulated purpose. In the same manner, the sixth Initiation of Decision alsobecomes possible because the initiate has, since his affiliation with theHierarchy, learnt to make right choice, and his ability to do that emerges outof his effort whilst on the Probationary Path and on the earlier stages of thePath of Discipleship to make correct choices and spiritually motivateddecisions. I am pointing this out because, as we now begin to study the finalfour initiations (which are far beyond the understanding of even the advanceddisciple), it will not be waste of time; in spite of a lack of truecomprehension, qualities and attributes and certain needed lessons will beindicated to the true aspirant, and these he can now begin to develop.I would like first of all to point out that the sixth initiation is to theMaster Who stands before the planetary Logos what the second initiation is tothe disciple; the fifth Initiation of Revelation and the sixth Initiation ofDecision are the higher correspondences to the first two initiations which areregarded by the Lodge on Sirius as initiations of the [720] Threshold. Have thiscarefully in mind. Much earlier in this treatise (page 361) I made the commentthat the second initiation with its evidenced control of desire (indicatingright choice) was “the threshold...to those levels of impression, of contact andof future ascension which are the sevenfold goal set before the Master when thesixth initiation (the true ascension) is consummated. It is for this reason thatthis initiation is called the Initiation of Decision.”This is a point of real interest and of practical value; it reveals in a newsense and quite definitely that all happenings on our planet are in truth simplypreparatory to other much greater events and opportunities. They put the Masteror the Chohan (we seem to have no word to express the type of consciousness ofthe initiate who has taken the five initiations of strictly human evolution) ina position where at each initiation He expresses the sum total of all pastattainment. His entire past is involved in what He demonstrates. This is notconsciously so. All that He is or knows has dropped below the threshold ofconsciousness, in the same way that the instinctual nature of man is todayautomatic and spontaneous and not consciously used. In spite of this subjectiveactivity, men are nevertheless in full possession of a definite part of theirequipment. So it is with the Master; all that He has been in the spiritual senseand in wisdom, perception and full comprehension is now instinctual, and thepowers, knowledges, attributes involved are instantaneously His without effortor conscious activity. He can depend fully upon what He is and has, and—as aresult of initiation—He is free from the questionings, the doubts and theuncertainties which are so distinctive of the disciple.Earlier (page 396) I pointed out that the Masters, at the sixth Initiation ofDecision, face realms of service where They will have to “impart, strengthen andenlighten that which is already fused, already strong, and already full of lightbut which needs that which They bring in order to express the all-encompassingWhole.” This is, of course, a mysterious and rather paradoxical statement, but[721] a certain measure of light can be thrown upon it if it is remembered thatthis sixth initiation is related, in a peculiar way, to Path VI. This is thePath upon which our planetary Logos is found. This Path is necessarily relatedto the sixth Ray of Devotion or Idealism, and also to the sixth plane, theastral plane—the plane of glamour and of desire. I would have you bear theserelationships in mind, but I would have you also remember that at thisInitiation of Decision the Master can move forward on any one of the seven Pathswhich He may decide is, for Him, the field of His future service. Thisexpression of His choice is, as you know, not dependent upon His ray energy orupon what might be the impelling force of the planetary rays; i.e., that of theplanet itself (the personality ray of the planetary Logos) or upon the soul rayof Sanat Kumara. It is not for me to tell you whether this dominating ray is Hissoul ray or the monadic or universal ray.It is of interest to have in mind also that at this sixth initiation a greatmoment of basically historic interest occurs. All the Masters Who are initiatesof the sixth degree meet in conclave and together, and before making Their finaldecision (which will probably remove Them from the Path of Earth Service),decide what measures They propose the Hierarchy should take which willdrastically and permanently affect the planet on which They have lived and forwhich They have worked. You will notice that I have here called Them “initiatesof the sixth degree,” bringing to your minds the fact that before a man takes aninitiation of any degree, He is already an initiate of that degree. They inTheir totality—at any given time—are the group which makes final decision anenthuman affairs. It was a decision made by this group of initiates during theancient Atlantean civilisation which brought it to an end; the decision whichThey will make now will produce great changes in our modern civilisation. TheMasters, however, do not “take this initiation” whenever They are ready to “makedecision.” The opportunity comes to the Hierarchy every forty-nine years, andthe year 1952 will see a group of these [722] higher initiates choose the Pathof Their future livingness and Being, but They will do so only after setting inmotion certain energy forces which will creatively change matters on Earth. Theythereby prove two things: Their grasp of world need and Their recognition ofman's freewill to make decision. The last initiation of this kind was thereforeheld in 1903. Those prepared to pass through this initiation were faced with thefact of the emerging forces of cosmic evil; They had then to decide in whatmanner They should bring aid to humanity and what situation They should bringabout so that mankind would be forced to recognise conditions and also make freechoice and decision. What They decided to do led to the world war, to ademonstrated cleavage between right and wrong, between imprisonment and freedom,and which, in 1952 will lead to a decision—the outcome of which is hidden in theconsciousness of Those Who will at that time, make it. (Written in 1949.)At this sixth initiation the Masters Who participate in it no longer come underthe jurisdiction of the Hierarchy. They have moved out from under it. Their longconnection with the Hierarchy is translated to a higher centre and istransferred to Shamballa, unless (as in the case of the Christ) They choose thePath of Earth Service and return to work with the evolutions upon our planet;there are many such evolutions and several kingdoms in nature besides the human,including the deva or angel evolution.The sixth Initiation of Decision is preparatory to the true Initiation of theResurrection, the seventh initiation. This can only be undergone when the willof the Master is completely merged in that of the planetary Logos. Between thesixth and the seventh initiations “an interim of divine fusion” takes place; anelementary and somewhat distorted picture of this critical fusion is given to usin The New Testament, where we read of the experience of the Christ in thegarden of Gethsemane. There again—as in the fourth Initiation ofRenunciation—the human element of suffering is emphasised, whereas in the truesymbolical “garden” between the sixth and the seventh initiations there is no[723] aspect of suffering. Suffering and pain enter not into the consciousnessof the Master. Where it says in The New Testament that, “angels came andministered unto” the Christ, the correct implication is that Those Who dwell andwork in Shamballa use this period to instruct the initiate who has made hisdecision through an expression of his divine nature and in the significance ofthe divine purpose; this concerns the relation of our planetary Logos to thesolar system, and decision is made through the development of that highersensitivity which leads inevitably to cosmic perception. We have no adequateword for this quality or type of sensitivity, for it is not something which wecan consciously understand, nor is it a form of conscious reaction; neither isit awareness as we use that term. It has been occultly defined as something akinto “immersion in a realised state of Being,” because the initiate is a consciousaspect of that of which he forms an integral part. By means of this statementyou will see how impossible it is for me to explain certain things, to makeclear certain unknown types of consciousness or to indicate areas of perceptionwhich lie beyond the ken even of a Master.Revelation is a progressive matter. Disciples are not really able to understandthe extensive significances of the third initiation, for instance; in likemanner, even high initiates fail to comprehend that which lies plainly beforeThem. Disciples can, however, dimly sense the nature of the Transfigurationwhich characterises them, from the hierarchical point of view, and Masters canalso dimly sense the nature of the decision with which They are faced. It isthis preparatory sensitivity in the disciple which produces true perception atall the various initiatory stages. This is a statement of major importance andlinks sensitivity, its interpretation and control, with the everyday life of theordinary disciple. It is important because of its inclusiveness and because eachstage upon the Path of Initiation has in it the germ of comprehension and anunderstanding (deeply hidden) of the various steps which have to be taken uponthe Way of the Higher Evolution. Upon this Way [724] the Master intelligentlyembarks when He has made His final decision; earlier stages are simplyrevelatory of the Way.Initiation has been defined as “a progressive sequence of directed energyimpacts.” These impacts are characterised by points of tension, and these leadinevitably to points of crisis; the whole process is governed by the Law ofCause and Effect. It is this latter point which I seek now to emphasise, becauseit has a definite and mysterious relation to this sixth initiation. The Master,as He makes His decision and chooses one of the seven Paths which unitedly formthe planetary antahkarana, is forced thereto by the accumulation of past karma.All evil karma has necessarily been worked off, but His accumulated good karmamakes His final decision inevitable; from that instant of decision He standsentirely free and liberated from all aspects and all forms of planetary karma,which is greater and more vast than his little individual karma, be it good orbad. He is then—in Himself—the summation of all past experience. Unless Hedeliberately chooses the Path of Earth Service and decides to remain within thefield, scope or influence of the planetary Life, He faces a solar or a cosmicfuture of which He knows relatively little, but for which the Path of Evolution,the Path of Discipleship and the Path of Initiation have fitted Him. Even Hedoes not know the conditions into which His “decision” commits Him, or thoseinto which He will have to penetrate; He does know, however, and “appropriatesthe fact and the faculties” (as one Master has expressed it) of completerevelation and future opportunity.You have oft been told that there are four Lords of Karma associated with theCouncil Chamber at Shamballa. They represent—in Their totality—the three Rays ofAspect, and one of Them represents the four minor Rays of Attribute. It is theLord of Karma Who implements the destinies of Those Who are conditioned by thethird Ray of Active Intelligence (and this is ever the case with Those Who aretaking the sixth initiation) and Who—symbolically speaking—”wipes clean theslate” of this particular group [725] of initiates at this particular time.Karma no longer holds Them.The revelation accorded to the Initiate in the first stage of the initiationgives Him a complete picture “in a flash of endless time” of the processes whichhave brought Him to this creative moment of decision. Immediately He achieves apoint of tension which He will continue to hold until the final or ninthinitiation, the Initiation of Refusal, wherein He rejects, refuses or repudiatesHis entire past and enters upon His chosen path entirely “free of recollectedconcepts, but exhibiting to Those Great Lives Who welcome Him upon the new anduntried path all that He is and the essence of His Being.”In dealing with these higher initiations of which I myself have no experience,there is naught for me to do but clarify your minds, and mine also, through theuse of ancient phrases and the oral teaching which is permitted to escape intothe minds of men.The point of crisis which ever follows the attainment of tension is theexpressed moment of the final decision. Then follows the revelation of what maybe, and the initiate knows that he faces the final resurrection and that frombeing the eternal pilgrim or the planetary wanderer, he now becomes a fixedpoint upon another cosmic plane, for the physical is, for him, eternally leftbehind.This initiation is therefore governed by the third ray, the Ray of IntelligentActivity. This ray is closely related to the mental plane of our planetary life,to the Law of Fixation and the Law of Cleavages. Much anent this I have writtenearlier, and a search for the significance of certain passages in A Treatise onCosmic Fire may bring enlightenment. Fixation is not permitted to the eternalpilgrim upon our little planet, the Earth, but when that is left behind entirelyat the ninth initiation the initiate becomes a “fixed or stationary point oflight within his chosen Place, the Place of the Most High and the point of fireupon the mountain-top. From that point he will no more go out.”[726] The concept of cleavage is latent here also. The Master severs allconnection with the past and with the planet, but never with the One Life whichpermeates all spheres and forms of being, which makes possible all states ofconsciousness and leads to endless activity.Creativity was one of the three words which I gave you earlier (see page 340) inconnection with this sixth initiation. The final four initiations are alldistinguished by a “revelation in the living light.” At the sixth initiation theMaster is brought to an understanding of the nature of creation, of the reasonfor the intelligent manifestation of substantial forms and their creation toprovide forms for Being and for Life, and of the quality of that which He—in thefuture—must and will create. At the seventh Initiation of Resurrection, He isaccorded a revelation of the quality which must express itself through allcreated forms: the quality of love-wisdom which has animated our planetary Logosand is the basic quality of our entire solar system. In other spheres and inother solar systems and on other cosmic planes, other qualities, unknown to us,may be demonstrated by the appropriate initiates; but those who attainresurrection and liberation upon our planet will always be spiritually qualifiedby divine love, and that will also be the underlying quality of all that theymay later create when freed from our planet. You can see, therefore, why thephrase “God is Love” is really our planetary keynote.At the eighth Initiation of Transition the purpose of all our planetary activityis revealed to the Master, and all Masters or initiates of this eighthinitiation (working either through the Hierarchy or in Shamballa) are needed atthis initiation so as to stimulate the point of tension of the new initiate inorder to make the revelation possible.It might be said that They act like a lens through which the living light flowswhich makes the revelation possible, and They also fulfill the need of acting asa protecting factor. This protection is needed because at this initiation theinitiate is shown not only the eternal good [727] underlying planetary purpose,but he is allowed “to see that which is hidden behind the fast sealed door andbe in touch with cosmic evil for it can no longer hurt him.” He needsnevertheless the protection of Those with Whom he has fitted himself toassociate. What the planetary purpose is I know not; when I say that part of thepurpose is to liberate light and love into a wider universe and to free thesolar system from the attacks of cosmic evil, I am stating a truth, but a truthwhich remains as yet meaningless to those who have not been put in touch withthe completed purpose; it remains a mystery, for the true nature of light, themystery of electricity, the constitution of the good, the beautiful and thetrue, the origin of evil, the nature and purpose of the Black Lodge, the placewhich that Lodge plays within the divine scheme of being, are all unknown to youin their essential significance. Remember that when a Member of the Hierarchyuses the word essential , He does not mean (as you oft do) that which is neededor necessary; He is referring to the inmost essence which is found at the heartof all things—both the good and the evil. Therefore, when I say to you also thatat this eighth initiation the nature and the purpose of duality is revealed tothe initiate, it is again meaningless.At these three final initiations, therefore, the significance of creation, ofquality and of purpose are successively revealed to the Master, and that whichmakes the revelation possible is not only the action of the One Initiator and ofthe initiating group (when such a group is required), but the major factor isthe developed sensitivity of the initiate himself—a sensitivity which hasdeveloped through many aeons of lives and of vital experience.The objective of the evolutionary process to which all lives on our planet haveto submit has been to develop this sensitivity which will make revelationpossible, and it might be said that (from one definite angle) the goal of allexperience has been revelation—each revelation “carrying the initiate closer tothe Heart of the Sun wherein all things are known and felt, and through whichall forms, [728] all beings and all things can be bathed in love.” Ponder onthese words, for the microcosmic correspondence to the macrocosmic fact is fullof teaching value. See to it that “each lesson learned each day, each revelationgrasped and understood, makes your heart full of love and enables you to loveyour fellowmen with ardent, fiery warmth.” I am quoting some ancient aphorismsfor disciples.At the ninth Initiation of Refusal, the revelation presented to the Masterconcerns the nature of Being and of existence. There is naught I can say to youwhich could be in any way explanatory of Being, for Being is related to THATwhich creates, to the universal point of planetary or solar Life which is, andhas ever been, responsible for the life of all forms from the greatestmanifestation to the smallest. When that revelation is accorded to the initiate,he for the first time receives his initial contact with what is called in theoccult and esoteric books “the Central Spiritual Sun.” He realises for himselfthat those words concern a basic fact and are related to the purpose of thesolar system, just as “the Heart of the Sun” revealed to him the quality of thesolar system. When it is realised that our planetary purpose is mysteriouslyrelated to the revelation of love upon our little planet, the Earth, through theprocess of creation, the concept emerges that there is the probability that ourplanet has a unique relation to the Heart of the Sun. There are many hints foryou in what I have said; they are hints to me also, only I can bring to theirexpansion into ascertained fact a wider knowledge than is as yet yourpossession.There is little more that I can say anent this crucial and decisive sixthinitiation. It embodies the Master's recognition of liberation, and in itsprocesses He demonstrates that liberation by making free decision anent Hisfuture state of Being and of purpose. The future, for the average person and forthe average disciple, is contained within his past and is implemented in hispresent. This is not so with the initiate of the sixth initiation. He isentirely liberated from his past; the Law of Karma no longer [729] has any holdover Him; He makes free decision, and His future is decided by Him not on thebasis of its inevitability or as providing Him with a field in which to work offkarma, but on the basis solely of qualification for service. This creates a verydifferent situation. The decision once made is a fixed decision, and there is noturning back or relinquishment of it, nor (so free is the Master from allpossible hindrances) is there any desire to turn back or possibility that Hecould do so.The remaining three initiations demonstrate these points still more clearly anddefinitely, and the light in which the initiate walks waxes ever brighter andbrighter. Light reveals to him the nature and the purpose of the cosmic ethericphysical planes (the four highest planes of our planetary Life); this lightbrings to his attention the nature of certain extra-planetary conditions, andfor the first time these become factual to him and not simply hypothetical; thelight reveals to him his future opportunities once his final choice or decisionis made, and—as said above—it also reveals to him the nature of divine purposeas our planetary Logos conceives it under the inspiration of the solar Logos.He can now express himself fully upon the monadic plane, the plane of universallife; the great heresy of separateness has slipped away from him and he knowsnothing but love, unity, spiritual identification and a universal awareness.Because of this, he can become a creator, for creation is the expression oflife, love and purpose, and all these three he can now understand and fullyexpress.He is now an intelligent cooperator with the Building Forces of the planet andalso of the solar system, and upon his chosen ray he will carry out his creativeintentions.Initiation VII. The ResurrectionThere is no idea more cultivated subjectively by humanity than that of theresurrection; when life seems hard and circumstances carry in them no groundsfor happiness, and when nothing calls to one of such a nature that one [730]goes forth happily to the day's enterprises, and when the nights of sleep arehaunted nights, the thought of rising up and out of all these circumstances, ofleaving all behind and of entering into a new life, carries with it strength andhope. In the West, the Festival of the year which is regarded as of the mostimportance is that of Easter Day—the Day of Resurrection. Yet two thousand yearsago the Christ did not rise out of a rocky sepulchre and re-assume His discardedbody. He passed through the great seventh initiation which we will considertoday, and knew the secret of life, of which immortality is only one of its manyattributes. Humanity lays emphasis so frequently upon attribute, quality andreactions, and not upon that which is the basic underlying reality; men dealwith effects and not with causes; for instance, mankind is concerned with warand with horrified preparations for more war, and is not primarily occupied withthat which causes war and which, if rightly handled, would prevent war. Let usconsider some few aspects of the seventh initiation.The word “resurrection” has deep significance latent in its derivation and onethat is not often emphasised. The usual interpretation has been that the wordcomes from “re,” again, and “surgere,” to rise, therefore to rise again. Yet aconsultation with the dictionary shows that the prefix means “back to anoriginal state” by rising. This return to an original state is pictured for usin The New Testament under the story of the Prodigal Son, who said “I will ariseand go to my Father,” and by the story of the resurrection in which the MasterJesus arose out of the tomb; the chains of death could not hold Him. At thattime of His “rising,” a far more important event took place and the Christpassed through the seventh Initiation of Resurrection and returned back to Hisoriginal state of Being—to remain there throughout all the eternities. This isthe true and final resurrection. The Son of God has found His way back to theFather and to His originating Source, that state of Existence to which we havegiven the name Shamballa. The consciousness of the Universal Life is His: this[731] is far more than simply the consciousness of immortality, because the ideaor concept of mortality is not contained within it at all. There have been manydeaths within the aeonial life cycle of the initiate:1. The familiar and constantly recurring death of the physical body, incarnationafter incarnation.2. The deaths of the astral and the mental vehicles, as the undying souldiscards them life after life—only to create new ones until mastery is attained.3. Then—as a result of the incarnating process and its evolutionaryeffects—there comes the death of desire and its replacing by a growing spiritualaspiration.4. Then, through right use of the mind, comes the “death” of the personality or,rather, its repudiation and renouncing of all that is material.5. This is followed by the death or destruction of the causal or soul body atthe great Initiation of Renunciation. This process of death and resurrectiongoes on ceaselessly in all the kingdoms of nature; each death prepares the wayfor a greater loveliness and livingness, and each death (if you analyse it withcare) prefaces resurrection in some form or another until we come to this finalresurrection and into the position of final attainment.I will not here elaborate upon this process of constant death followed byconstant resurrection, but it is the evolutionary keynote and the evolutionarytechnique, and only because men love unduly that which is material and hate tolose contact with the form aspect of nature do they fear death. It is wise toremember that immortality is an aspect of the living spiritual being, and is notan end in itself, as men seek to make it. To the Knowers of Life such a phraseas “I am an immortal Soul” is not even true. To say “I am Life Itself and,therefore, am immortal” approaches closer to the truth, but even that sentenceis (from the angle of the initiate) only a part of a larger truth. Symbolically,nature is ever portraying to us the essential facts in the annual progress ofthe four seasons, in the cycles of light and dark and in the wonder of theemergence of beauty or [732] colour or useful function out of a seed which hasstruggled—because of its inherent life—into the light of the sun.The fear of death is one of the great abnormalities or distortions of divinetruth for which the Lords of Cosmic Evil are responsible. When in earlyAtlantean times they emerged from the place where they had been confined, andforced temporarily the retirement of the Great White Lodge to subjective levels,their first great act of distortion was to implant in human beings fear,beginning with the fear of death. From that time on, men have laid the emphasisupon death and not life, and have been ridden by fear all their days.One of the initial acts of the reappearing Christ and of the Hierarchy will beto erase this particular fear and to confirm in peoples minds the idea thatincarnation and the taking of a form is the true place of darkness to the divinespirit which is man; it is death to the spirit temporarily, and imprisonment.Evolution, men will be taught, is in itself an initiatory process leading fromone living experience to another, culminating in the fifth Initiation ofRevelation and in the seventh Initiation of Resurrection.At the fifth initiation it is revealed to the initiate that life in form isindeed death, and he then knows this truth in a manner which my few short wordscannot convey. Form dies for him and he knows a new expansion of life andundergoes (if I may so express it) a new understanding of living. The seventhinitiation is divorced from all considerations of form, and the initiate becomesa concentrated point of living light; he knows in a manner indescribable thatlife is all that IS, and that it is this life and its real fullness which makeshim a part of THAT which lies outside of our planetary Life; he may now share inthat extra-planetary Existence in which our planetary Logos lives and moves andhas His being. This is the “life more abundantly” of which Christ spoke andwhich only an initiate of the seventh degree can understand or convey.After the fifth initiation, the initiate has slowly been sensing the nature ofthis greater Life, the Life of “The [733] Unknown God,” as it has been called,which enfolds all livingness and all forms upon and within our planet and yetremains —greater than our planetary Life, more all-encompassing than is ourplanetary Logos, and Whose greatness, beauty, goodness and knowledge are to ourplanetary Logos what His life is to the lowest form of life in the third oranimal kingdom. It is only by such inadequate comparisons that one can arrive atsome faint comprehension of that great WHOLE in which our planet and ourplanetary Logos are but a part. It is this revelation which is accorded to theinitiate at this seventh Initiation of Resurrection. He takes this initiationupon what (for lack of a better phrase) we call the “logoic plane,” or on thelevel of consciousness of the Lord of the World.At this initiation the Initiator is attended by two groups of Beings; one is asmall group of the “Knowers of the Purpose, the Custodians of the Will,” and theother is a much larger group, the personnel of which are known as “The Wise Onesand the Attractive Energies of Shamballa.” I am of course endeavouring totranslate certain brief words and intricate symbols into phrases which you canunderstand and which only dimly convey the true significance of Those Whofunction on this highest level of the cosmic physical plane. On this level,dynamic electricity is held as in a great reservoir of potency and is directedby these two groups which embody the will and the quality of the will of Deity,called by us the Will-to-Good. They are the directing Agents and are acorrespondence to the ajna centre of mankind, only here it is the ajna centre ofthe planetary Logos, in the same sense as Shamballa is His head centre, theHierarchy His heart centre and Humanity His creative throat centre. Motion,planned activity and the seven great creative ray energies are directed intoaction by Them under the influence of the seven Ray Lords; the Ray Lords areembodied livingness qualified by the seven aspects of Love, but Who areThemselves of so high an order that They cannot function as directing creativeAgents but work through Their trained and developed Representatives.[734] Just as there is a group of Contemplative Initiates, called in the Easternphraseology “Nirmanakayas,” Who function in deep meditation at a point midwaybetween the Hierarchy and Shamballa, so this much higher group of Ray Lordsfunction in the deepest cosmic meditation between our planet, the Earth, and oursister planet, Venus. You would find it useful to read with care The SecretDoctrine and A Treatise on Cosmic Fire and refresh your minds as to thisrelationship. A lower correspondence to these two important groups has beenforming midway between the Hierarchy and Humanity, and to it we give the name ofthe New Group of World Servers. All these three groups are fundamentally“transmitters of energy”; the two highest are exceedingly susceptible to cosmicimpression and to the vibratory quality of the extra-planetary body of AvatarsWho hold Themselves in readiness to function as destroying or building Energiesin any part of our solar system and are under the direction of the Solar Logos.The Avatar of Synthesis, Who is working in cooperation with the Christ, is oneof Them. Bear in mind that these extra-planetary Avatars have not arrived atTheir high state of spiritual unfoldment on our planet or even in our solarsystem. Their origin, source and spiritual relationships are a great mysteryeven to the planetary Logoi—to Whose help They go when the invocative appeal ofany planet is adequate. Think not that They come to put wrong right or to arrestevil. A few, a very few, may do so, but They work along the line of the sevenray energies in the solar system and produce certain energy effects desired atany particular time; the constructive work of the Avatar of Synthesis will beapparent to you in the name He is known by; He is coming to the Earth in orderto further the manifestation of unity, of oneness and of inter-relation, and Hecomes, therefore, to wield and apply first ray energy. He will charge orgalvanise the three groups—the directing Agents in Shamballa, the Nirmanakayasand the New Group of World Servers—with dynamic energy and, in a mysterious way,relate them to each other so that a [735] new synthesis and alignment will bepresent upon the Earth. All these Avatars embody energy to the extent that anyparticular planet is capable of receiving it.These are interesting items of information but are only of value in so far asthey convey to you a sense of planetary integrity and of solar synthesis, andpresent to you a closer spiritual inter-relation in which you, as individuals,can share if you are linking your fate and service to that of the New Group ofWorld Servers. Then you will be in the direct line of spiritual descent, ofdivine energy; in this thought you have the clue to the doctrine (so travestiedand misused) of the Apostolic Succession. The details, the personnel and thetechniques of the two higher groups lie beyond your ken; They work incooperation with the planetary Logos Himself, and Those Who compose these groupsare all initiates of degrees higher than the fifth. Most of the Nirmanakayashave taken the sixth and the seventh initiations, whilst the group whichfunctions midway between the Earth and Venus have all taken the eighth and ninthinitiations. Some of Them, as I mentioned earlier, aid the initiate of theseventh degree; a still larger group of them participate in the activities ofthe two final initiations.This seventh initiation gives the initiate the right to “come and go in thecourts of Shamballa” as Their work may dictate and Their service may require. Itis there also that he goes for the needed periodic or cyclic re-chargings whichenable him to work.There is one aspect of initiation which is apt to be overlooked. Everyinitiation is a process of energy transmission from a higher centre of energy toa lower; every initiation charges the initiate with electrical force, and thischarging and re-charging is related to what H.P.B. calls “the mystery ofelectricity “ These transmissions of energy enhance the magnetic-attractiveforce of the initiate, and at the same time are eliminative in their effects. Inthis fact lies a great planetary truth and the key to the science of planetaryredemption. When the spiritual and the electrical [736] charging of the threemajor centres on the planet—Shamballa, the Hierarchy and Humanity—has reached ahigh stage of receptive efficiency, a certain cosmic Avatar will “becomeconscious of the vibratory quality of the little point of light within the solarsphere” and will then “turn His gaze and send His force unto that point oflight, and cosmic evil will be driven out and find no more a place on Earth.”Two more initiations remain to be considered, but so high is their potency andso mysterious their working that I find myself unable to deal with them in anyway. They are:Initiation VIII. The Great Transition - Initiation IX. The RefusalIt will of course be apparent that the Transition referred to is related to thesixth Initiation of Decision, when the Master decides which of the seven PathsHe will follow to His destined place. I know not what the Great Refusalinvolves. One thing only I know: It indicates the Initiate's last contact withwhat we understand as cosmic evil, manifesting on this planet and in relation tothe planet. He is accorded this last contact, but such a contact is not basedupon anything analogous to evil within Him, but is based upon the “planetaryappeal for liberation.” This appeal is so strong that the Initiate—because Hisheart is on fire with love—is tempted to go back upon His decision and stay uponthe planet with Those World Saviours Who have chosen the Path of Earth Service.This He may not do, and in the sight of the assembled Initiates He makes Hisrefusal and “does His whole duty as He journeys to the sacred Feet of the ONEWHO stands at the end of His chosen Path.”Again, we come up against the outstanding planetary characteristic which hasbeen presented to us under many differing words, i.e., the sensitivity which insome form or another distinguishes each initiation. We know it also asattraction, the sensitivity which moves outward until it attracts and draws toitself those forms of being which the initiate can instruct or aid; we know italso as the overall [737] activity conferring that spiritual sensory perceptionwhich makes the initiate aware—in a universal sense—of all that concerns thesphere of influence of the Will of God. This demonstrates particularly at theeighth Initiation of Transition. In the ninth Initiation of Refusal, thisheightened spiritual perception is presented to us under the word “Existence,”for existence is a livingness coupled with awareness which “finds its own placeand the spiritual house of its Being which is the true home of all Beings, butof this—our planetary forms know naught.” This the initiate has at last learntto find, after the struggle with evil in himself, after the struggle withmaterialism and with evil in the human family, and after his struggle to aid inthe “closing of the door where evil dwells” and his refusal to make any contact(even with good intention) with cosmic evil.The planetary Lodge of Masters has absorbed Him and, at the final initiation,the Great Lodge on Sirius has recognised Him, and with the Black Lodge of AdeptsHe will have nothing to do. He will mitigate its evil effects and will struggleto offset its results, but He knows that the final overcoming of cosmic physicalevil must be undertaken by Existences much further advanced than even theMembers of the Council Chamber at Shamballa; certain solar Entities and certaingreat Lives from Sirius are dealing with the problem.The theme of the living consciousness of the planetary Logos is forever andunchangeably the great Hierarchy of Being, that chain of life in which thesmallest link is of importance, and the greatest link is related to the smallestthrough the electrical interplay of spiritual energy. There is naught—from oneimportant angle of life—but Hierarchy, linking sun with sun, star with star,solar system with solar system, planet with planet and all planetary lives witheach other. The major keynote of every single planetary initiation, even to thevery highest, is RELATIONSHIP. What other qualities may be revealed to theInitiate on other paths we know not, but the goal of all endeavour upon ourplanet is right relations between man and man [738] and between man and God,between all expressions of divine life, from the tiniest atom up and on intoinfinity.From the standpoint of our planetary evolution, there is naught but love, naughtbut goodwill and the will-to-good. This exists already, and its truemanifestation is nearer today than at any time in planetary history.From stage to stage, from crisis to crisis, from point to point and from centreto centre, the life of God progresses, leaving greater beauty behind it as itmoves through one form after another and from kingdom to kingdom. One attainmentleads to another; out of the lower kingdoms man has emerged, and (as a result ofhuman struggle) the kingdom of God will also appear. The bringing in of thatkingdom is all that truly concerns humanity today, and all living processes inmankind are bent towards preparing each individual human being to pass into thatkingdom. The knowledge that there may be greater manifestations than even thekingdom of God may be inspiring, but that is all. The manifestation of theKingdom of God on Earth, the preparing of the way for its great Inaugurator, theChrist, the making possible the externalisation of the Hierarchy upon Earth giveus each and all a fully adequate task and something for which to live and work,to dream and to aspire.The five volumes composing A Treatise on the Seven Rays are now completed, mybrothers. It has been for me a labour of love and for A.A.B. a labour! It willsuffice for study for many years to come.May light and love and power shine upon your ways, and may you in due time andwith as little delay as possible stand before the Initiator and join the ranksof Those Who—actively and consciously—love Their fellowmen, work asreconstructive and regenerative Energies and forever—SERVE.I sign myself, because it has been given out who I am, as the Master DjwhalKhul.THE TIBETAN"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIXFIVE GREAT SPIRITUAL EVENTS[741] (Written February 1949)You (A.A.B.) have asked me what I considered the most important and significantevents from the spiritual angle at this present time. This question highlights atheme which is exceedingly apposite, following as it does upon what I have justgiven anent the Great Renunciation (see pages 602-614) and its consequentrevelation or (as the Christian churches call them) the Crucifixion and theResurrection. The Christian resurrection is, however—from the angle of the greatLodge on Sirius—only a minor one and a passing resurrection, though therevelation subsequently accorded is lasting and permanent in its effects.There are five great spiritual events in which all humanity is today sharing,and two which will take place later, when the first five have established theirlasting effects.These events are based upon a forced and not upon a spontaneous renunciation (asis the case in the true experience of the Renunciation Initiation); they willlead nevertheless to a revelation which is imminent in its dawning and whichwill confront humanity before so very long.The war of 1914-1945 is over; its aftermath of suffering, famine, selfishreactions, suspicion and unseemly struggle for supremacy is equally as bad asthe past war; the effects are more lasting, because the war has been largelytransferred to the mental plane. The physical effects of war are far more easilyobliterated than are the mental effects. The great question with which theHierarchy is today faced is: Will the race of men succeed in renouncing theirpresent material objectives and so prepare the way for a great revelation? TheComing of the Christ Himself is not the revelation which is to be accorded, butHe will simplify the thinking of men so that a widespread illumination and [742]recognition of the revelation will be possible. The next few years will indicatethe way the tide will turn, and whether the reactionary, material and selfishforces which have controlled for millenia of years will finally control. Thisreactionary and material spirit taints every department of human life, and thechurches are no exception. Humanity can, however, learn its lesson and turnthankfully to the “way of righteousness” and to the hitherto unknown techniqueof right human relations.I seek not to deal in detail with the evil which holds the world in thrall.Enough is already known and a small handful (small in comparison to the manymillions) of hierarchical workers in all departments of life are struggling toawaken humanity to the risks they are running, and to the finality of thedecision which the next two generations will be forced to make. More will cometo the surface as we study present-day happenings from the angle of renunciationand resurrection.I would like first of all to point out that:1. The mass of the people are sound, but ignorant of the higher values; that canbe slowly righted. They are negative as yet in action, and prone to words andnot deeds. They are easily led and also easily swayed by imparted fears.2. The evil in the world and that which is primarily guilty of swaying themasses at this time is focussed through a few powerful men or groups of powerfulmen. No country is free from this control, or from this attempted control. Thesepowerful groups are swayed in their turn by the forces of evil—forces which werenot “sealed in their own place,” because the plan of love and light and powerstill lacks positive and worldwide presentation.3. The aspirants, disciples and spiritual workers of the world are not acting infull concert with the Hierarchy. They are swayed by fear, by a sense of futilityand by a too acute understanding of the nature of the forces of evil with whichthey are confronted. The picture of what must be accomplished looms too large;there is little organised [743] cooperation among them, and no welding togetherinto a united group for world salvage and service.The spiritual opportunity is, however, emerging with increasing clarity in theminds of thinking men and women, even if it is not expressed by them in orthodox(so-called) terms or in recognised or spiritual terms. Perhaps a clear statementof that which the active spiritual Forces are seeking to bring about may provehelpful. If the Forces of Evil are active and organised, the Forces of Light areequally active, but not so well organised. The basic goal is the freedom and theliberation of mankind, but the spiritual workers are handicapped by the factthat men themselves must make free choice and decision in order to be free; theycan only be liberated when they—as individuals and later as groups—liberatethemselves from the expressed thought-control of the powerful dominating groupsand from the fears which these groups intentionally engender. Freedom can neverbe conferred through totalitarian methods; liberation cannot come through adictator or dictating groups. A realisation of the manner in which thehierarchical forces are working and a recognition that all men are todayimmersed in vital spiritual happenings may serve to encourage the faithful andgive a quickening vision to those who are struggling on behalf of human freedom.What are the five spiritual events in which all are consciously or unconsciouslyparticipating? Let me list them:> 1. The crisis of the ideologies.> 2. The steady awakening of men everywhere to better understanding.> 3. The growth of goodwill, as it reveals cleavages.> 4. The partial sealing of the door where evil dwells.> 5. The use of the Great Invocation.These are the five deepest spiritual events happening in the world today. Thetwo which lie ahead in the not too distant future (but which depend uponhumanity availing itself of the present opportunity) are:> 6. The closer Approach of the Hierarchy.> 7. The imminent Return of the Christ. [744]1. The Crisis of the IdeologiesMen are today confronted with conflicting and antagonistic ideologies or schoolsof thought, and automatically—according to their background, tradition, trainingand place of birth—they regard some one of these ideas as true and all theothers as false and wrong. They are apt to forget that according to the localeof birth, the national mode of schooling and the nature of the nationalpropaganda, so will be the chosen ideology or the imposed ideology. Very fewpeople are free agents, even in the democracies. A man born in Central Russia,for instance, knows nothing but Communism; he cannot imagine another suitableform of government; again, a man born in the United States or in Great Britainboasts and is pleased that he was born in a democracy, but the accident of birthaccounts largely for his attitude. Men need to remember these things and notblame each other for the place in which they are born! We have, therefore,ideologies and their opponents, great schools of thought and modes ofgovernment, confronted by organised opposition. One basic premise can be laiddown: The platform of the leading ideologies is not necessarily wrong or wicked;it is the imposition by force and by a police state of an ideology, and its useby powerful men or groups for their own benefit, plus the keeping of the peoplein blind ignorance so that no free choice is theirs—which is fundamentallywicked and evil.We have, for instance, the great crisis in the world today presented by theconflict between Communism and the democratic point of view. I mention thisfirst because it is the one which is occupying a prominent position in the eyesof all men everywhere. This presents a dominant spiritual opportunity. Thedemocratic attitude, dedicated as it claims to be to human freedom (howeverlittle of that freedom is yet truly attained) is—because of that freedomfactor—sponsored today by the Hierarchy. Communism being an imposed ideology,forced on the people by totalitarian authority, is regarded as evil. It is notthe communistic [745] theories which are necessarily wrong; it is the techniqueand the methods, rampant in the totalitarian lands, which are counter to thespiritual plan. Imposed Communism and all totalitarian methods imprison thehuman soul, and breed fear and hatred everywhere. Should the democraticprinciples therefore be imposed upon the world or any part of the world by atotalitarian regime, it would be equally wrong.These conflicting ideologies are presenting clearly to the human consciousnesscertain great distinctions; these distinctions are found in techniques andmethods far more than in the various tenets. Many of the people most violentlyfighting Communism could not tell you succinctly what those tenets are, but theyare fighting—and rightly fighting—the totalitarian methods of cruelty, spying,murder, suppression and the lack of freedom. What they are doing in truth isfighting the abominable methods of imposing the rule of a few evil and ambitiousmen upon the ignorant masses, under the name of Communism . They are fightingthe technique of exploiting the ignorant through misinformation, organised lyingand limited education. They are fighting against the sealing up of nationswithin the confines of their own territory, against the police state, the lackof free enterprise and the reduction of men and women to automatons. This is thetrue imprisonment of the human spirit. The situation is, however, so pronouncedand the evil so obvious (and the human spirit so basically and divinely strong)that it will eventually defeat itself; when the present group of totalitarianrulers (behind what you call the “iron curtain”) die out a different state ofaffairs will gradually supervene and a true Communism (in the spiritual sense ofthe term) will take the place of the present wickedness.On the other hand, the much vaunted democracies have much to learn. Men are nottruly free, even in democratic countries; the Negroes, for instance, lack theirconstitutional rights in parts of the United States; and in South Africa, theireducational facilities and their opportunity [746] to work and live as free menare not equal to those of the white race; in the southern states, theConstitution of the United States is infringed every day by those who believe inwhite supremacy—a supremacy which will be put to a crucial test when Africaawakes. This attitude of the United States and their failure to live up to theConstitution where Negroes are concerned, have greatly weakened the faith ofother countries in the wonder of America, and the situation in South Africa isnot honoured by thinking men. I mention these two situations because there iswidespread evil even in the democracies; a true house cleaning is sorely needed.The imperialism of democratic Britain has badly marred an otherwise fine recordon behalf of dependent peoples, but it is rapidly becoming a thing of the past,as Britain gives freedom of choice and democratic liberation to India, Pakistan,Ceylon and Burma. Each of those liberations was in the nature of a spiritualexpansion of consciousness to the British people and a spiritual opportunity, ofwhich only Ceylon and Pakistan show signs of being aware. Always, in everydepartment of human living, the spiritual and the material aims are making theirpresence and their differences clearly felt; the spiritual issue, as I havelately pointed out to you, is the imprisonment of the human spirit or itsfreedom and liberation.True Democracy is as yet unknown; it awaits the time when an educated andenlightened public opinion will bring it to power; towards that spiritual event,mankind is hastening. The battle of Democracy will be fought out in the UnitedStates. There the people at present vote and organise their government on apersonality basis and not from any spiritual or intelligent conviction. There isa material, selfish aspect to Democracy (rampant today), and there is aspiritual aspect, little sought after; there are material and spiritual aspectsto Communism, but its adherents know them not, and only a ruthless materialismis conveyed to them.There is again the ideology of Socialism which is regarded [747] by some as abasic evil. Socialism can degenerate into another form of totalitarianism, or itcan be more democratic than the present expressions of Democracy. These issueswill emerge clearly in Great Britain, where the socialist point of view isgaining ground among the masses, but which at present is a mixture ofnationalisation of the public utilities and of free enterprise—a combinationwhich may have true value, if preserved.There are other ideologies in the political, social and economic fields butthese with which I have dealt constitute a triangle of schemes undergoingnational and political experiments in different countries throughout the world.All of them have a religious and spiritual side; all of them are tainted withmaterialism; one of them is wickedly totalitarian and is finding followers;another is the victim of the stupid lack of interest of its people; another isin the throes of an experiment which may or may not prove successful. Under theimpact of these ideologies the spiritual growth of the human family is fostered,because the emerging spiritual factor (under the evolutionary law) is everpresent, and always there is to be found a tendency towards God and divineexpression. That is why the issue is stressed between Christianity andCommunism—a controversy emphasised by the Roman Catholic Church, but one intowhich the communistic nations are already drawing the Protestant churches.From the standpoint of the Hierarchy, these three ideologies are three aspectsof one great spiritual event; the outcome of the interplay between them caneventuate in an increased spiritual approach to divinity or (if the Forces ofLight do not triumph) they can drive mankind deeper into the pit or prison ofmaterialism. The intense political interest of the Catholic Church, plus itsgross materialism, acts as a great handicap to the steady gain of the spiritualposition; if however, the Catholic hierarchy can renounce or relinquish itsmaterial and political aims and present the love of God in its beauty, it can domuch to lead humanity out of darkness into light. If the United States canequally [748] renounce its gross materialism, it can give a lead to the worldalong spiritual lines which will be beyond anything yet demonstrated and, aidedby Great Britain, the two great democracies, expressing right human relationsand the fellowship of man, can do great things for the race. Great Britain islearning a sense of values, and being drawn away from materialism through greatprivation; it is hoped that she will consciously renounce materialism.I would like to remind you here that the spiritual Hierarchy of our planet caresnot whether a man is a democrat, a socialist or a communist, or whether he is aCatholic, a Buddhist, or an unbeliever of any kind. It cares only thathumanity—as a whole—avail itself of spiritual opportunity. It is an opportunitywhich is present today in a more compelling way than ever before.2. Man's steady Awakening to better UnderstandingThe general effect of these clashing ideologies and the result of the war amongthe world religions have started men thinking in every land. Men are emergingout of the mental lethargy which has characterised them for so long. The man inthe street is today thinking, pondering, wondering, planning and deciding. Inpast centuries, it was only those who had benefited by education and those inthe “upper brackets” who thought and planned. This tendency to thought indicatesthe coming into activity of a new and better civilisation, and this ispreparatory to spiritual events of major importance. The spirit of man, usuallyunconsciously, is driving onwards towards a more spiritual civilisation andculture. I did not say towards a more religious expression of truth. A morespiritual inter-relation is on its way and the establishing on a worldwide scaleof right human relations indicates this. We shall have eventually a spiritualfocussing which will be divorced from the present orthodox religions, but whichwill be in tune with the hidden, spiritual factor in all religions. Men are not,in reality, looking for the Christ to come as a religious leader; they look forHim to come to them in the field of [749] their greatest need, to point the wayto resurrection and the revelation which will inevitably follow man'srenunciation of the material values.The prevalent spirit of expectancy and of a truly divine discontent are theguarantees that this second spiritual event is a real factor in our time. Manyfactors contribute to this awakening. In most countries, through the radio,through the newspapers, through books, magazines and travel, through lecturesand forums and simplified human intercourse (to which the automobile and theairplane have greatly contributed) men everywhere are free to know and tounderstand. This is, of course, not true of those countries where the freedom ofthe human spirit is attacked. There are two ways in which that freedom of choicecan be infringed: First, as in Russia, by keeping the citizenry in ignorance ofworld affairs, and secondly, by giving them biassed news and misinformation, ora garbled or distorted slant on world affairs, as is the case in most othercountries, particularly in the United States. An instance of this can be seen inthe fact that the Arabs never got a true hearing in the American newspapers oron the radios; the American people were “pressured” (I think that that is theword you use) into an acceptance of the Zionist position—the motive being oiland mineral riches.But the mentality of man is daily developing and his ability to grasp worldaffairs is growing. That is one of the greatest of spiritual events and is thefoundational fact which makes the life of the soul and the growth of intuitiveperception possible on a large scale. This is a by-product of the clash of theideologies, but is the true and beautiful result of the universal educationalsystem which—faulty though it may be and is—has made it possible for all men toread, to write and to communicate with each other.3. The Growth of Goodwill and the Revelation of CleavagesThe result of the world war, of disease, famine and pain, has developed a spiritof community in suffering and [750] in deprivation; this has led to a consequentunderstanding participation in human difficulties everywhere which is rapidlychanging into a spirit of world goodwill.This worldwide goodwill, when truly established and correctly organised, is theneeded preliminary to revelation, for this coming revelation will be a planetaryrevelation, shared by all men everywhere. Unitedly all men realise, even today,the need to rise out of the prison of self-interest into the freedom of sharedopportunity, and the factor which will bring about this resurrection isgoodwill.One interesting aspect of goodwill is that, as it develops in the humanconsciousness, it first of all brings a revelation of the existent cleavageswhich distinguish the political, the religious, the social and the economic lifeof people everywhere. The revelation of a cleavage is ever accompanied (for suchis the beauty of the human spirit) by efforts along all possible lines to bridgeor heal the cleavage. This is testified to by the thousands of groups andorganisations working to end cleavages and to pull down the barriers to righthuman relationships. That these efforts may be faulty and fruitless is often ofless importance than the fact that the attempts to heal, to help and toestablish right human relations are everywhere being made. Modern psychology isan evidence of this, dealing as it does with the problem of the integration ofthe human being and the healing of the cleavages of his nature. One of the firstthings to be done is to educate the individual in the necessity to have goodwillnot only to his fellowmen but also to himself. The emphasis of medievalChristianity upon weakness, wickedness and the innate sinfulness of the humanbeing has today to be of offset by a true appreciation of divinity in humanform.It is not possible to list the cleavages which represent men's failure toestablish and hold good and decent relationships with their fellowmen; there aretoday cleavages between man and man, between group and group, and also betweenreligions and between nations. The terminology which will express goodrelations, instead of these, already [751] exists: Union, United, League,Federation, Commonwealth, Right Understanding, Kindness, Human Welfare and manysimilar terms; they mean, as yet, but little. Some day, however, they will standfor certain substantial realities, but that day is not immediate. The concept ofeasier, unified and happy relations is nevertheless existent in the minds ofmany thousands everywhere, and the factual reality will materialise some day.The first step is the wholesome recognition that cleavages exist; it is herethat goodwill can do its most useful and necessary work. I do not intend here tostress the nature of that work or state how it should be carried forward. That Ihave done already many times. It is the cultivation of a spiritual attitude thatis needed and the dedication, at all times, and in every possible way, to thewill-to-good. The majority of the existent cleavages are now recognised; thedelay comes in the task of bridging them and also in shouldering responsibility.Many nations, and especially the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A., are prompt toadjudicate blame, to point out errors and to advise other nations what is wrongand how to put it right. They both need to clean house themselves and attend tothe righting of the wrongs within their own borders. The same is true of allnations, but the others are not so openly engaged in telling other peoples whatthey should do. Why, for instance, should the U.S.A. deal with the problem ofthe Indonesian strife and seek to force the Dutch to do what Americans feelshould be done, and (at the same time) give not constitutional aid to the justcause of the Negro minority within the States? Why accuse other nations ofconstant wrong doing, as does Russia, and of breaking treaties, when Russiafails on all points to keep her word or to cooperate in righting world affairs?The task which the Hierarchy wishes to see accomplished at this time is thespread of goodwill; each person, community and nation should begin with adiagnosis of their own attitude towards goodwill, and then set an example byeliminating cleavages in the home, the business, [752] or the nation. Goodwillis contagious ; once a definite start has been made in a pure and disinterestedspirit, goodwill will permeate the world and right human relations will berapidly established. The healing of cleavages is a practical matter. The Spiritof Synthesis, working through the great first ray Avatar (the Avatar ofSynthesis) is closer to the Earth than ever before, and the clarity which willemerge in the Light of His Presence is already available; the tendency tointegration can therefore be more easily fostered and a new synthesis attainedamong men. Before, however, integration and synthesis are possible, this firstray energy must work to destroy all that prevents integration and all that ishindering a needed synthesis. Human beings themselves must also destroy theprejudices, the animosities and the fixed ideas which have prevented synthesis,which have created cleavages and hindered right understanding.4. The partial Sealing of the Door where Evil dwellsJust what do these words mean? More than I can tell you or put into words, forthe problem of evil is too difficult a one for the average man to grasp. Theproblem of the Hierarchy (if I may put it both accurately and yet symbolically)is to liberate the good, free the beautiful, release the true and “immure inprison under seal” that which is not good, that which breeds ugliness and hate,and that which distorts the truth and lies about the future. I have chosen allthese words with care; their meaning is obvious, but there are significances fartoo deep and dangerous for you to grasp.It has been humanity—cumulatively and over millions of years—which has releasedevil into the world. Thoughts of hate, deeds of cruelty, lying words, sadisticaction, selfish intentions and the foulest kind of ambitious selfishness havecreated a pathway to the “door where evil dwells.” Evil is in reality of twokinds: There is that innate tendency to selfishness and to separation which isinherent in the substance of our planet; of it all forms are made and ourplanetary Logos inherited it from the residue left over [753] from a previoussolar system. That is something unavoidable and something that provides mankindwith a needed opportunity and one which men are well equipped to handle andcontrol. There is that in them which can transmute and change it, and it is thisthat basically constitutes the Science of Redemption.But humanity has not chosen to exert itself in this redemptive activity, and forthousands of years has been controlled by that which is material; it has thusconstructed the “broad and easy way” which leads to the place where another kindof evil dwells—an evil which is not indigenous to our planet, an evil with whichit was never intended that men should deal. For untold aeons, the Hierarchy hasstood like a shield, guarding humanity. But with the coming of a greatlyincreased mental development, with the repudiation of the Hierarchy by the bulkof humanity, and by the prostitution of religion to material ends and narrowtheological and mental tenets, the Hierarchy has been forced (much against itswill) to withdraw some measure of its protecting power (though not all of it,fortunately for mankind). The way to the door where evil dwells was unimpeded,and humanity opened wide the door. The entrance for what might be regarded ascosmic evil was first opened in the decadent days of the Roman Empire (which wasone reason why the Christ chose to manifest in those days), was opened widerunder the corrupt regime of the Kings of France and, in our own day, has beenopened still wider by evil men in every land.Remember that the evil to which I refer here is not necessarily the foul andvile things about which people speak with bated breath. These are largelycurable and the processes of incarnation eventually purify them. The true natureof cosmic evil finds its major expression in wrong thinking, false values andthe supreme evil of materialistic selfishness and the sense of isolatedseparativeness. These (to speak again in symbols) are the weights which keep thedoor of evil open and which precipitated upon the world the horrors of war, withall its attendant disasters.[754] The realisation of what was happening did more temporarily to unify theworld and heal the cleavages among nations than any other thing. The nations ofthe world allied themselves with the Forces of Light to a very large extent, andlittle by little, cosmic evil was forced back and the door which “conceals theplace of endless death and hides the countenances of the Lords of wicked prideand hateful lust” was partially closed, but not entirely shut; its final closingand sealing is not yet accomplished.There are certain areas of evil in the world today through which these forces ofdarkness can reach humanity. What they are and where they are I do not intend tosay. I would point out, however, that Palestine should no longer be called theHoly Land; its sacred places are only the passing relics of three dead and gonereligions. The spirit has gone out of the old faiths and the true spirituallight is transferring itself into a new form which will manifest on eartheventually as the new world religion. To this form all that is true and rightand good in the old forms will contribute, for the forces of right will withdrawthat good, and incorporate it in the new form. Judaism is old, obsolete andseparative and has no true message for the spiritually-minded which cannot bebetter given by the newer faiths; the Moslem faith has served its purpose andall true Moslems await the coming of the Imam Mahdi who will lead them to lightand to spiritual victory; the Christian faith also has served its purpose; itsFounder seeks to bring a new Gospel and a new message that will enlighten allmen everywhere. Therefore, Jerusalem stands for nothing of importance today,except for that which has passed away and should pass away. The “Holy Land” isno longer holy, but is desecrated by selfish interests, and by a basicallyseparative and conquering nation.The task ahead of humanity is to close the door upon this worst and yetsecondary evil and shut it in its own place. There is enough for humanity to doin transmuting planetary evil without undertaking to battle with that which theMasters Themselves can only keep at bay, but [755] cannot conquer. The handlingof this type of evil and its dissipation, and therefore the release of ourplanet from its danger, is the destined task of Those Who work and live in “thecentre where the Will of God is known,” at Shamballa; it is not the task of theHierarchy or of humanity. Remember this, but remember also that what man hasloosed he can aid to imprison; this he can do by fostering right humanrelations, by spreading the news of the approach of the spiritual Hierarchy, andby preparing for the reappearance of the Christ. Forget not also, the Christ isa Member of the Great Council at Shamballa and brings the highest spiritualenergy with Him. Humanity can also cease treading the path to the “door whereevil dwells” and can remove itself and seek the Path which leads to light and tothe Door of Initiation.5. The Use of the Great InvocationSome time ago I gave out to the world—under instruction from the Christ—anInvocation that is destined to become of major usefulness in bringing aboutcertain great events. These are:> 1. An outpouring of love and light upon mankind, from Shamballa.> 2. An invocatory appeal to the Christ, the Head of the Hierarchy, to reappear.> 3. The establishing on earth of the divine Plan, to be accomplished willingly> by humanity itself.Incidentally, these three events are relatively near and will be brought aboutby a conscious working out of the immediate phase of the plan, which it is thedivine intention to bring about to a certain extent, before the reappearance ofthe Christ. The establishing of right human relations is the immediate task andis that phase of the Plan of Love and Light to which humanity can most easilyrespond and for which they are already evidencing a sense of responsibility.Little attention has been paid to the factor of invocation as expressed by thepeople of the world; yet down the [756] ages the invocative cry of humanity hasrisen to the Hierarchy and brought response. Some day a scientific study will bemade of the great world prayers, spiritual statements and invocative appeals andtheir relation to world events; this relationship will become illuminatinglyapparent and the result will be a closer linking of earth and the spiritualcentres of love and life. This has not yet been done. Let me illustrate: Thespiritual statement by Shri Krishna, to be found in the Lord's Song, theBhagavad Gita, was an announcement, preparatory to the coming of the Christ. Inthat Song He says:“Whenever there is a withering of the Law and an uprising of lawlessness on allsides, then I manifest Myself. For the salvation of the righteous and thedestruction of such as do evil, for the firm establishing of the Law, I come tobirth in age after age.”In the lawless and wicked period of the Roman Empire, the Christ came.Another instance of a notable and most ancient invocation is to be found in theGayatri where the people invoke the Sun of Righteousness in the words: “Unveilto us the face of the true spiritual Sun, hidden by a disk of golden light, thatwe may know the truth and do our whole duty, as we journey to Thy sacred Feet.”To this we should also add the Four Noble Truths, as enunciated by the Buddhaand which are so well known to all of us, summarising as they do the causes andthe sources of all the troubles which concern humanity. There are manytranslations of these truths to which I have referred; they all convey the samelonging and appeal and they are all essentially correct as to meaning. Duringthe Jewish dispensation, there was given a statement as to human conduct in thewords of the Ten Commandments; upon these, human law has been based and uponthem the laws governing the relationships of people in the West have beenfounded. It has eventuated in a somewhat narrow conception of Deity; theseCommandments are didactic and [757] present the negative angle. Then Christ cameand gave to us the fundamental law of the universe, the law of love; He alsogave us the Lord's Prayer with its emphasis upon the Fatherhood of God, thecoming of the Kingdom and right human relations.Now the Great Invocation, as used by the Hierarchy itself, has been given out tothe world. So reactionary is human thinking that the claim made by me that it isone of the greatest of the world's prayers and is on a par with the other voicedexpressions of spiritual desire and intention will evoke criticism. That is ofno importance. Only a few—a very few—in the early days of Christianity employedthe Lord's Prayer, because it needed recording, expression in understandableterms, and adequate translation before its widespread use became possible. Thateffort took centuries to accomplish. Today, we have all the facilities for rapiddistribution and these have all been employed on behalf of the Great Invocation.The uniqueness connected with the Invocation consists in the fact that it is, inreality, a great method of integration. It links the Father, the Christ andhumanity in one great relationship. Christ emphasised ever the Fatherhood of Godand substituted it in place of the cruel, jealous tribal Jehovah of the nationto which He had gone for a physical vehicle. Christ was a Jew. In the 17thchapter of St. John's Gospel (which is another of the major spiritual statementsof the world) Christ emphasised the relation of the Christ consciousness to theconsciousness of Deity itself. He linked the concept of the Monad to the fullydeveloped soul-infused personality, and the underlying unity existing betweenall beings in all forms and the Father. The possibility which He there expressedstill remains distant, except in connection with the spiritual Hierarchy; it isgood, however, to remember that They have achieved a goal towards which all truedisciples and initiates are working. The Great Invocation relates the will ofthe Father (or of Shamballa), the love of the Hierarchy, and the service ofHumanity into one great Triangle of [758] Energies ; this triangle will have twomajor results: the “sealing of the door where evil dwells,” and the working outthrough the Power of God, let loose on earth through the Invocation, of the Planof Love and Light.This is no idle dream. From the angle of the human consciousness, the vehicle ofLight is, first of all, the great educational systems of the world, with theircapacity for improvement and for the extension of science along the lines of thebetterment of mankind, and not for its destruction as is so oft the case today;to this must be coupled the steady changing or conversion of scientificattainment, by the enlightenment which wisdom brings; this has in the pastsafeguarded human aspiration and human progress into light. In the light whichenlightenment brings we shall eventually see Light, and the day will come whenthousands of the sons of men and countless groups will be able to say withHermes and with Christ: “I am (or we are) the light of the world.”We are told by the Christ that men “love darkness rather than light becausetheir deeds are evil.” Nevertheless, one of the great emerging beauties of thepresent time is that light is being thrown into every dark place, and there isnothing hidden which shall not be revealed.When we invoke the Mind of God and say: “Let light stream forth into the mindsof men, let light descend on Earth,” we are voicing one of the great needs ofhumanity and—if invocation and prayer mean anything at all—the answer is certainand sure. When we find present in all people at all times, in every age and inevery situation, the urge to voice an appeal to the unseen spiritual Centre,there is a fixed surety that such a Centre exists. Invocation is as old as thehills or as old as humanity itself; therefore no other argument for itsusefulness or its potency is required.The usual invocative appeal has hitherto been selfish in its nature andtemporary in its formulation. Men have prayed for themselves; they have invokeddivine help for those they love; they have given a material interpretation totheir basic needs. The invocation, lately given to us by [759] the Hierarchy, isa world prayer; it has no personal appeal or temporal invocative urge; itexpresses humanity's need and pierces through all the difficulties, doubts andquestionings—straight to the Mind and the Heart of the One in Whom we live andmove and have our being—the One Who will stay with us until the end of timeitself and “until the last weary pilgrim has found his way home.”But the Invocation is not vague or nebulous. It voices the basic needs ofmankind today—the need for light and love, for understanding of the divine willand for the end of evil. It says triumphantly: “Let light descend on earth; mayChrist return to earth; let purpose guide the little wills of men; let the Planseal the door where evil dwells.” It then sums it all up in the clarion words:“Let light and love and power restore the Plan on Earth.” Always the emphasis islaid upon the place of appearance and of manifestation: the Earth.Already this Invocation is doing much to change world affairs—far more than mayappear to your eyes. Much remains to be done. I would ask all students, all menof goodwill and all who are participating in the work of the Triangles andhelping to build the network of light and goodwill, to do all that is possibleto spread the use of the Invocation. The year 1952 will be a year of spiritualcrisis and a year when it should prove possible to close more tightly the doorwhere evil dwells.The Invocation has been sent out by the combined Ashrams of the Masters and bythe entire Hierarchy; it is used by its Members with constancy, exactitude andpower. It will serve to integrate the two great centres: the Hierarchy andHumanity, and to relate them both in a new and dynamic manner to the “centrewhere the Will of God is known.”I ask you, therefore, during the coming years to prepare to use and distributethe Invocation and make it a major endeavour. I would have you call all thepeople in every country in the world (whom you are in a position to reach) to aunited voicing of the Invocation on the same day [760] in every land (WorldInvocation Day was launched in June 1952, and is held annually on the day of theJune (Gemini) Full Moon). I would ask you to collect all that I have said orwritten anent the Invocation and then prepare a brief manual as to its use andpurpose, putting a copy in the hands of all those who are willing to use it. Acomprehension of its origin, meaning and potency will render it far moreeffective. The year 1952 should see a major turning point in the thinking ofhumanity, in human goals and human affairs. For implementing this I would askyou to work.Here you have a short resume of the five most important spiritual results of thepresent century. The war itself has cleared the way for them. They are a naturaland normal outcome of the war and have arisen (with the exception of the GreatInvocation) out of the masses of the people and from their thinking; it was alsotheir unvoiced demand and the appeal of their suffering hearts which brought theInvocation to them.The two other spiritual events which I listed lie, as you know, still in thefuture. They are the closer approach of the members of the spiritual Hierarchyto our humanity; and the reappearance of the Christ. With these two points Iwill not deal. I have dealt with the last stupendous event in the book by thatname; and in the book, The Externalisation of the Hierarchy , I have dealtexhaustively with the emergence of the Hierarchy on to the physical plane.I am anxious to have you concentrate on the work which is preparatory to thesetwo “emergences”; seek to make the five spiritual events which are alreadywithin your working knowledge a definite part of your own spiritual endeavour.Let humanity constitute your field of service, and may it be said of you thatyou knew the spiritual facts and were a dynamic part of these spiritual events;may it not be said of you that you knew these things and did nothing about themand failed to exert yourself. Let not time slip by as you work.STANZAS FOR DISCIPLESTHE PATH [761]Seek not, O twice-blessed One, to attain the spiritual essence before the mindabsorbs. Not thus is wisdom sought. Only he who has the mind in leash, and seesthe world as in a mirror can be safely trusted with the inner sense. Only he whoknows the five senses to be but illusion, and that naught remains save the twoahead, can be admitted into the secret of the Cruciform transposed.The path that is trodden by the Server is the path of fire that passes throughhis heart and leads to the head. It is not on the path of pleasure, nor on thepath of pain that liberation may be taken or that wisdom comes. It is by thetranscendence of the two, by the blending of pain with pleasure, that the goalis reached, that goal that lies ahead, like a point of light seen in thedarkness of a winter's night. That point of light may call to mind the tinycandle in some attic drear, but—as the path that leads to that light is troddenthrough the blending of the pair of opposites—that pin point cold and flickeringgrows with steady radiance till the warm light of some blazing lamp comes to themind of the wanderer by the way.Pass on, O Pilgrim, with steady perseverance. No candle light is there nor earthlamp fed with oil. Ever the radiance grows till the path ends within a blaze ofglory, and the wanderer through the night becomes the child of the sun, andenters within the portals of that radiant orb.THE CUP OF KARMA [762]There is a cup held to the lips of those who drink, by four great Lords ofKarma. The draught within that cup must all be drained, down to the nethermostdrop, e'er it is possible to fill the cup with a purer, sweeter one. The sevenLords of cosmic Love await the hour of filling.The cup is naught. The draught within distils forth drop by drop. It will notall be drained until the final hour wherein the Pilgrim takes the cup. He liftsit from the hand of those Who, bending, hold it to his lips. Until that day thecup is held, and in inner blind dismay the Pilgrim drinks. After that hour helifts his head he sees the light beyond; he takes the cup and, with a radiantjoy, drains to the very dregs.The contents of the cup are changed; the bitter now becomes the sweet; the fieryessence then is lost in cool, life-giving streams. The fire absorbed within hasburned and scarred and seared. The draught now taken soothes the burns; it healsthe scars and permeates the whole.The Four bend down and see the work. They release the cup of Karma. The tenderLords of Cosmic Love then mix another draught, and—when the cup is empty seen(emptied by conscious will)—they pour within that which is needed now forbroader, larger living. Until the cup has once been used, filled, drained, andseen as naught, it cannot safely hold within that which is later given.But when to utter emptiness the Pilgrim drains the cup then to the world intorment now he turns. With cup in hand (drained once, filled again, and refusedto selfish need) he tends the need of struggling men who tread the way with him.The draught of love, of sacred fire, of cool, health-giving stream he lifts nottowards himself but holds it forth to others. Upon the road of weary man hebecomes a Lord of Power—power gained through work accomplished, power reachedthrough conscious will. Through the cup of Karma drained he gains the right toserve.Look on, O Pilgrim, to the goal. See shining far ahead [763] the glory thatenvelops and the light that naught can dim. Seize on the cup and swiftly drain,delay not for the pain. The empty cup, the steady hand, the firm and strongendeavour lead to a moment's agony and thence to radiant life.THE LISTENING PILGRIMListen, O Pilgrim, to the chanting of the Word by the great Deva Lords. Hush allearth vibration, still the restless strivings of lower mind, and with ear intenthark to the sounds that rise to the throne of the Logos. Only the pure in heartcan hear, only the gentle can respond.The stormy sounds of all earth struggle, the shrill vibration of the waterysphere, the crashing note marking the place of thought, dims the sound and shutsout the tone. He who is silent, quiet and calm within, who sees all by means oflight divine and is not led by light reflected within the threefold spheres, ishe who will shortly hear. From out the environing ether will strike a note uponhis ear unlike the tones that sound within the world terrestrial.Listen, O Pilgrim, for when that sound strikes in colourful vibration upon theinner sense, know that a point has been achieved marking a great transition.Watch then, O Pilgrim, for the coming of that hour. With purified endeavourmount nearer to that Sound. Know when its tone steals through the misty dawn, orin the mellow sunlight strikes soft upon the ear, that soon the inner hearingwill become expanded feeling and will give place to sight and perfectcomprehension.Know when the music of the spheres comes to you note by note, in misty dawn orsunny noon, at cool of eve, or sounding through the deep of night, that in theirrhythmic tone lies secret revelation.AN ESOTERIC FRAGMENT [764]Where is the gate, O Lanoo, which guards the triple-way?Within the sacred heart of Him Who is the threefold Path. I reach the gate andpass within, entering thus the Heart, through the means of wide compassion.How many gates are there, O Passer on the Way?The gates are seven, each leading to the centre of a great sphere of bliss. Bythe one who seeks to know, the first gate must be found. That entered, inperiodic cycles he will find the other six.You speak of wide compassion as the key that opens wide the gates. Explain inwords the simplest the need that this involves.The need of gentle mercy, which knows and sees yet understands; the need oftears of crystal to wash away a brother's sins; the need of fiery courage thatcan hold a brother's hand, and lift and elevate him though all the world cry“nay”; the need of comprehension, that has experienced and knows; the occultsense of oneness must guide unto the gate.What else will lead a man to the portal of the Path?Compassion first and conscious oneness; then death to every form that holds andhides the life; next wisdom linked with learning, and the wise use of the Word;speech of an occult nature and the silence of the Centre, held in the noise ofall the world.Can you, O Lanoo, blend these thoughts into a threefold charge?First Oneness, then the Word, and lastly Growth.HEALING [765]A centre of violet, orbed by yellow, melts into red. Yellow develops andprotects. It ensheaths the nucleus. When you attain the significance of violet,the laws of health and magnetic alleviation will be no longer sealed. The sealis being loosed by the devas of the shadows; the yellow approaches the violetand the red progresses. The ranks approach and cooperation is possible. Inloosening the seal the gateway opens. These three are the great Helpers and inTheir hands lies knowledge for the next generation. Approach.THE HIDDEN PORTALAn immense cone of fire is seen in the midst of an arid desert. A man stands infront of the scene in an attitude of indecision. The cone stands between the manand a fruitful country.Rises the cone from out the arid waste. Naught but its heat is felt, naught butits glare is seen. Its flames have swept the country and left the desert bare.It radiates forth a fire that devours all before it. All green things die andthe dwellers on the sphere recede before its flame, scorching and burning, crueland superb.White is its inner heart, red the surrounding flame, and yellow the spreadingfire. Like a mantle of fierce heat it shuts out the vision and obscures thebeyond. Like a pall of rosy red tinged with an orange deep it veils all thedistance.From out the country full and green, across the arid waste had travelled far thePilgrim. Naught had he held and kept, naught save his strong desire, back on theroad he might not go, but onward to the fire.From out that cone of fire, echoing from its heart, swift to his ears a voicethat said: “Behold the place of God.”From out the cone of fire a note fell on his ear that touched a chord within hisbreast, and awakened quick response.[766] Press on, O Pilgrim, towards the flame; brave the fierce ardour of thefire; enter within the portal which is hidden by its light.The door is there, unseen, unknown, watched by the Lords of Flame. Deep in theheart of yellow, close by the outer rim, lies the key that holds hid the secret.The threshold of that inner door, the step unseen that must be reached, willmeet the feet within the fringe of flame. Put forth the hand and touch the door,knock thrice with pure intent. A voice will answer to that call. The words willsound: “Who is it seeks the way?”THE KEYKey the first lies hid under the Threshold, guarded by the Watcher. He whobreaks in must stoop and seize after a search of strenuous decision. The handthat grasps the key must have the nail-mark through the centre there located.When this is so, door the first will open.Key the second lies across the Threshold, over the heap of thorns. From thecentres in the feet must pour the blood that dissolves all hindrances. In thebloodstained feet and the nail-marked hands lies hid the secret. Seek you them.Then door the second will open to your touch.Key the third lies half way up. Just at the level of the heart that key is seen.Before it can be seized and used the spear must pierce and thus the blood pourforth, cleansing and making whole. Only those thus purified can grasp the keyand pass through door the third.AN OCCULT MESSAGEThe key is found; and with the pressure of the hands in service of the Light andwith a beating heart of love, that key is turned. The door swings wide open.With hasty feet the one who hastens towards the light enters that doors thenwaits. He holds the door ajar for those who follow after and thus—inaction—waits.A Voice sounds forth: My brother, close that door, for [767] each must turn thekey with his own hand and each must enter through that door alone. The blazinglight within the Temple of the Lord is not for all at the same moment or thesame hour of each day. Each knows his hour. Your hour is Now.So, brother, close that door. Remember, those behind know not the door hasopened or the door has closed. They see it not. Rest on that thought, mybrother, and passing through the door close it with care, and enter upon anotherstage upon the upward Way—alone, yet not alone.THE CRUCIFIXIONIn the mystic Heart, with its two lobes, lies the key to the reservoir. In theout-going and the return the cross is made. Midway it stands, with the righthand and the left hand path on either side. There the man is crucified, with thetwo on either hand—one on the right and one on the left. In the apprehension ofthe key, in the opening and shutting of doors, lies life eternal. Know you andunderstand.THE CROSSIn the Cross is hidden Light. The vertical and horizontal in mutual frictioncreate; a vibrant Cross scintillates, and motion originates. When the verticalassumes the horizontal, pralaya supervenes. Evolution is the movement of thehorizontal to upright positiveness. In the secret of direction lies the hiddenwisdom; in the doctrine of absorption lies the healing faculty; in the pointbecoming the line, and the line becoming the cross is evolution. In the crossswinging to the horizontal lies salvation and pralayic peace.THE CHALICEThe lower chalice rises like a flower of colour dark or somber. Dull it appearsto the outer vision, but within a light will sometime shine and shatter theillusion.Chalice the second rises from out the lower sheath as does the flower from outthe calix green. Of colour rose it [768] is, and many shades thereof; and to theonlooker it seems as if the colour might transcend the inner shining light. Butthis is but illusion which time itself dispels.Chalice the third surmounts all and opens wide in time its outspread petals.Blue does it appear and blends with the rose, forming at first a deepimpenetrable shade which shuts out the light.Within the three, deep hidden in the heart, tiny at first yet ever waxinggreater, shines the light divine. This light, through radiating heat and innatedivine vibration, constructs for itself a sheath of iridescence. It emerges fromthe threefold chalice as a floating bubble alights on a flower.Within this iridescent sheath burns the inner Flame, and in its turn it burnsout the lower gross material. E'en as the Path is neared, clearer the lightshines out. Forth through the chalice gross and dark that forms the foundationshines the light supernal, till all who see the radiation cry out withinthemselves: “Behold, a God is here.”Forth from the chalice rosy red shines the inner glow, till soon the red ofearth desire becomes the glow of heaven's fire, and all is lost save aspirationthat shades not the cup with karmic colour.Forth from the chalice blue shines and glows the inner light divine till all theforms are burnt and gone, and naught is left save one divine abstraction. Naughtbut the shells remain below, naught but the forms for use, and at theculmination what strange event is seen? Tarry, O Pilgrim, at the strangeappearance, with bowed head watch the progress of the fire. Slowly the chalicethreefold merges into an altar, and from that triple altar mounts the fire untoits Source. As mounts and spreads the inner flame, the beauty of the centralsphere, lit with a radiance white, causes the worlds to stand and cry: “Behold,a God is here.”Ever the flames mount higher, ever the warmth streams forth, till—in the momentof the hour set—the flame destroys all, and all is gone, the work of agespasses, in a moment, into nothingness.But forth from the fourfold fire, up from the altar of [769] the ages, springsthe Liberated One, the Flame. Back to the fire of Cosmos springs the dual flame.Into the Three is absorbed the essence, and becomes one with its Source. TheSpark becomes the Flame, the Flame becomes the Fire, and forms part of the greatCosmic blaze that holds the secret of the Five hidden within the heart.A FIRE MANTRAMThe point of light within the glowing arc, O Pilgrim on the Way, waxes and wanesas application hard or not betrays the purpose within the heart.That point is ever there, unnoticed and unseen. Dark is the night and drear, andsore the heart of the unilluminated Pilgrim. Dark is the night but drearness isnot felt when within the gloomy portal is seen the bright illusive light, thelight that flickers ever on ahead, enticing with its gleam the Pilgrim everonward.Six times the light may wax and wane, six times the glow is felt, but at theseventh glowing hour the Flame bursts forth.Six times the Flame bursts forth, six times the burning starts, but at theseventh hour the altar is lost sight of and only Flame is seen.Six times the circle of the burning fire, six times the roaring furnace burnsand separates, but at the seventh naught is left save the ascending Flame, thatmounts to the Triadal Spirit.Six times the Flame mounts up, six times the cloud recedes, but at the seventhnaught is seen save everlasting fire.Six times the flames absorbs the water, six times the moisture disappears, butat the seventh great absorption naught is left save iridescent fire.Three times the fire envelops, three times the sun recedes; at time the fourththe work is done, and naught is left save Flame primordial. That Flame absorbs,revolves, receives, and remains. When all that is has traversed the Flame, thenTime is not.ARCANE SCHOOL TRAININGTraining for new age discipleship is providedby the Arcane School .
