I live in a physical body like other men, on theborders of Tibet, and at times (from the exoteric standpoint) preside over alarge group of Tibetan lamas, when my other duties permit. It is this fact thathas caused it to be reported that I am an abbot of this particular lamasery.Those associated with me in the work of the Hierarchy (and all true disciplesare associated in this work) know me by still another name and office. A.A.B.knows who I am and recognises me by two of my names.I am a brother of yours, who has travelled a little longer upon the Path thanhas the average student, and has therefore incurred greater responsibilities. Iam one who has wrestled and fought his way into a greater measure of light thanhas the aspirant who will read this article, and I must therefore act as atransmitter of the light, no matter what the cost. I am not an old man, as agecounts among the teachers, yet I am not young or inexperienced. My work is toteach and spread the knowledge of the Ageless Wisdom wherever I can find aresponse, and I have been doing this for many years. I seek also to help theMaster M. and the Master K.H. whenever opportunity offers, for I have been longconnected with Them and with Their work. In all the above, I have told you much;yet at the same time I have told you nothing which would lead you to offer methat blind obedience and the foolish devotion which the emotional aspirantoffers to the Guru and Master Whom he is as yet unable to contact. Nor will hemake that desired contact until he has transmuted emotional devotion intounselfish service to humanity—not to the Master.The books that I have written are sent out with no claim for their acceptance.They may, or may not, be correct, true and useful. It is for you to ascertaintheir truth by right practice and by the exercise of the intuition. Neither Inor A.A.B. is the least interested in having them acclaimed as inspiredwritings, or in having anyone speak of them (with bated breath) as being thework of one of the Masters. If they present truth in such a way that it followssequentially upon that already offered in the world teachings, if theinformation given raises the aspiration and the will-to-serve from the plane ofthe emotions to that of the mind (the plane whereon the Masters can be found)then they will have served their purpose. If the teaching conveyed calls forth aresponse from the illumined mind of the worker in the world, and brings aflashing forth of his intuition, then let that teaching be accepted. But nototherwise. If the statements meet with eventual corroboration, or are deemedtrue under the test of the Law of Correspondences, then that is well and good.But should this not be so, let not the student accept what is said.August 1934"},{"pageContent":"THE GREAT INVOCATIONFrom the point of Light within the Mind of GodLet light stream forth into the minds of men.Let Light descend on Earth.From the point of Love within the Heart of GodLet love stream forth into the hearts of men.May Christ return to Earth.From the centre where the Will of God is knownLet purpose guide the little wills of men—The purpose which the Masters know and serve.From the centre which we call the race of menLet the Plan of Love and Light work out.And may it seal the door where evil dwells.Let Light and Love and Power restore the Plan on Earth.“The above Invocation or Prayer does not belong to any person or group but toall Humanity.

THE FIELD OF TELEPATHIC INTERPLAY[1] One of the characteristics, distinguishing the group of world servers andknowers, is that the outer organisation which holds them integrated ispractically non-existent. They are held together by the inner structure ofthought and by a telepathic medium of inter-relation. The Great Ones, Whom weall seek to serve, are thus linked, and can—at the slightest need and with theleast expenditure of force—get en rapport with each other. They are all tuned toa particular vibration.In the new groups are collected together people who are very diverse in theirnature, who are found upon differing rays, who are of different nationalities,and who are each of them the product of widely varying environments andheredity. Besides these obvious factors which immediately attract attention,there is also to be found an equal diversity in the life experience of the soulsconcerned. The complexity of the problem is also tremendously increased when oneremembers the long road which each has travelled and the many factors (emergingout of a dim and distant past) which have contributed to make each person whathe now is. When, therefore, one dwells on the barriers and difficultiessupervening upon such diverse conditions, the question arises at once: Whatprovides the common meeting ground, and what makes it possible to have aninterplay between the minds involved? The answer to this question is ofparamount importance and necessitates a clear understanding.[2] When the Biblical words are used: “In Him we live and move and have ourbeing,” we have the statement of a fundamental law in nature and the enunciatedbasis of the fact which we cover by the rather meaningless word: Omnipresence .Omnipresence has its basis in the substance of the universe, and in what thescientists call the ether; this word “ether” is a generic term covering theocean of energies which are all inter-related and which constitute that onesynthetic energy body of our planet.In approaching, therefore, the subject of telepathy, it must be carefully bornein mind that the etheric body of every form in nature is an integral part of thesubstantial form of God Himself—not the dense physical form, but what theesotericists regard as the form-making substance. We use the word God to signifythe expression of the One Life which animates every form on the outer objectiveplane. The etheric or energy body, therefore, of every human being is anintegral part of the etheric body of the planet itself and consequently of thesolar system. Through this medium, every human being is basically related toevery other expression of the Divine Life, minute or great. The function of theetheric body is to receive energy impulses and to be swept into activity bythese impulses, or streams of force, emanating from some originating source orother. The etheric body is in reality naught but energy. It is composed ofmyriads of threads of force or tiny streams of energy, held in relation to theemotional and mental bodies and to the soul by their co-ordinating effect. Thesestreams of energy, in their turn, have an effect on the physical body and swingit into activity of some kind or another, according to the nature and power ofwhatever type of energy may be dominating the etheric body at any particulartime.[3] Through the etheric body, therefore, circulates energy emanating from somemind. With humanity in the mass, response is made unconsciously to the rulingsof the Universal Mind; this is complicated in our time and age by a growingresponsiveness to the mass ideas—called sometimes public opinion—of the rapidlyevolving human mentality. Within the human family are also found those whorespond to that inner group of Thinkers Who, working in mental matter, controlfrom the subjective side of life the emergence of the great plan and themanifestation of divine purpose.This group of Thinkers falls into seven main divisions and is presided over bythree great Lives or super-conscious Entities. These three are the Manu, theChrist, and the Mahachohan. These three work primarily through the method ofinfluencing the minds of the adepts and the initiates. These latter in theirturn influence the disciples of the world, and these disciples, each in his ownplace and on his own responsibility, work out their concept of the plan and seekto give expression to it as far as possible. It is, therefore, as you cansurmise, a process of stepping down rates of vibration until they aresufficiently heavy to affect physical plane matter and thus make possible thebuilding of organised effects on the physical plane. These disciples havehitherto worked very much alone except when karmic relationships have revealedthem to each other, and telepathic intercommunication has been fundamentallyconfined to the Hierarchy of adepts and initiates, both in and out ofincarnation, and to Their individual work with Their disciples.It is, however, now deemed possible to establish a resembling condition and atelepathic relation between disciples on the physical plane. No matter wherethey may find themselves, this group of mystics and knowers will [4] eventuallyfind it feasible to communicate with one another and frequently do even now. Abasic mystical idea or some new revelation of truth is suddenly recognised bymany and finds expression simultaneously through the medium of many minds. Noone person can claim individual right to the enunciated principle or truth.Several minds have registered it. It is usually stated, however, in a widegeneralisation, that these people have tapped the inner thought currents or haveresponded to the play of the Universal Mind. Literally and technically this isnot so. The Universal Mind is tapped by some member of the planetary Hierarchyaccording to His mental bias and equipment, and the immediate needs sensed bythe working adepts. He then presents the new idea, new discovery, or the newrevelation to the group of adepts (telepathically, of course, my brother) and,when it has been discussed by them, He later presents it to His group ofdisciples. Among them He will find one who responds more readily andintelligently than the others and this one, through his clear thinking and thepower of his formulated thoughtforms, can then influence other minds. Theseothers grasp the concept as theirs; they seize upon it and work it out intomanifestation. Each regards it as his special privilege so to do and, because ofthis specialising faculty and his automatically engendered responsibility, hethrows back of it all the energy which is his, and works and fights for histhoughtforms.An illustration of this is to be found in the history of the League of Nations.Before He took up special work, the Master Serapis sought to bring through someconstructive idea for the helping of humanity. He conceived of a world unity inthe realm of politics which would work out as an intelligent banding of thenations for the preservation of international peace. He presented it to theadepts in conclave and it was felt that something could be done. [5] The MasterJesus undertook to present it to His group of disciples as He was working in theoccident. One of these disciples on the inner planes, seized upon the suggestionand passed it on (or rather stepped it down) until it registered in the brain ofColonel House. He, not recording the source (of which he was totally unaware),passed it on in turn to that sixth ray aspirant, called Woodrow Wilson. Then,fed by the wealth of analogous ideas in the minds of many, it was presented tothe world. It should be borne in mind that the function of a disciple is tofocus a stream of energy of some special kind upon the physical plane where itcan become an attractive centre of force and draw to itself similar types ofideas and thought currents which are not strong enough to live by themselves orto make a sufficiently strong impact upon the human consciousness.In union is strength. This is the second law governing telepathic communication.The first law is:1. The power to communicate is to be found in the very nature of substanceitself. It lies potentially within the ether, and the significance of telepathyis to be found in the word omnipresence.The second law is:2. The interplay of many minds produces a unity of thought which is powerfulenough to be recognised by the brain.Here we have a law governing a subjective activity and another law governingobjective manifestation. Let us voice these laws in the simplest mannerpossible. When [6] each member of the group can function in hismind-consciousness, untrammelled by the brain or the emotional nature, he willdiscover the universality of the mental principle which is the first exotericexpression of the soul consciousness . He will then enter into the world ofideas, becoming aware of them through the sensitive receiving plate of the mind.He then seeks to find those who respond to the same type of ideas and who reactto the same mental impulse, simultaneously with himself. Uniting himself to themhe discovers himself to be en rapport with them.The understanding of the first law produces results in the mind or mental body.The understanding of the second law produces results in a lesser receivingstation, the brain. This is possible through the strengthening of a man’s ownmental reaction by the mental reaction of others, similarly receptive. It willbe found therefore that this process of communication, governed by these twolaws, has always been in operation among the adepts, the initiates and thesenior disciples who are in physical plane bodies. Now the operation of thisprocess is to be extended and steadily developed by the emerging group ofmystics and world servers who constitute, in embryo, the world Saviour.Only those who know something of the meaning of concentration and meditation andwho can hold the mind steady in the light will be able to understand the firstlaw and comprehend that interplay of thought-directed energies which finds oneterminal of expression in the mind of some inspired Thinker, and the otherterminal in the mind of the attentive world server who seeks to tune in on thosemind processes which hold the clue to ultimate world salvation. Thethought-directing energy has for its source a Thinker Who can enter into thedivine Mind, owing to His having transcended human limitation; thethought-directed receiver [7] is the man, in exoteric expression, who hasaligned his brain, his mind, and his soul.It is a fact that omnipresence, which is a law in nature and based on the factthat the etheric bodies of all forms constitute the world etheric body, makesomniscience possible. The etheric body of the planetary Logos is swept intoactivity by His directed will; energy is the result of His thoughtform playingin and through His energy body. This thoughtform embodies and expresses Hisworld Purpose. All the subhuman forms of life and the human forms up to thestage of advanced man are governed by divine thought through the medium of theirenergy bodies which are an integral part of the whole. They react, however,unconsciously and unintelligently. Advanced humanity, the mystics and theknowers, are becoming increasingly aware of the mind which directs theevolutionary process. When this awareness is cultivated and the individual mindis brought consciously into contact with the mind of God as it expresses itselfthrough the illumined mind of the Hierarchy of adepts, we shall have the steadygrowth of omniscience. This is the whole story of telepathic interplay in thetrue sense; it portrays the growth of that oligarchy of elect souls who willeventually rule the world, who will be chosen so to rule, and who will berecognised by the mass as eligible for that high office through theco-ordination that they have established between:1. The universal mind.2. Their individual mind illumined by the soul consciousness.3. The brain, reacting to the individual mind, and4. The group of those whose minds and brains are similarly tuned andtelepathically related.[8] In connection with disciples and aspirants to discipleship, it is presumedthat their minds are somewhat attuned to the soul; that they are also so alignedthat the soul, mind and brain are coordinated and are beginning to function as aunit. This is the individual responsibility. Now comes the task of learning tobe responsive to the group and to find and contact those minds which areenergised by similar thought currents. This has to be cultivated. How, mybrother, shall this be done? Let us consider the various types of telepathicwork.The undeveloped human being and the unthinking, non-mental man or woman can beand often are telepathic, but the centre through which they work is the solarplexus. The line of communication is, therefore, from solar plexus to solarplexus. This is therefore instinctual telepathy and concerns feeling in everycase. It involves, invariably, radiations from the solar plexus, which in thecase of the animal world serves usually as the instinctual brain. This type oftelepathic communication is definitely a characteristic of the animal body ofman, and one of the best illustrations of this telepathic rapport is thatexisting between a mother and her child. It is this type of telepathy which ispredominantly present in the average spiritualistic seance. There the medium,quite unconsciously, sets up a telepathic rapport with the people in the circle.Their feelings, worries, sorrows, and desires become apparent and form part ofthe reading, so called. Both the sitters and the medium are functioning throughthe same centre. With this class of medium, and in this type of seance, thehighly intelligent and mentally polarised man or woman will learn nothing, andwill probably receive no messages, unless faked. Hence, therefore, when it comesto scientific investigation by trained minds, physical phenomena haspredominated and not the more subtle forms of psychism. Where [9] the moresubtle forms of super- or extra-sensory perception have been involved, thesubjects have been either adolescent or in their early twenties and have beenprimarily and rightly focussed in the emotional-feeling body. This is true evenwhen they are highly intellectual.This form of telepathic communication is therefore of two kinds, with the solarplexus always involved:a. It will be from solar plexus to solar plexus between two people who areordinary, emotional, governed by desire, and primarily centred in the astral andanimal bodies.b. It will be between such a “solar plexus” person, if I may so call him, and ahigher type whose solar plexus centre is functioning actively but whose throatcentre is also alive. This type of person registers in two places—provided thatthe thought sensed and sent out by the solar plexus person has in it somethingof mental substance or energy. Pure feeling and entirely emotional emanationsbetween people necessitate only solar plexus contact.Later, when group work in telepathy is undertaken, the centres of transmissionwherein high and consecrated feeling, devotion, aspiration and love areconcerned and where the groups work with pure love, communication will be fromheart to heart, and from a group heart to another group heart. The phrase “heartto heart talk,” so often used, is usually a misnomer at this time, but will someday be true. At present it is usually a solar plexus conversation!The second form of telepathic work is that of mind to mind, and it is with thisform of communication that the highest investigation is at this time concerned.Only mental types are involved, and the more that emotion and feeling [10] andstrong desire can be eliminated, the more accurate will be the workaccomplished. The strong desire to achieve success in telepathic work, and thefear of failure, are the surest ways to offset fruitful effort. In all such workas this, an attitude of non-attachment and a spirit of ‘don’t care’ are of realassistance. Experimenters along this line need to give more time and thought tothe recognition of types of force. They need to realise that emotion, and desirefor anything, on the part of the receiving agent create streams of emanatingenergy which rebuff or repulse that which seeks to make contact, such as thedirected thought of someone seeking rapport. When these streams are adequatelystrong, they act like a boomerang and return to the emanating centre, beingattracted back there by the power of the vibration which sent them forth. Inthis thought lies hid the cause of:a. The failure on the part of the broadcasting or transmitting agent. Intensedesire to make a satisfactory impression will attract the outgoing thought backagain to the transmitter.b. The failure on the part of the receiving agent whose own intense desire to besuccessful sends out such a stream of outgoing energy that the stream ofincoming energy is met, blocked and driven back whence it came; or, if thereceiver is aware of this and seeks to stem the tide of his desire, hefrequently succeeds in surrounding himself with a wall of inhibited desirethrough which naught can penetrate.II. TELEPATHIC WORK[11] Telepathy and the allied powers will only be understood when the nature offorce, of emanations and radiations, and of energy currents, is better grasped.This is rapidly coming about as science penetrates more deeply into the arcanaof energies and begins to work—as does the occultist—in the world of forces.It should also be borne in mind that it is only as the centres employed areconsciously used that we have that carefully directed work which will befruitful of results. For instance, an emotional person, using primarily thesolar plexus centre, will be endeavouring to enter into rapport with a mentaltype. From this will result only confusion. The two parties concerned are usingdifferent centres and are sensitive to certain types of force and closed toothers. Again, some people, even if mentally polarised and therefore sensitiveto similar vibrations attempt to make a telepathic contact when one party isunder emotional strain and therefore not responsive, or one party is intensivelyoccupied with some mental problem and is encased in a wall of thoughtforms andtherefore impervious to impressions. You can see, therefore, how a cultivationof detachment is a necessary qualification for success in telepathic work.All who seek to tread the Path of Discipleship are endeavouring to live in thehead centre, and—through meditation—to bring in the power of the soul. Theproblem which you face, as disciples learning telepathic sensitivity, is foundedon two things:a. Upon which of your three bodies is the most active; thereby is indicatedwhere you live subjectively most of the time. [12]b. Upon which centre is the most expressive in your equipment, and through whichyou contact most easily modern living conditions. I mean by these words: where,literally speaking, your life energy is predominantly focussed and your sentientenergy expresses itself the most.An understanding of this will make you better able to work and to makeintelligent experiment. Therefore, watch yourselves with care yet impersonally,and work out the why and the wherefore of the effects produced, for by thismeans you will learn.The third type of telepathic work is that from soul to soul. This is the highesttype of telepathic work possible to humanity and is that form of communicationwhich has been responsible for all the inspirational writings of real power, theworld Scriptures, the illumined utterances, the inspired speakers, and thelanguage of symbolism. It only becomes possible where there is an integratedpersonality, and, at the same time, the power to focus oneself in the soulconsciousness. The mind and the brain have, at the same time, to be brought intoperfect rapport and alignment.It is my intention to elucidate further this science of communication, whichstarted through the sense of touch and developed through sound, symbols, wordsand sentences, languages, writing, art, and on again to the stage of highersymbols, vibratory contact, telepathy, inspiration and illumination. I have,however, in the above, dealt with the general outline and we will take thespecific details later.The work of the telepathic communicators is one of the most important in thecoming new age, and it will be of value to gain some idea of its significanceand techniques. I [13] would, in summarising the above instruction, state thatin connection with individuals:1. Telepathic communication isa. Between soul and mind.b. Between soul, mind and brain.This is as far as interior individual development is concerned.2. When it is found between individuals, telepathic communication isa. Between soul and soul.b. Between mind and mind.c. Between solar plexus and solar plexus, and therefore purely emotional.d. Between all these three aspects of energy simultaneously, in the case of veryadvanced people.3. Telepathic communication is also:a. Between a Master and His disciples or disciple.b. Between a Master and His group and a group or groups of sensitives andaspirants on the physical plane.c. Between subjective and objective groups.d. Between the occult Hierarchy and groups of disciples on the physical plane.e. Between the Hierarchy and the New Group of World Servers in order to reachhumanity and lift it nearer the goal.This concerns the new science of group telepathic communication, of which herdor mass telepathy (so well known) is the lowest known expression. Thisinstinctual telepathy which is shown by a flight of birds, acting as a unit, orthat animal telepathy which serves to govern so mysteriously the movements ofherds of animals, and the rapid transmission [14] of information among thesavage races and non-intelligent peoples—these are all instances of that lowerexternalisation of an inner spiritual reality. An intermediate stage of thisinstinctual activity, based largely on solar plexus reactions, can be seen inmodern mass psychology and public opinion. It is, as you know, predominantlyemotional, unintelligent, astral and fluidic in its expression. This is changingrapidly and shifting into the realm of what is called “intelligent publicopinion,” but this is, as yet, slow. It involves the activity of the throat andajna centres. We have, therefore:1. Instinctual telepathy.2. Mental telepathy.3. Intuitional telepathy.I would remind you right at the outset that sensitivity to the thoughts of one’sMaster, sensitivity to the world of ideas, and sensitivity to intuitionalimpressions are all forms of telepathic sensitivity.In any consideration of this theme, it is obvious that there are three majorfactors which must be considered:1. The initiating agent. I use this word with deliberate intent, as the power towork telepathically, both as initiating agent and as recipient, is closelyconnected with initiation, and is one of the indications that a man is ready forthat process.2. The recipient of that which is conveyed to him on the “wings of thought.”3. The medium through which it is intended to convey the transfer of thought, ofidea, of wish, of imprint, and therefore of some form of knowledge.[15] This is the simplest statement of the elementary mechanics of the process.This indicates, likewise, the most elementary comprehension of the thoughtcovered so frequently by the Bhagavad Gita in the words which we have translatedin the West by the terms: the Knower, the Field of Knowledge, and the Known. Youhave oft been told that every sacred book, such as the Bhagavad Gita , forinstance, has various interpretations, dependent upon the point in evolution ofthe reader, or seeker after truth. This interpretation of the Bhagavad Gita interms of Communicator, Communication and Communicant still demands elucidation,and in the idea which I have above conveyed to you, I have given you a hint.III. THREE TYPES OF TELEPATHY[16] Let us now discuss in some detail the three types of telepathy enumeratedabove: instinctual telepathy, mental telepathy, and intuitional telepathy. Thesethree produce differing modes of activity and tap (to use a familiar word)differing areas of communication.1. Instinctual telepathy is based upon those impacts of energy which come fromone etheric body and make an impression upon another. The medium ofcommunication employed is, as we have seen, the etheric substance of all bodies,which is necessarily one with the etheric substance of the planet. The areaaround the solar plexus (though not in direct relation to that centre as itexists as an instrument differentiated from all other instruments or centres) issensitive to the impact of etheric energy, for this area in the etheric body isin direct “touch” with the astral body, the feeling body. Also, close to thesolar plexus is found that centre near the spleen which is the direct instrumentfor the entrance of prana into the human mechanism. This instinctual response toetheric contact was the mode of communication in Lemurian times, and largelytook the place of thought and of speech. It concerned itself primarily with twotypes of impression: that which had to do with the instinct ofself-preservation, and that which had to do with self-reproduction. A higherform of this instinctual telepathy has been preserved for us in the expressionwe so frequently use, “I have a feeling that...,” and allied phrases. These aremore definitely astral in their implications and work through the astralsubstance, using the solar plexus area as a sensitive plate for impact andimpression.[17] One point should here be made clear, and upon it you should ponder. Thisastral (not etheric) sensitivity, or “feeling telepathy” is basically theAtlantean mode of communication, and involved finally the use of the solarplexus centre itself as the receiving agent; the emitting agent (if I may usesuch a phrase) worked, however, through the entire area of the diaphragm. It wasas though there appeared, through emergence, a gathering of forces or outgoingwaves of energy in that part of the human vehicle. The relatively wide area fromwhich the information was sent out acted as a large general distributor; thearea which received the impression, however, was more localised, involving onlythe solar plexus. The reason for this can be found in the fact that in Atlanteandays the human being was still unable to think , as we understand thinking. Thewhole lower part of the body, in a sense difficult for us to grasp, was given upto feeling; the communicator’s one thought-contribution was the name of therecipient, plus the name or noun form of that which was the idea to be conveyed.This embryo thought winged its way to its goal, and the powerful “feeling”apparatus of the solar plexus received it (acting like a magnet) and drew the“feeling impression” powerfully there, drawing thus upon the communicator. It isthis process which is pursued when, for instance, some mother “feels” that somedanger threatens her child, or that some happening is taking place in connectionwith her child. She is thus sometimes enabled to send, by the medium ofinstinctual love, a most definite warning. The solar plexus is involved wherethe recipient is concerned; the area around the diaphragm is involved where thecommunicator is concerned.2. In our race, the Aryan, instinctual telepathic work is still the majorexpression of this spiritual possibility, but at the same time mental telepathyis becoming increasingly [18] prevalent. This will be more and more so, as timegoes on. It is most difficult in this transition period to define, ordifferentiate, the peculiar areas involved, because the solar plexus is stillexceedingly active. What we have today is a mixture of instinctual telepathy andthe beginning of mental telepathy. This manifests, however, very seldom, andthen only in the educated classes. With the masses, instinctual telepathy isstill the mode of contact. The throat centre is primarily involved where mentaltelepathy is concerned; there is also sometimes a little heart activity andalways a measure of solar plexus reaction. Hence our problem. Frequently thecommunicator will send a message via the throat centre, and the recipient willstill use the solar plexus. This is the most frequent method, and I would askyou to remember this. The sending out of a message may involve, and frequentlydoes in connection with disciples, the throat centre, but the recipient willprobably use the solar plexus centre. The throat centre is the centre, parexcellence, or the medium, of all creative work. The heart and the throat,however, must eventually be used in synthesis. I stated the reason for thisearlier in the words: “Only from the heart centre can stream, in reality, thoselines of energy which link and bind together. It was for this reason that I haveassigned certain meditations which stimulated the heart centre into action,linking the heart centre (between the shoulder blades) to the head centre,through the medium of the higher correspondence to the heart centre, foundwithin the head centre (the thousand petalled lotus). This heart centre, whenadequately radiatory and magnetic, relates disciples to each other and to allthe world. It will also produce that telepathic interplay which is so much to bedesired and which is so constructively useful to the spiritualHierarchy—provided it is established within a group of pledged disciples, [19]dedicated to the service of humanity. They can then be trusted.” (Discipleshipin the New Age, I. Page 87)3. Intuitional telepathy is one of the developments upon the Path ofDiscipleship. It is one of the fruits of true meditation. The area involved isthe head and throat, and the three centres which will be rendered active in theprocess are the head centre, which is receptive to impression from highersources, and the ajna centre which is the recipient of the idealisticintuitional impressions; this ajna centre can then “broadcast” that which isreceived and recognised, using the throat centre as the creative formulator ofthought, and the factor which embodies the sensed or intuited idea.It will be apparent to you, therefore, how necessary it is to have a betterrecognition of the activity of the centres, as they are detailed in the Hinduphilosophy; and until there is some real understanding of the part the vitalbody plays as the broadcaster and as the recipient of feelings, thoughts andideas, there will be little progress made in the right understanding of modes ofcommunication.There is an interesting parallel between the three modes of telepathic work andtheir three techniques of accomplishment, and the three major ways ofcommunicating on Earth:Instinctual telepathy train travel, stations everywhere telegraph Mentaltelepathy ocean travel, ports on the periphery of all lands telephoneIntuitional telepathy air travel, landing place radioThat which is going on in connection with the human consciousness is everexternalised or finds its analogy upon the physical plane, and so it is inconnection with developed sensitivity to impression.There is still another way in which we can look at the entire subject ofresponse between broadcasting areas of [20] consciousness and the receivingareas of consciousness. We might list the divisions of this process. Much mustremain theoretical, and little can, as yet, be worked out in practice. However,let me list the various forms of telepathic work for your general instruction:1. Telepathic work from solar plexus to solar plexus . With this we have alreadydealt. This is closely connected with feeling, and little or no thought isinvolved; it concerns emotions (fear, hate, disgust, love, desire and many otherpurely astral reactions). It is carried on instinctively and below thediaphragm.2. Telepathic work from mind to mind . This is beginning to be possible, andmany more people are capable of this kind of communication than is now realised.People today do not know whence various mental impressions come, and thisgreatly enhances the complexity of life at this time and increases the mentalproblem of thousands.3. Telepathic work from heart to heart . This type of impression is thesublimation of the “feeling” response registered earlier upon the ladder ofevolution in the solar plexus. It concerns only group impressions, and is thebasis of the condition spoken of in the Bible in connection with the greatestSensitive humanity has ever produced, the Christ. There He is referred to as “Aman of sorrows and acquainted with grief,” but in this condition no personalsorrow or grief is involved. It is simply the consciousness of the sorrow of theworld and the weight of grief under which humanity struggles. “The fellowship ofChrist’s suffering” is the reaction of the disciple to the same world condition.This is the true “broken heart,” and is as yet a very rare thing to find. Theusual broken heart is literally a disrupted solar plexus centre, bringingcomplete demolition of what is occultly called “the centre of feeling,” andconsequently the wrecking of the nervous system. It is [21] really brought aboutby a failure to handle conditions as a soul.4. Telepathic work from soul to soul. This is, for humanity, the highestpossible type of work. When a man can begin, as a soul, to respond to othersouls and their impacts and impressions, then he is rapidly becoming ready forthe processes which lead to initiation.TWO OTHER GROUPS OF TELEPATHIC POSSIBILITIESThere are two other groups of telepathic possibilities which I would like tolist for you. They are possibilities only when the four above-mentioned groupsof telepathic impression are beginning to form a conscious part of thedisciple’s experience.5. Telepathic work between soul and mind. This is the technique whereby the mindis “held steady in the light,” and then becomes aware of the content of thesoul’s consciousness, an innate content, or that which is part of the group lifeof the soul on its own level, and when in telepathic communication with othersouls, as mentioned under our fourth heading. This is the true meaning ofintuitional telepathy. Through this means of communication the mind of thedisciple is fertilised with the new and spiritual ideas; he becomes aware of thegreat Plan; his intuition is awakened. One point should here be borne in mind,which is oft forgotten: The inflow of the new ideas from the buddhic levels,thus awakening the intuitional aspect of the disciple, indicates that his soulis beginning to integrate consciously and definitely with the Spiritual Triad,and therefore to identify itself less and less with the lower reflection, thepersonality. This mental sensitivity and rapport between soul and mind remainfor a long time relatively inchoate on the mental plane. That which is sensedremains too vague or too abstract for formulation. It is the stage of themystical vision and of mystical unfoldment.6. Telepathic work between soul, mind and brain. In [22] this stage the mindstill remains the recipient of impression from the soul but, in its turn, itbecomes a “transmitting agent” or communicator. The impressions received fromthe soul, and the intuitions registered as coming from the Spiritual Triad, viathe soul, are now formulated into thoughts; the vague ideas and the visionhitherto unexpressed can now be clothed in form and sent out as embodiedthoughtforms to the brain of the disciple. In time, and as the result oftechnical training, the disciple can in this way reach the mind and brains ofother disciples. This is an exceedingly interesting stage. It constitutes one ofthe major rewards of right meditation and involves much true responsibility. Youwill find more anent this stage of telepathy in my other books, particularly ATreatise on White Magic . (Pages 176-180, 415, 427-428, 477-478)This much that I have outlined here is practically all that concerns man in hisown inner individual contacts and work and training. There is, however, a wholerange of telepathic contacts which should be noted because they constitute thegoal for humanity.7. Telepathic work between a Master (the focal point of a group) and thedisciple in the world . It is an occult truth that no man is really admittedinto a Master’s group, as an accepted disciple, until he has become spirituallyimpressionable and can function as a mind in collaboration with his own soul.Prior to that he cannot be a conscious part of a functioning group on the innerplanes gathered around a personalised force, the Master; he cannot work in truerapport with his fellow disciples. But when he can work somewhat as a conscioussoul, then the Master can begin to impress him with group ideas via his ownsoul. He hovers then for quite a while upon the periphery of the group.Eventually, as his spiritual sensitivity increases, he [23] can be definitelyimpressed by the Master and taught the technique of contact. Later, the group ofdisciples, functioning as one synthetic thoughtform, can reach him and thusautomatically he becomes one of them. To those who have the true esoteric sense,the above paragraph will convey a good deal of information, hitherto hidden.8. Telepathic work between a Master and His group. This is the mode of workwhereby a Master trains and works through His disciples. He impresses themsimultaneously with an idea or an aspect of truth. By watching their reactions,He can gauge the united activity of the group and the simultaneity of theirresponse.9. Telepathic work between subjective and objective groups. I do not refer hereto the contact between an inner group of disciples, functioning consciously onthe subjective levels, and the outer form that group takes. I refer to an innergroup and a different outer group or groups. These groups, on both levels, canbe either good or bad, according to the quality or calibre of the grouppersonnel and their motives. This opens up a wide range of contacts and is oneof the ways in which the Hierarchy of Masters work, as individuals. It is,however, not possible for groups upon the outer plane to respond to this type ofcontact until the bulk of their members have the heart centre awakened. In thisconnection a most interesting point should be noted. The awakening of the heartcentre indicates inclusiveness, group appreciation and contact, also groupthought and group life-activity. Unless, however, the head centre is alsoawakened and active, the soul is not able to control, and this heart activityneed not necessarily be what we call good or spiritual activity. It is quiteimpersonal, like the sun, of which the heart is, as you know, the symbol. Itshines alike upon the good and the bad; and group activity, as a result of heartawakening, can include the bad groups [24] as well as the good groups. Thereforeyou can see the necessity of awakening the head centre and bringing in thecontrol of the soul aspect; and hence the emphasis laid upon character buildingand the need for meditation.10. Telepathic work between the Hierarchy of Masters as a group or a part of theHierarchy, and groups of disciples. There is little I can tell you about this,and you would not and could not understand. The experiment we are now making, inconnection with the New Group of World Servers, is related to this form oftelepathic work.Some of these forms of telepathic work have necessarily their distortedreflections on the physical plane. These you might like to ponder upon, andtrace the correspondences between them. What is “mass psychology” with itsunreasoning quality and its blind activity, but a massed reaction to solarplexus impressions as passed from group to group? What is “public opinion,” socalled, but vague mental reactions by the mass of men beginning to grope theirway on the mental plane, to the activity and play of more active and powerfulminds? The written and spoken words are not in themselves adequate to accountfor the display of modern opinion as we now have it. What is the apparentlyaccurate information, so rapidly circulated among the savage races, but anexpression of that instinctual telepathy which uses the vital body and thepranic fluids as its medium?IV. THREE TYPES OF ENERGY INVOLVED[25] Telepathic inter-relation between the members of a group grows through themedium of a constant attitude of reflective thought and a steadfast love foreach other. I would remind you that when I use these terms I am referring to thetwo major types of energy in the world today. Essentially, energy is activesubstance. These two types of force are of a vitality, potency and substance sosubtle and fine that they can work through and “force into activity” the pranicfluids which constitute the substance of the etheric body and to which Ireferred in a much earlier instruction. (A Treatise on the Seven Rays , II, 113)The telepathic work, therefore, is concerned with three types of energy whichdemonstrate as forces with the power to motivate:1. The force of love with its negative quality whicha. Attracts the needed material with which to clothe the idea, the thought orconcept to be transmitted; it is also the attractive agency utilised by therecipient. Therefore both transmitter and recipient work with the same agency,but the transmitter uses the love energy of the larger whole whilst therecipient concentrates, upon the transmitter, the love energy of his own nature.If this be so, you can see why I emphasise the necessity for love and fornon-criticism.b. Constitutes the coherent quality which links together the transmitter and therecipient, and which also produces the coherency of that which is transmitted.[26] It will be apparent to you consequently that it is only at this time thatwe can begin to look for a wider and more general expression in the world todayof the processes of telepathy, for only today is the love principle reallybeginning to affect the world on a large scale. Love of a cause, a party or anidea is becoming more and more prevalent, producing in the initial stages theapparently wide cleavages with which we are so familiar and by which we are sodistressed at this time, yet producing finally a dominance of the attitudes oflove which will heal breaches, and produce synthesis among the peoples. Love(not sentiment) is the clue to successful telepathic work. Therefore love oneanother with a fresh enthusiasm and devotion; seek to express that love in everypossible way—upon the physical plane, upon the levels of emotion, and throughright thought. Let the love of the soul sweep through all like a regeneratingforce.2. The force of mind. This is the illuminating energy which “lights the way” ofan idea or form to be transmitted and received. Forget not that light is subtlesubstance. Upon a beam of light can the energy of the mind materialise. This isone of the most important statements made in connection with the science oftelepathy.The success of this is dependent upon the alignment of the bodies of thetransmitter and the recipient. The double line of contact must be that of mentalenergy and brain electrical energy. The magnetic power of love to attractattention, to produce alignment, and to call forth rapport and understanding isnot all that is necessary in the new telepathy which will distinguish the newage. There must also be mental development and mental control.This form of telepathy is not a function of the animal soul, as in the case ofthe solar plexus contact and response [27] to messages by the emotionallypolarised man or woman. This telepathic rapport and response is a characteristicof the human soul working from mind to mind and from brain to brain. It isliterally a state of consciousness which is sufficiently conditioned by theintegrated mental person so that he is aware of and inclusive of the mentalstate and thought processes of another person.3. The energy of prana, or the etheric force of the vital body. This energy, byan act of the will and under the pressure of the magnetic power of love,responds to or is receptive to the dual energies mentioned above. The idea,thoughtform or mental impression which must be recorded in the brainconsciousness of the recipient opens a way in the pranic fluids and so controlstheir activity (which is as ceaseless as the thoughtform-making propensities ofthe chitta ) that the brain becomes responsive in two ways:a. It is rendered passive by the impact of the three types of energy, blendedand fused into one stream of force.b. It becomes actively responsive to the idea, impression, thoughtform, symbol,words, etc., which are being swept into the area of its conscious activity.Let me attempt to reduce the above information to practical simplicity, thusshowing how these three types of energy can be used in practical work:1. By the use of the energy of love in three ways:a. By sending out love (not sentiment) to your brothers at the time oftransmission or reception. [28]b. By capitalising on the inherent power of love to attract the material or thesubstance, and thus to “clothe” in the occult sense that which you send out.c. By sending forth the “clothed” idea, impression, etc., on a stream of lovewhich your brother—alert, receptive and waiting—will attract to himself by themeans of his conscious love for you.2. By the use of mental energy through the effort to polarise yourself upon themental levels of consciousness. By a definite act of the will you lift yourconsciousness onto the mental plane and hold it there. This action is areflection upon a lower plane, and in the brain consciousness , of the mind’sability to hold itself in the light. The success of all telepathic work you do,as a group or as individuals, will be dependent upon your capacity to “holdyourselves steady in the light” mentally. The difference is that this time youdo it for the purpose of the planned work, and attempt to hold the mind steadyin the light of the group, or in each other’s light, and not so specifically inthe light of your own soul.3. By the conscious organised use of the energy of the etheric ajna centre , andsometimes of the head centre, when receiving, and of the throat centre, whentransmitting. This swings etheric force into activity when engaged in telepathicwork, but entails its conscious subordination to the power of the other twoenergies. Practically, you will observe that this involves on the part of thedisciple the power to do three things at once. You need to ponder more deeplyupon the fact and necessity of active outgoing energy [29] when you are occupiedwith the task of transmission, and with active receptivity when you arefunctioning as a receiver.I would like to point out that successful telepathic work is dependent upon thefollowing factors:First, that there are no barriers existing between the receiver and thebroadcaster. Such barriers would be lack of love or of sympathy, criticism andsuspicion.Secondly, that the broadcaster is mainly occupied with the clarity of hissymbol, with the word or thought, and not with the receiver . A quick glancetoward the receiver, a momentary sending forth of love and understanding issufficient to set up the rapport, and then attention must be paid to the clarityof the symbol.Thirdly, let the receivers think with love and affection of the broadcaster fora minute or two. Then let them forget the personality. A thread of energy,linking receiver and broadcaster, has been established and exists . Then forgetit.Fourthly, let the receivers work with detachment. Most receivers are so anxiousto receive correctly that through their very intensity they counteract their ownefforts. A casual and “don’t care” spirit and a close attentiveness to the inner“picturing faculty” will net better results than any violent and strong desireand effort to see the symbol and to contact the mind of the sender.The brain should register a reflection of the mind content. If a ray of light ismet by an outgoing force from the receiver’s mind or a powerfully emittedthoughtform, it can be prevented from reaching the mind. However, a transmitterwith more expert training can overcome this barrier. Much of the trouble will befound to be based on the emitted thoughtforms, or in the rush of ill-regulated[30] mental energy or brain radiation which negates efforts. Therefore a quietspirit and well regulated thoughts will aid much, and the cultivation of thatdispassion which desires nothing for the separated self, and nothing violently.The need of sensitive receivers is great. Train yourselves. Forget yourselvesand your own petty little affairs—so petty and unimportant when viewed inrelation to the momentous issues of the present time. Keep an attentive ear tothe voices which issue forth from the world of spiritual Being, and love eachother with loyalty and steadfastness.V. THE GROWTH OF TELEPATHIC RAPPORT[31] I would like to point out that the use of words telepathically must bemastered as a preliminary step to the use of sentences and of thoughts. Choose aword and meditate upon it, knowing wherefore you have chosen it. Study it in thefour ways indicated by Patanjali; (The Light of the Soul, page 33) that is:1. Study its form, study it symbolically, as a word picture.2. Study it from the angle of quality, of beauty, of desire.3. Study its underlying purpose and teaching value, and its mental appeal.4. Study its very being and identify yourself with its divine underlying idea.When you have reached this final stage, hold your consciousness steady at thathigh point as you (if you are a transmitter) send out the word to the receiveror to the receiving group. Receivers should in their turn achieve, as far asthey can, complete alignment so as to be responsive to all these four aspects ofthe word. This method will serve to shift the receiver nearer to the plane wherehe should function—the level of the higher mind. The word goes out upon the lifebreath of the transmitter; his lower mind then sends out the purpose aspect; hisastral consciousness is responsible for sending out the quality aspect; and theform aspect is sent out as he says the word—very softly and in a whisper.The above is a good exercise and very simple; telepathic power should greatlyincrease if one faithfully follows these four stages—up and within, down andwithout—in the [32] work of transmitting. During the first or form stage one mayuse what symbolic forms one likes to embody the word, for such a word as “will”has no appropriate form like “pool” has; one may, if he choose, preserve theword form, seeing it letter for letter or as a whole. But one must be sure toend with the picture form or the word form with which he began; and that hesends out, at the close, what he formulated at the beginning.To summarise: A group of disciples working in an Ashram has to learn that—1. Groups are held together by an inner structure of thought.2. The focus of the externalised group life is the etheric body.The etheric body is:a. A receiving agency.b. A circulating medium for energy coming from the mind, from the soul, from theMaster, or from the group mind.3. The mind is the first exoteric expression of the soul consciousness, as faras the true aspirant is concerned.4. The following telepathic relationships are possible and must be borne inmind:a. Solar plexus to solar plexus.b. Mind to mind.c. Master to disciple.d. Groups of disciples to other similar groups.e. Subjective groups to objective receptive groups.f. The Hierarchy, through its great Leaders, to the various Ashrams of theMasters. [33]g. The Hierarchy to the New Group of World Servers.5. The major factors which must be considered in all telepathic work are:a. The initiating agent or emanating source.b. The recipient of the ideas, thoughts or energy.c. The medium of revelation.The growth of telepathic rapport will bring in an era of universality andsynthesis, with its qualities of recognised relationships and responsiveness.This will be, outstandingly, the glory of the Aquarian Age.As the race achieves increasingly a mental polarisation through the developingattractive power of the mental principle, the use of language for the conveyingof thoughts between equals or of communicating with superiors will fall intodisuse. It will continue to be used in reaching the masses and those notfunctioning upon the mental plane. Already voiceless prayer and aspiration andworship are deemed of higher value than the pleadings and proclamations ofvoiced expression. It is for this stage in the unfoldment of the race for whichpreparation must be made, and the laws, techniques and process of telepathiccommunication must be made plain so that they can be intelligently andtheoretically understood.Disciples must occupy themselves increasingly with right understanding, rightdesignation and right definition of the new science of telepathy. Mentalcomprehension and mental sympathy will make true interplay possible, and thiswill bridge between the old way of understanding thought through the medium ofthe spoken or written word (embodying that thought as the individual thinkerseeks to convey it) and the future stage of immediate response to [34] thought,unlimited by speech or other medium of expression. Disciples will endeavour towork in both ways, and the medium of normal human relations and that ofsupernormal subjective relations must be studied by them and expressed by them.In this way the time of bridging and the period of transition can be spanned. Itwill take about five hundred years for the race to become normally telepathic,and when I say normally I mean consciously . This bridging work must be carriedforward by disciples in three ways:1. By an endeavour to understand:a. The medium of transmission.b. The method of transmission.c. The manner of reception.d. The mode of inter-related activity.2. By the cultivation of sensitive reactions to each other and to the otherhuman units with whom the lot of the disciples may be cast. This involves:a. Sensitive physical reaction, via the centres, to the forces emanating fromthe centres of those with whom the disciples are associated. Particularly shouldthe sensitivity of the ajna centre be developed.b. Sensitivity to the state of feeling or to the emotional reactions of thosearound. This is done through the development of compassion and of sympathy, plusthat detachment which will enable one to take right action.c. Sensitivity to the thoughts of others through mental rapport with them uponthe plane of mind. [35]3. By all these done also in group formation as well as individually. All theactivities mentioned above must constitute group activity.In these three ways the vehicle of the personality can be so conditioned that itcan become a sensitive receiving apparatus. When, however, soul consciousness isachieved or developing, then this triple instrument is superseded by theintuitional receptivity of the soul—whose inclusiveness is absolute and who isat-one with the soul in all forms.Those disciples who are working along this line are the nurturers of the seed ofthe future intuitional civilisation, which will come to its full glory in theAquarian Age. The intuition is the infallibly sensitive agent, latent in everyhuman being; it is based, as you know, upon direct knowledge, unimpeded by anyinstrument normally functioning in the three worlds. Of this intuitional futureage, Christ is the Seed Man , for “He knew what was in man.” Today, a group or aunit of groups can be the nurturers of the seed of the intuition; thecultivation of sensitivity to telepathic impression is one of the most potentagencies in developing the coming use of the intuitive faculty.The truly telepathic man is the man who is responsive to impressions coming tohim from all forms of life in the three worlds, but he is also equallyresponsive to impressions coming to him from the world of souls and the world ofthe intuition. It is the development of the telepathic instinct which willeventually make a man a master in the three worlds, and also in the five worldsof human and superhuman development. By a process of withdrawal (of occultabstraction) and of concentration upon the telepathic cult, the whole science oftelepathy (as a seed of a future racial potency) can be developed andunderstood. This is a process now going forward, and it is going on in two ways:[36] through the medium of telepathic groups and of telepathic people, andthrough the medium of exoteric scientific investigation. The building of thethoughtform which will accustom the race to the idea of telepathic work isproceeding apace, and the seed of this development is becoming very vital andpowerful and germinating with real rapidity. It is, in the last analysis, theseed of MASTERHOOD.VI. GROUP TELEPATHIC WORK[37] I shall now take up with you the subject of united group telepathic work,its possibilities and the present opportunity, touching upon the dangersinvolved and the responsibility which will rest upon your shoulders and uponthose of all disciples who may attempt to work in this way. You need to bear inmind the following three injunctions:First: It is essential that you acquire facility in tuning in on each other withdeepest love and understanding; that you develop impersonality so that when abrother tunes in on a weakness or a strength, upon a mistake or a rightattitude, it evokes from you no slightest reaction that could upset the harmonyof the group united work as planned; that you cultivate a love which will everseek to strengthen and to help, and a power to supplement or complement eachother which will be of use in balancing the group, as a working unit underspiritual impression. The discovery of a weakness in a group brother should onlyproduce the evocation of a deeper love; the discovery that you have made amistake (if you have) in interpreting a brother should only prompt you to arenewed vital effort to approach more closely to his soul; the revelation to youof a brother’s strength will indicate where you can look for help in any hour ofyour own need. State frankly what you feel as you work month after month at thistask of group rapport, deliberately tuning out criticism and substituting for itanalysis—an analysis impersonally given; state truthfully what you sense andregister. Your conclusions may be right or wrong, but a definite effort tocomply and to recognise consciously the gained impression should aid the groupblending without undue delay into an instrument of sensitive understanding. Ifdisciples cannot tune in on each other [38] with ease after long periods ofclose relationship, how can they, as a group, tune in on some individual or somegroup of individuals unknown to them in their personalities? Unless suchinterplay is established fundamentally and unless there is a close integrationbetween the members who constitute the group, it will not be possible forconstructively useful and spiritually oriented and controlled work to beproperly carried forward and successfully accomplished. But it is a task whichyou can accomplish if you will, and real application over a period of timeshould enable the group to work smoothly and well together. The three Rules (ATreatise on White Magic, page 320) for beginners, earlier given, embody thefirst steps leading to the attitude required in true hierarchical work; this isthe objective of the accepted disciple.Secondly: Your constant effort—to be carried forward steadily and slowly—must beto bring about a group love of such strength that nothing can break it and nobarriers rise up between you; to cultivate a group sensitivity of such a qualitythat your diagnosis of conditions will be relatively accurate; to develop andunfold a group ability to work as a unit , so that there will be nothing in theinner attitudes of any of the group members which could break into the carefullyestablished rhythm. For it is quite possible for a member of the group to retardthe work and to hold back the group because he is so engrossed in his ownaffairs or in his own ideas of self-development; when some members cease theiractivity it does affect the inner group vibration; when others become slowed upby definite changes in their outer or inner lives, this requires periods ofadjustment and oft of re-organisation of the life. These changes, beingexternalised, can produce powerful psychological changes and upset the rhythm ofthe soul’s endeavour. A tried and [39] experienced disciple will not let such achange upset his inner rhythm, but a less experienced disciple needs real soulwatchfulness to the danger of sidetracking the life interest from spiritualpurposes to personality attentions and interests.Thirdly: Any group work of this kind must be most carefully controlled; anygroup effort which seeks to impress the mind of any subject (whether anindividual or a group) must be strenuously guarded as to motive and method; anygroup endeavour which involves a united applied effort to effect changes in thepoint of view, an outlook on life, or a technique of living must be utterlyselfless , most wisely and cautiously undertaken, and must be kept free from anypersonality emphasis, any personality pressure and any mental pressure which isformulated in terms of individual belief, prejudice, dogmatism or ideas. I wouldask you to study the above few words most carefully.The moment that there is the least tendency on the part of a group, or of anindividual in a group, to force an issue, to bring so much mental pressure tobear that an individual or group is helpless under the impact of other minds,you have what is called “black magic.” Right motive may protect the group fromany serious results to themselves, but the effect upon their victim will bedefinitely serious, rendering him negative, and with a weakened will.The result of all true telepathic work and rightly directed effort to “impress”a subject will be to leave him with a strengthened will to right action, anintensified interior light, an astral body freer from glamour, and a physicalbody more vital and purer. The potency of a united group activity is incrediblypowerful. The occult aphorism that “energy follows thought” is either astatement of a truth or else a meaningless phrase.[40] Forget not that the method of work of the Hierarchy is that of impressionupon the minds of Their disciples, of telepathic work carried on with the Masteras broadcaster and the disciple as the recipient of impression and of energy.This reception of impression and energy has a dual effect:1. It brings into activity the latent seeds of action and of habits (good orbad), thus producing revelation, purification, enrichment and usefulness.2. It vitalises and galvanises the personality into a right relation to thesoul, to the environment, and to humanity.It is necessary for you and for all disciples to grasp the correspondence tothis hierarchical effort and any effort which you may make in order to work as agroup of individuals with groups or individuals. An appreciation of the powerwhich you may let loose, of the dynamic effect which you may succeed inawakening in the subject of your directed thought, and of the impression whichyou may imprint in the mind and consciousness of the subject should incite youto a guarded purity of life (astral and physical), to a watchfulness overthoughts and ideas, and to a love which will safeguard you from all love ofpower. Thus you will preserve the integrity of those you seek to help and willbe enabled to suggest, to strengthen and to teach subjectively with no undueinfluence, no forcing, and no infringement of the liberty and spiritualfranchise of the person concerned. A difficult task, my brothers, but one towhich you are equal, given due attention and obedience to the above threeinjunctions as to motive, technique and method.VII. THE SCIENCE OF IMPRESSION[41] The entire subject of telepathic communication can be approached under amore subjective designation or name, but one which is interpretive of the moreuniversal and prior stage than that of direct telepathic reception. Theoccultist ever approaches the subject connected with the evolutionary processfrom the angle of the whole and then the part, from the periphery to the centre,from the universal to the particular. Among Themselves, the Masters do not dealwith telepathy as a science warranting consideration, endeavour and impartation;They are concerned primarily with the Science of Impression . The term mostoften employed by Them is the esoteric equivalent of what the average personmeans when he says, “I have an impression.” Impression is the subtlest reaction(more or less accurate) to the vibratory mental activity of some other mind orgroup of minds, of some whole, as its radiatory influence affects the unit oraggregate of units.The first stage of correct telepathic reception is ever the registering of animpression; it is generally vague at the beginning, but as a thought, idea,purpose or intention of the sending agent concretises, it slips into the secondstage which appears as a definite thoughtform; finally, that thoughtform makesits impact upon the consciousness of the brain in the location lying just behindthe ajna centre and consequently in the area of the pituitary body. It canappear also in the region of the solar plexus centre. But for those Lives Whohave surmounted life in the three worlds and Who are not conditioned by thetriple mechanism of the personality, the impression is the factor of importance;Their consciousness is impressed, and so sensitive is Their response to thehigher impression, that They [42] absorb or appropriate the impression so thatit becomes a part of Their own “impulsive energy.”This is by no means an easy subject for me to elucidate, and the reasons aretwo:1. The members of the Hierarchy (among Whom I have the status of Master)(Discipleship in the New Age I, 777) are Themselves in process of learning thisScience of Impression. This They do on the levels of the abstract mind, of theintuition, or of manas and buddhi.2. The science is as yet without a vocabulary. It is not limited at any stage bythoughtforms but it is limited by word forms; and it is therefore a difficultproblem for me to pass on any information anent this subtle mode ofcommunication of which telepathy is in fact but an exoteric externalisation.SOURCES OF IMPRESSION TO THE THREE PLANETARY CENTRESImpression, as an art to be mastered both from the angle of the impressing agentand of the impressed recipient, is definitely related to the world of ideas. Asfar as our planetary Life is concerned, there are certain great sources ofimpression and one or two of them might here be noted; you will thus gain someidea of the subtlety of the whole subject, of its close relation to energyimpacts and of its group reception as differentiated from individual reception,as is the case in any telepathic rapport.1. The impression of Shamballa by:a. Members of the Great White Lodge on Sirius. The recipients of this impressionare the highest Members of the Great Council, presided over by the Lord of theWorld. So subtle is this impression [43] that these Great Lives can only receiveit with accuracy when in full joint conference of the entire Council, and alsoafter due preparation.b. From one or other of the constellations which are at any particular timeastrologically en rapport with our planet. This impression can only be receivedby the Great Council when sitting in conclave with a majority of its Memberspresent. This, I would have you note, does not entail the attendance of theentire Council.c. From a triangle of circulating energy, emanating from the two planetswhich—with our planet, the Earth—form a triangle in any particular cycle. Thisimpression is received by the three Buddhas of Activity for distribution to theHierarchy.d. From the planet Venus, the Earth’s alter ego . This makes its entrance viathe Lord of the World and three of His Council Who are chosen by Him at anyspecific time to act as recipients.These are the major entering impressions, recorded by what is glibly called “theUniversal Mind,” the mind of God, our planetary Logos. There are other enteringimpressions, but to them I do not refer, as any reference would be meaninglessto you.2. The impression of the Hierarchy by:a. Shamballa itself through the medium of groups within the Great Council; thesestep down the impression which they register so that the Hierarchy—as awhole—may cooperate with the purposes intended by those who are forming theneeded Plan. [44]b. Certain great Lives Who, at specific times and according to cyclic rhythm, orin times of emergency, are swung into this type of activity. For instance, onesuch time would be the Full Moon period, which is a time of reception by theHierarchy as well as by Humanity; an instance of the second type of activitywould be the Wesak Festival, or those acute crises when intervention is requiredfrom sources far higher than those with which the recipient is usually enrapport. Such a crisis is fast approaching. The first type of impression is rhythmic, recurrent and therefore cumulativein its intended effects. The second type of impression is the result ofinvocation and evocation and is dependent upon both the recipient and the agent.c. That great group of divine Contemplatives who are trained to act as anintermediate receptive group between Shamballa and the Hierarchy. They receiveimpression from Shamballa and transmit it to the Hierarchy, thus enabling theMembers of the Hierarchy to receive it as “a sharpened impression” and toregister it accurately because the emanating impression has passed through anarea within the divine Mind where it is enhanced by the trained perception andthe determined receptivity of this group. They are called, in the East, thedivine Nirmanakayas. I only mention Their occult name so that you may learn torecognise Them when you meet reference to Them.d. The Buddha at the time when the Wesak Festival is celebrated. He then acts asa focal point or as the “distributor of the impression”; He then has [45] behindHim (little as you may realise it) the entire impressing force of the Buddhas ofActivity Who are to Shamballa what the Nirmanakayas are to the Hierarchy.Let me here interpolate a remark which may prove helpful and illuminating. Weare dealing (as you will undoubtedly have noted) with the reception ofimpression by groups or by aggregations of groups composed of living Beings Whohave Their own agents of distribution or impression. The entire evolutionaryhistory of our planet is one of reception and of distribution, of a taking inand of a giving out. The key to humanity’s trouble (focussing, as it has, in theeconomic troubles of the past two hundred years, and in the theological impasseof the orthodox churches) has been to take and not to give, to accept and not toshare, to grasp and not to distribute. This is the breaking of the Law which hasplaced humanity in the position of guilt. The war is the dire penalty whichhumanity has had to pay for this great sin of separateness. Impressions from theHierarchy have been received, distorted, misapplied and misinterpreted, and thetask of the New Group of World Servers is to offset this evil. These Servers areto humanity what the Buddhas of Activity are to Shamballa, and the group ofdivine Contemplatives (the Nirmanakayas) are to the Hierarchy. It might bestated therefore that:1. The Buddhas of Activity are Themselves impressed by the WILL of God as itenergises the entire planetary life.2. The Nirmanakayas are impressed by the LOVE of God as it demonstrates itselfas the attractive force which impulses the Plan inspired by the Purpose. Inother words, it is the Hierarchy, impelled to action [46] by Shamballa, or theWill-to-Good, externalising itself as goodwill.3. The New Group of World Servers are impressed by the active INTELLIGENCE ofGod; they translate this divine impression and step it down in two great stages,therefore, bringing it into concrete manifestation.We now carry this conception of divine impression down to the level of the humanconsciousness.3. The impression of Humanity by:a. The Hierarchy, through the stimulating of ideas. These demonstrate through asteadily growing and enlightened public opinion.b. The influence of the Ashrams of the Masters as they affect the aspirants ofthe world, the humanitarians and the idealists. These impressing agencies, beingseven in number, constitute seven different streams of impressing energy whichaffect the seven ray types. The united Ashrams, forming the great Ashram of theChrist, affect humanity as a whole; this great united Ashram works solelythrough the New Group of World Servers whose members are on all rays, of allgrades of development, and who work in all the various departments of humanliving and enterprise.c. The activity of the New Group of World Servers about which I have alreadywritten in my various pamphlets; therefore repetition is not necessary. (ATreatise on the Seven rays, II, 629-751. A Treatise on White Magic, 398-433)It will be obvious to you that I have only touched upon a few, a very few, ofthe impressing forces of the planet, and have [47] enumerated only a few of themajor groups which are—in their intrinsic nature—both recipients of impressionand agents later of the impressing agent. When we arrive at the human family,this reciprocal activity is blocked by human selfishness; it is this“interruption of impression” and this “interference with the divine circulatoryflow” which (as I have said above) is responsible for sin, for disease, and forall the various factors which make humanity today what it is. When the free flowof divine energy, of divine interplay and of spiritual purpose isre-established, then evil will disappear and the will-to-good will becomefactual goodwill upon the outer physical plane.In the statements given above in connection with the three great planetarycentres you have the basis for the new and coming Approach to Divinity whichwill be known under the expression: Invocative and Evocative religion. It isthis new Science of Impression which forms the subjective basis and the unitingelement which binds together the entire realm of knowledge, of science and ofreligion. The fundamental ideas which underlie these great areas of humanthought all emanate from intuitional levels; they finally condition the humanconsciousness, evoking man’s aspiration to penetrate deeper into the arcana ofall wisdom, for which knowledge is the preparatory stage. This Science ofImpression is the mode of life of the subjective world which lies between theworld of external happenings (the world of appearances and of exotericmanifestation) and the inner world of reality. This is a point which should bemost carefully taken into the calculations of the occult investigators.Impressions are received and registered; they form the basis of reflection forthose aspirants who are sensitive enough to their impact and wise enough torecord carefully in consciousness their emanating source. After due practice,this period of brooding upon the registered [48] impression is followed byanother period wherein the impression begins to take form as an idea; from thatpoint it follows the familiar course of translation from an idea into apresented ideal; it then comes under the invocative appeal of the moreconcrete-minded until it finally precipitates itself into outer manifestationand takes form. You will see, therefore, that what I am doing is to take thestudent a step further into the world of reception and perception and point himto the more subtle contacts which lie behind those concepts which are regardedas definitely nebulous and to which we give the name of intuitions.The Science of Impression—if studied by the disciples in the world and by theNew Group of World Servers—will greatly facilitate the presentation of thoseideals which must and will condition the thinking of the New Age and willeventually produce the new culture and the new civilised expression which liesahead of humanity, superseding the present civilisation and providing the nextfield of expression for mankind. This science is, in fact, the basis of thetheory of relationships and will lead to the expansion of the idea of righthuman relations which has hitherto—as a phrase—been confined to an ideal desirefor correct interplay between man and man, group and group, and nation andnation; it has also hitherto been restricted to the human society and interplay,and remains as yet a hope and a wish. When, however, the Science of Impressionhas been correctly apprehended and has been brought down to the level of aneducational objective, it will be found to be closely linked to the emergingteaching anent invocation and evocation and will be expanded to include not onlyright human relations to the superhuman kingdoms, but right human relations withthe subhuman kingdoms also. It will, therefore, be concerned with the sensitiveresponse of the entire natural and supernatural world to the “One in Whom we[49] live and move and have our being”; it will put mankind into a rightrelationship with all aspects and expressions of the divine nature, deepeningsubjective contact and bringing about a diviner objective manifestation and onemore in line with divine purpose. It will lead to a great shift of the humanconsciousness off the levels of emotional and physical life (where the bulk ofhumanity is focussed) on to the levels of mental perception.You will understand, consequently, the reason why the Knowers of the world haveever referred to the dual action of the mind as it is sensitive to the higherimpressions and active in the mental creation of the needed thoughtforms. Themind, rightly trained, will seize upon the fugitive impression, subject it tothe concretising effect of mental activity, produce the required form, and this,when correctly created and oriented, will finally lead to the externalising ofthe registered impression, as it took form in an intuition and eventually foundits place upon the mental plane. You will see also why disciples and worldworkers have to function as MINDS, as receptive and perceptive intelligences andas creators in mental matter. It is all related to this Science of Impressionwith which we have been dealing. You will note also that this whole process iscapable of expansion in the processes of meditation, so that the aspirant can besensitive to impression and (because he is oriented to the world of ideas and isaware of the subtlety and delicacy of the apparatus required to register the“overshadowing cloud of knowable things”) is safeguarded from the sensitivityrequired to register impacts from other minds, good or bad in their orientation,and from the thought currents of that which is in process of taking form as wellas from the powerful pull or urge of the emotional and desire reactions of theastral plane and of the emotionally polarised world in which he livesphysically.[50] More understanding will come also if you grasp the fact that this Scienceof Impression is concerned with the activity of the head centre as an anchoringcentre for the antahkarana, and that the ajna centre is concerned with theprocess of translating the recorded intuition into a form (through recognitionof and reaction to a mental thoughtform) and its subsequent direction, as anideal objective, into the world of men. In the early stages and until the thirdinitiation, the Science of Impression is concerned with the establishing of asensitivity (an invocative sensitivity) between the Spiritual Triad (temporarilyexpressing itself through the abstract mind and the soul or the Son of Mind) andthe concrete mind. This mental triangle is a reflection, in time and space, ofthe Monad and of the two higher aspects of the Triad, and is reflected (afterthe process of invocation and a succeeding process of evocation) in anothertriad—that of the lower mind, the soul and the vital body. When the relationbetween the lower and the higher mind is correctly and stably established, youhave the swinging into activity of the lowest triad connected with the Scienceof Impression—the head centre, the ajna centre and the throat centre.In the above I have given you an interesting and brief elucidation of thetechnique to be applied to the energising of the centres in the human body. Iwould remind you that what is true of the individual disciple must be and istrue of that great disciple—Humanity, the entire human family. It is also true,as an outgrowth of this idea, of all the three planetary centres: Shamballa, theHierarchy and Humanity. The name Science of Impression is that given to theprocess whereby the establishment of the required relationship in all theseunits of life takes place. The Technique of Invocation and Evocation is the namegiven to the mode or method whereby the desired relationship is brought about.[51] The Creative Work is the name given to the manifestation of the results ofthe two above processes. The three aspects of the Technique of Invocation andEvocation with which the average disciple should concern himself are those ofthe building of the antahkarana, the correct use of the lower mind in its twohigher functions (the holding of the mind steady in the light and the creationof the desired thoughtforms), and the process of precipitation whereby theimpression is enabled eventually to take tangible form.In the above exegesis I have given you much food for thought in connection withtelepathic possibilities; it all fits into the theme of world service as it isto be applied in the expansion of the human consciousness on a large scale. Thisis one of the major tasks of the New Group of World Servers.VIII. THE SUPREME SCIENCE OF CONTACT[52] It would be useful if you attempted to master and to assimilate what I haveto impart anent the three great sciences which form the three modes ofexpression of what we might term the SUPREME SCIENCE OF CONTACT. These threesciences are all equally interdependent and all related to the art ofresponsiveness. They are:1. The Science of Impression . . . The will-to-be.Relation to the Spiritual Triad.Source of emanation . . . Shamballa.Connected with the abstract mind.2. The Science of Invocation and Evocation . . . Love or attraction.Relation to the soul in all forms.Source of emanation (at this time) . . . The Hierarchy.Connected with the lower mind, as the agent of the soul.3. The Science of Telepathy . . . Mind. Human intelligence.Relation to the personality.Source of emanation . . . Humanity itself.Connected with the head centre.You will see how all these pairs of opposites play their part, exemplifying thedualistic nature of our planetary Life: [53]1. The abstract mind and the lower mind.2. The soul and the lower mind.3. The lower mind and the head centre.Each of them acts as an invocative agent and produces evocation. All act asrecipients and as transmitters, and all of them together establish the groupinter-relation and the circulation of the energies which are the distinctivecharacteristic of the entire world of force.One point you all need to grasp is that the progressing disciple does not moveinto new fields or areas of awareness, like a steady marching forward from oneplane to another (as the visual symbols of the theosophical literature wouldindicate). What must be grasped is that all that IS is ever present. What we areconcerned with is the constant awakening to that which eternally IS, and to whatis ever present in the environment but of which the subject is unaware, owing toshort-sightedness. The aim must be to overcome the undue concentration upon theforeground of daily life which characterises most people, the intensepreoccupation with the interior states or moods of the lower self whichcharacterises the spiritually minded people and the aspirants, and theimperviousness or lack of sensitivity which characterises the mass of men. TheKingdom of God is present on Earth today and forever has been, but only a few,relatively speaking, are aware of its signs and manifestations. The world ofsubtle phenomena (called formless, because unlike the physical phenomena withwhich we are so familiar) is ever with us and can be seen and contacted andproved as a field for experiment and experience and activity if the mechanism ofperception is developed as it surely can be. The sounds and sights of theheavenly world (as the mystics call it) are as clearly perceived by [54] thehigher initiate as are the sights and sounds of the physical plane as youcontact it in your daily round of duties. The world of energies, with itsstreams of directed force and its centres of concentrated light is likewisepresent, and the eye of the see-er can see it, just as the eye of the mentalclairvoyant can see the geometrical pattern which thoughts assume upon themental plane, or as the lower psychic can contact the glamours, the illusionsand delusions of the astral world. The subjective realm is vitally more realthan is the objective, once it is entered and known. It is simply (how simple tosome and how insuperably difficult to others, apparently!) a question of theacceptance, first of all, of its existence, the development of a mechanism ofcontact, the cultivation of the ability to use this mechanism at will, and theninspired interpretation .ITS GOAL IN THE EVOLUTIONARY LIFE PROCESSIt might be said that consciousness itself, which is the goal—on this planet—ofall the evolutionary process, is simply the demonstrated result of the Scienceof Contact. It is likewise the goal in some form or other and at some stage orother of all planetary existences within the solar system itself. The unfoldmentof this conscious response is, in reality, the growth of the sensitive awarenessof the planetary Logos HIMSELF. The human mechanism and its ability to respondto its environment (as science well knows) has been developed in response to aninner urge, present in every human being and in all forms of life, and to the“pull” and magnetic effect of the surrounding environment. Step by step, theforms of life upon the physical plane, down through the ages, have unfolded onesense after another; one form of sensitive response after another becomespossible as the mechanism is produced, until the human being can receiveimpressions from the physical plane and rightly interpret them; can respond tothe emotional contacts of the astral plane and succumb to them or [55] surmountthem; and can become telepathic to the world of the mental plane, thussharing—physically, emotionally and mentally—in the life and contacts of thethree worlds which constitute his environment and in which he is submergedwhilst in incarnation. What he gets out of this life of constant impression islargely dependent upon his power to invoke his environment and draw from it (inevocative response) what he needs in all the various departments of his being.This, in its turn, forces him—whether he likes it or not—to produce an effectupon other people; this can be far more potent for good or evil, and from thetelepathic angle, than he likes to think or can conceive. You see, therefore,how these sciences of Impression, of Invocation and Evocation, and of Telepathyare naturally concerned with what is inherent in man and in his relation to hisenvironment and circumstances.The germ or embryonic capacity for all types of planetary contact is inherent inevery man and will not be frustrated in the long run. In this knowledge of goalsalready achieved in the three worlds lies the guarantee of achievement in themore subjective worlds which are present within the aspirant’s surroundings butto which he remains as yet unawakened and unenlightened. I am seeking to makethe matter as simple as I can, for much of the abstract formulations of theoccult sciences and the academic psychologists are incident to the over-activityof men’s minds and emotional natures. If you can grasp certain broad andrelatively simple facts and recognise that you possess the key or the clue inyour already developed capacities, then you will go forward with simplicity,making no undue intellectual difficulties when dealing with these more subtlephases of your ever-existent environment. It is, in the last analysis, just aquestion as to what “impresses” you at any given moment, and then in what mannerit conditions you. [56]You will see, therefore, how much that I have already said links up with theteaching I have given upon the Points of Revelation. In the very condensedsummation of the Science of Impression, I touched briefly upon the three greatgroups of Lives that are constantly under “impression” and which, in their turn,become “impressing agents.” There is little that can be added to this theme withprofit at this time; what has already been given should be studied and relatedto the teaching on the Points of Revelation. (Discipleship in the New Age, VolII, Section 3)Revelation is a generic term covering all the responses to the activities of theeye of the mind, the eye of the soul, and the “insight” of the Universal Mindwhich contact with the Monad gives. Sight is the greatest of all thedevelopments in this world period in which the Logos is seeking to bring thesubhuman kingdoms to the point where human vision is theirs, to bring humanityto the point where spiritual vision is developed and hierarchical insight is thenormal quality of the initiate sight, and to bring the Members of the Hierarchyto the point where universal perception is Theirs. Therefore, it might be saidthat:1. Through the door of individualisation the subhuman kingdoms pass to humanvision, leading to mental contact and intelligent impression.2. Through the door of initiation humanity passes to spiritual vision, leadingto soul contact and spiritual impression.3. Through the door of identification the Hierarchy passes to universal vision,leading to monadic contact and extra-planetary impression.Each time that there is a fresh vision of a compelling and conditioning nature,it is the result of invocation by the [57] one seeking the new impression. Whenthis invocative spirit is present, the results are inevitable and sure and theresponse evoked cannot be stopped. This is the basis of all the success ofdesire (material or otherwise), aspiration, prayer and meditation. Always weget—in time and space—what we invoke; and the knowledge of this fact,scientifically applied, will be one of the great liberating forces for humanity.IX. EXPANDING AREAS OF CONSCIOUS INTERACTION[58] The training given by the Masters in Their Ashrams to Their disciples hasone main objective: to increase, develop and enable them to utilise in servicetheir inherent and innate sensitivity. Let us, as we discuss these matters,avoid that much over-worked word “vibration” and use instead the more simple andmore easily understood word “impact”. Response to impact is something we allregister. Our five senses have opened to all people five great realms from whichimpact comes, and we are so familiar with them all that our response is nowautomatic and, though registered, is not consciously so, unless there is aplanned reason and direction intended. We respond similarly and as automaticallyto emotional stimuli, and rapidly (very rapidly) the race is reaching outtowards mental telepathy. Some few are beginning to work along the lines ofspiritual telepathy. Few do more than register occasionally contacts emanatingfrom a high source, and the result is usually also over-mixed with personalityreactions.Contact, with resultant impact from the soul, is also quite rapidly developing,hence the necessity for my laying the foundations of further knowledge whichwill clarify still higher contact, emanating from the Spiritual Triad andopening up areas of interaction hitherto known only to the Hierarchy. I referhere to the teaching which I have given out through a group of my disciplesanent the Antahkarana. (Education in the New Age. A Treatise on the Seven rays,Volume V) All such developing contacts involve conditions covered by the twowords: Contact and Impact. [59]1. Contact can be defined (for our particular purposes) as recognition of anenvironment, an area of the hitherto unknown, of that which has somehow beenevoked, of a something other which has made its presence felt. This somethingother than the Perceiver has usually been earlier sensed , has been propoundedinto a theoretical possibility , has later been invoked by the directed andconscious attention of the one who has sensed its presence, and finally contactis made.2. Impact is something more than simply registering contact. It develops intoconscious interaction; it conveys later information; it is revelatory in nature,and can be defined in its initial stages as the guarantee to the one whoresponds to it of a new area for exploration and for spiritual adventure, and asthe indication of a wider field wherein consciousness may expand more and moreand register increasingly the divine purpose waiting to be more fully known.Therefore, from the more normal field of what we may call ordinary telepathicperception (just now coming to recognition by ordinary science), through aslowly learnt process of invocation and evocation, to a state of consciousnessdistinguished by a trained sensitivity, the disciple moves. He unfolds aspiritual recognition which is controlled, understood, and directed to usefulhierarchical ends. In these words, you have a very simple definition of theprocess to which we give, technically, the name: The Science of Impression.Another point to remember is that this science is the basic Science ofSensitivity; it is the art of all responsiveness to phenomena and is peculiarlyapplied to the reaction, the recognition, the responsiveness, and theregistration of all [60] phenomena to be found throughout the cosmic physicalplane. This is the plane whereon our entire threefold planetary Life findsexpression and which we have subdivided (for the sake of clear thinking) intothe seven planes (so called) of our solar system—from what we call our lowestphysical plane up to our highest plane, the logoic. In the earlier stages ofresponsiveness to the two phases of contact and impact, the first task is todevelop the needed apparatus of contact, the medium of learning, the mechanismof registration, and then learning to use it constructively and intelligently.This work proceeds from cycle to cycle, in the earliest stages, with noconscious intention on the part of the unit of life, thus developing; yet fieldafter field of consciousness is slowly recorded, and area after area of thesurrounding physical, mental and spiritual worlds come within the arena ofperception, and are mastered and controlled, until eventually the unit of life(I know not what else to call it) becomes the human being, self-directed, anindividual. Finally the man becomes the Master, controlling and directing withinthe periphery of His wide awareness, in consonance with the divine Mind andPlan.But—and this is a point I seek to impress upon you—humanity, subjected to thisconstant process of expansion from the emergence of the fourth kingdom innature, the human, has now reached the stage where it can begin to pass out ofthe control of what has been called the Law of Triple Response into a new phaseof unfoldment where a recognised dualism dominates. This is a most importantstatement. Let me word it in this way and let me commend to you a very carefulconsideration of my words. I will express what I seek to impart in certain shortsentences and in tabulation form: [61]1. The advanced man in the three worlds is conscious of two inherenttriplicities:a. The lower man . . . . . . . . Physical body. Astral nature. Mind.b. The three periodical vehicles . . . . . Monad. Soul. Personality.2. Soul and personality have made contact. He is now technically soul-infused.Two periodical vehicles have been at-oned. Three lower vehicles and the soul areunited.3. The etheric body is at the point of assuming great power. It can now beconsciously used as a transmitter of:a. Energy and forces, consciously directed.b. Impacts from the highest of the periodical vehicles, working through itsinstrument, the Spiritual Triad.4. The etheric body is, therefore, the agent consciously directed, of therapidly integrating spiritual unity. It can convey into the brain the neededenergies and that occult information which together make a man a Master of theWisdom and eventually a Christ—all-inclusive in HIS developed attractive andmagnetic power.Earlier I made the following statement which, as you study it, will summarisethe above detailed analysis. I said, defining impression, that it “concerns theengendering of a magnetic aura on which the highest impressions can play.” (SeeChart The Constitution of Man.) This might also serve as a definition of the artof invocation and evocation. As the man (for we will not consider this scienceapart from him, as it would include too vast a field) becomes sensitive to hisenvironment, as the forces of evolution [62] play upon him and lead him on fromstage to stage, from point to point, from plane to plane, and from height toheight, he becomes enriched and increasingly magnetic. As this attractive ormagnetic force increases, he himself becomes invocative; this outgoing demand,emanating from or through the aura which he has engendered brings to him adeveloping revelation. This revelation, in its turn, enriches the magnetic fieldof his aura so that he becomes a revealing centre to those whose field ofexperience and aura need the stimulus of his practised assurance.Finally, it might be said that the entire human kingdom will eventually be amajor magnetic centre upon our planet, invoking all the higher kingdoms upon theformless planes and evoking all the lower or subhuman kingdoms upon the planesof form. Some day, two-thirds of the human family will be sensitive to impactscoming from the Mind of God, as that Mind fulfils its intentions and carries outits purposes within our planetary ring-pass-not. In its turn, humanity willprovide the area of mind within whose ring-pass-not the subhuman kingdoms willfind the correspondence of the Universal Mind which they need for theirunfoldment; man, as you well know, is the macrocosm for the microcosm of thelower kingdoms in nature. This is the goal of all human service.What I have said up to this point anent the Science of Impression, if read alsoin connection with the teaching on the Points of Revelation, (Discipleship inthe New Age, Volume. II, Section 3) will convey much enlightenment. However,deep reflection is called for. The Science of Impression might be regarded, inthe last analysis, as the fundamental science of consciousness itself, for theresult of contact and impact leads to the awakening and the unfoldment ofconsciousness and of that growing awareness which distinguishes every formthroughout the manifested [63] world.Every form has its own area of awareness,and evolution is the process whereby forms respond to contact, react to impact,and pass on to greater development, usefulness and effectiveness. The Law ofEvolution and the Science of Impression cover the unfoldment of consciousnessand bring about adaptability to the immanent soul. Modern science, through itswork in the fields of psychology and medicine (to mention only two) and itsexperiments with forms which have established the modes of constructing andbringing into being the varying mechanisms of contact found in the differentkingdoms of nature, has mastered much of the evolutionary development of theexoteric response apparatus. With all this we shall not attempt to deal; it iscorrect as far as it goes. We shall confine ourselves to a consideration of thecontacts and impacts which confront the disciples and initiates of the worldtoday, as they work in the Hierarchy and through an Ashram, and whose path ofadvance is as a shining light which shineth ever more until full enlightenmenthas been achieved.X. SEQUENTIAL REVELATION OF RELATIONSHIPS[64] I would like to refer you back to page 52 where I outlined thisextra-ordinary science which is—inherently in itself—the evidence of evolution,of the essential dualism in manifestation, and the testimony, unalterable andincontrovertible, to the unfoldment of consciousness. At the same time, itproceeds upon the basic premise that the various phases of consciousness whichare steadily and sequentially revealed in time and space are (from the point ofview of the Eternal Now) the sum total of the states of consciousness of the“One in Whom we live and move and have our being.” All these phases of consciousacceptance of existent phenomena and their related reactions are, to SanatKumara, what a day’s experience and reactions or the current life experiencesare to the intelligent man—only vastly more enveloping and comprehensive.There were a number of points to which I did not refer then, but which I wouldlike to take up now in the interests of clarity and understanding. I have calledthis science of rapport and of reaction, the Supreme Science of Contact. That isessentially what it is. The reaction to this contact, whether cosmic as in thecase of Sanat Kumara, or planetary as in the case of the Members of theHierarchy, is nevertheless limited and circumscribed (from the point of view ofthe informed aspirant), is responsible for the creation of Karma or the settingin motion of causes which must unalterably have their effects—these effectsbeing negated and rendered useless (or innocuous, if you prefer that word) whenthe entity concerned brings to the engendered circumstances the neededintelligence, wisdom, [65] intuition or will. Ponder on this. Consciousness isinherent in all forms of life. That is an occult platitude. It is an innatepotency which forever accompanies life in manifestation. These two, relatedthrough manifestation, are in reality atma-buddhi, spirit-reason, dedicated forthe term of the creative period to a simultaneous functioning; the first resultof their relation is the appearance of that which will enable the Lord of theWorld to express His Own unknown inscrutable purpose.During the cycle of manifestation, this combination of life-awareness,spirit-reason, atma-buddhi, is the product of the multiplicity in unity of whichwe hear so much—demonstrating as activity, quality, ideology, rationality,relationship, unity, and many other expressions of the divine nature. In theearlier part of A Treatise on the Seven Rays, I spoke of life, quality andappearance , mentioning the major triplicity which could be and is alreadyproven and apparent to man. Quality was emphasised as the second aspect, notbecause on all planes and for all time that is so, but because at the presentpoint in human evolution, quality plus activity appear to be the two loweraspects of divine manifestation. Already, however, two others are, if anything,superseding them in the consciousness of thinking humanity—relationship andideas. Still others will be rapidly added as the consciousness of man is moreeffectively employed.The Science of Contact will not only reveal quality, but is revealing the linesof relationship which underlie all manifestation and of which the etheric bodyis the symbol. It is also rendering man sensitive to ideas as the unfoldingintellect of man permits it. The reaction of humanity to these two revelations(which come, if you could but realise it, as the result, the reward, of contactand of the impact of life-reason upon that manifestation which has always beenpresent though unrealised) will bring about vast [66] changes and morefar-reaching results than has the reaction to quality. Curiously enough, thediscovery of quality as the second aspect in manifestation (later to besuperseded), called for, and developed, the critical faculty in man; thiscritical faculty (so destructive in its present use) will be correctly expressedwhen the nature of relationship is better grasped and the true function of ideasis properly understood.This Supreme Science of Contact governs all reactions to impact. This statementincludes the cosmic reactions of Sanat Kumara down to the scarcely discerniblereactions (invisible almost even to the eye of the seer) of the infinitesimalatom. For the sake of clarity, I divided this science into three majordivisions, basing them upon the reactions of the three major planetary centresto their environment. This is a point which I would have you carefully bear inmind. I could write a treatise longer than this one purely on the creation ofthe response apparatus which each of these three centres of divine life-reasonhad to form in order to make the needed contact and to interpret correctly.There are many paradoxes in what I am here giving you, and apparently somecontradictions where orthodox occultism is concerned, but that is ever the caseas the teaching expands in content and the earlier all-inclusive facts are seento be minor aspects of still greater facts. You can see, therefore, thesignificance and the importance of the dictum in The Secret Doctrine that theHierarchy and all in the Council Chamber of Sanat Kumara (or Shamballa) haveinvariably passed through the human stage of evolution, for only human beingscan perfectly blend and express life-reason, and only human intellect canconsciously create what is needed in order to bring the needed stages ofmanifested life into being.[67] Here again emerges another reason for the importance of the “centre whichwe call the race of men”; upon the shoulders of humanity rests unbelievableresponsibility. Therefore, whether we are dealing with simple telepathy, or withinvocation and evocation, or with impression, we are in reality considering theeffect of life-reason as it manifests in relation to the available and suitableenvironment. Note this phrase. All this takes place through men in process ofbeing made perfect, through men who have attained a relative perfection, andthrough men who—in the majority of cases—arrived at perfection elsewhere than inthis present manifesting cycle. This should indicate to you the potentialityhidden in the very lowest of the human family, and the future of wonder and ofusefulness which lies ahead for each and all in due time and after due effort.Technically speaking, it is the Hierarchy which is “impressed” from Shamballa,and Humanity which is reached by the Hierarchy via the method of invocation andevocation. Within the human family two things occur as the result of thisreceived and recognised activity of a phase of the Science of Contact.LINKING GROUPS WITHIN THE PLANETARY LIFE1. Telepathic relationship is set up. This, my brother, has ever existed betweenmembers of the human family and, as previously explained, is of two kinds: Solarplexus telepathy, instinctual, uncontrolled, widely prevalent and allied to manyof the surprising activities of forms of life other than the human, i. e., theinstinct of the homing pigeon or the method whereby cats and dogs and horseswill find their homes over immense distances. The telepathic interplay between amother and her children is instinctual and seated in the animal nature. Mentaltelepathy is now being recognised and studied. This is the activity and rapportestablished from mind to mind; it also includes the telepathic response tocurrent [68] thoughtforms and thought conditions in the world today. Interest inthis is already very great.2. Intuitional telepathy begins to manifest increasingly among advanced humanbeings in all lands and all races. This indicates soul contact and theconsequent awakening of group consciousness, for sensitivity to intuitionalimpressions has to do only with group concerns.This Science of Contact governs relations within our entire planetary life andincludes, for instance, the rapport being established between humanity and thedomesticated animals. These animals are to their own kingdom what the New Groupof World Servers is to humanity. The New Group of World Servers is the linkingbridge and the mode of communication between the Hierarchy (the fifth kingdom)and Humanity (the fourth kingdom) under the present divine Plan; thedomesticated animals fulfil, therefore, an analogous function between Humanity(the fourth kingdom) and the animal kingdom (the third). These analogies areoften fertile fields of illumination.As regards Shamballa, the impression there received is not the result ofinvocation which in due course evokes extra-planetary response, as is the casebetween the Hierarchy and Shamballa, and the Hierarchy and Humanity, withcertain changes during the process of stepping down or of descent. That whichimpresses Shamballa and is received by the Grand Council of the Lord of theWorld, comes via Sanat Kumara because HE is in close contact with otherplanetary Logoi or groups of planetary Logoi, wielding a united, focussed,intelligent Will. It is Sanat Kumara Whose task it is to impress the Lives Whomeet periodically in the Council Chamber with the next phase of unfoldingPurpose. This Purpose is later “occultly reduced” or stepped down until itemerges as the hierarchical Plan. This Plan is contingent upon imminence, atmicrealisation [69] and pure reason, as the Hierarchy has termed these three“aspects of reaction” to impression from Shamballa. Let me make myself clear.The Hierarchy is no group of mystical workers; only those aspects of divinePurpose which can be immediately grasped and developed and which are patentlyvaluable to humanity—when presented in right form by the Hierarchy—areregistered by Them. They know what consciously to “repudiate” as it is occultlycalled, and They act ever in response to a Law of Imminence or of occultprevision which is almost unrecognisable and indefinable by advanced humanity.The words, “atmic realisation” are most interesting, for they refer to thequality and the mass of will energy which could be made available by the pledgedand unified Hierarchy to carry out the imminent Plan. Never forget that inconsidering Shamballa and the Plan, we are thinking entirely within the limitsof the expression of the WILL aspect of the Lord of the World, and this—exceptfor advanced initiates—is well-nigh impossible. This factor has to be acceptedtheoretically, even if not yet understood.To these two unalterable requirements the Hierarchy contributes the faculty ofpure reason, which is the governing faculty of the Hierarchy and which bringsinto activity the quality to which man has erroneously given the name of “love”.This emphasises the sentimental aspect and signifies to the majority, verylargely, simply the sentimental and emotional aspect, which is entirely of anastral nature. Pure reason, which is the supreme characteristic of the Membersof the Hierarchy, will ever express itself in right action and right humanrelations, and that will manifest—when present—what love in reality is. Purelove is a quality or effect of pure reason.The pure reason of the hierarchical response is needed for the grasping and thecomprehension of the Purpose as [70] it works out through the Plan sponsored atany one time by the Hierarchy, and the quality of pure love is needed anddemanded (even if unrealised) by a waiting humanity.This “impression” emanating from Shamballa takes the form of a focussedemanation which employs the higher aspect of the antahkarana as its channel ofcontact. I refer not here to the thread as built by the disciple between themental unit and the abstract mind. I refer to its continuation through thebuddhic and atmic levels of consciousness into the area of magnetisedconsciousness (I use this word as we have not yet the necessary word to expressthe exact nature of this higher awareness, and the term “identification” seemssomewhat unsuitable) which surrounds and protects the true Shamballa centre. Itis essential that you here bear in mind that just as the mass of men do notknow, recognise or respond to the Hierarchy, so—within the Hierarchy itself—youhave a group analogous to this mass of men. There are many lesser members of theHierarchy and many, very many, disciples who do not know, recognise or as yetrespond to the influence or the potency of Shamballa.Within the Hierarchy, the Science of Impression conditions the relation betweensenior and junior members in the various Ashrams. All do not respond in the sameway, for in its higher aspects it is a science in process of mastering. It mightbe said, in order that you may understand more easily, that “impression” governsand conditions all those within the Hierarchy whose abstract mind is highlydeveloped. It is not fully developed in the case of many disciples in theAshram, and hence only certain Members of the Hierarchy (the Masters, the Adeptsand Initiates of the third degree) are permitted to know the details of thePlan; these are protected by means of this very Science [71] of Impression. Theremaining members of the Hierarchy take their orders from their seniors.MIND THE FOCUS OF PLANETARY DEVELOPMENTI would ask you to remember that, in our planetary development, the emphasis ofthe entire evolutionary process is on the MIND and on the various aspects of themind—intelligence, mental perception, the Son of Mind, the lower mind, theabstract mind, the mind as will, the Universal Mind. The three which are ofmajor importance and which form an esoteric triangle requiring to be broughtinto a vital inter-relation are the Son of Mind, the abstract mind, and theUniversal Mind. They are, when fully related and active, the factors whichengineer divine purpose and step it down into such form that we call it thehierarchical Plan and can act upon it. Only when the initiate has attained,through monadic contact, a touch of the Universal Mind can the Purpose be sensedby him; this involves also the development of the abstract mind, plus theresidue of mental perception which the Son of Mind (the soul) has bequeathed tohim; through all this unfoldment he can join the group who are the Formulatorsof the Plan. We are dealing here with most difficult and complex matters,inherent in the initiate consciousness and for which we have as yet no correctterminology. Also, the average aspirant has no idea what is the nature of theawareness or the reactions to contact of Those Who have passed beyond the thirdinitiation; these limitations of the average student must constantly be borne inmind.The Science of Invocation and Evocation—which embodies the technique ofinterplay within the Hierarchy itself, to a certain degree between Shamballa andthe Hierarchy, and to an increasing extent between Humanity and the Hierarchy—isbased entirely on a sense of relation. Therefore only a certain level ofconscious Lives can invoke Shamballa and evoke response, and this because They[72] have Themselves developed some of the aspects of that type of mentalunderstanding which is the hierarchical expression of the Universal Mind. Thelight and futile talk of certain writers and thinkers anent the cosmicconsciousness, and their flippant use of such phrases as “tuning in with theInfinite” or “tapping the Universal Mind” serve only to show how very little isknown in reality about the responses and the reactions of those of high initiaterank or of those on the highest levels of hierarchical life.True capacity to invoke and evoke (within initiate ranks) is based upon amysterious development—impossible before the time of the third initiation—of theesoteric sense. The active use of the esoteric sense in the occult trainingoffered to aspirants, disciples and initiates of lesser degree produces certainchanges within the brain, with corresponding changes within the buddhic vehicle;these changes enable one at will (after the third Initiation of Transfiguration)to contact the Being, Life, or the monadic POINT of contact with Whom he will beincreasingly affiliated, or the Member of the Hierarchy Whom he may desire toconsult. It does not involve the use of speech or words but is simply atechnical method whereby an initiate within the Hierarchy or en rapport withShamballa can make his presence felt and certain ideas can be presented by him.Upon this I will not further enlarge.For average humanity, the development of the intuition is the lowercorrespondence to this type of esoteric sense employed by initiates of highdegree—or this mode of perceptive intercourse, as it is sometimes called. Withinthe Ashrams, advanced disciples are taught how to discover within themselves andto use this new potency and thus develop the needed mechanism. They can knowsimultaneously both the demand and the answer or response which their invocationapplication has evoked. All disciples who [73] have taken the third initiationhave the power to invoke and to be evoked, and hence this technique is notpermitted to those of lower status. A highly developed discriminative faculty ishere needed. It is in reality an advanced part of the technique whereby—in theearliest stages—the disciple is permitted to attract the attention of theMaster. This he does through the very importunity of his desire; later, throughthe use of his acquired knowledge, he proceeds to what is called “the regulatednature of his appeal.” The appeal is then less regulated by desire and moreunder the control of will.I am not here dealing with invocation and evocation as it is carried on betweenHumanity and the Hierarchy. I gave much along this line when I made public thevarious Invocations whereby I have been attempting to substitute the invocativemethod for the selfish use of prayer and the limiting mode of the averagemeditation process. It is a slow process by means of which this method ofintercourse must be learnt and mastered, and no textbook or information on thesubject is of much use. Nor am I going to deal with the ordinary telepathyprevalent among men and natural to so many, as this has been dealt with earlierin this book. But at this point I should like to emphasise something whichapplies to every human being. When animal-man passed through the door ofindividualisation and became a human being he came possessed of an innatepotency of sight ; for aeons he has seen in the three worlds, and many have forseveral lives sought after the vision which stabilises the aspirant upon thePath. Through the door of initiation, having attained the mystical vision, eachaspirant will become aware of that within himself which permits of a spiritualperception of such an expansive nature that he gets his first real andindividual glimpse of the divine Plan; from that moment his entire life isaltered. Later (and this [74] I cannot expect the student to understand; if hethinks he does, he is being misled by words), he will pass through the door ofidentification . This is a perfectly meaningless phrase, since its significanceis most carefully guarded. Symbolically speaking and in order to preserve theconcept of this door in the mind of humanity, true esoteric meetings are enteredon the password. Only the WORD can enter through this door—this highest andwidest of all doors. Once through that door and once eligible to the CouncilChamber of the Great Lord, the Initiate will comprehend what is meant by“monadic impression.” It is not impression by a Monad (that meaningless term)upon the brain of a man who has constructed the antahkarana and passed thefourth initiation. It is an innate responsiveness to the Purpose of theUniversal Mind of the One in Whom we live and move and have our being.XI. RESULTS OF CONTACT AND RECEPTIVITY[75] I am not indicating in any way how an individual can become telepathic. Allthose developments within the area or region of progressive contacts are onlyuseful and truly available when they are developed normally and naturally andare not the result of premature unfoldment. When the development is prematurethere is always the danger of wrong, erroneous and self-centred interpretations.The telepathic information can be of purely selfish or personal import and thattype of telepathy has no place in what I am seeking to impart. People todayfrequently evidence a telepathic tendency or capacity. They tune in (a phrasethey regard as more euphonious than the words “telepathic rapport”) withsomething or someone, though they know not what it is. Everything that theypurport to register is regarded by them as of major importance: it is usuallyself-related and not due to their high point of spiritual unfoldment whichwarrants their being the custodians of mysterious spiritual messages—usually ofa most unimportant and platitudinous nature. There are many sources of thesemessages and it might be useful if I here mentioned some of them; what I have tosay may prove to be of value to the general occult public.1. Messages emanating from the relatively nice, well-trained subconscious natureof the recipient. These well up from the subconscious but are regarded by therecipient as coming from an outside source. Introspective people frequentlypenetrate into the layer of subconscious recollection and are quite unaware ofso doing. Their interest in themselves is so intense. Not knowing that they havedone this, [76] they regard what they find as unusual, beautiful and important,and then proceed to formulate it into messages, which they expect their friendsand the general public to regard as spiritually based. These messages arenormally innocuous, sometimes beautiful, because they are a mixture of what therecipients have read and gathered from the mystical writing or have heard fromChristian sources and the Bible. It is really the content of their rightthinking along spiritual lines and can do no one any harm, but is of no trueimportance whatsoever. It accounts, however, for eighty-five percent (85%) ofthe so-called telepathic or inspired writings so prevalent at this time.2. Impressions from the soul, which are translated into concepts and writtendown by the personality; the recipient is deeply impressed by the relativelyhigh vibration which accompanies them, forgetting that the vibration of the soulis that of a Master, for the soul is a Master on its own plane. These are truesoul impressions but usually have in them nothing new or of major importance;they are, again, the result of past ages of soul development (as far as thepersonality is concerned); they are, therefore, that which an awakeningpersonality has contributed to the soul of the good, the true and the beautiful,plus that which has entered into the personality consciousness as a result ofsoul contact. This accounts for eight percent (8%) of the writings andcommunications put before the general public by aspirants today.3. Teachings given by a senior or more advanced disciple on the inner planes toa disciple under training or who has just been admitted into an Ashram. Theseteachings bear the impress and conclusions of the senior disciple and arefrequently of value; they may—and often do—contain information of which therecipient is totally unaware. The criterion here is that nothing (literallynothing) will concern [77] the recipient, either spiritually or mentally or inany other way connected with his personality, nor will they contain theplatitudes of the religious background of the recipient. They will account forfive percent (5%) of the teaching given, but this is in relation to the entireworld and the percentage does not refer to some one occult group, one religiousfaith or one nation. The recognition of this is of vital importance.4. Communications from a Master to His disciple. This accounts for two percent(2%) of the entire telepathic receptivity, demonstrated by humanity as a wholethroughout the entire world. Western students would here do well to rememberthat the subjective Eastern student is far more prone to telepathic receptivitythan is his Western brother; this has a definite bearing on all the aboveclassifications, which is somewhat humiliating for the Western mystic and occultstudent. The World Scriptures emanate from another department of the second rayteaching faculty. In this statement I do not include The Old Testament exceptsuch passages as the Twenty-third Psalm and certain passages out of theProphets, particularly the Prophet Isaiah. The World Scriptures were written formystics, occupied with beauty, comfort, and encouragement, and were not writtenfor occultists. I would call this to your attention.In this section of the teaching I am dealing with the nature and results ofcontact, of receptivity. I am giving no rules for individual development, andwould not, if I could. Humanity today is developing receivers of every kind ofconcept, beginning with the lowest of them all—the masses of men who, throughdemagogues, the newspapers, the radio, books and lectures, are conditioned bymany minds, according to their ray type of receptivity. As true intelligencedevelops and as love begins to permeate human thinking, these conditioningfactors will get increasingly [78] less attractive. This means when the soulbecomes of greater life importance and man-made ideas (if such a phrase ispermissible) of less importance. There are, in reality, no man-made ideas. Thereare only ideas as grasped by the intelligentsia and then as “stepped down” byhumanity’s constant reaction to glamour, to emotional or astral conclusions, andto selfish interpretations.It must be remembered that the activity of all these “impressing agencies” isfelt in a wide and general sense throughout the entire planet and the planetaryaura. No kingdom in nature escapes this impact, and it is thus that the purposeof the Lord of the World is carried out. Being, Coherence and Activity are thusblended into one created and creative whole; life, quality and appearancerespond unitedly to the imposed intention of the planetary Logos and yet, at thesame time, remain creatively free as regards their reaction to these contactedimpressions; this reaction is necessarily dependent upon the type and quality ofthe mechanism which registers the impression. This mechanism has been developedby the life within the form throughout the creative period and—as far as thetime element has been involved—the indwelling entity in any kingdom in naturehas been free, and the time has been long or short, and the reaction toimpression has been rapid or slow, according to the will of the controllinglife. In the mineral kingdom, this reaction is very slow, for inertia or tamascontrols the spiritual life within the mineral form; in the vegetable kingdom,it is more rapid, and under the invocative appeal of the lives in that kingdomthe deva world is invoked and greatly aids and hastens the unfoldment of thevegetable consciousness; this is one reason for its relative sinlessness andextraordinary purity.The major impression registered in the second kingdom of nature emanates fromthe angel worlds and from the [79] deva hierarchy. The angels and devas are tothe vegetable kingdom what the spiritual Hierarchy is to humanity. This is, ofcourse, a mystery with which you have no concern. But impressions and reactionsare to be found in both these kingdoms, and upon such response depends theevolution of the indwelling consciousness.The animal kingdom has a peculiar relation to the fourth kingdom in nature, andthe unfolding of the animal consciousness proceeds along lines paralleling, yetdissimilar to that of the human being who is beginning to respond to the kingdomof souls, the fifth kingdom. It is the karma and destiny of the fourth kingdomto be the impressing agent for the third; the problem is complicated, however,by the fact that the animal kingdom antedates the human and had, therefore,generated a measure of karma—both good and evil—prior to the appearance ofmankind. The “impressing process” carried forward by humanity is modified andoften negated by two factors:1. Human ignorance and selfishness, plus inability to work consciously andintelligently with the embryonic minds within animal forms; this is true exceptin a few (a very few) cases which involve the domestic animals. When humanity isitself further advanced, its intelligent impression upon the consciousness ofthe animal kingdom will produce planetary results. At present this is not so. Itwill only come when the animal kingdom (as a result of human understanding)becomes invocative.2. The self-generated karma of the animal kingdom which is largely being workedoff in its relation to mankind today. The karmic entity—holding a type of rulewithin the third kingdom—is a part of the planetary Dweller on the Threshold.PLANETARY SEQUENCE OF IMPRESSION[80] You will note, therefore, the amazing planetary sequence of impression—allof it emanating from the highest possible sources, though stepped down andregulated to the receiving factors; all of it concerned to a greater or lessdegree (according to the quality of the mechanism of reception) with the willand purpose of Sanat Kumara; all of it, during the aeons, achieving a grouppotency and a responding sensitivity.The main factor preventing a completely unimpeded sequence of impression fromShamballa straight down into the mineral kingdom, via all the other kingdoms, isthe factor of freewill, resulting in karmic responsibility. This can be eithergood or bad. It is interesting to note here that both the good and the bad karmaproduce conditions which not only have to be worked out, but that they lead toconditions which delay what we—from our limited point of view—might look upon asthe liberation of the planet. The generating of good karma necessitates the“living through” of conditions where everything (for the man responsible or forany other form within its limitations) is good, happy, beneficent and useful.The evil karma generated in any kingdom in relation to the “realm where dwelleththe planetary Dweller on the Threshold” stands between the cosmic Door ofInitiation and our planetary Logos. This Dweller represents all the mistakes anderrors due to wrong reactions, unrecognised contacts, deliberate choices made indefiance of known good, and mass movements and mass activities which aretemporarily not progressive in time and space. I realise that where these factsapply to the subhuman kingdoms in nature you are not aware of what I mean, butthat does not alter the law or movements which are in no way related to humanevolution. In connection with the planetary Logos I would like to add that inthat great planetary struggle and His subsequent [81] initiation, we are allimplicated—from the atom of substance up to and including all the Lives whichform the Council Chamber of the Lord of the World; it is this titanic effortwhich is made by the sum total of all the living processes and entities thatcompose the manifestation of Sanat Kumara which is responsible for the creativeevolutionary processes; it is also responsible for what we call time , with allthat that concept involves of events, opportunity, the past, the present and thefuture, the good and the evil.The dynamic impression which emanates from Shamballa reaches forth in greatcycles and cyclic waves; these are impulsed from extra-planetary sources, asdemanded or invoked by the Lord of the World and His Associates; they emanate inresponse to the “acclaimed will” of Sanat Kumara in the Council Chamber.This high spiritual and ultimate impression moves outward along the seven rays,viewing them as seven streams of spiritual energy, qualified and coloured by theShamballic impression; this process repeats itself when hierarchical invocationis effective and successfully established.This again is repeated between the Hierarchy and Humanity in response to humaninvocation; this is becoming increasingly intelligent, potent and evocative.The problem of the human kingdom is, however, very great. Humanity is therecipient of so many impacts, so many impressions, so many telepathic and mentalcurrents and so many qualified vibratory impressions from all the seven kingdomsin nature that aeons have elapsed in developing the adequate discriminativesensitivity and in establishing the certitude of the point in evolution fromwhich conscious invocation must arise and upon which the evoked impression mustbe registered. Unconscious invocation proceeds all the time; when it becomesconscious, it becomes exceedingly powerful.[82] The entire human family is today an amazing receiver of impressions, owingto its myriad types of susceptible mechanisms. These impressionable instrumentsare capable of registering tamasic impressions, coming from the sub-humankingdoms, particularly the third and the first; they record rajasic impressionscoming from mental sources of all kinds; they are also—to a much lessdegree—responsive to sattvic or rhythmic impressions. Their response to thesehigh impressions and their registration of truth, light and quality, coming fromthe highest sources is, however, growing.It is because of this that the human kingdom (the great middle kingdom whosefunction it is to mediate between the higher and the lower) is the subject ofmuch divine impression, conveying the Purpose of Sanat Kumara. This you know. Ihave taught you much along this line in A Treatise on the Seven Rays and also inthe earlier A Treatise on Cosmic Fire. In these present instructions I amdealing with group possibilities, with groups which can be trained to record,register and be impressed by the Hierarchy. Such a group can be in the positionof being able to invoke the Hierarchy with power if it so choose. I am againbringing these things to your attention as aspirants and disciples, but from anangle different to those in my earlier writings. The responsibility ofimpressionability, of telepathic registration and of invocative appeal is verygreat; hence what I have written here.XII. RELATION OF THE HUMAN TO THE HIERARCHICAL CENTRE[83] True telepathic rapport is part of the Supreme Science of Contact and haspeculiar and definite reference to humanity. Many different terms might be usedin the effort to convey some understanding of this subtle, subjective mode ofrelationship, and I have used among others the following:1. The Science of Contact.2. The Science of Impression.3. The Science of Invocation and Evocation.4. The Science of Relationship.5. The Science of Sensitivity.All these terms convey different aspects of the reaction of form or forms tocontact, to impression, to impact, to environment, to the thought context ofvarious minds, to ascending and descending energies, to the invocation of agentsand the evocation of their response. The whole planetary system is in reality avast interlocking, inter-dependent and inter-related complexity of vehiclescommunicating or responsive to communication.The moment that this inter-related and communicating system is studied from theangle of relationships, then the processes of evolution and the goal of thespirit of man (which is in reality the Spirit of the planetary Logos) become ofvital and supreme importance, but are at the same time most difficult tocomprehend. So immense is the theme that it is profitless for us to do more thandeal with two factors: [84]1. The Science of Impression in relation to mankind.2. The impressing Centres, as they affect the understanding of relationship.The many modes of contact between the many subhuman and superhuman forms,groupings, and kingdoms are too intricate in their nature to be grasped at thistime by students, and—which is more important—the information would be of smalluse to them. We will, therefore, confine ourselves to the Science of Impressionand the Science of Invocation and Evocation only in so far as they affecthumanity. These—from the human angle—cover reception of impression and of ideas,and expressions of the consequences of sensitivity at this time and in thisparticular cycle.We are to consider, therefore, the relation of the human centre to thehierarchical centre and the growing responsiveness of humanity to the “Centrewhere the Will of God is known”. As I said before, it is not my intention togive here the rules governing telepathic intercourse. Such intercourse is foundbetween man and man and groups and groups. The relationship is slowly andnormally developed and requires no hastening. It is developing as the othersenses of man and his apparatus of perception have developed. Humanity is,however, outstripping telepathic development in the rapid responsiveness ofentire groups, and of human beings en masse, to group impression and to groupimpartation of ideas. The sudden response of groups and nations to massideologies has been both unexpected and difficult to handle wisely andconstructively. It was not anticipated by either Shamballa or the Hierarchy thatmass impression would develop more quickly than that of individual sensitivity,but it has happened that way. The individual within a group and working within agroup is far [85] more correctly sensitive than is the man struggling alone torender himself sensitive to impression.One of the factors militating against personal telepathic development lies inthe fact that the strong, potent and modern ascension of the spirit in man—as awhole—frequently offsets personality reactions, and telepathy is a personalitymatter depending upon contact between mind and mind. The moment, however, thatman tries to be telepathic, he is immediately swept into a vortex of abstractenergies which condition him for spiritual impression far more than they fit himfor personal relationships telepathically established.This surprising development freed the supervising Masters for some of Theirplans and led Them to abandon the training of individual disciples in telepathicrapport and to recognise the opportunity to train and develop invocative groups.Instead of working in lower mental substance with picked aspirants, They changedthe medium of contact to that of the soul and launched the relatively newScience of Invocation and Evocation . The lower mind then became simply aninterpreter of impressions with the emphasis upon the group mind, the grouppurpose and the group will. This developing system of trained invocatives madethe mind a positive acting factor and tuned out all tendency to negativity.This hierarchical decision then necessarily led to the instituting of theprocesses of group initiation, thus shifting the area of training and the wholeof the teaching process and of preparation for initiation on to higher levels.The experiment of giving mankind the Great Invocation was tried and is provingsuccessful, though much yet remains to be done.It might be said, therefore, that the four requirements which are needed to aidthe disciple to meet the demands of [86] the initiatory process are “the abilityto be impressed, the capacity accurately to register the impression, the powerto record what has been given, and then to give it word forms in the mindconsciousness.” On the basis of the information received, the disciple must thenproperly invoke the needed energies and learn through experience to produce aresponsive evocation. My earlier statement on this subject a few pages back wasintended to lead up to this teaching and I repeat it here: “The entire human family is today an amazing receiver of impressions, owingto the myriad types of susceptible mechanisms.... It is because of this that thehuman kingdom (the great middle kingdom whose function it is to mediate betweenthe higher and the lower) is the subject of so much divine impression, conveyingthe purpose of Sanat Kumara.... In these present instructions I am dealing withgroup possibilities, with groups which can be trained to record, register and beimpressed by the Hierarchy. Such a group can be in the position of being able toinvoke the Hierarchy with power if it so choose. I am again bringing thesethings to your attention as aspirants and disciples, but from an angle differentto those in my earlier writings. The responsibility of impressionability, oftelepathic registration and of invocative appeal is very great.”SOURCES OF IMPRESSION FOR THE DISCIPLEFor the aspirant and particularly for the conscious disciple, the impression tobe considered comes from four sources:1. From the disciple’s own soul.2. From the Ashram with which he is to be affiliated.3. Directly from the Master.4. From the Spiritual Triad, via the antahkarana.[87] The first two stages cover the period of the first two initiations; thethird precedes the third initiation and persists until the disciple is himself aMaster; the fourth type of informative impression can be registered after thethird initiation and reach the disciple in the Ashram ; he then has the taskhimself of impressing his mind with what he has been told and known within theAshram; eventually, as a Master of an Ashram, he starts upon one of the majorhierarchical tasks of mastering the Science of Impression. There are therefore,two aspects to this work of impression: one deals with the capacity to beimpressed; the other with the ability to be an impressing agent. The disciple isnot permitted to practise the art of impressing until he himself is among thosewho receive Triadal impression and therefore impression from Shamballa, withinthe protective area or aura of the Ashram with which he is affiliated. It mustbe remembered that this Science of Impression is in reality the science ofthoughtform-making, thoughtform vitalisation and thoughtform direction; and onlya disciple who has passed through the processes of Transfiguration and is nolonger the victim of his own personality can be entrusted with so dangerous acycle of powers. As long as there exists any desire for selfish power, forunspiritual control and for influence over the minds of other human beings orover groups, the disciple cannot be trusted, under the hierarchical rules, withthe deliberate creation of thoughtforms designed to produce specific effects,and with their dispersal to men and groups. After he has passed the tests of theTransfiguration Initiation he may do so.The Science of Impression is the bedrock or the foundation for the practice oftelepathy. If a major world test were to be made, those receptive to impressionwould be found to fall into two groups: [88]1. Those possessing unconscious receptivity to telepathic impression. They atpresent constitute a majority wherein the impression is received via the solarplexus, and the thoughtforms thus generated are dispatched from the throatcentre of the one who is the impressing agent.2. Those who are developing or have developed a conscious receptivity whereinthe impression is, first of all, received by the mind and then imparted to andregistered by the brain. The one who is the impressing agent in this case worksvia the centre between the eyebrows, the ajna centre.The first group of recipients are purely personality grounded or focussed. Insome cases they are only physically aware of the life processes and of somecontact which remains for them unrecognised and unchecked or uncontrolled in anyway. Under this group we must, therefore, class all mediumistic phenomena, eventhose of the highest astral or spiritual nature, plus the messages received fromthe usually beautiful subconscious of the average person upon the ProbationaryPath. Messages from the disciple’s own soul are intermediate between thosemediumistic expressions and those which are definitely mental in nature.With this last mentioned type of communication, there will be found mixedcertain messages or impressions from the Ashram which the disciple will be aptto confuse with group telepathy, soul communication and direct relation with theMaster—a relationship at this stage non-existent. This will not greatly matter,because when the disciple begins to realise certain differences, a new type ofregistration will awaken and guide the disciple’s consciousness.This stage, which embraces the second type of impression in its earliest forms,can be quite a long one, for it [89] covers a very definite period of transitionfrom the astral plane to the mental plane. The time equation varies according toray and the age of the soul. Sixth ray people, for instance, are very slow inmaking this transition, owing to the pronounced factor of glamour; first andsecond ray people are relatively quick. Third ray people are also slow, for theyare lost in the threads of their own glamorous manipulations and their deviousthinking, and hardly know where truth begins and delusion ends; illusion, whichis the problem of the mental types on all rays, is far more temporary in itseffects than is delusion.When the disciple has mastered to some degree the significant difference betweenmessages from his own subconscious or the subconscious of other people with whomhe may be en rapport, and the messages coming from his own soul, his life thenbecomes more self-directed and organised, more fruitful from the angle ofservice, and therefore of definite use to the Hierarchy. He learns todistinguish the messages coming from his own soul from those which arehierarchical; his life becomes more clearly directed; he next distinguishesdefinitely and accurately the communications which come to him from the Ashramand which are sent out to make impression upon the minds of aspirants anddisciples of all degrees and of all ray types. When he can distinguish betweenthese various communications, then and only then does the third type ofcommunication become possible—direct messages which are due to contact with theMaster of his Ashram in person. He, by that time, possesses what has been called“the freedom of the Ashram” and “the keys to the Kingdom of God”; he can then betrusted with some of the directive potency of the Ashram itself. His thinkingwill then affect and reach others. This developing effectiveness grows withrapidity when the fourth type of impression is familiar to the disciple: [90]that coming from the Spiritual Triad, and therefore from the Monad andShamballa. There are consequently (to this final stage of impression) threelesser though definite states, each marking an expansion in the realm of serviceand each related to the last three initiations of the total possible nineinitiations which confront developing humanity. The sixth initiation, in whichonly Masters can participate, marks a transition from the first three stages ofimpressibility required by the disciples as preludes to the fifth initiation—orin reality to the third, fourth and fifth—and are related to the three stages ofTriadal communication, each of which is related to the seventh, the eighth andthe ninth initiations.Never does the geometrical pattern, the numerical progression or the Law ofCorrespondences break down in the understanding of the purpose and the plans ofthe planetary Logos—established before the worlds were created and finding theirprototypes upon the cosmic mental planes. These points are peculiarly difficultfor men to grasp at this time wherein their state of consciousness isconcentratedly individualised.Nevertheless, there is on man’s part a steadily growing responsiveness to anexpanding environment, as for instance man’s recognition of the distinctionbetween nationalism and inter-nationalism. This responsiveness is naturallyconditioned by human freewill, effective peculiarly in the timing process. Hemay learn rapidly and fast or he may go the slow way, but his state ofconsciousness remains one of a developing reaction to his environment, asregistered by his consciousness, and in which he (stage by stage) becomes anintegral factor. This integration into his environment, his absorption of itsatmosphere and his potency in progression are all related to the fact that he iscreated to receive impression and that he possesses a mechanism of response toall [91] the facets of the divine expression in manifestation. It is for thatreason that the truly illumined man and all who have taken the three highestinitiations are always referred to as “the diamond souled”; they, in theirtotality constitute the “jewel in the lotus”—that twelve-petalled lotus which isthe symbol and expression of the potency of the planetary Logos.You can see, therefore, how the theme of revelation runs throughout the entireevolutionary process; it must never be forgotten that step by step, stage bystage, expansion after expansion, initiation after initiation, the divine WHOLEis realised by man. The method is impressed from a hitherto unrecognisedenvironment; this only becomes possible in this particular form when “the Sonsof Mind who are the Sons of God and whose nature is at-one with His began tomove on Earth”. The Science of Impression is in reality the technique wherebyHumanity has been taught by the Spiritual Hierarchy from the moment of its firstappearance upon Earth; it is the technique which all disciples have to learn (nomatter which of the Seven Paths they may eventually choose) and it is also thesublime art which every Master practises on inspiration from Shamballa; it is atechnique which is implemented by the Will, and its consummation is the completeassimilation of the “little wills of men” into the divine Purpose; it is theacceptance on their part of the promotion of that Purpose through rightimpression on all forms of life at any particular point of evolution. Disciplesthen become agents of the divine will and are entrusted with the direction ofenergies, with the plan and with the secrets and the inspiration which arehidden in the Mind of God.HIS CONTRIBUTION TO THE DIVINE PLANTo that knowledge—germinated and formed in the solar system previous tothis—they add that which the present solar system has to give and to mature; themagnetic [92] attractiveness of the second Ray of Love-Wisdom in one of itsthree major forms or Rays of Aspect, implemented by the four Rays of Attribute.This power to use the ray energies to attract and impress the constantlyexpanding revelation is the clue to all the work going forward today, and tothis activity we give the name of the Science of Impression. It involves theconstant opening up of a new environment—an environment which reaches all theway from the lowest grade of daily living, undertaken by the least developed ofhuman beings, to that point upon the ladder of evolution when the aspirantbecomes consciously susceptible to what we call spiritual impression. At thatpoint he becomes capable of being more sensitive to a higher range of impressionand—at the same time—he himself begins to learn the art of impressing the mindsof others, to master the understanding of the level from which he works as animpressing agent, and to know who are the sons of men he can impress. He has tomaster also the secondary lesson of adapting his environment in such a mannerthat he can impress others and the impression can find its way through hisenvironing circumstances and into the usually inattentive minds for whom hefeels a responsibility.This he does through a growing knowledge of himself and through learning the artof registering . The clearer and the more deeply apprehending is his capacity toregister the impression to which he is subjected and to which he is sensitive,the more easily will he reach those he must aid towards a wider and deeperinsight. This registering of his own expanding environment—with all itsimplications of a new vision, a new goal, a wider field of service—leads to theinflowing energies ( arriving on the wings of inspiration) becoming a reservoirof thought-substance, to the use of which he must accustom himself.[93] The first step then is the fact of recording and of reducing into correctand available concepts, ideas and thoughtforms, that which he has registered.This marks the first stage in his truly occult service, and to this new type ofservice he will be increasingly dedicated . From the reservoir ofthought-substance he learns to project those forms, those magnetic ideas, whichwill invoke the attention of those he seeks to help; this is called the stage ofresultant invocation . It is an invocative act, an invocative way of living,which will find its way into the minds of men, and which will call forth orevoke from them a response and a widening consciousness; the processes ofspiritual impression are thereby set up; it is also an invocation—on the part ofthe disciple—for further and greater impression and inspiration in order toincrease his ability to serve.XIII. TELEPATHIC SENSITIVITY A NORMAL UNFOLDMENT[94] You will have noticed that I have given no instructions as to the art ofdeveloping telepathic sensitivity. The reason is, as I told you before, thatthis sensitivity should be, and always is, a normal unfoldment when the discipleis correctly oriented, completely dedicated and learning decentralisation. If itis a forced process, then the sensitivity developed is not normal and carrieswith it much difficulty and future danger. Where the disciple is concerned,release from the constant consideration of personal circumstances and problemsleads inevitably to a clear mental release; this then provides those areas offree mental perception which make the higher sensitivity possible. Gradually, asthe disciple acquires true freedom of thought and the power to be receptive tothe impression of the abstract mind, he creates for himself a reservoir ofthought which becomes available at need for the helping of other people and forthe necessities of his growing world service. Later, he becomes sensitive toimpression from the Hierarchy. This is at first purely ashramic, but is latertransformed into total hierarchical impression by the time the disciple is aMaster; the Plan is then the dynamic substance providing the content of thereservoir of thought upon which he can draw. This is a statement of unique andunusual importance. Later still, he becomes sensitive to impression fromShamballa, and the quality of the Will which implements planetary Purpose isadded to the content of his available knowledge. The point which I seek to makehere, however, is the fact of the existence of a growing reservoir of thoughtwhich the disciple has created in response to the many [95] varying impressionsto which he is becoming increasingly sensitive; the ideas, concepts andspiritual objectives of which he is becoming aware are steadily being formulatedby him into thoughts with their appropriated thoughtforms, and upon these helearns to draw as he seeks to serve his fellowmen. He finds himself inpossession of a reservoir or pool of thought-substance which is the result ofhis own mental activity, of his innate receptivity, and which provides thematerial for teaching and the “fount of knowledge” upon which he can draw whenhe seeks to aid other people.The essential point to be grasped is that sensitivity to impression is a normaland natural unfoldment, paralleling spiritual development. I gave you a clue tothe entire process when I said that“Sensitivity to impression involves the engendering of a magnetic aura uponwhich the highest impressions can play.”I would have you give the deepest consideration to these words. As the disciplebegins to demonstrate soul quality, and the second divine aspect takespossession of him and controls and colours his entire life, automatically thehigher sensitivity is developed; he becomes a magnet for spiritual ideas andconcepts; he attracts into his field of consciousness the outline, and later thedetails, of the hierarchical Plan; he becomes aware eventually of the planetaryPurpose; all these impressions are not things which he must seek out and learnlaboriously to ascertain, to hold and seize upon. They drop into his field ofconsciousness because he has created a magnetic aura which invokes them andbrings them “into his mind”. This magnetic aura begins to form itself from thefirst moment he makes a contact with his soul; it deepens and grows as thosecontacts increase in frequency and become eventually an habitual state ofconsciousness; [96] then, at will and at all times, he is en rapport with hissoul, the second divine aspect.PARALLELING SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENTIt is this aura which is in reality the reservoir of thought-substance uponwhich he can spiritually rely. His point of focus is upon the mental plane. Heis no longer controlled by the astral nature; he is successfully constructingthe antahkarana along which the higher impressions can flow; he learns not todissipate this inflow but to accumulate within the aura (with which he hassurrounded himself) the knowledge and the wisdom which he realises his serviceto his fellowmen requires. A disciple is a magnetic centre of light andknowledge just in so far as the magnetic aura is held by him in a state ofreceptivity. It is then constantly invocative of the higher range ofimpressions; it can be evoked and set into “distributing activity” by that whichis lower and which is demanding aid. The disciple therefore, in due time,becomes a tiny or minute correspondence of the Hierarchy—invocative as it is toShamballa and easily evoked by human demand. These are points warranting carefulconsideration. They involve a primary recognition of points of tension and theirconsequent expansion into magnetic auras or areas, capable of invocation andevocation.These areas of sensitivity pass through three stages, upon which it is not myintention to enlarge:1. Sensitivity to impression from other human beings. This sensitivity becomesof use in service when the needed magnetic aura has been engendered and isbrought under scientific control.2. Sensitivity to group impression—the passage of ideas from group to group. Thedisciple can become a receptive agent within any group of which he is a part,and this ability indicates progress in his part. [97]3. Sensitivity to hierarchical impressions, reaching the disciple via theantahkarana and—later—from the Hierarchy as a whole, when he has attained someof the higher initiations. This indicates ability to register impression fromShamballa.It would be of value if we now considered three points which are concerned withsensitivity to impression, with the construction of the resultant reservoir ofthought, and with responsiveness to subsequent invocative appeals. These threepoints are:1. Processes of Registration.2. Processes of Recording Interpretations.3. Processes of Resultant Invocative Response.I would recall to your minds the knowledge that the aura which each of you hascreated around the central nucleus of your incarnated self or soul is a fragmentof the over-shadowing soul which brought you into manifestation. This aura is(as you well know) composed of the emanations of the etheric body, and this inits turn embodies three types of energy for which you are individuallyresponsible. These three types are (when added to the energy of prana whichcomposes the etheric vehicles):1. The health aura. This is essentially physical.2. The astral aura, which is usually by far the most dominant factor, extensiveand controlling.3. The mental aura, which is in most cases relatively small but which developsrapidly once the disciple takes his own development consciously in hand, or oncethe polarisation of the personality is upon the mental plane. The time willeventually come when [98] the mental aura will obliterate (if I may use such aninadequate term) the emotional or astral aura, and then the soul quality of lovewill create a substitute, so that the needed sensitivity does not entirelydisappear but is of a higher and far more acute nature.In this threefold aura (or more correctly, fourfold, if you count the ethericvehicle) every individual lives and moves and has his being; it is this living,vital aura which is the recording agent of all impressions, both objective andsubjective. It is this “agent of sensitive response” which the indwelling selfhas to control and use in order to register impression or to direct etheric ormental impression out into the world of men. Astral impression is purely selfishand individual and, though it may affect a man’s surroundings, is not directedas are the other energies registered. It is the aura which predominantly createsthe effects which a person has upon his associates; it is not primarily hiswords which produce reactions even though they are supposed to embody hisreactions and his thinking but which are, in reality, usually expressions of hisemotional desires.All of us, therefore, carry around with us a subjective mechanism which is atrue and perfect picture of our peculiar point in evolution. It is the aurawhich a Master watches, and this is a factor of major importance in the life ofthe disciple. The light of the soul within the aura and the condition of thevarious aspects of the aura indicate whether or not the disciple is nearing thePath of Discipleship. As the emotional reactions lessen, and as the mentalapparatus clarifies, the progress of the aspirant can be exactly noted. I wouldhave you distinguish carefully between the astral and the mental bodies and thatwhich they emanate. The bodies (so called) are substantial in nature; the aurais essentially radiatory and extends from each substantial [99] vehicle in everydirection. This is a point which should be most carefully noted.The problem of the aspirant as he “engenders” his magnetic aura is himself towithdraw, and thus lessen the extent and the power of the astral aura, andextend and increase the potency of the mental aura. It should be remembered thatthe large majority of aspirants are definitely polarised in the astral nature,and that therefore their problem is to achieve a different polarisation and tobecome focussed upon the mental plane. This takes time and vast effort.Eventually—as mentioned above—the radiation of the soul is substituted in placeof the hitherto present emotional activity of the aspirant; this emanation is,in reality, a radiation from the love petals of the egoic lotus.The moment an aspirant begins to work consciously at his own unfoldment and toconsider and deal with the aura with which he is equipped, he then passesthrough three stages during his progress upon the Path of Return. These are:1. The stage wherein he discovers the potency and the quality of his astralaura. Owing to the fact that this is (in this second solar system) the qualityof love and its distortion into the astral nature, the development of emotionalsensitivity is peculiarly and almost unnaturally strong. It is stronger than themental body and its mental direction.2. The stage wherein the mental vehicle increases its potency and produces,finally, a mental radiation which is so strong that it dominates and controlsthe astral aura.3. The stage wherein the soul expresses its essential nature of love and beginsto pour its radiation into the astral aura, via the astral body. Eventually the[100] sensitivity of love is substituted for emotional sensitivity and desire.Aspirants are to be found at all these three stages of sensitivity. There comesa moment during the second initiation when the soul of the initiate sweeps intoactivity and fundamental force (if I might use such a term) submerges the astralnature, vitalising and inspiring the astral body, changing temporarily thequality of the astral aura, and establishing a control which will lead finallyto the substitution which I have mentioned above. This is an aspect of the truthwhich underlies the doctrine of “vicarious atonement”—a doctrine which has beenwoefully distorted by Christian theology.REGISTRATION, RECORDING AND INTERPRETATIONLet us now deal with the aforementioned “Processes of Registration, of RecordingInterpretations, and the Resultant Invocative Response.” We must bear in mindalways that I am stating general rules and that I am not dealing either with theideal or with the undesirable; the sources of impression change as the disciplemakes progress, though always the larger and the greater source will include alllesser sources.The fact that a man is sensitive to hierarchical impression in his mental aurawill not prevent his being sensitive in his astral nature to the invocative andemotional call of human beings. The two together are most useful in effect, ifthe disciple sees to it that they are related. Forget this not, brother of mine.The capacity to interpret recorded impressions is likewise learnt as the mentalaura develops under the influence of the “mind held steady in the light” of thesoul; the disciple learns that all recorded truth is susceptible to manyinterpretations, and that these unfold with increasing clarity as he takes oneinitiation after another, and as he develops conscious responsiveness. Theability to invoke demonstrates from life to life and involves [101] theinvocation of conscious response from the anima mundi or from the subconscioussoul of all things, as well as from the human consciousness and from the worldof super-conscious contact.This ability develops steadily as the aspirant treads the Path of Discipleship;it is frequently prefaced in the earlier stages by much confusion, much astralpsychism and frequent wrong interpretations. There is no need at this stage,however, for undue distress, because all that is needed is experience, and thatexperience is gained through experiment and its expression in the daily life. Inno case is the truism of learning through a system of trial and error provedmore correct than it is in the life and experience of the accepting disciple.When he is an accepted disciple, the errors decrease in number even though thetrials (or the experimental use of the many varying energies) become moreextensive and, therefore, cover a much wider range of activities.The Processes of Registration are founded upon what I might call invocativeapproaches from a wide area of possible contacts. The disciple has to learn todistinguish between these many impacts upon his sensitive aura. In the earlystages the majority of them are unconsciously registered, though theregistration is acute and accurate; the goal, nevertheless, is consciousregistration; this is brought about through the constant and steady holding ofthe attitude of the Observer. It is developed through the attainment ofdetachment—the detachment of the Observer from all desires and longings whichconcern the separated self. It will therefore be obvious to you that the use ofthe word “observer” involves the concept of duality and, therefore, ofseparation. In this case, however, the motive prompting observation is notself-interest, but the determination to clarify the aura so that it can registeronly [102] that which will be illuminating and related to the divine Plan, whichwill be to the benefit of humanity and, therefore, to the creation of a newserver within the Ashrams of the Hierarchy.The divisions made by certain psychologists of the consciousness of man intosubconscious, conscious or self-conscious, and superconscious have a realmeasure of value here. It must be remembered, however, that the disciple, firstof all, becomes a truly conscious unit of humanity and thus develops a trueself-consciousness. This he arrives at by discriminating between the lower selfand the higher self, and this renders his magnetic aura sensitive to an aspectof himself which has not hitherto been a controlling factor. From that achievedpoint he begins to register impressions with increasing clarity and accuracy.Usually, in the early stages, the one desire of the disciple is to registerimpressions from the Hierarchy; he much prefers that idea to the idea ofregistering impressions from his own soul or from the surrounding human factors,his fellowmen and the environment and the circumstances which they create. Helongs for what might be called “vertical impression.” This motive, being verylargely self-centredness, turns the disciple introspectively in upon himself,and it is in this stage that many aspirants become prisoners, astrally speaking,because they register in their magnetic aura the many astrally motivatedthoughtforms of what they believe and hope “vertical impression” supposedlywould convey. They contact with facility the astral counterparts of the higherworlds, which are reflected (and thereby distorted) into the astral plane; theworld there registered is glamoured by wrong and selfish desires and by thewishful thinking of well-meaning devotees. Upon this I need not enlarge. Alldisciples—at some point or another of their training—have to work through thisphase of glamour; in so doing they [103] clarify and intensify the magnetic auraand, simultaneously, clarify the surrounding astral world with which they are incontact. They learn also that the longing to register impressions from theHierarchy must give place to the determination to place their magnetic aura atthe disposal of humanity; they then learn to register human need and tounderstand thereby where help is possible and their fellowmen can be served. Bymeans of this conscious registration of invocative appeals from the world ofhorizontal contacts, the magnetic aura of the disciple is cleared of thehindering and engrossing thoughtforms, and from the aspirational desires andlongings which have hitherto prevented right registration. The disciple thenceases to create them, and those which have been created die out or atrophy forlack of attention.Later on, when the accepting disciple becomes the accepted disciple and ispermitted to participate in ashramic activity, he adds the ability to registerhierarchical impression; this however is only possible after he has learnt toregister impression coming to him from his own soul (the vertical impression)and from the surrounding world of men (the horizontal impression). When he hastaken certain important initiations, his magnetic aura will be capable ofregistering impression from the subhuman kingdoms in nature. Again, later on,when he is a Master of the Wisdom and, therefore, a full member of the fifthkingdom in nature, the world of hierarchical life and activity will be the worldfrom which horizontal impression will be made upon his magnetic aura, andvertical impression will come from the higher levels of the Spiritual Triad and,still later, from Shamballa. Then the world of humanity will be to him what thesubhuman kingdoms were when the fourth kingdom, the human, was the field of hisregistered horizontal impression. [104] You have here the true significance ofthe Cross of humanity clearly revealed.The fact of registration is no unusual phenomenon. Sensitive people areconstantly being impressed from some level of consciousness or other, and arereceptive to these impressions according to the level of consciousness uponwhich they normally function; mediums, for instance, are exceedingly prone toreceive impressions from etheric or astral levels, as are the vast majority ofastral psychics—and their name is legion. Impressions from mental levels(concrete, abstract or of a more exalted nature) make their impress upon theminds of those who have attained a true measure of focus upon the mental plane.Scientists, mystics, mathematicians, occult students, aspirants and disciples,educators and humanitarians and all who love their fellowmen are all susceptibleto such impression, and one of the outstanding needs of the disciple is todevelop adequate sensitivity to ashramic impression and contact. Then he movesout of the group of mental sensitives listed above.The problem with which I now deal is far deeper and concerns the interpretationand the clear and correct recording of the impression, which is a far moredifficult matter. The subject who is impressed must know the source of theimpression; he must be able to relate it to some field of demanded information,correction, instruction, or energy distribution. He must be able to stateclearly on what aspect of his recording mechanism (the mind, the astral body,the energy body, or the brain) the imparted and registered impression has madeimpact. One of the difficulties, for instance, facing the aspiring disciple andthe earnest occult student is to record directly in the brain impressions fromthe Spiritual Triad (and later from the Monad), via the antahkarana.[105] This impression must be a direct descent from mental levels to the brain,avoiding all contact with the astral body; only in so far as this direct descentis attained will the recorded impression be devoid of error. It will not then betinctured with any emotional complex whatsoever, for it is the astral level ofconsciousness which is the great distorter of essential truth. Impressions fromthe Ashram or from the Spiritual Triad (which are the only type of impressionswith which I am here concerned) pass through three stages:1. The stage of mental recording . The clarity and the accuracy of thisrecording will be dependent upon the condition of the channel of reception, theantahkarana; in this recording, curiously enough, a certain element of timeenters in. It is not time as you know it upon the physical plane, which is butthe registration by the brain of passing “events”; it is the higher mentalcorrespondence to time. Into this, I cannot here enter as the theme is tooabstruse; for time, in this connection, is related to distance, to descent, tofocus, and to the power to record.2. The stage of brain reception . The accuracy of this reception will bedependent upon the quality of the physical brain cells, upon the polarisation ofthe thinking man in the head centre, and the freedom of the brain cells from allemotional impression. The difficulty lies here, that the receiving aspirant orthe focussed thinker is always aware emotionally of the descent of the higherimpression and of the consequent clarification of the theme of his thought. Thismust, however, be recorded by a perfectly quiescent astral vehicle, andtherefore you will see one of the main objectives of true meditation. [106]3. The stage of recognised interpretation . This is an exceedingly difficultphase. Interpretation is dependent upon many factors: the educationalbackground, the point reached in evolution, the mystical or the occult approachof the disciple to the centre of truth, his freedom from the lower psychism, hisessential humility (which plays a major part in proper understanding), and hispersonality decentralisation. In fact, the character in its entirety is involvedin this important matter of correct interpretation.In this aspect of impression the subject of SYMBOLS must necessarily beinvolved. All impressions must necessarily be translated and interpreted insymbols, in word forms or in pictorial representations; these the aspirantcannot avoid; and it is in the word forms (which are, needless to point out, inthe nature of symbols) that he is apt to go astray. They are the media throughwhich the registered impression is conveyed to the brain consciousness, i.e., tothe physical plane awareness of the disciple, thus making possible his usefulcomprehension of abstract ideas or of those aspects of the Path which it is hisduty to understand and teach.There is no need for me to elaborate this theme. The true disciple is ever awareof the possibility of error, of the intervention of psychic intrusions anddistortions; he knows well that true and effective interpretation of theimparted impression is dependent largely upon the purity of the receivingchannel and upon the freedom of his nature from all aspects of the lowerpsychism—a point oft forgotten. A thick veil of concrete thoughtforms can alsodistort the true interpretation, as can astral intervention; the teaching uponthe Path and the spiritual impression can be interfered with by glamour from theastral plane or by separative and concrete [107] ideas emanating from mentallevels. In this case it can be truly said that “the mind is the slayer of thereal.” There is a deep occult significance to the words “an open mind”; it is asessential to correct interpretation as is freedom from glamour and the psychicexpressions to be found upon the astral plane.Here again you can grasp the necessity of a factual alignment so that a directchannel is created, along which the impression (directed by some higher sourcethan the personality) can descend into the brain. At first, this channel andalignment must be established between the brain and the soul; this will involveall the three aspects of the personality—the etheric body, the astral vehicleand the mind nature; basically, this aligning process should be started anddeveloped upon the Probationary Path and brought to a relatively high state ofeffectiveness upon the earlier stages of the Path of Discipleship. Later, as thedisciple consciously creates the antahkarana and becomes a functioning part ofthe Ashram, he learns (whilst practising alignment) to by-pass—if I may use sucha word—two aspects of himself which have hitherto been of major importance: theastral vehicle and the soul body or causal body. The astral body is thusby-passed before the fourth initiation, and the soul body before the fifth; theentire process of “by-passing” takes much time and must be worked at withintensity, first of all with the focus upon the emotional nature throughconscious discrimination, and finally upon the soul nature under the inspirationof the Spiritual Triad which is eventually substituted for the soul. All thiswill take many incarnations. For the registration and the interpretation of thehigher impressions is a basic occult science and takes much learning andapplication to perfect.As the two processes are slowly developed, the third stage automatically becomesincreasingly effective. The received [108] and interpreted impression bringsabout fundamental changes in the life and the state of consciousness of theaspirant and, above all, in his orientation . He becomes an evocative andinvocative centre of energy. That which he has received through the medium ofhis aligning channel becomes a potent factor in invoking a fresh flood of higherimpression; it also makes him evocative upon the physical plane, so that themagnetic aura which he has engendered becomes increasingly sensitive to thesespiritual inflowing impressions, and also increasingly sensitive to that whichhe evokes from his surrounding physical environment and from humanity. Hebecomes a power station en rapport with the Hierarchy and he receives anddistributes (in response to the evocative call of humanity and human need) theenergy received. He also becomes a “receiver of light” and of spiritualillumination, and a distributor of light in the dark places of the world andinto human hearts. He is, therefore, an invocative and evocative centre for useby the Hierarchy in the three worlds of human evolution.XIV. HIGHER ASPECTS OF RELATIONSHIP[109] The word telepathy has been used primarily to cover the many phases ofmental contact and the exchange of thought without the use of the spoken orwritten word or sign. However, what is thus understood in this modern usage doesnot cover the higher aspects of “relationship within the Universal Mind.” Thethird aspect, that of intelligence, is involved when interpretation of contactoccurs; the second aspect, that of love-wisdom, is the factor which makes thehigher impression possible, and this it does whilst that aspect is developing orin process of coming into functioning activity. During this developing process,only straight telepathy is possible and this is of two kinds:1. Sympathetic telepathy or immediate understanding, awareness of events,apprehensions of happenings, and identification with personality reactions. Thisis all connected with the solar plexus activity of the personality and this—whenthe love nature or second aspect is unfolded or unfolding—becomes the “seed orgerm” of the intuitive faculty. The entire process is, therefore, astral-buddhicand involves the lower aspects of the Universal Mind as an agent.2. Mental telepathy or the interplay of transmitted thought. Though this is aconstant phenomenon among advanced intellectual people, it is still scarcelyrecognised, its laws and modes of expression are as yet unknown, and the bestminds and interpreters on subjective levels still confuse it with solar plexusreactions. It is a relatively new and unexplored science, [110] but the range ofits activities is not astral and, therefore, related to the solar plexus centre,for the substance in which this science is carried forward is not astralsubstance but mental substance, and therefore another vehicle is involved andemployed, that of the mental body. It is the “seed or germ” of higher contactsand of impressions coming from levels higher than the buddhic or intuitionalplane. It is related to the higher aspect of the Universal Mind, to theintelligent Will. In both cases, the lower aspect of love (emotional andsensitive astral response) and the pure love of the soul are involved.Astral, sympathetic sensitivity is fallible and frequently erroneous in itsconjectures and interpretations. The higher telepathy—also a form ofsensitivity, and which is as an entering door or concept—becomes eventuallyinfallible; in its earlier stages (where methods of interpretation and ofdeduction are concerned) it may prove frequently at fault.Straight mental telepathy is one of the highest demonstrations of thepersonality; it is in the nature of a bridging faculty, for it is one of themajor steps towards the higher impression; it always presupposes a relativelyhigh stage of mental development, and that is one reason why it is not yetregarded as a reputable, proved and provable capacity of the human being. Inthis case, the mind is truly “the slayer of the Real,” and the sources and modesof subjective knowledge still remain in a dark area of the human consciousness.The normal processes of evolution will, however, prove incontrovertibly theexistence of faculties which make the higher spiritual and subjectiveimpressions possible, and eventually normal.This “Supreme Science of Contact” can be—as already explained—broken up into thefollowing phases which are [111] all progressively developed from each other.Forget not the inevitable continuity which is the outstanding characteristic ofthe evolutionary process.1. Astral sensitive awareness. This is based upon the reactions of the solarplexus, and the entire process is carried forward upon the astral plane and withastral substance. This, in its highest form, becomes the factor which latermakes intuitive awareness and intuitive sensitivity possible; then the processis carried forward in buddhic substance. Aspirants are, at one stage of theirdevelopment, strongly astral-buddhic in nature. This should be remembered.2. Mental telepathy. This involves naturally two minds or several minds, and theprocess is carried forward in the substance of the mental plane. It is thefactor which makes possible the activity which we call “impression.” Thisimpression comes largely from certain aspects of the mental plane, such as:a. The soul of the telepathic individual, using the knowledge petals of theegoic lotus—a high form of mental intelligence.b. The abstract mind, so called. This aspect of mental substance is largely usedby the Hierarchy in order to reach the minds of disciples. It is only within thelast few centuries that the Hierarchy has shifted the focus of its livingattention on to the buddhic plane and away from the mental plane. This hasbecome possible because the aspirants of the world are now sensitive to contactswhich are founded upon an astral-buddhic consciousness but which are strictlycarried on within mental [112] substance. This necessarily involves the threeaspects of the mind, found therein: the concrete mind, the Son of Mind, and theabstract sensitivity or reaction. This involves (on the physical plane) anactivity of the pituitary body (as you can readily see) and also the use of theajna centre.3. The occult Science of Impression . This becomes possible when the other twoforms of telepathic rapport are present and are developing to a certain point ofaccuracy. It is dependent also upon the construction of the antahkarana and uponthe steady orientation of the aspirant or disciple toward the Spiritual Triad;it also becomes possible when the abstract mind is developed and sensitive, andcan thus become the seed or germ of the spiritual Will; this will involveresponsiveness to divine purpose. The higher aspect of this abstract mind is theatmic plane. It is useful to realise the substantial nature of these two levelsof consciousness. It is within the substance of the atmic plane that theactivity is set up which can impress the abstract mind, which then becomes theseat of the consciousness of the spiritual man; at the same time, he remains inactive possession and use of his personality and continues to employ theconcrete mind; astral sensitivity, however, then begins to fall below thethreshold of consciousness and thus joins the great array of instincts and ofinstinctual reactions of which the human being is possessed and which admit himinto the life and conditioned awareness of all that exists in the three worlds,including the three subhuman kingdoms of nature. It is with these subliminatedand [113] controlled instincts that those Masters and disciples work whose taskit is to oversee the evolution of the forms of life in the subhuman kingdoms.The higher forms of mental telepathy, involving the soul and the abstract mindare concerned solely with the divine Plan—as the Hierarchy works it out in thethree worlds. The Science of Impression is concerned, therefore, primarily, withthe divine Purpose as Shamballa is working it out, and also with those higheraspects of hierarchical work which are not concerned with work in the threeworlds. This is a point upon which I would ask you to ponder.Today, owing to the curious evolutionary stage reached in the human kingdom, anintermediate aspect of the three above forms of impression has been instituted;it is like an interim period between full human expression and the fullexpression of the kingdom of souls. This we call:4. The Science of Invocation and Evocation. This science can and does use theunintelligent urges and the higher (yet inchoate) longings of the masses of menin an invocative form; it does so in order to bridge the gap existing inconsciousness between the life of the ordinary man, the life of the integratedpersonality and the life of the soul. Through the use of this invocativedemand—oft speechless and not consciously expressed—the disciples of the worldcan focus; they can employ it and thus generate an energy which will be strongenough to make a true impact and a definite impression upon Beings and Livesfound on levels higher than those in the three worlds. This impact evokes areaction from these higher Beings, and then a spiritual and intelligentinterplay is set up which is of great value in promoting [114] an added stimulusand an increased vitalisation of the normal and usually slow evolutionaryprocess. This is happening today in an acute form and accounts for much that istaking place in the world of human affairs at this time. The spreadingstimulation is of a very intense nature. The invocative cry of humanity is notonly the voiceless appeal which the hierarchical workers are everywheremobilising, but it finds expression also in all the plans and schemes, theformulated platforms, and the many groups and organisations which are dedicatedto the betterment of human living.Certain basic concepts underlie every phase of the Science of Contact, andwithout them there would be no basis for any effort to master this science.Please grasp this fact. There are three which must always be borne in mind:1. The medium through which the thought currents or impressions (from no matterwhat source) must pass in order to make an impact upon the human brain is theplanetary etheric body . This is fundamental in its implications. This ethericvehicle makes all relationships possible, because the individual etheric body isan integral part of the vital body of the planet. This vital body is the mediumalso of all instinctual reactions, such as an animal will evidence when dangeris around. The closer that this etheric body is interwoven (if I may use such aword) with the dense physical vehicle, the clearer will be the instinctualreaction—as in the illustration which I have given and which is based uponmillennia of such reactions; the greater also will be the sensitivity and themore aptitude will there be for telepathic [115] contact and recognition of thehigher impressions. It might also be added that the etheric body of a discipleor even of an advanced person can be so handled and dealt with that it canreject much that might otherwise impinge upon it, pass through it or use it as achannel. This training is automatic; evidence of it can also be seen in theability which the human mechanism possesses to tune out all contacts andimpressions that it may not need, to which it is so accustomed that they do noteven register, and all that it deems undesirable or not fit for consideration.The reason that true telepathic contact between minds is not more prevalent isdue to the fact that few people think with an adequate clarity or with theenergy required; they do not create true, concise or powerful thoughtforms or—ifthey do—these thoughtforms are not correctly directed towards the intendedobjective. When a man is a disciple and deliberately seeks to be impressed byhis soul, by the Master or by the Spiritual Triad, the task of the impressingagent is relatively simple; all the disciple has to do is to develop rightreceptivity, plus an intuitive intelligence which will enable him to makecorrect interpretations, and to recognise also the source of the communicationor impression.This brings us to the second basic concept:2. Sensitivity to impression involves the engendering of a magnetic aura uponwhich the highest impressions can play . This I dealt with (in some measure) inthe preceding section. It should be borne in mind that the potency of themagnetic aura which envelops all human beings is to be found at present in four[116] areas of substance; these four areas are close to four major centres. Whenthe individual is strictly low grade and is predominantly animal in nature, thenthe majority of impacting impressions will reach him automatically through thesacral centre; such impacting impressions (as you can well imagine) will beheavy and yet dynamic; they will have reference to all that concerns hisphysical being, his physical appetites, and his physical comfort or discomfort.There are however, today, relatively few persons in proportion to the planetarypopulation who use the sacral centre as the major registering organ. Themagnetic aura (when this is the case) is relatively small; all the tendencies ofthis tiny aura are downward in nature, and all impressions (which cannotpossibly come from a higher source than the man himself) work down through theaura of the sacral centre. Most of the impressions are therefore purelyinstinctual in nature and little or no thought is involved; there is evidence,however, of what can be understood as aspiration even if it is not what a trueaspirant might regard as spiritual in nature.The average, though still unthinking, human being works through his astral bodyand, because he is there polarised, works through his solar plexuscentre—etherically and primarily. All impressions find entrance into the auravia the area around that part of the etheric vehicle. It is through this majorcentre that the ordinary medium works, receiving impressions and communicationsfrom astral entities or from the animated astral forms to be found in theglamours created by humanity.Forget not, nevertheless, that true aspiration is essentially an astral productor reaction; all aspirants—[117] in the early stages of their slowre-orientation—work through the solar plexus centre, and thus only graduallyfocus the lower energies there, prior to their transmutation and elevation tothe higher centre, the heart centre. There are certain disciples who workdeliberately upon the astral plane, under instruction from the Master of theirAshram, in order to reach such neophytes and thus to impress them with theknowledge and the subtle information needed for their progress. No Master worksin this manner, and the Masters have therefore to use certain of Their disciplesin this service. Such disciples direct the desired impression to the solarplexus area of the magnetic aura. This magnetic aura has another point of entryin the region of the throat centre, utilising it as the recipient of higherimpressions. This centre or area of energy is largely used and vitally activatedby those who are the creative workers of the world; they have necessarily made adirect contact with the soul and are therefore wide open to those intuitiveideas which are the source of their creative work. According to the success theyhave in such creative production, and according to the beauty of their work,will be the impression they thereby convey to other men. Curiously enough, thenew and peculiar forms of art which delight some people and which outrage thesense of beauty in others are largely solar plexus creations and are thereforenot of a truly high order. In a few of them—a very few—the throat centre isinvolved.The magnetic aura around the head is that which is truly sensitive to thehighest impressions and is the point of entry to the head centre. Upon this Ineed not enlarge; all that I have taught you is related [118] to the awakeningof this highest centre, prior to the aspirant’s becoming a member of the Kingdomof God. The ajna centre is not involved and it will remain for several morecenturies the agent of directed impression and not the objective of suchimpressions.The next key-thought which is of importance is found in the words:3. “The Plan is the dynamic substance , providing the content of the reservoirupon which the impressing agent can draw and to which the recipient of theimpression must become sensitive.”This sentence requires probably a quite serious readjustment in the thinking ofmost students. The concept of the Plan as Substance will assuredly be new tothem, and new perhaps also to you. It is nevertheless a concept which they mustendeavour to grasp. Let me phrase it somewhat differently: The Plan constitutesor is composed of the substance in which the Members of the Hierarchyconsistently work. Let us take this important concept and break it up into itscomponent parts for the sake of clarity. I am strongly emphasising these wordsbecause this concept is of an importance almost beyond human comprehension, andbecause its understanding may revise and re-vitalise your entire approach to thePlan, and you will therefore be enabled to work in a fresh and in an entirelynew manner:1. The Plan IS substance. It is essentially substantial energy. And energy issubstance and nothing else.2. The substance (which is the Plan) is dynamic in nature, and is thereforeimpregnated with the energy of WILL. [119]3. The Plan constitutes a reservoir of energised substance, held in solution bythe WILL of Sanat Kumara and embodying His intangible purpose (intangible to usbut not intangible to Him).4. It is this planetary Substance upon which the “impressing agents” mustdraw—the Nirmanakayas, the Members of the Hierarchy and the working disciples ofthe world, plus all spiritual sensitives of a certain degree.5. Recipients of the desired impression must become sensitive to thissubstantial energy.This entire proposition can be referred back to the originating Thinker Whobrought our manifested world into being, and Who sequentially and under the Lawof Evolution is bringing to fruition the objective of His thinking. In thelarger and wider sense, it is that sum total of the ocean of energies in which“we live and move and have our being.” This is the sevenfold body of theplanetary Logos.THE IMPRESSING AGENTS OF THE DIVINE WILLWe are not here, however, considering the larger Whole, but we are dealing witha specific and focussed area of the planetary consciousness. This is foundmidway between the highest plane whereon the Council Chamber of the Great Lordis found and the three planes which form the active arena for hierarchicalwork—the three levels of consciousness of the Spiritual Triad. This “focussedarea” has been precipitated by the Agents of the divine Will; They know theultimate purpose of Sanat Kumara and hold it steadfastly in view, making itavailable to those Masters of the Wisdom Who can act as the “impressing Agentsof Sanat Kumara’s Will.” These are the Manu, the Christ, and the Mahachohan, theLord of Civilisation.It might be said here that the three Buddhas of Activity are the primeimpressing Agents and that the three Great [120] Lords are the “impressedRecipients” at an exceedingly high level; this is the atmic level of awareness,which is the area energised by the divine Will.When dealing with the fifth Point of Revelation (Discipleship in the New Age,Vol II) I said that it concerned itself with the highest aspect of the Will—withthat which produces the highest synthesis, the final synthesis. The planetaryPurpose is the eventual synthesis of the initial thought of the planetary Logos,and to this thought we give always the unmeaning name of “GLORY”; this standsfor all that we can conceive of the divine purpose; it is, for us, a “blaze ofglory.” The human mind is at this stage (in time and space) unable to registerany aspect of the Purpose; all that we can do is to cooperate with the effortsof the Hierarchy to activate those things and events which will make themanifestation of the Purpose eventually possible. This purpose will constitutethe ultimate revelation to the final root-race of men; it therefore lies a verylong way ahead of our present point in evolution.I will here make a statement which will probably convey nothing to theintelligence of the average disciple, but which may constitute a fruitful seedthought to the initiate who may read these words:The Purpose of Sanat Kumara is created at present by the synthesis which thenature of the final seven Paths reveals. It is adapted in time and space tohuman intelligence by the presented Plan, and—in the glory of consummation—thecompleted Plan will reveal the Purpose on all the seven planes of evolution.Then evolution, as formulated and imposed by the Hierarchy, will end and agreater dynamic expansion will take its place.You will note that all along the lines of teaching there comes an eventualmerging and blending, and that, at a [121] certain point in the development ofconsciousness, the many lines of spiritual approach become the few lines ofconscious spiritual awareness. So it is in relation to the detail of theevolutionary process, with the formulation of the hierarchical Plan, and withthe recognition of the Purpose. Speaking practically (and that is always ofmajor importance), it might be said that evolution controls the form of thePurpose; the Plan concerns the hierarchical recognition of the Purpose, whilstthe Purpose is the synthetic Thought which pours into the supernal consciousnessof the Lord of the World along the seven Paths of which the Masters become awareat a certain very high initiation.The seven great energies flow into our manifested world along the lines of theseven Paths; these are not the direct energies of the seven Rays, because theseconcern consciousness in a most specific manner; they are the substantialenergies of material expression and their origin concerns a great mystery. Thesetwo lines of energy—material energy and the energy of consciousness—when broughttogether by divine Purpose, constitute the essential dualism of our manifestedlife.All that we are able to recognise of that Purpose is the hierarchical Plan, andthis only disciples and advanced aspirants can judge and recognise. This Plan isbased upon knowledge of divine guidance in the Past, the recognition of progressout of that Past into the Present, plus the effort to become sensitive to theright emergence of that Plan (embodying ever an aspect of the Purpose) in theimmediate Future. The Purpose is related to the Past, the Present and theFuture; the Agents of the Plan are impressed from Shamballa, via theNirmanakayas; the process is then repeated, and advanced humanity become therecipients, the sensitive recipients, of the Plan as transmitted to them by theimpressing Agents, the Masters, working through the [122] New Group of WorldServers. This group is the lower correspondence of the Nirmanakayas, therecipients of impression from Shamballa. See you, therefore, the beauty and thesynthesis, the inter-dependence and the cooperative interplay which isdemonstrated right through the chain of Hierarchy from the very highest Agent tothe very lowest recipient of divine impression.The key to all this is energy. Energy is substance, and this substance isqualified by divine dynamic WILL. There is much to be learnt anent the Will.Will as dynamic energy is not yet understood in its true sense by human beings.Mankind usually recognises will as fixed determination; this is in reality theirindividual effort to impress substance (personal or environing) with their ownself-will or with their well-intended effort to conform to what they believe tobe the will of God, speaking symbolically. But men know nothing yet of theprocess of working with dynamic energised substance, for it basically impressesthem and uses them as they become aware of the Plan and thus come under theinfluence of the Spiritual Triad. They are used and not using that which isavailable for the furtherance of the Plan—the dynamic energy of the divine Will.This dynamic Will cannot become available nor can disciples truly work with thePlan until the antahkarana is to some measure adequately constructed, though notyet perfected.It becomes of service, therefore, for the aspirant and the disciple to know thenature of the Agents Who can locate their magnetic aura and impress upon itTheir understanding of the Plan; these Agents may be accepted disciples orinitiates and Masters; then the aspirant or disciple must find those to whom hecan personally act as an impressing agent. He has consequently to study himselfas a recipient and also as an agent , as a responsive factor and also as an[123] originating and impressing factor. This might be regarded as thescientific approach to the spiritual life, and it is of value because thenecessity of service is implicit in the necessity for receptivity; all is,therefore, related to Invocation and Evocation.It is in our next basic theme, the nature of the etheric body, that we shallfind again the higher relationships and the interdependence of many alliedfactors. This interdependence emerges acutely the higher one progresses into thescheme of correspondences. Eventually, a point of fusion is reached.XV. INTER-PLANETARY AND EXTRA-PLANETARY RELATIONSHIPS[124] The subject of the etheric body of all forms and of the etheric body ofthe planetary Logos is necessarily of major importance in any consideration ofthe Supreme Science of Contact. It is this concept of sensitive contact which Iseek to emphasise as we study the three points or the three basic conceptsoutlined in the preceding section. All such terms as planes, groups, creativeHierarchies, and centres are simply word modes of inferring relationship,interplay and mutual impression between the beings or the lives who make up thesum total of our manifested universe; they are nevertheless signs of our leadingup to a planetary synthesis or a planetary integrity of a nature hitherto noteven visioned by man.The subject is necessarily one of immense difficulty, for all human beings thinkin terms of their own contacts and relationships, which are strictly limited andare not expressed in terms of the One Life, flowing through all forms and allkingdoms, or through all the diverse planetary evolutions (of which you knownothing) and thus creating in time and space a living intelligent planetaryEntity of systemic maturity, qualified by immense attractive and integratingenergies, motivated by a supreme Purpose—a Purpose which is part of the vastpurpose of the solar Logos, working through the planetary Logoi, and thereforeresponsible for the well-being and progressive evolution of all lives and groupsof lives within the framework and the essential structure of our planet.The relation evoked is, as you can well imagine, inter-planetary andextra-planetary; these terms mean little to [125] the average disciple and hehas to wait until the initiatory process puts him in a position where he canfrankly evaluate the situation. Of the latter stages, we can know nothing; onlyin the Council Chamber of Shamballa are these extra-planetary contacts andrelationships recognisable. But one basic fact must be grasped, and that is thatthe medium of relationship and of contact is SUBSTANCE; and the effect of theserelationships, carried on through this medium, is the gradual development andprogressive unfoldment of the three divine Aspects which all esotericistsrecognise, and of others which the coming millennia will reveal. Thecontributing factor, therefore, within and upon our planet is what we mightregard as the three major centres of the planetary Logos:1. The Head Centre , the dynamic Agent of the extra-planetary Purpose, theexpression of the divine planetary Will as focussed in Shamballa. This is theenergy of Synthesis, the source of all planetary life; it connotes essentialBeing.2. The Heart Centre , the Agent of the Plan of evolution. This is the expressionof divine Love or pure Reason, the Hierarchy. It is essentially the energy ofAttraction, the kingdom of souls.3. The Throat Centre, the Agent of all the three Aspects in relation to thethree subhuman kingdoms in nature, the expression also of the divineIntelligence, Humanity. This is the energy of active Mind and makes humanity themacrocosm of the microcosm, the three subhuman kingdoms. Humanity is to thesekingdoms what the Hierarchy is to the fourth kingdom in nature, the humankingdom.These are the elements of the occult science and—for students such asyou—contain nothing new. Nevertheless, they [126] need to be seen in theirtriple relationship if the mode of working of the One Life is to be grasped moreclearly than is now the case. The aim of the entire evolutionary scheme is tobring these three Centres into such a close relationship that the synthesis ofthe divine Purpose can work out harmoniously on every possible (note thatphrase) level of consciousness. If this can take place, then the basic Thought,the fundamental Proposition of the planetary Logos can eventually be disclosedto man.May I remind you of the occult statement that every living being or manifestedlife—from the planetary Logos down to the tiniest atom—either has been, is, orwill be a man. This has reference to the past, to the present and to the futureof every manifested life. Therefore, the fact of humanity and of that for whichhumanity stands is probably the primary and major aspect of the divine purpose.Pause and think about this statement. It is, therefore, the first clear factwhich indicates the measure and the magnitude of a human being; and until twoother facts are sequentially revealed to us, it will not be possible correctlyto gauge the wider aspects of the purpose of Sanat Kumara. Everything subhumanis slowly moving towards a definite human experience; it is also passing throughthe phase of human effort and consequent experience, or else it has moved out ofthat phase of limitation and—through initiation—is drafting human nature into astate of divinity (to use a most inadequate phrase).HUMANITY’S KEY ROLEThe keynote, therefore, of the Lord of the World is HUMANITY for it is thebasis, the goal and the essential inner structure of all being. Humanity itselfis the key to all evolutionary processes and to all correct understanding of thedivine Plan, expressing in time and space the divine Purpose. Why HE chose thatthis should be so, we know not; but it is a point to be accepted and rememberedin all study of [127] the Science of Impression because it is the factor thatmakes relationship and contact possible and it is also the source of allunderstanding. These are most difficult things to express and to enlarge upon,my brothers, and only the penetrating intuition can make these matters clearerto your avid and active intelligence.You will note, therefore, that though we call one of the major centres HUMANITY,yet—in the last analysis—all the centres are constituted of lives progressingtowards the human stage, of those units of life who are at the human stage, andthose who have left that stage far behind but who are endowed with all thefaculties and all the knowledges wrought out into human expression in earlierplanetary schemes or solar systems, or through our own definite andcharacteristic planetary life.Because of this uniformity of experience, the art of contact and the science ofimpression become entirely possible and normally effective. The great andomnipotent Lives in Shamballa can impress the omniscient Lives and lesser livesin the Hierarchy because They share a common humanity; the hierarchical Workersor Masters and Initiates can consequently impress humanity because of sharedexperience and understanding; then the lives that compose the human familypresent the goal to the subhuman kingdoms and can, and do, impress them becauseof basic instinctual tendencies which are expressed in the human group but whichare latent instinctual tendencies and potential assets in the three subhumangroups.This teaching has always been implicit in the esoteric doctrines but has notbeen sufficiently emphasised, owing to the point in evolution of mankind. Today,mankind has made such progress that these points can be made effectively. Iwould call to your attention that this was the keynote of the Gospel story: thehuman-divine nature of the Christ, [128] relating Him to the Father through Hisessential divinity, and also to man through His essential humanity. TheChristian Church gave a wrong slant to the teaching by making Christ appear asunique, though the higher criticism (deemed so shocking fifty years ago) hasdone much to correct this false impression.The outstanding characteristic of humanity is intelligent sensitivity toimpression. Ponder on this definite and emphatic statement. The work of scienceis, after all, simply the development of the knowledge of substance and of form;this knowledge will make it possible for humanity eventually to act as the majorimpressing agent in relation to the three subhuman kingdoms in nature; that ishumanity’s primary responsibility. This work of relationship is practically thework of developing or the mode of unfoldment of human sensitivity. I refer hereto sensitivity to impression from or by the Hierarchy.The work done through the processes of initiation is intended to fit disciplesand initiates to receive impression from Shamballa; the initiate is essentiallya blend of scientific and religious training; he has been re-oriented to certainphases of divine existence which are not yet recognised by the average humanbeing. I am endeavouring to make clear to you the basic synthesis underlying allmanifested life upon our planet, and also the close interplay or relationshipwhich forever exists and expresses itself through the supreme science of contactor of impression.The three great Centres are in close relationship at all times, even if this isnot yet recognised by the intelligent disciple; an unbroken series ofimpressions is ever present, relating one centre to another and bringing aboutan evolutionary unity of objective, and developing (with exceeding rapidity atthis time) a secondary science, that of Invocation [129] and Evocation. Thisscience is in reality the science of impression in activity and not simply intheory.The first great Invocation was uttered by the planetary Logos when He expressedthe desire to manifest and thus invoked and brought to Himself the substanceneeded for His designed expression. That started the chain of being or ofhierarchy; inter-relation was then set up between all “substantial” units; themore potent and the more dynamic and greater could then impress the lesser andthe weaker until gradually—as the aeons swept by—the seven Centres were createdand were in close impressionable relationship. Of these seven we are at thistime considering only three; the others we know very little about, for they arelargely composed of units of the deva evolutions (and I would ask you to notethe plurality there) and of subhuman lives, working under impression from thehead, the heart and the throat centres of the planetary Logos.Students are apt to make their thinking unduly complicated when they seek toitemise and define, to separate into academic groups and brackets themultiplicity of energies with which they feel confronted when considering theplanetary and the human centres. I would advise you that you think simply and(certainly, at first) in terms of the three major energies as they emanate fromsome centre, become impressing agents, and then are again transmitted or steppeddown:1. The dynamic electrical energy of Life itself or divine potency, of embodiedPurpose, expressing through evolutionary manifestation the divine Will. It mightbe well to realise that purpose emanates from the cosmic mental plane and is theall-inclusive, synthetic, motivating principle which expresses itself as thedivine will upon the cosmic physical plane—the seven planes of our planetaryLife. This dynamic energy focuses itself through the Lives or Beings [130] Whocontrol and dominate Shamballa. Until the divine purpose has been achieved, theplanetary Logos holds all in manifestation through the potency of His Will, andanimates all forms with electric fire. Knowledge of this Will and Purpose comesto the student who is constructing the antahkarana and who is, therefore, comingunder the control of the Spiritual Triad, the threefold expression of the Monad.2. The attractive magnetic solar energ y to which we give the quite unsuitablename of Love. It is this energy which constitutes the cohering, unifying forcewhich holds the manifested universe or planetary form together and isresponsible for all relationships; it is this energy which is the soul of allthings or of all forms, beginning with the anima mundi and reaching its highestpoint of expression in the human soul which is the constituent factor in thefifth kingdom in nature, the Kingdom of God or of Souls. An understanding ofthis human potency comes as a man makes contact with his own soul and sets up astable relationship with that soul; then he becomes a soul-infused personality.As you well know, the threefold personality is to the soul what the SpiritualTriad is to the Monad: a clear medium of expression. Most students are or shouldbe today occupied with this attractive energy, for until they have mastered thedesire nature and have transmuted it into aspiration and soul control, theycannot hope to comprehend the dynamic energy of electric fire. This attractivemagnetism is the energy dominating and controlling the Hierarchy.3. The intelligent activity of fire by friction . Students would be well advisedto re-read A Treatise on Cosmic Fire where I deal at length with these threeconditioning energies. This third energy is the basic energy expressing itselfin the three worlds and in the four kingdoms in nature, climaxing its expressionin the creative energy of the human kingdom. [131] This energy emanatedoriginally (as far as our solar system and our planetary scheme are concerned)in the first solar system and is the best proven and the best known energy inmanifestation. It is the medium for activity in all forms through which theplanetary Logos expresses Himself; it is the result of the activity of thedivine Mind, as that peculiar type of divine energy plays upon and through allatoms and upon all atomic forms. The fission of the nucleus of the atom in thepast few years is the outer sign or demonstration that humanity has“encompassed” the divine Mind and can now move on to “encompass” the love or theattractive nature of divinity. Ponder upon this statement. I know not what wordto use but encompass and it is entirely inadequate. A new and deeper esotericterminology is badly needed.If you will work with and reflect upon these three fundamental energies andsearch for their expression within yourself, you will greatly simplify youroccult thinking. Let me here make a few more statements which you have perforceto accept hypothetically, but which can nevertheless be substantiated by you ifyou arrive at an understanding of the Law of Analogy or of Correspondences, andif you will also accept the truism that the microcosm reflects the macrocosmand, therefore, each human being is related to Deity through essentialsimilarity .SEVEN STATEMENTS DEPICTING THE PATTERN OF THE PRESENT PLANETARY WORKStatement One.Dynamic electric energy entered into our planetary sphere from extra-planetarysources and from a point of definite focus upon the cosmic mental plane; thisenergy was paralleled by a secondary energy from the sun Sirius, thus accountingfor the dualism of manifestation.Statement Two.This energy expanded outward from its central focus (the centre calledShamballa) and in this expansion became [132] the agency which impressed thePlan upon the serving Hierarchy. The Plan is that measure of possibility ofimmediate importance which the divine Purpose can present at any given moment intime and space.Statement Three.This process of expansion set up another focal point of energy, and the heartcentre of the planet, the Hierarchy came into being; thus two centres werecreated and en rapport, which constitutes a major event upon the involutionaryarc; to this, little attention has hitherto been paid. It coincided with” theadvent or the arrival of the Lords of Flame from the alter ego of our Earth, theplanet Venus. They created the nucleus of the Hierarchy which—in that far, verydistant time—consisted of only forty-nine members; these were advanced humanbeings and not souls awaiting incarnation in human form on Earth, as was thecase with the vast majority of these visiting Solar Angels.Statement Four.Alignment between the head centre and the heart centre upon the involutionaryarc was thus set up; another expansion took place which resulted, as you knowwell, in the creation of a new kingdom in nature, the fourth or human kingdom.This kingdom was destined to become and is today the third major centre in theplanetary life. Then another alignment, but one which is still contained uponthe involutionary arc, took place.Statement Five.Today, an evolutionary alignment is taking place. The planetary centre which wecall Humanity is active and vibrant, and it is now possible to “progress alongthe Upward Way and create the line which links the lesser with the higher,permitting thus an interplay.” Men are rapidly moving out of the human centreinto [133] the hierarchical centre; the mass of men are responding to spiritualimpression.Statement Six.At the same time, the heart centre of the planetary Logos, the Hierarchy, whilstit is being responsive to the invocation of the throat centre, Humanity, isbecoming increasingly evocative and is itself attaining a much higher contactand alignment with the head centre of the planetary Logos; it is, therefore,capable of receiving a constantly developing dynamic impression from Shamballa.Statement Seven.Thus a great alignment is being achieved through the relationship and theinterplay going on between these three major planetary centres; this produces aconstant inflow of energies from several different sources, and these energiesgalvanise these three centres into a new and increased activity. Invocation isarising all the time between these centres and producing a consequent evocationof impressing energies.In these seven statements, you have depicted a PATTERN of the present planetarywork or the present logoic thesis. An involutionary alignment (the guarantee offuture successful alignments) constitutes most ancient history; an evolutionaryalignment in which all three centres are involved is constantly producing aninterplay of energies as well as a constantly successful impression of onecentre upon another. Humanity, as the throat centre of the planetary Logos andthe prime planetary creative agency (which modern science demonstrates), invokesthe heart centre, the Hierarchy, and then receives the needed impression whichwill result in the developing civilisations and cultures as well as the eventualappearance on Earth of the fifth or spiritual [134] kingdom. The Hierarchy orthe planetary heart centre invokes Shamballa, the planetary head centre, and thePlan—as an expression of the Purpose—is impressed upon the hierarchicalconsciousness. If there is redundancy in these various comments of mine, it isentirely intentional; repetition serves the purposes of accurate presentationwhere esotericism is concerned.As the invocative system spreads and a greater alignment is attained,Shamballa—the planetary head centre—invokes energies outside the planetary lifeand the inflow of cosmic and solar energies will be very much greater; for thisthe esotericists of the world must be prepared. It will also produce the adventor appearance of many AVATARS, bringing with Them many and very different kindsof energies to those which hitherto have controlled human affairs and the eventsand evolution of the other, the subhuman kingdoms in nature. With thereappearance of the Christ as the focal point or the supreme Agent of theplanetary heart centre, a new era or “divine epoch” will be instituted. TheAvatar of Synthesis will draw very close to humanity and He will inaugurate the“reign of Avatars” Who will be embodied Purpose and spiritual Will; They willinitiate both the Hierarchy and Humanity into phases of the divine character ofwhich, at present, nothing is known and for which we have no terminology thatcould convey the exact facts and nature. All that I am attempting to do here isto give you a general outline of events which may lie centuries ahead but whichwill inevitably occur—once the Christ is again in physical Presence andrecognition on Earth.H.P.B. speaks in The Secret Doctrine of the “three periodical vehicles,”referring as he does so to the Monad, the Soul and the Personality; he isdealing, therefore, with the nine aspects of divinity which connote the ninemajor initiations and those divine characteristics through which [135] the threemajor aspects of divinity reflect themselves. In this connection, it is wellknown to students that the Monad expresses itself through the Spiritual Triad,the Soul through the three aspects of the Egoic Lotus, and the Personalitythrough the three mechanical vehicles. It will be obvious to you surely thatthese three periodical vehicles are under the influence or impression of thethree major planetary centres and are, therefore, finally conditioned by thethree major energies to which I referred earlier in this section. I do not feelit to be necessary to enlarge upon this basic relation; it is that whichintegrates the human soul into the vast general whole and makes the individualan intrinsic part of the sum total.THE CENTRES AND THE RAY ENERGIESThere is one aspect of the Science of Impression upon which I have not yettouched and that is the place of the centres as focal points, as transmitters oras agencies for the seven ray energies. It is known to esotericists that each ofthe seven centres comes under the influence or is the recipient of some rayenergy, and there is a general acceptance of the fact that the head centre isthe agent of the first Ray of Will or Power, the heart centre is the custodianof second Ray energy of Love-Wisdom, whilst the third Ray of active creativeIntelligence passes through and energises the throat centre. These Rays ofAspect do find expression through the three centres above the diaphragm, and—onthe larger scale—through Shamballa, the Hierarchy and Humanity. It is, however,equally true that Shamballa is primarily second ray as it is expressed, becausethat is the ray of the present solar system of which Shamballa is a part; andthat the first ray, or its dynamic life aspect, is focused in the heart, for theheart is the centre of life. The great centre which we call Humanity ispredominantly governed by the third Ray of Active Intelligence. This ray energyarrives at the throat centre via the head and the heart centres. I [136] ampointing this out for two reasons which must form part of your thinking as youstudy this science:1. All the centres come under the influence of all the rays, and this mustsurely be obvious in relation to average and undeveloped human beings. Were thisnot so, such human beings would he unable to respond to first ray, second rayand third ray energy, for the centres above the diaphragm are, in their case,inactive.2. In time and space and during the evolutionary process, it is not possible tosay which centre is expressing the energy of any particular ray, for there is aconstant movement and activity. The centre at the base of the spine isfrequently the expression of first ray energies. This is apt to be confusing.The human mind seeks to make everything precise, stable, to bracket certainrelations or to assign certain centres to certain ray energies. This cannot bedone.At the end of the world cycle, when divine purpose is fulfilled and theevolutionary process has brought about the changes and adjustments needed forthe full expression of the Will of Sanat Kumara, then the situation will bedifferent and men will know (as the Members of the Hierarchy know) which centresexpress the seven ray energies. It must be remembered also that the Rays ofAttribute shift and change constantly; for instance, humanity as the planetarythroat centre is under the constant influence of the seventh ray, as is thesolar plexus centre of the planet. To that sub-diaphragmatic centre I give noname. Though the human throat centre is primarily expressing the third ray,there is an interesting situation to be noted in this connection: two rayenergies control this centre at this time.[137] The throat centre of the average integrated personality is governed by thethird ray and is strongly energised by third ray energies (again seven innumber), whilst the throat centre of the spiritual aspirant, of disciples andinitiates below the third initiation is responding primarily to seventh rayinfluence, and this is peculiarly the case now as the seventh ray is inincarnation. The rays which are manifesting at any particular time affectpowerfully all the other centres as well as the one through which they arenormally expressing. This is a point oft forgotten.It is needless for me to point out that—as man progresses upon the Path ofReturn—he consistently comes under the impression of the centre of which he isan integral part: that is, first of all, the planetary throat centre, the humanfamily; then, as a soul, he comes under the impression of the Hierarchy, theplanetary heart centre, and at that point he begins to express the combinedenergies of the intelligence and of love; finally, on the Path of Initiation, hecomes under the impression of Shamballa, the planetary head centre, and becomesa participant in the divine Purpose and an Agent of the divine Plan.SEPARATENESS: THE GREAT ILLUSIONIt is therefore literally and eternally true that the same energetic Life poursthrough the planetary centres, into and through the three periodical vehicles ofthe incarnated Monad, and finally into and through the three centres in thehuman etheric body which correspond to the three major centres of the planetaryLogos. There is, therefore, nowhere to be found any basis for separation or anypossible point of separation or of essential division. Any sense of separatenessis due simply to ignorance and to the fact that certain energies are as yetunable to make adequate impression upon the human consciousness, functioning intime and space. The essential synthesis exists and the end is sure and [138]inevitable; unity is attainable because unity exists and the sense ofseparateness is simply the Great Illusion.It was in order to hasten the dispelling of this great illusion of separatenessin the minds of men, and to bring about the emergence of the basic existingunity, that the new world prayer was given to men and its use on a world-widescale inaugurated. Elsewhere (The Reapperarance of the Christ) I have told youof the origin and the impulsing of the Great Invocation. Here I am simplyplacing it before you as a fitting conclusion to this portion of my labour oflove in the presentation of truth, and as a possible starting point in yours.From the point of Light within the Mind of GodLet light stream forth into the minds of men.Let Light descend on Earth.From the point of Love within the Heart of GodLet love stream forth into the hearts of men.May Christ return to Earth.From the centre where the Will of God is knownLet purpose guide the little wills of men—The Purpose which the Masters know and serve.From the centre which we call the race of menLet the Plan of Love and Light work out.And may it seal the door where evil dwells.Let Light and Love and Power restore the Plan on Earth."},{"pageContent":"SECTION TWO — TEACHING ON THE ETHERIC VEHICLEI. THE NATURE OF THE ETHERIC BODY(See Chart Evolution of a Solar Logos)[139] Much that I may say here may be familiar to a certain extent, becausethere is a vast amount of information anent the etheric body scatteredthroughout my various books. It will have its value however if students canreceive in a few pages a general idea and the basic concepts which underlie theteaching—or should I say, the fact? If they have the time, students would findit of profit to re-read what I said; run their eyes rapidly through the booksand papers in search of the word “etheric.” They will never regret it. Lifeitself, the training to be given in the future, the conclusions of science and anew mode of civilisation will all increasingly be focussed on this uniquesubstance which is the true form to which all physical bodies in every kingdomin nature conform. Note that phraseology.The attitude of occultism is, at this time, relatively negative to the fact andthe nature of the etheric body. People are ready to admit its existence, but thedominant factors in their consciousness are the fact of the physical body(around whose comfort, security and care all life seems woven) and the fact ofthe astral or emotional nature. Not one among them, or among occult studentsgenerally, pays any attention to the etheric body, and there is a great hiatusor gap in consciousness today (only this time normally and rightly) between thepersonality and the Spiritual Triad. This gap will be bridged by the building ofthe antahkarana, and this can only be built by advanced students. There is nosuch planned bridge for the gap in [140] consciousness between the physical bodyand the etheric counterpart. The etheric body exists in subtle etheric matter,and factually there is no true gap; there is simply the ignoring by humanity ofan aspect of the physical body which is of far more importance than is the densephysical vehicle. The consciousness of men today is physical-astral, and thefactor of conditioning energies is ignored, overlooked, and—from the angle ofconsciousness—non-existent.One of the main obligations of occult students today is to testify to the factof the etheric body; modern science is already thus testifying because itsresearches have now landed it in the realm of energy. Electro-therapy, thegrowing recognition that man is electrical in nature, and the realisation thateven the atom in apparently inanimate objects is a living vibrant entitysubstantiate this occult point of view. Generally speaking, science has precededesotericism in its recognition of energy as a dominant factor in all formexpression. Theosophists and others pride themselves on being ahead of humanthinking, but such is not the case. H.P.B., an initiate of high standing,presented views ahead of science, but that does not apply to the exponents ofthe theosophical teaching. The fact of all manifested forms being forms ofenergy, and that the true human form is no exception, is the gift of science tohumanity and not the gift of occultism. The demonstration that light and matterare synonymous terms is also a scientific conclusion. Esotericists have alwaysknown this, but their aggressive and foolish presentations of the truth havegreatly handicapped the Hierarchy. Frequently the Masters have deplored thetechnique of the theosophists and other occult groups. When the new presentationof the occult teaching made its appearance through the inspired activity ofH.P.B., a number (an increasing number as the years slipped by) of theosophicalmembers presented the occult [141] teaching in such a manner that it travestiedthe true teaching and outraged the intellectual perception of the mass ofenquiring and intelligent men. The teaching on the etheric body is an instanceof this. H.P.B. was largely responsible, because of utilising the word “astral”to cover a mass of information anent the etheric as well as the astral. This wasdue to the realisation of the fact that the astral body was doomed in a fewgenerations (relatively speaking) to disappear, and for H.P.B. in particular wasalready nonexistent, owing to the advanced point in evolution reached by thisdisciple.Realising that the etheric body was an expression always of the dominant energycontrolling mankind in any particular cycle, H.P.B. used the term “astral body”as interchangeable with the etheric body. The etheric body, in the vast majorityof cases is the vehicle or the instrument of astral energy. The mass of men arestill Atlantean or astral in their natures, and this means a far largerpercentage than the average occultist is willing to admit. H.P.B. was, however,truthful and knew that at that time and for several hundred years afterwards(probably about three hundred years) the astral body would continue to governthe mass of human reactions and their consequent daily life expression. Hencethe apparent confusion in the writings between these two “bodies.”Here is a basic statement—one that is so basic that it governs and controls allthinking anent the etheric body:The etheric body is primarily composed of the dominant energy or energies towhich the man, the group, the nation, or the world reacts in any particular timecycle or world period.If you are to understand clearly, it is essential that I lay down certainpropositions anent the etheric body which [142] should govern all the student’sthinking; if they do not, he will be approaching the truth from the wrong angle;this, modern science does not do. The limitation of modern science is its lackof vision; the hope of modern science is that it does recognise truth whenproven. Truth in all circumstances is essential and in this matter science givesa desirable lead, even though it ignores and despises occultism. Occultscientists handicap themselves either because of their presentation of the truthor because of a false humility. Both are equally bad.There are six major propositions which govern all consideration of the ethericbody, and I would like to present them to students as a first step:1. There is nothing in the manifested universe—solar, planetary or the variouskingdoms in nature—which does not possess an energy form, subtle and intangibleyet substantial, which controls, governs and conditions the outer physical body.This is the etheric body.2. This energy form—underlying the solar system, the planets and all formswithin their specific rings-pass-not—is itself conditioned and governed by thedominant solar or planetary energy which ceaselessly and without break in time,creates it, changes and qualifies it. The etheric body is subject to ceaselesschange. This, being true of the Macrocosm, is equally true of man, themicrocosm, and—through the agency of humanity—will eventually and mysteriouslyprove true of all the subhuman kingdoms in nature. Of this, the animal kingdomand the vegetable kingdom are already evidences.3. The etheric body is composed of interlocking and circulating lines of forceemanating from one or [143] other, or from one or many, of the seven planes orareas of consciousness of our planetary Life.4. These lines of energy and this closely interlocking system of streams offorce are related to seven focal points or centres to be found within theetheric body. These centres are related, each of them, to certain types ofincoming energy. When the energy reaching the etheric body is not related to aparticular centre, then that centre remains quiescent and unawakened; when it isrelated and the centre is sensitive to its impact, then that centre becomesvibrant and receptive and develops as a controlling factor in the life of theman on the physical plane.5. The dense physical body, composed of atoms—each with its own individual life,light and activity—is held together by and is expressive of the energies whichcompose the etheric body. These, as will be apparent, are of two natures:a. The energies which form (through interlocked “lines of forceful energy”) theunderlying etheric body, as a whole and in relation to all physical forms. Thisform is qualified then by the general life and vitality of the plane on whichthe Dweller in the body functions, and therefore where his consciousness isnormally focussed.b. The particularised or specialised energies by which the individual (at thisparticular point in evolution, through the circumstances of his daily life andhis heredity) chooses to govern his daily activities.6. The etheric body has many centres of force, responsive to the manifoldenergies of our planetary Life, but we shall consider only the seven major [144]centres which respond to the inflowing energies of the seven rays. All lessercentres are conditioned by the seven major centres; this is a point whichstudents are apt to forget. It is here that knowledge of the egoic and of thepersonality rays is of prime usefulness.It can be seen, therefore, how exceedingly important this subject of energybecomes, because it controls and makes the man what he is at any given moment,and likewise indicates the plane on which he should function, and the methodwhereby he should govern his environment, circumstances and relationships. Ifthis is grasped by him, it will enable him to realise that he will have to shifthis whole attention from the physical or the astral planes on to the ethericlevels of awareness; his objective will then be to determine what energy shouldcontrol his daily expression (or energies, if he is an advanced disciple). Hewill realise also that as his attitude, attainment and comprehension shift toever higher levels, his etheric body will be constantly changing and respondingto the newer energies. These energies he will be will-fully bringing in; this isthe right use of the word “will-full.”It is not easy for the average seer or clairvoyant to distinguish the ethericbody from its environment or to isolate its particular type of energy orlivingness, for the reason that its automaton, the physical body—being composedof vibrant energetic atoms—is itself in constant movement, and such movementinvolves a necessary radiation as a consequence; animal magnetism is anillustration of this radiation. This emanation from the dense physical bodynormally and naturally mingles with the energies of the etheric body, and thusonly the trained seer can differentiate between the two, particularly within thephysical body itself.[145] From one point of view the etheric body can be looked at in two ways:first, as it interpenetrates, underlies and occupies the entire physicalorganism and, secondly, as it extends beyond the physical form and surrounds itlike an aura. According to the point in evolution will be the extent of the areawhich the etheric body covers beyond the outside of the physical body. It mayextend for a few or many inches. It is only in this area that the vital body canbe studied with relative ease, once the emanatory activity of the physical atomsis offset or allowed for.Within the physical body, the network of the etheric body is to be foundpermeating every single part. It is peculiarly associated at this time with thenervous system, which is fed, nourished, controlled and galvanised by itsetheric counterpart. This counterpart is present in millions of tiny streams orlines of energy, to which the Eastern occultist has given the name “nadis.”These nadis are the carriers of energy. They are in fact the energy itself andcarry the quality of energy from some area of consciousness in which the“dweller in the body” may happen to be focussed. This may be the astral plane orthe planes of the Spiritual Triad, for none of the energies can control thephysical body from any plane, no matter how high, except in this manner.According to the focus of the consciousness, the psychic state of awareness, thepotency of aspiration or desire, and the point in evolution or the spiritualstatus, so will be the type of energy carried by the nadis, passing from them tothe outer nervous system. This general proposition must be accepted, for thewhole subject is as yet too intricate, and the mechanism of observation of thestudent too undeveloped, for me to enter into greater detail. This will sufficeas an initial hypothesis upon which to work.The amount of energy and the type of energy controlling any aspect of thenervous system is conditioned by the centre [146] in its immediate area. Acentre is a distributing agency, in the last analysis. Even though that energywill affect the entire body, the centre most responsive to the quality and typewill potently affect the nadis, and therefore the nerves, in its immediateenvironment.It must always be remembered that the seven centres are not within the densephysical body. They exist only in etheric matter and in the etheric so-calledaura, outside the physical body. They are closely related to the dense physicalbody by the network of nadis. Five of the centres are to be found in the ethericcounterpart of the spinal column, and the energy passes (through large andresponsive nadis) through the vertebrae of the spine and circulates thenthroughout the etheric body as it is interiorly active within the physicalvehicle. The three head centres exist, one just above the top of the head,another just in front of the eyes and forehead, and the third at the back of thehead, just above where the spinal column ends. This makes eight centres but isin reality seven, as the centre at the back of the head is not counted in theinitiation process, any more than is the spleen.The powerful effect of the inflow of energy, via the energy body, has itselfautomatically created these centres or these reservoirs of force, these focalpoints of energy, which the spiritual man must learn to use and through themeans of which he can direct energy where needed. Each of these seven centreshas appeared in the course of human evolution in response to energy from one orother, or from several, of the seven rays. The impact of these rays upon theetheric body, emanating as they do periodically and ceaselessly from the sevenrays, is so potent that the seven areas in the etheric body become more highlysensitised than the rest of the vehicle, and these in due time develop intoresponsive distributing centres. The effect of these seven centres upon thephysical body in due time produces a condensation or a [147] state of what iscalled “attracted response” from dense matter, and thus the seven major sets ofendocrine glands slowly came into functioning activity. It must here beremembered that the whole development of the etheric body falls into twohistorical stages:1. That in which the etheric energy, flowing through responsive centres andcreating the endocrine glands as a consequence, gradually began to have adefinite effect upon the blood stream; the energy worked through that mediumsolely for a very long time. This still remains true, for the life aspect ofenergy animates the blood, through the medium of the centres and their agents,the glands. Hence the words in the Bible that “the blood is the life.”2. As the race of men developed, and consciousness grew greater and certaingreat expansions took place, the centres began to extend their usefulness and touse the nadis, and thus to work upon and through the nervous system; thisproduced conscious and planned activity upon the physical plane, commensurate tothe man’s place in evolution.Thus the incoming energy forming the etheric body created a needed ethericmechanism with its corresponding dense physical counterparts; it therefore, aswill be noted from its relationship to the blood via the glands, and to thenervous system via the nadis (both through the medium of the seven centres),became the transmitter of two aspects of energy: one of which was kama-manasic(desire-lower mind) and the other atmic-buddhic (spiritual will—spiritual love)in the case of advanced humanity. Herein lies full opportunity for all, as theLaw of Evolution proceeds to dominate all manifestation. What is true of theMacrocosm is true also of the microcosm. [148]II. THE BASIS OF NON-SEPARATENESSThe use of the creative imagination is of value here. It may not give a truepicture on all points, but it will convey one great reality. The reality towhich I refer is that there is no possible separateness in our manifestedplanetary life—or elsewhere for that matter, even beyond our planetaryring-pass-not. The concept of separateness, of individual isolation, is anillusion of the unillumined human mind. Everything—every form, every organismwithin all forms, all aspects of manifested life in every kingdom in nature—isintimately related each to each through the planetary etheric body (of which alletheric bodies are integral parts) which substands all that is. Little as it maymean, and useless as it may appear, the table at which you write, the flower youhold in your hand, the horse on which you ride, the man to whom you talk, aresharing with you the vast circulatory life of the planet as it streams into,through and out of every aspect of the form nature. The only differences whichexist are those in consciousness, and peculiarly so in the consciousness of manand of the Black Lodge. There is only the ONE LIFE, pouring through the mass offorms which, in their sum total, constitute our planet—as we know it.All forms are related, inter-related and interdependent; the planetary ethericbody holds them together so that a cohesive, coherent, expressive Whole ispresented to the eye of man, or one great unfolding consciousness to theperception of the Hierarchy. Lines of light pass from form to form. Some arebright and some are dim; some move or circulate with rapidity, others arelethargic and slow in their [149] interplay; some seem to circulate withfacility in some particular kingdom in nature and some in another; some comefrom one direction and some from a different one, but all are in movement allthe time; it is a constant circulation. All are passing on and into and through,and there is not one single atom in the body which is not the recipient of thisliving, moving energy; there is no single form that is not “kept in shape andlivingness” by this determined inflow and outflow, and there is therefore nopart of the body of manifestation (which is an integral part of the planetaryvehicle of the Lord of the World) which is not in complex but complete touchwith HIS divine intention—through the medium of HIS three major centres:Shamballa, the Hierarchy, and Humanity. In the multiplicity of the forms ofwhich His great composite vehicle is composed, there is no need for Him to be inconscious touch. It is, however, possible, should He so desire it, but it wouldprofit Him not, any more than it would profit you to be in conscious touch withsome atom in some organ of your physical body. He works, however, through Histhree major centres: Shamballa, the planetary head centre; the Hierarchy, theplanetary heart centre; and Humanity, the planetary throat centre. The play ofthe energies elsewhere (controlled from these three centres) is automatic. Theobjective of the circulating energies—as it appears to us when we seek topenetrate divine purpose—is to vivify all parts of His body, with the view ofpromoting the unfoldment of consciousness therein.This is basically true from the angle of Shamballa “where the Will of God isknown”; it is partially true of those Members of the Hierarchy Who sense thePurpose and formulate the Plan and then present it in an understandable form tothe lesser initiates and disciples and aspirants. These two groups work entirelyon the consciousness side, which motivates and directs (as needed) the moving,[150] circulating energies. This is not true of the bulk of humanity, who areconscious but only conscious within their ring-pass-not, and are thereforefundamentally separated off by their emphasis upon form as it exists in thethree worlds—the dense physical levels of the cosmic physical plane. On thelowest of these levels, the outer physical form reacts and responds to thecirculating energies through the medium of the etheric energy which comes fromthe lowest of the four levels of the etheric plane.Gradually the consciousness within these forms reacts to the nature of the outervehicle as it is impulsed from etheric levels, and a profoundly significantdevelopment takes place. This development—to make a wide generalisation—fallsinto three categories:1. The outer form changes under the impact of the etheric energies entering in,passing through and disappearing from (ceaselessly aeon after aeon) the form.The energy that is there one minute is gone the next.2. This ceaseless play of energy varies in time and space, and moveslethargically, rapidly or rhythmically according to the type or nature of theform through which it is at any moment passing.3. The energy of the etheric plane changes considerably as the aeons pass away,according to the direction or the source from which it comes. The directingenergy alters significantly as evolution proceeds.Students have been apt to speak simply of the etheric body as an entire integralentity and as constituted solely of etheric substance, forgetting that theetheric body is the medium for the transfer of many types of energy. They forgetthe following facts: [151]1. That the etheric body is itself composed of four types of substance, each ofwhich is definitely specialised and found on one or other of the etheric levels.2. That these substances, functioning actively in any particular etheric body,create a network of channels; they produce fine tubes (if I may use soinappropriate a word) which take the general form of the dense material ortangible form with which they may be associated. This form underlies every partof the physical body and can be seen extending for a certain distance outside ofthe recognisable form. This etheric body is not in reality an ovoid (as theolder occult books teach) but usually takes the form or general outline of thephysical vehicle with which it is associated. When, however, the head centre isawakened and functioning, then the ovoid appearance is far more frequent.3. These channels or tubes—according to the type of energy they carry—pass tocertain areas of the body, via three main stations:a. The seven major centres, of which you have heard much.b. The twenty-one minor centres, which I outlined for you earlier. (A Treatiseon the Seven Rays, Volume IV, pp 72-73)c. The forty-nine focal points, scattered all over the body.4. All these centres and focal points for the transmission of energy areconnected each with each by larger channels than the mass of channels whichconstitute the etheric body as a whole, because many lesser channels and linesof force or energy merge and blend as they near a centre or a focal point. [152]5. The mass of the smaller channels or the channelling tubes of energyeventually create in all forms that layer of corresponding nerves which are notyet recognised by medical science but which are like an intermediary web ornetwork. These relate the etheric body as a whole to the entire two-fold nervoussystem (cerebro-spinal and the sympathetic nervous systems) which science doesrecognise. It is this system underlying the nerves which is the true responseapparatus and which—via the brain—telegraphs information to the mind or, via thebrain and the mind, keeps the soul informed. It is this system of nadis which isused in full consciousness by the initiate who has related the Spiritual Triadand the soul-infused personality, and has therefore seen the soul-body, thecausal body or the egoic lotus totally disappear, being no longer of any trueimportance. There is a peculiar and at present inexplicable relation betweenthis system of nadis and the antahkarana when it is in process of creation or iscreated.6. The physical body, therefore, like so much else in nature, is itself triplein design. There is:a. The etheric body.b. The substantial nadis.c. The dense physical body.These form one unit and in incarnation are inseparable.7. The centres in their totality and the many focal points of contact found inthe etheric body are responsible for the creation and preservation of theendocrine glandular system in a form either limited and inadequate, orrepresentative of the spiritual man and entirely adequate. The nadis, in theirturn, [153] are responsible for the creation and precipitation of the twofoldnervous system. This is a point most carefully to be borne in mind and is theclue to the problem of creativity.8. The type of the etheric substance “substanding” any form is dependent upontwo factors:a. The kingdom of nature concerned. Basically the four kingdoms draw theirpranic life each from one or other of the four levels of etheric substance,counting upwards from the lowest:1. The mineral kingdom is sustained from plane 1.2. The vegetable kingdom is sustained from plane 2.3. The animal kingdom is sustained from plane 3.4. The human kingdom is sustained from plane 4.That was the original condition; but as evolution proceeded and there was aninter-acting emanation established between all the kingdoms, this automaticallychanged. It was this “esoteric emanating change” which, aeons ago, producedanimal-man. I give this as an illustration and a key to a great mystery.b. Curiously enough, in the human kingdom (and only in the human kingdom) theetheric body is now composed of all four types of etheric substance. The reasonfor this is that eventually (when mankind is spiritually developed) each ofthese four planes or types of etheric substance will be responsive to the [154]four higher levels of the cosmic physical plane—the etheric levels, to which wegive the names: the logoic level, the monadic, the atmic level and the buddhic.This will happen as a result of conscious growth and initiation.9. It must also be remembered that the substance of which these etheric channelsor channelling tubes are composed is planetary prana, the life-giving,health-giving energy of the planet itself. Through these tubes, however, mayflow all or any of the possible energies—emotional, mental, egoic, manasic,buddhic or atmic, according to the point in evolution which the man concernedhas reached. This always means that several energies are pouring through thesetubes, unless the point in evolution is exceedingly low or unless one is dealingwith a cleavage; these various energies are fused and blended together but findtheir own focal points in the etheric body when entering directly within thecircumference of the dense physical body. Just as it can be said of the soul orof the Deity, so it can be said of the energetic or vital etheric body orentity: “Having pervaded this whole universe with a fragment of myself, Iremain.”The word “prana” is almost as much misunderstood as are the words “etheric” or“astral.” It is this loose connotation which is responsible for the greatignorance prevalent in occult circles.Prana might be defined as the life-essence of every plane in the sevenfold areawhich we call the cosmic physical plane. It is the LIFE of the planetary Logos,reduced within limits, animating, vivifying and correlating all the seven [155]planes (in reality the seven subplanes of the cosmic physical plane) and allthat is to be found within and upon them. The cosmic sutratma or life-thread ofthe planetary Logos enters His manifestation on the highest of our planes (thelogoic plane) and, through the instrumentality of the informing Lives to befound in Shamballa (which, I must remind you, is not the name of a locality) isbrought into contact with, or is related to, the matter of which the manifestedworlds are made—formless, as on the cosmic etheric planes (our highest fourplanes), or tangible and objective, as on the lower three planes. The fact thatwe call only that tangible which we can see or touch and contact through themedium of the five senses is entirely wrong. All is regarded as belonging to theworld of form which is found on the physical plane, the astral plane and thelevels of the lower mind. This lower mental plane, referred to above, includesthe level on which the causal body is found—the plane in which “the lotus oflove is floating,” as the Old Commentary puts it. All that lies above that onmental levels, and on up to the highest of the cosmic physical planes, isformless. These distinctions must be most carefully borne in mind.There is within the human body a wonderful symbol of distinction between thehigher etheric levels and the lower so-called physical levels. The diaphragmexists, separating that part of the body which contains the heart, throat andhead, plus the lungs, from all the rest of the organs of the body; these are allof them of the utmost importance from the angle of LIFE, and that which isdetermined in the head, impulsed from the heart, sustained by the breath andexpressed through the apparatus of the throat determines what the man IS.Below the diaphragm are found organs whose use is far more objective even if ofgreat importance; though each [156] of these lower organs has a life and purposeof its own, their existence and functioning is impulsed, determined andconditioned by the life and rhythm emanating from the higher part of thevehicle. This is not easy for the average man to comprehend, but any seriouslimitation or physical disease above the diaphragm has a compelling and seriouseffect on all that is found below the diaphragm. The reverse is not the case tothe same extent.This symbolises the potency and essentiality of the etheric body, bothmicrocosmic and macrocosmic, and the macrocosmic expression of the fourfold Lifeconditions all living forms.The Function of the Four Ethers Each of the four ethers, as they are sometimescalled, is intended—as far as man is concerned—to be a channel or expression ofthe four cosmic ethers. At present this is very far from being the case. It canonly truly be so when the antahkarana is built and acts, therefore, as a directchannel for the cosmic ethers to which we have given the names of universallife, monadic intensity, divine purpose and pure reason. Ponder for a while onthese types of energy and creatively imagine their effect when, in due course oftime and spiritual unfoldment, they can pour unrestrictedly into and through theetheric body of a human being. At present, the etheric body is responsive toenergies from:1. The physical world. These are not principles but are the feeders andcontrollers of the animal appetites.2. The astral world, determining the desires, emotions and aspirations which theman will express and go after upon the physical plane.3. The lower mental plane, the lower mind, developing self-will, selfishness,separateness and the direction and trend of the life upon the physical plane. Itis [157] this directive instinct which, when turned to higher matters,eventually opens the door to the higher cosmic etheric energies.4. The soul, the principle of individualism, the reflection in the microcosm ofthe divine intention and—speaking symbolically—being to the entire monadicexpression that which “stands at the midway point,” the instrument of truesensitivity, of responsive ability, the spiritual counterpart of the solarplexus centre which is found at the midway point between that which lies abovethe diaphragm and that which is found below it.When the antahkarana is constructed and the higher three are directly related tothe lower three, then the soul is no longer needed. Then, reflecting this event,the four etheric levels become simply the transmitters of the energy emanatingfrom the four cosmic etheric levels. The channel is then direct, completed andunimpeded; the etheric network of light is then of great brilliance, and all thecentres in the body are awakened and functioning in unison and rhythm.Then—corresponding to the directly related Monad and Personality—the headcentre, the thousand-petalled lotus, the brahmarandra, is as directly related tothe centre at the base of the spine. Thus complete dualism, in place of theprevious triple nature of the divine manifestation, is established:1. Monad . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Personality.With the threefold soul no longer needed.2. Head centre . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Centre at base of spine.With the intermediate five centres no longer required.[158] The Old Commentary says, in this connection:“Then the three that ranked as all that was, functioning as one and controllingall the seven, no longer are. The seven who responded to the three, respondingto the One, no longer hear the triple call which determined all that was. Onlythe two remain to show the world the beauty of the living God, the wonder of theWill-to-Good, the Love which animates the Whole. These two are One, and thus thework, completed, stands. And then the Angels sing.” [159]III. PLANETARY AND HUMAN CENTRESThere is a factor bearing upon the etheric body to which very little referencehas ever been made, the reason being that it would have been utterly uselessinformation. Let me embody it in a tabulated statement, beginning with a fewpoints earlier imparted but which should here be repeated for clarity and placedin proper sequence:1. The planetary Logos works through the medium of the three major centres:a. The Centre where the will of God is known: Shamballa.b. The Centre where the love of God is manifest: the Hierarchy.c. The Centre where the intelligence of God is producing the evolutionaryprocess: Humanity.2. The three major centres, both planetary and human, exist in etheric substanceand they may or may not produce physical correspondences. All the Masters, forinstance, do not work through a physical vehicle. They nevertheless have anetheric body composed of the substance of the cosmic etheric levels—buddhic,atmic, monadic and logoic levels—and these levels are the four cosmic ethers,the higher correspondence of our etheric planes; these higher levels are thefour levels of the cosmic physical plane. Until They choose, at the sixthInitiation of Decision, one of the seven Paths of Ultimate Destiny, the Mastersfunction in Their cosmic etheric bodies.These three major energy centres are closely related to each other, and throughhis own individual major centres (the head, the heart and the throat) [160] thedisciple is in relation with the three planetary centres. I would have youponder on this statement for it has practical value.3. The Monad, as you know, is to be found on the cosmic second etheric level,called the monadic plane. When the antahkarana has been built, then cosmicetheric substance can be slowly substituted for the ordinary and familiaretheric substance which “substands” the dense physical body of a man.4. The ray upon which the Monad is to be found—one of the three major rays and,therefore, related to one of the three major centres—conditions:a. The disciple’s absorption into one of the three departments of hierarchicalwork, i.e., a first ray soul will go normally into such an Ashram as that of theMaster M. in the department of the Manu; a second ray disciple will pass into asecond ray Ashram such as mine (D.K.) or that of the Master K.H. and thereforeinto the department of the Christ; a third ray soul will be absorbed into one ofthe Ashrams (and there are many) functioning under the Lord of Civilisation, theMaster R.b. All who come into incarnation upon one of the Rays of Attribute —the fourth,fifth, sixth and seventh rays—find their way finally on to one of the threemajor Rays of Aspect . The changes of shifts in ray focus are made when theetheric body has in it an adequate measure of the substance of the lowest of thecosmic ethers, the buddhic substance; this is basic for all, on all the rays,for at the end of the age, when cosmic etheric substance [161] composes theetheric vehicles of the initiate, the three rays become the two rays, and lateranother absorption takes place into the second Ray of Love-Wisdom which is theray of our present solar system.You can see, therefore, what conditioning factors the various energies becomewhen appropriated and used, and how their substance, or rather the presence ofcertain energies in the etheric body of the personality, are essential beforecertain initiations can be taken. The theme is too complex to be enlarged uponhere, but I would ask you to consider with care the various statements I havemade and then seek illumination within yourself.The rays are the seven emanations from the “seven Spirits before the throne ofGod”; Their emanations come from the monadic level of awareness or from thesecond cosmic etheric plane. In a certain sense it could be said that theseseven great and living Energies are in their totality the etheric vehicle of theplanetary Logos. The evolutionary processes can equally well be stated to bethose of eliminating the physical substance lying between the dense physicalbody and the astral sentient body, and substituting substance of the fourhighest planes, the four cosmic ethers. Physically speaking, it is this ethericsubstitution which enables a man successively to take the five initiations whichmake him a Master of the Wisdom.The first initiation is purely the concern of the man’s own soul, and the momentthat that initiation has been taken, a measure of buddhic energy can enter andthe process of transference of the higher ethers and their substitution for thelower can go forward. This, as you may well imagine, produces conflict; thepersonality etheric body rejects the incoming higher ether, and thus crises areproduced in the initiate’s life.[162] Progress and initiation have been presented to us mainly in terms ofcharacter-building and of service to humanity. This approach most surely alsoproduces conflict and the personality fights the soul. But paralleling this wellknown conflict, another battle goes on between the ethers composing thedisciple’s etheric body and the downpouring higher ethers. Of this a man is notso conscious, but the battle is a very real one, affecting primarily the healthof the physical body , and falls into five natural stages which we callinitiations. The symbolism of the Rod of Initiation teaches us that (during theinitiatory process) this Rod, directed by the Christ or by the Lord of theWorld, as the case may be, is used to stabilise the higher ethers within thepersonality by an access of applied energy which enables the initiate to retainthat which is from above, in order that “as above, so below.”There are three angles from which the etheric body must be considered:1. As the mechanism which externalises itself through the nadis, or that finesystem of related lines of force which, in their turn, externalise themselvesthrough the physical system of nerves.2. As a transmitter of many different types of energy, coming from manydifferent sources; these energies run through or along (both words are equallytrue) the lines of force which underlie the nadis. A while ago I used the word“tubes,” thus inferring a network of tubes through which the transmittedenergies can pour; here you have a case where words are wholly inadequate andeven misleading.3. These energies—according to their source, quality and purpose—create theseven major centres which condition the many smaller subsidiary centres [163]and finally externalise themselves through the seven major glands of theendocrine system.I have said earlier that the intersecting energies in the etheric body of theplanet are at this time a network of squares . When the creative process iscomplete and evolution has done its work, these squares will become a network oftriangles. Necessarily this is a symbolic way of speaking. In the Book ofRevelations which was dictated 1900 years ago by the disciple who is now knownas the Master Hilarion, reference is made to the “city which standsfour-square.” The etheric vehicle of the planet was inherited from a formersolar system, with the purpose or intention in view of its transformation into anetwork of triangles in this solar system. In the next one of the triplicity ofsolar systems (the third or last) in which the will of God works out, theetheric body will begin as a network of triangles, but this will be resolvedinto a network of interlinked circles or of linked rings, indicating thefulfilment of interlocking relationships. In this present system, the result ofevolution, as far as the etheric body is concerned, will be the contactestablished between all three points of each triangle, making a ninefold contactand a ninefold flow of energy; this is consistent with the fact that nine is thenumber of initiation, and by the time the destined number of disciples havetaken the nine possible initiations, this triangular formation of the planetaryetheric body will be complete.The idea can be conveyed symbolically by the diagram below, which pictures thetriangular formation and the mode of a dual growth or progression and expansionof the network because, starting with the initial triangle, two points only areleft for the processes of extension.[Image00006.jpg][164] The initial triangle was formed by Sanat Kumara, and we call the threeenergies which circulate through its medium the three major Rays of Aspect. Thefour Rays of Attribute formed their own triangles and yet, in a paradoxicalmanner, they are responsible for the “squares” through which their energies atthis time pass. Thus the work of transforming the inherited etheric body wasbegun and has proceeded ever since. In the etheric body of the human being youhave a repetition of the same process in the triangle of energies created by therelationship between the Monad, the Soul, and the Personality.THE CHANGING PATTERN OF THE PLANETARY ETHERIC BODYIt is well-nigh impossible for man to draw or make a picture of the network oftriangles and, at the same time, see them taking the circular form in theirtotality of the etheric body of the planetary sphere. The reason is that thewhole etheric body is in constant motion and ceaseless transformation, and theenergies of which it is composed are in a state of constant change andcirculation.It is wise to have in mind that it is the mechanism which changes and that thistransformation of the square into the triangle has no reference whatsoever tothe transmitted energies or to the various centres, except in so far that itbecomes far easier for the energies to flow through the triangular formation ofthe etheric body than it is to flow—as is now the case—through or around asquare and a network of squares.I am quite aware that what I am here communicating may seem to you the veriestnonsense and there is, of course, no possible way in which I can prove to youthe factual nature of this inter-communicating system or in which you can checkand confirm what I say; but then, my brothers, you have no way as yet ofascertaining the factual existence of Sanat Kumara and yet from the very nightof time His existence has been proclaimed by the Hierarchy and accepted [165] bymillions. Every human being believes a great deal more than he can prove or thevalidity of which he can establish.The centres are in reality those “crossing points” of energies where the ethericbody possesses seven triangles or transformed points. From the angle ofShamballa the centres in a human being resemble a triangle with a point at thecentre.From the angle of the Hierarchy, conditions are somewhat different. You have theseven centres portrayed as lotuses, with varying numbers of petals; neverthelessthere is always preserved and recognisably present a triangle, at the very heartof the lotus; always there is the triangle with its communicating point, and tothis we give the name, the “jewel in the lotus.” You have therefore thefollowing symbolic presentation of the lotus, and you would do well to study itwith care.The personality of the man is conditioned by the circle, which is the emanatinginfluence of the lotus, and an interplay is thereby set up. The lotus itself isconditioned by the soul and in its turn conditions the “sphere of influence inthe aura of the lotus” thus reaching into and conditioning the personality life.The triangle is conditioned by the Spiritual Triad, when the antahkarana isbuilt or in process of building, and in its turn first of all inspires or firesthe soul, and then finally destroys it. The dot at the centre is indicative ofmonadic life, first of all in its lowest expression of physical life andvitality, and finally as the “point of sensitivity.” Therefore we have:[Image00007.jpg]1. The Point at the centre, indicative of the monadic life. [166]2. The related energies of the egoic lotus, conditioned by the soul.3. The sphere of radiation, the emanating influence of the lotus, conditioningthe personality.4. The triangle of energy, conditioned by the Spiritual Triad.The foregoing instruction on the etheric body is not long but it contains muchthat is relatively new and provides much food for assimilation. [167]IV. THE CENTRES AND THE PERSONALITYWe will now consider the centres as controlling factors in the life of thepersonality in the three worlds, and their relation to each other, alwaysstudying the subject from the angle of their relation to one of the three majorplanetary centres—Shamballa, the Hierarchy and Humanity—in connection with:1. The Point at the Centre.2. Related Energies.3. Sphere of Radiation.4. The Triangle of Energy.The abstruseness of this theme is very great; a basic statement will, however,serve somewhat to clarify the subject; it is a statement which has seldom foundexpression elsewhere. Let me phrase it as simply as possible:The centres below the diaphragm, i.e., the solar plexus centre, the sacralcentre and the centre at the base of the spine, are controlled by the fourethers of the planetary physical plane; the centres above the diaphragm, i.e.,the heart centre, the throat centre, the ajna centre and the head centre, arecontrolled by the four cosmic ethers, to which we give the names of the energiesof the buddhic plane, the energies of the atmic plane, the energies of themonadic plane and the energies of the logoic plane.This statement involves a somewhat new concept; it creates a basic relation,making possible the fact that “as above so below.” Think this out. It hasserious implications.[168] The centres below the diaphragm are—during the evolutionaryprocess—controlled by the first, the second and the third ethers, counting frombelow upward; when evolution has brought the aspirant to the point of personalintegration, then the energies of the highest, the etheric-atomic plane can anddo control. When that takes place, then the possibility is present of theenergies of the cosmic etheric planes bringing the centres above the diaphragminto full expression. This takes place upon the Path of Discipleship and thePath of Initiation. This interesting process of transference of energies iscalled by several names, such as “radiatory substitution,” “energisingat-one-ment,” and “inspirational reflected light of energy.” All these terms areefforts to express in somewhat inadequate words what happens when the higherenergies are substituted for the lower, when the magnetic “pull” of thespiritual energies draws upward and absorbs the lower energies which areconcerned primarily with the personality life, or when the reflecting light ofthe Spiritual Triad and of the Monadic Glory are transferred into the higherenergy centres in the final vehicle used by the developed human being.Little has as yet been given out anent the relation of the four physical ethersand the four cosmic ethers; there is nevertheless a direct relation betweenthem, and this the initiatory process reveals. This also brings aboutsignificant changes in the vehicles of humanity. There is also a direct relationbetween the four aspects of karma (the Law of Cause and Effect) and the fourphysical ethers, as well as the four cosmic ethers; this relationship will laterconstitute the basis of a new occult science. Therefore, there is yet much to begrasped by students concerning energy, its emanating sources, its mode oftransfer or its transitional processes, and its anchorage within the planetarybody, or the physical body of the individual. With some of these [169] ideas wewill now deal, thus laying the foundation for future investigation, but sayinglittle which will be of immediate use to the individual student.RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE HIGHER AND THE LOWER CENTRESIt is relatively easy to list the four cosmic ethers and then list the fourethers of the physical plane as we know them, and then make the statement thatthe average person is controlled by the centres below the diaphragm, which areresponsive to the physical plane ethers as they transmit energies from the threeworlds of human evolution, and that the initiate is responsive to the cosmicethers, as they play through and awaken the centres above the diaphragm. It mustat the same time be remembered that the seven centres in the etheric vehicle ofman are always composed of the physical ethers, but become—upon the Path ofDiscipleship—the vehicles of the cosmic ethers. To retain the picture withclarity, it might be well to consider very briefly the four aspects of thecentres as I have listed them above, or that totality which they present to theeye of the See-er. These are:1. The Point at the Centre. This is the “jewel in the lotus,” to use the ancientoriental appellation; it is the point of life by means of which the Monadanchors itself upon the physical plane, and is the life principle therefore ofall the transient vehicles—developed, undeveloped or developing. This point oflife contains within itself all possibilities, all potentialities, allexperiences and all vibratory activities. It embodies the will-to-be, thequality of magnetic attraction (commonly called love), and the activeintelligence which will bring the livingness and the love into full expression.The above statement or definition is one of major importance. This point at thecentre is in reality, therefore, all that IS and the other three aspects oflife—as listed—are merely indications of its existence. It is that which hascapacity to withdraw to its Source, or to impose upon itself [170] layer uponlayer of substance; it is the cause of the return of the so-called EternalPilgrim to the Father’s Home after many aeons of experience, as well as thatwhich produces experiment, leading to eventual experience and final expression.It is also that which the other three aspects shield, and which the sevenprinciples (expressing themselves as vehicles) protect. There are seven of these“points” or “jewels,” expressing the sevenfold nature of consciousness, and asthey are brought one by one into living expression, the seven subrays of thedominating monadic ray are also one by one made manifest, so that eachinitiate-disciple is (in due time) a Son of God in full and outer glory.The time comes when the individual etheric body is submerged or lost to sight inthe light emanating from these seven points and coloured by the light of the“jewel in the lotus” in the head, the thousand petalled lotus. Each centre isthen related by a line of living fire and each is then in full divineexpression.Much emphasis has been placed by teachers in the past upon the “killing out” ofthe centres below the diaphragm, or upon the transference of the energies ofthese centres into their higher correspondences. This I also have pointed out inother writings and instructions, because it is a definite way in which to conveyessential truth. These methods of expression are, however, only symbolicphrases, and to that extent are true; nevertheless, at the close of theevolutionary process every single centre in the etheric body is a living,vibrant and beautiful expression of the basic energy which has ever sought touse it. They are, however, energies which are dedicated to divine and not tomaterial living, and are clear, pure and radiant; their central point of lightis of such a brilliance that the ordinary eye of man can scarcely register it.At this point it must be remembered that though there are seven of these points,one at the centre of each lotus, [171] there are only three types of such“jewels in the lotus” because the Monad expresses only the three major aspectsof divinity, or the three major rays.2. The Related Energies. This expression has reference to what have been calledthe “petals” of the lotus: with these differentiations of the various energies Iseek not here to deal; too much emphasis has ever been laid upon them both byoriental and occidental writers; there is far too much curiosity about thenumber of petals in any particular centre, about their arrangement and abouttheir colouring and quality. If these matters interest you, you can search inthe standard books for this information, remembering as you garner the profferedinformation that you are not in a position to prove its accuracy; itsusefulness, therefore, to you is highly problematical. I write this for realstudents and for those who seek to live the life of the spirit; the informationwhich theorists seek is amply provided for both by me and many other exponentsof the technicalities of the Ageless Wisdom.All I would remark is that as the point in the centre is the point of life andthe permanent, persistent Eternal ONE, so the related energies or petals areindicative of the state of consciousness which that Eternal One is able—at anystated point in time and space—to express. This may be the relativelyundeveloped state of consciousness of the savage, the consciousness of theaverage man or the highly developed consciousness of the initiate up to thethird degree, or the still more vibrant awareness of the initiate of stillhigher grades. It is ever concerned with CONSCIOUSNESS; only the point at thecentre is concerned with the first or life aspect; the petals concern the secondor the consciousness aspect, and this must be most carefully borne in mind.[172] The state of the consciousness is ever indicated by the size, the colourand the activity of the energies which compose the petals of the lotus; theirunfoldment and their development is conditioned by the governing rays, as wellas by the age and the length of the soul’s expression. The extent and the natureof the relative “brightness” is also conditioned by the point of focus in anyparticular life, as well as by the trend of the thinking of the soul which is inincarnation; it must be remembered here that “energy follows thought.” Thenatural focus or point of polarisation is at times most definitely offset by aman’s line of thought (whatever that may currently be) or by the fact that he isliving, consciously or unconsciously, the life of every day. An instance of thiscan be found in the fact that a disciple’s natural focus might be the solarplexus centre, but because of his fixed and determined thought, the energy whichhe wields can be directed to one of the centres above the diaphragm, thusproducing a temporary atrophying of the centre below the diaphragm and theconsequent stimulation of that which lies above that dividing line. Thus are theneeded changes made.When the cycle of evolution is nearing its close and the initiate-disciple haswell-nigh run his course, the energies are all fully developed, active andvibrant, and are therefore consciously used as essential aspects of theinitiate’s contact mechanism . This is often forgotten and the emphasis of thestudent’s thinking is laid upon the centres as expressions of his naturalunfoldment, whereas that is of relatively secondary importance. The centres are,in reality, focal points through which energy can be distributed, under skilleddirection, in order to make a needed impact upon those centres or individualswhich the disciple seeks to aid. These impacts can be stimulated or vitalised atneed, or they can be deliberately [173] destructive, thus aiding in theliberation from substance or matter of the one to be aided.It is high time that students paid attention to the service angle of thecentres, and to the focussing and the use of energy in service. It is here thatthe knowledge of the number of the petals which form a centre is involved,because this knowledge indicates the number of the energies which are availablefor service, i.e., two energies, twelve energies, sixteen energies, and soforth. No attention has hitherto been paid to this important point, but itembodies the practical use of the new occultism in the coming New Age. Theoriental symbols which are often superimposed upon the illustrations of thecentres should now be discontinued, because they convey no real use to theoccidental mind.3. The Sphere of Radiation. This obviously concerns the radius of influence orthe outgoing vibratory effect of the centres, as they are gradually and slowlybrought into activity. These centres, or their vibrations, are in reality whatcreates or constitutes the so-called aura of the human being, even though thataura is frequently confused with the health aura. Instead of the word“frequently” I had almost said “usually,” because that would be more definitelycorrect. It is the etheric body which indicates and conditions the aura, whichis presumed to demonstrate what the personality is, emotionally and mentally,and (occasionally) what is indicated of soul control. This is not a falsepremise, and I would have you register this fact. It is, however, excessivelylimited in its import, because the aura is in reality indicative of thesubject’s centres. From the study of this aura certain things can beascertained:a. Whether the development is above or below the diaphragm.b. Whether the centres are undeveloped or developed. [174]c. Whether the nature of the controlling rays is adequately clear.d. Whether the point at the centre and the petals of the lotus are controlled,or whether a balance is being achieved.e. Whether the personality is outgoing, and is therefore in a state oflivingness, or whether a withdrawing is taking place due to introspection andself-centredness, or to the slow oncoming of the death process.f. Whether the personality or the soul is in control, and whether, therefore, astruggle between the two is going on.You can see, therefore, how revealing the aura can be to the individual who hasthe ability to read it with accuracy, and how thankful you should be that such acapacity is relatively rare, or is in the possession of an Initiate or of aMaster Whose nature is LOVE.The “sphere of radiation” is a potent instrument in service, and its extent andpurity of contact should he cultivated by the pledged disciple. There is trueoccult teaching in the statement in The New Testament that “the shadow of Peterpassing by healed. ” His aura was of such a nature that it had a beneficenteffect wherever and whenever it touched or contacted those in his environment.The control of the Christ over His aura was such that “He knew when virtue hadgone out of Him”—He knew, therefore, that healing energies had poured throughone of His centres to a needy person or group of persons. It is the aura, andits potency of attraction, and its stability, which also holds a group together,which also keeps an audience listening, and which makes an individual ofimportance along some definite [175] line of approach to his fellowmen. The“sphere of radiation” is easily determined by those who seek it out and whowatch the effect of the radiation upon people in their community andenvironment. One highly emotional person, working through an overdeveloped anduncontrolled solar plexus centre, can wreck a home or an institution. I givethis as an illustration. One radiant, creative life, consciously using the heartor the throat centres, can carry inspiration to hundreds. These are points wellworth careful consideration. You must, however, bear in mind that these centresare brought into activity by the cultivation of certain major virtues, and notby meditation or concentration upon the centres. They are brought automaticallyinto the needed radiatory condition by right living, high thinking and lovingactivity. These virtues may seem to you dull and uninteresting, but they aremost potent and scientifically effective in bringing the centres into thedesired radiatory activity. When the task is done, and when all the centres areliving spheres of outgoing, radiatory activity, they swing into each others’orbit so that the initiate becomes a centre of living light and not a compositeof seven radiant centres. Think on this.4. The Central Triangle of Energies. This central triangle indicatesunmistakably the three rays which condition a man’s “periodical vehicles,” asH.P.B. expresses it. These are: the monadic ray, the soul ray and thepersonality ray. To the watching and attentive Master it is also apparent whichray is the controlling ray, but this is not possible to anyone below the gradeof Master. Disciples and other onlookers must form their conclusions from the“nature of the sphere of radiation.” An element of error can creep in at thispoint, which is not possible to a Master; it must, however, be remembered thatuntil the sixth Initiation of Decision, “the Monad guards two secrets, but losesthree [176] when it takes control and the soul fades out.” This, I may notfurther elucidate.I have here given a somewhat new slant or picture of the centres. It is one ofgreat value to students could they but realise it, because it is not truly inline with the information given to them in the occult books. An understanding ofwhat I have said will lead the earnest student to a more practical applicationof his attitude to the centres, and also to a fixed endeavour to make his sphereof radiatory activity more useful to his fellowmen. The reason for this will bethat his attitude will express the quality of the subjective spirit and not thequality—hitherto rampant—of objective matter. Forget not that the etheric bodyis a material and substantial body, and is therefore an integral part of thephysical plane; forget not that it is intended, first of all, to carry theenergies of the emotional and of the mental plane in the unconsciousexperimental stage of incarnation; that it is also intended to carry thethreefold energies of the soul in the stage of consciously gaining experience;and that also, as the antahkarana is built, it is intended to carry the energiesof the Monad in the stage of consciously expressed divinity. See you, therefore,the beauty of the spiritual process, and the planned aid given to the sons ofmen at all stages of their return to the centre from whence they came? [177]V. THE NATURE OF SPACECertain wide generalisations anent the etheric body should be recalled at thispoint. The existence of an etheric body in relation to all tangible and exotericforms is accepted today by many scientific schools; nevertheless the originalteaching has been amended in order to bring it into line with the usual theoriesof energy and its forms of expression. Recognition is given today, by thinkers,to the factual nature of energy (and I am using that word “factual” mostadvisedly); energy is now regarded as all that IS; manifestation is themanifestation of a sea of energies, some of which are built into forms, othersconstitute the medium in which those forms live and move and have their being,and still others are in process of animating both the forms and their environingsubstantial media. It must also be remembered that forms exist within forms;this is the basis of the symbolism which is to be found in the intricate carvedivory balls of the Chinese craftsmen where ball within ball is to be discovered,all elaborately carved and all free and yet confined. You—as you sit in yourroom—are a form within a form; that room is itself a form within a house, andthat house (another form) is probably one of many similar houses, placed the oneon top of another or else side by side, and together composing a still largerform. Yet all these diverse forms are composed of tangible substance which—whencoordinated and brought together by some recognised design or idea in the mindof some thinker—creates a material form. This tangible substance is composed ofliving energies, vibrating in relation to each other, yet owning their ownquality and their own [178] qualified life. I dealt with much of this in ATreatise on Cosmic Fire and you would find it profitable to reread what I theresaid. I will not repeat it here as I am seeking a different approach.It might be profitable to point out that the entire universe is etheric andvital in nature and of an extension beyond the grasp of the greatest mind of theage, mounting into more than astronomical figures—if that statement even conveyssense to your minds. This extent cannot be computed, even in terms of lightyears; this cosmic etheric area is the field of untold energies and the basis ofall astrological computations; it is the playground of all historicalcycles—cosmic, systemic and planetary—and is related to the constellations, tothe worlds of suns, to the most distant stars and to the numerous recogniseduniverses, as well as to our own solar system, to the many planets, and to thatplanet upon which and in which we move and live and have our being, as well asto the smallest form of life known to science and perhaps covered by themeaningless term “an atom.” All are found existing in Space—Space is etheric innature and—so we are told in the occult science—Space is an Entity. The glory ofman lies in the fact that he is aware of space and can imagine this space as thefield of divine living activity, full of active intelligent forms, each placedin the etheric body of this unknown Entity, each related to each other throughthe potency which not only holds them in being but which preserves theirposition in relation to each other; yet each of these differentiated formspossesses its own differentiated life, its own unique quality or integralcolouring, and its own specific and peculiar form of consciousness.This etheric body—vast and unknown as it is, as to its extent—is neverthelesslimited in nature and static (relatively speaking) in capacity; it preserves aset form, a form [179] of which we know absolutely nothing, but which is theetheric form of the Unknown Entity. To this form the esoteric science gives thename of SPACE; it is the fixed area in which every form, from a universe to anatom, finds its location.We speak at times of an expanding universe; what we really mean is an expandingconsciousness, for this etheric body of the Entity, Space, is the recipient ofmany types of informing and penetrating energies, and it is also the field forthe intelligent activity of the indwelling Lives of the Universe, of the manyconstellations, of the distant stars, of our solar system, of the planets withinthe system, and of all that constitutes the sum total of these separated livingforms. The factor which relates them is consciousness and nothing else, and thefield of conscious awareness is created through the interplay of all livingintelligent forms within the area of the etheric body of that great Life whichwe call SPACE.Every form within the etheric body is like a centre in a planet or in the humanbody, and the resemblance—based upon what I gave you herein in relation to thehuman centres—is correct and recognisable.Each form (because it constitutes an aggregated area of substantial lives oratoms) is a centre within the etheric body of the form of which it is aconstituent part. It has, as the basis of its existence, a living dynamic pointwhich integrates the form and preserves it in essential being. This form orcentre—large or small, a man or an atom of substance—is related to all otherforms and expressing energies in the environing space, and is automaticallyreceptive to some, and repudiates others through the process of non-recognition;it relays or transmits other energies, radiating from other forms, and it thusbecomes in its turn an impressing agent. You see, therefore, wheredifferentiated truths approach each other and blend, forcing us to use the [180]same terminologies in order to express the same factual truths or ideas.Again, each point of life within a centre has its own sphere of radiation or itsown extending field of influence; this field is necessarily dependent upon thetype and the nature of the indwelling Consciousness. It is this magneticinterplay between the many vast centres of energy in space which is the basis ofall astronomical relationships—between universes, solar systems and planets.Bear in mind, however, that it is the CONSCIOUSNESS aspect which renders theform magnetic, receptive, repudiating and transmitting; this consciousnessdiffers according to the nature of the entity which informs or works through acentre, great or small. Bear in mind also that the life which pours through allcentres and which animates the whole of space is the life of an Entity ; it is,therefore, the same life in all forms, limited in time and space by theintention, the wish, the form and the quality of the indwelling consciousness:the types of consciousness are many and diverse, yet life remains ever the sameand indivisible, for it is the ONE LIFE.The sphere of radiation is conditioned always by the point of evolution of thelife within the form; the correlating, integrating factor, relating centre tocentre, is life itself; life establishes contact; livingness is the basis ofevery relation, even if this is not immediately apparent to you; consciousnessqualifies the contact and colours the radiation. Thus again we are returned tothe same fundamental triplicity to which I gave the names of Life, Quality,Appearance in an earlier book (A Treatise on the Seven Rays Volume I). A form istherefore a centre of life within some aspect of the etheric body of the Entity,Space, where a living animated existence, such as that of a planet, isconcerned. The same is true also of all lesser forms, such as those found uponand within a plane.[181] This centre has within it a point of life and is related to allsurrounding energies; it has its own sphere of radiation or of influence whichis dependent upon the nature or strength of its consciousness and upon thedynamic conditioning factor of the ensouling entity’s thought life . These arepoints worthy of your most careful consideration. Finally, every centre has itscentral triangle of energies; one of these energies expresses the ensouling lifeof the form; another expresses the quality of its consciousness, whilst thethird—the dynamic, integrating life which holds form and consciousness togetherin one expressive livingness—conditions the radiation of the form, itsresponsiveness or non-responsiveness to the environing energies and the generalnature of the informing life, plus its creative ability.Much that I have given you here will serve to elucidate that which I havewritten upon esoteric astrology (A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Volume III. TheDestiny of the Nations) ; it will give you the key to that science ofrelationships which is essentially the key to astrology and also to the scienceof Laya Yoga. This latter science has (fortunately for the Aryan race) falleninto disrepute since later Atlantean days; it will, however, be restored andused upon a higher turn of the spiral, during the next five hundred years. Whencorrectly and rightly restored, its emphasis will not be upon the nature of thecentre involved, but upon the quality of the consciousness which distinguishesany particular centre and which will then necessarily condition its sphere ofradiation. Under the great Law of Correspondences, all that I have here given orindicated can be applied by the student to all forms of life: to a universe, toa solar system, to a planet, to a human being, to any subhuman form and to thetiniest atom of substance (whatever you may mean by that last term!). [182]VI. THE PLANETARY LIFE — A CENTRE IN THE SOLAR SYSTEMWe shall now endeavour to apply whatever knowledge is available to you at thistime in relation to the planetary Life, expressing itself as a centre in thesolar system. We shall also study its secondary expression through the medium ofthree major centres: Shamballa, the Hierarchy, and Humanity.The fundamental concept of hylozoism underlies all the esoteric teaching uponthe theme of manifesting life. All forms are composed of many forms, and allforms—aggregated or single in nature—are the expression of an indwelling orensouling life. The fusion of life with living substance produces another aspectof expression: that of consciousness. This consciousness varies according to thenatural receptivity of the form, according to its point in evolution, and to itsposition also in the great chain of Hierarchy.However, dwarfing every other concept, is the concept of life itself. Thereis—as far as we have ever been permitted to know—only one Life, expressingitself as Being, as responsive consciousness, and as material appearance. ThatOne Life knows itself (if such a term can be used) as the will-to-be, thewill-to-good, and the will-to-know. It will be obvious to you that these areonly terms or methods organised to convey a better picture than heretofore.This is also a brief preamble to another statement, which can be worded asfollows: The planetary Logos, the One in Whom we live and move and have ourbeing, is the informing, ensouling life of this planet, the Earth; it is Hislife which integrates the planet as a whole, and His life which pours throughall forms—great or small—which, [183] in their aggregate, constitute theplanetary form. Preserve, therefore, in your conscious imagination and by meansof the innate symbol-making faculty which all men possess, the concept of ourplanet as a great lotus composed of many interweaving energies, located withinthe greater form of the solar system which is, as we know, esotericallyportrayed as a twelve-petalled lotus. This lotus, the Earth, is responsive tothe many entering energies with which I dealt at some length in my book uponEsoteric Astrology. (A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol III)At the heart of this vast sea of energies is to be found that cosmicConsciousness to Whom we give the name of Sanat Kumara, the Lord of the World,the Ancient of Days. It is His Will-to-Be which brought His manifested form intothe tangible arena of life ; it is His Will-to-Good which activates the Law ofEvolution and carries His Form, with the myriad lesser forms of which it iscomposed, on to the ultimate glory which He alone visions and knows. It is Hisconsciousness and His sensitive response to all forms and to all states of beingand to all possible impacts and contacts which guarantees the developingconsciousness of all the many lives within or upon this Earth of ours.This great Centre of Existence works through a triangle of energies or throughlesser centres, each of which is brought into active expression by one of thethree major Rays or Energies. The Centre which is created by the Ray of Will orPower is called Shamballa and its major activity is bequeathing, distributingand circulating the basic principle of life itself to every form which is heldwithin the planetary ring-pass-not of the planetary Life or Logos. This energyis the dynamic incentive at the heart of every form and the sustained expressionof the intention of Sanat Kumara—an intention working out as the planetaryPurpose which is known only to Him.[184] The second Centre is created by the Ray of Love-Wisdom; this is the basicenergy which brought into being the entire manifested universe, for it is theenergy of the Builder Aspect. To it we give—as far as humanity is concerned—thename of Hierarchy, for it is the controlling factor of the great chain ofHierarchy. The prime activity of this Centre is related to the unfoldingconsciousness of the planet, and therefore of all forms of life within or uponthe planet; it is not related to the life aspect in any sense.The task of the “units of Energy” who constitute the personnel of this Centre isto awaken and arouse the sense of awareness and of consciousness which issensitive in its response to the life within all forms. Just as the basic modeof activity in and through Shamballa could be called the Science of Life or ofdynamic livingness, so the basic science by means of which the Hierarchy workscould be called the Science of Relationships. Consciousness is not only thesense of identity or of self-awareness, but it concerns also the sense ofrelation of that recognised self or the “I” to all other selves. Thisconsciousness is progressively developed, and the Members of this second Centre,the Hierarchy, have the major and important task, in this particular solarsystemic cycle, of bringing all the units in each kingdom of nature to anunderstanding of place, position, responsibility and relationships. Thisprobably sounds entirely meaningless in relation to those conditions where theunits of life are, for instance, in the vegetable or the animal kingdom, but aglimmering of understanding may come when you remember that the seed or germ ofall states of consciousness is latent in every form, and of this the instinct toperpetuate and the instinct to mate are the major incubating areas.The third Centre is that of the Human Kingdom, which is brought into being bymeans of the energy of the third [185] Ray of Active Intelligence. Its majorfunction is intelligent creation; but it has nevertheless a secondary activitywhich is to relate the second and the third Centres to each other and to assumeprogressive control of the subhuman kingdoms and relate them to each other. Thissecondary function is only now assuming proportions which can be recognised andnoted.THE CENTRAL TRIANGLE OF ENERGIESEach of these three Centres has a governing and controlling Triangle or centralTriangle of Energies. In relation to Shamballa, this Triangle is composed of thethree Buddhas of Activity Who represent conscious intelligent life , conscious,intelligent and active wisdom , and conscious, intelligent and active creation .In connection with the Hierarchy, the central Triangle is composed of the Manu,representing loving intelligent life , the Christ, representing lovingintelligent consciousness, and the Mahachohan, representing loving intelligentactivity , and therefore between Them representing every phase of grouplivingness, group expression and group action; these qualities focus through theMahachohan, primarily because He is the Lord of Civilisation and thecivilisations of humanity represent progressive growth and unfoldment.Only in the final root-race of men upon our planet will the essential centralTriangle make its appearance and function openly in the third planetary Centre,that of Humanity. Men are not yet ready for this, but the areas of consciouscreative activity, out of which this triangle of functioning embodied energieswill emerge, is already in preparation. One point of this future triangle willemerge out of the field of world governments, of politics and of statesmanship;another will appear out of the world religions, and a third out of the generalfield of world economics and finance. Today no such men of spiritual will, ofspiritual love and of [186] spiritual intelligence are to be found upon Earth;even if they did emerge in these three fields of expression they could do littlegood, for the sense of recognition and of responsibility is as yet inadequatelydeveloped; later, they will appear and will then openly relate the department ofthe Manu to that of world government, the department of the Christ to that ofthe world religions, and the department of the Lord of Civilisation to that ofthe social and financial order. That time will surely come, but it will comeonly after the externalisation of the Hierarchy and its open functioning uponthe physical plane. Then, some senior disciples from each of the threehierarchical departments will appear and will attempt the experiment of thiscentralising and embodiment of the three qualities of the central Triangle. Theywill then discover, by direct action, when and if mankind is ready for such anexperiment of direct control and if it has developed the needed sense ofresponsibility—a responsibility which will produce cooperation.All these three Centres can therefore be depicted in the following manner: withthe completed circle of the entire energy form, with the central triangle ofenergies carrying the qualities of the three major rays, and then the point atthe centre which stands for the dynamic embodied Life.[Image00008.jpg]In connection with Shamballa, that point is Sanat Kumara Himself; when the righttime comes (though the hour is not yet) He will place His Representatives as thecentral points in both the Hierarchy and in Humanity. For this relativelydistant event the doctrine or the theory of Avatars, of Mediators or ofInter-Mediaries is preparing the way, thus enabling men to think in theserepresentative and inclusive terms. Not even in the Hierarchy is the time yet[187] ripe for the “residence in state of the divine Representative.” Each year,the Buddha comes and carries the force of Sanat Kumara to the Hierarchy but —Hecannot stay. The “units of energy,” the Members of the Hierarchy, cannot bearfor long the strong quality of the incoming vibration, except after duepreparation and in group form, and then only for a few scant minutes;nevertheless the “period of dynamic potency” is being prolonged during thiscentury from one day to five; the next century may see an even longer period ofregistration instituted.At the close of the age, the three major Centres will be in complete, unifiedand synchronised activity, with Sanat Kumara in Shamballa overshadowing andinforming His Representatives in the hierarchical and human Centres; then thecentral Triangle in each Centre will not be only actively functioning, but theywill be working together in the closest rapport, thus forming symbolically a“Star with nine points, ever revolving”; then the massed energies of the threemajor Centres will dominate the other four centres, controlling themanifestation of the Life Expression in all the kingdoms of nature.When one comes to the consideration of the sphere of radiation of these threemajor Centres, it is interesting to note that, at this time and in this presentworld cycle, the most potent radiation and the widest range of influence is thatof the Hierarchy. Apart from “giving life” to all forms upon and within theplanet, the influence or radiation of Shamballa is definitely and consciouslyrestricted, until such time as the Hierarchy and Humanity can respondconstructively. It is present, needless to say, and evokes response from thoseable to swing within its sphere of radiation; but it is felt that as yet thereare too many forms of expression which could not react correctly to the work ofthe “Destroyer of forms,” which is the most potent [188] aspect of this firstray centre and the one which manifests first, because its work must beaccomplished before the two other aspects of its potency can function rightly.The centre called humanity has as yet an inadequate radiation because of its—atpresent—inadequate development; its sphere of influence is relatively limited,though men are beginning to work outward in the direction of the subhumankingdoms and to attract more forcefully the kingdom of souls than heretofore.The Hierarchy has, however, no interior restrictions such as are consciously anddeliberately imposed upon itself by Shamballa or which are unconsciously imposedby humanity; any blocking of the hierarchical radiation (if I may use such aterm) will come from the forms on which the impact of its radiation is sought,but the outgoing influence of the central Triangle of the Hierarchy is uniqueand far-reaching.All that we have here been considering takes place within the etheric body ofthe planet, for all these centres exist etherically, and only etherically, andare not affected by the fact that the “units of energy” in Shamballa or in theHierarchy may be functioning in physical vehicles. Some are and some are not.The conditioning Lives in both these Centres work entirely through ethericmeans, wielding and controlling energies; the Human Centre, with its “units ofenergy” works largely at present upon purely physical levels or in the medium ofthat type of substance which we call “material”; men work with outer forms, withthe tangible elements and with material factors. The “units” in the otherCentres work with substance and not with matter. This is an interesting andvital distinction. The Hierarchy is existent upon the buddhic plane, which isthe first of the cosmic ethers, and it works from there, impressing mentalmatter. Shamballa works on the levels of the three highest ethers whilstHumanity works primarily in the three worlds [189] of the dense cosmic physicalplane. The New Group of World Servers has in it “units of energy” who can workboth with matter and with substance.There is here a most interesting distinction and one that is seldom grasped.Esoterically speaking, the word “matter” or material is given to all forms inthe three worlds; and though the average human being finds it difficult tounderstand that the medium in which the mental processes take place and that ofwhich all thoughtforms are made is matter from the spiritual angle, yet so itis; substance —technically speaking and esoterically understood—is in realitycosmic etheric matter, or that of which the four higher planes of our sevenplanes are composed. From the human angle, ability to work with and in thecosmic etheric substance demonstrates first of all when the abstract mindawakens and begins to impress the concrete mind; an intuition is an idea clothedin etheric substance, and the moment a man becomes responsive to those ideas, hecan begin to master the techniques of etheric control. All this is, in reality,an aspect of the great creative process: ideas, emanating from the buddhiclevels of being (the first or lowest cosmic ether) must be clothed in matter ofthe abstract levels of the mental plane; then they must be clothed in matter ofthe concrete mental plane; later, with desire matter, and finally (if they liveso long) they assume physical form. An idea which comes from the intuitivelevels of the divine consciousness is a true idea. It is noted or apprehended bythe man who has, within his equipment, substance of the same quality—for it isthe magnetic relation between the man and the idea which has made itsapprehension possible. In the great creative process he must give form to theidea, if he possibly can, and thus the creative artist or the creativehumanitarian comes into being and the divine creative intention is therebyaided. [190] Ideas can, however, be stillborn and abortive, and thus fail toarrive at manifestation.THE SEQUENCE OF INTER-RELATED TRIANGLESThe student is well aware that the three major Centres have theircorrespondences in the human etheric body and that each of them is related toits higher correspondence and can thus be “impressed” or affected and awakenedby the corresponding higher agent. It might be stated that:1. Energy from the planetary centre, Shamballa, utilises the head centre, thethousand petalled lotus, when the man is adequately developed. This centre isthe agent of the divine will within the life of the spiritual man, workingthrough the Spiritual Triad. It is only actively useful when the antahkarana isconstructed or in process of construction.2. Energy from the planetary centre, the Hierarchy, utilises the heart centre.This centre is the agent of divine love (expressing basically the will-to-good)working through the soul of the individual aspirant or disciple; this becomespossible when contact with the soul has been attained in some measure and theaspirant is on the way to become a soul-infused personality.3. Energy from the third planetary centre, Humanity, utilises the throat centre,working through the integrated personality, and therefore only when a relativelyhigh degree of evolutionary unfoldment has been attained. The throat centre onlybecomes creatively and spiritually active when the lower nature has been to somedegree subordinated to idealistic aspiration: this aspiration need not be onethat is usually regarded as spiritual and religious by the orthodox andtherefore imprisoned thinker. It must, however, be one of which the wholeintegrated man [191] is the instrument and which will be of such a large naturethat it will call all his creative faculty into expression.In this solar system, the heart centre is the first usually to be awakened andactive; as soon as there is life in that centre and a measure of activity, theother two major centres can begin to awaken. The correspondence to this can beseen in the fact that the Hierarchy is the mediating or middle factor betweenthe planetary head and throat centres, between Shamballa and Humanity. That iswhy the emphasis is laid upon the heart aspect in all the teachings.There are two centres which are regarded as “receptive and distributing agents”in an unique manner:1. The Ajna Centre (the centre between the eyebrows) works in connection withthe three major centres but mainly, at this stage of human development, as thedistributor of soul force and of spiritual energy as received from the heart andthroat centres.2. The Solar Plexus Centre works in connection with the sacral centre and withthe centre at the base of the spine, the centre of life; it works also with allsubsidiary centres below the diaphragm, gathering and transmuting their energiesand transmitting “that which has been purified” into the higher major centre.It might here be added that the will-to-be is, from one angle, the energy ofimmortality; it is the energy which pours into and works through the headcentre, whilst the will-to-live demonstrates as the fundamental instinct ofself-preservation and is to be found positively focussed in the centre at thebase of the spine. The latter is related to the personality [192] and is closelyallied to desire, and therefore to the solar plexus centre; there is a directline of hitherto unrecognised energy between the lowest centre in the spine andthe solar plexus; the other is related to the divine-spiritual man and isclosely allied to the soul, and therefore to the heart centre.MAN’S INTEGRAL RELATIONSHIP AND CREATIVE FUNCTION WITHIN THE WHOLEThe intricacy of all these relationships is most difficult for the neophyte tograsp, and this difficulty is further increased by the many and varying stagesof development, of ray distinctions, and also by the numerous emphases orprinciples which are laid upon vehicles, upon differing planes and planetarylevels of consciousness and of existence. With all this the student is not askedto deal. The factors of importance which he should attempt to realise and uponwhich he can construct the temple of his life and his current mode of living aresimply the following—and they are the same for each and all, no matter what hisray or his point in evolution may be:1. Man’s etheric body is an integral part of the planetary etheric body and isresponsive to the free distribution of the many circulating energies.2. The three periodical vehicles which compose the expression of the human beingand which make him what he is (the Monad, the Soul, and the Personality) areeach related to the three planetary centres: Shamballa, the Hierarchy, andHumanity, and therefore to each of man’s individual three major centres.3. The three centres in the human being which are to be found above thediaphragm (the head, the heart and the throat centres) are the organs ofreception for energies coming from the three planetary centres. [193]4. The agent for the distribution of the energies received via the head, theheart and the throat centres is the ajna centre between the eyebrows.5. The agent for the purification, transmutation and transmission of theenergies of all centres below the diaphragm is the solar plexus centre. It isthis centre through which the majority of human beings are at this time working.It is the major controlling centre, both for the reception and the distributionof energies, until such time as the heart centre is awakening and beginning tocontrol the personality.There is necessarily much more to be said anent this subject of the majorplanetary and human centres, but I have here given the student enough upon whichto ponder (I had almost said upon which to puzzle). The one important thing tobe borne in mind is the relationship between the centres, i.e.:1. Between the centres below the diaphragm and those above it.2. Between the three major centres with each other.3. Between the three major centres and the three planetary centres.All of this must be thought of in terms of circulating and freely movingenergies, distributing themselves throughout the etheric body of the planet (andtherefore through the human etheric body) under the essential purpose ofShamballa and under the direction of the Hierarchy.It is the theme of relationship therefore, which is the basic pattern in theevolutionary process of unfoldment in this, the second solar system (of threesystems) which is [194] that of the Son, wherein the quality of the seconddivine aspect, Love, is being perfected. In this perfecting process manparticipates unconsciously at first, during the long cycle of evolutionaryunfoldment under the Law of Necessity; but when he becomes the aspirant andtakes the first steps upon the path towards spiritual maturity, he begins toplay a crucial role which he maintains until he attains spiritual liberation andhimself becomes a member of the Hierarchy, of the fifth or spiritual kingdom,through perfected service in the fourth or the human kingdom.The relationship between the fourth and the fifth kingdoms is being continuallyincreased. bringing new powers and more vital livingness into the human familywhich is registered by its most advanced members consciously. The distributionof energies from the Hierarchy constitutes a very interesting sequence, some ofwhich can be indicated briefly. As we know the Hierarchy is the ashram of theLord of Love, the Christ; we also know that this greater Ashram is constitutedof the seven Ray Ashrams, each having at its centre a Chohan or a Master of theWisdom; each of the seven Ashrams has connected with it one or more subsidiaryAshrams.An Ashram is an emanating source of hierarchical impression upon the world. Its“impulsive energies” and its inciting forces are directed toward the expansionof the human consciousness, through the magnetic lives of the group members asthey carry on their duties, obligations and responsibilities in the outer world:it is aided also by the steady vibratory activity of the members of the Ashramwho are not in physical incarnation and by the united clear thinking andconvinced awareness of the entire Ashram. Beginners, such as are most aspirants(though not all), are usually engrossed with the fact of the Ashram. Traineddisciples are engrossed with the work to be done, and the [195] Ashram—as anAshram—plays little part in their thinking; they are so pre-occupied with thetask ahead and with the need of humanity and of these to be served that theyseldom think of the Ashram or of the Master at its centre. They are an integralpart of the ashramic consciousness and their conscious occupation is called, inthe ancient writings, “the emanating of that which flows through them, theteaching of the doctrine of the heart which is the force of truth itself, theradiating of the light of life, borne upon the stream to which the non-initiategives the name, ‘the light of love’.”The members of the Ashram constitute a united channel for the new energies whichare, at this time, entering the world; these energies pour dynamically throughthe Ashram out into the world of men; they stream with potency through theMaster at the heart of the Ashram; they move with “luminous speed” throughoutthe inner circle; they are stepped down by those who constitute the outercircle, and this is right and good; they are delayed by the beginner and the newdisciple from breaking forth into the world of men, and this is not so good.They are delayed because the new disciple has turned his back upon the world ofmen and his eyes are fastened upon the inner goal and not upon the outerservice; they remain fixed upon the Master and His senior disciples and workers,and not upon the mass of human need.It is essential that servers everywhere—the intelligent men and women of goodwill—get a grasp, fresh and clear, of the work to be done and that they become“relaying channels and not delaying points of selfish interest” in the divineflow. This takes vision and courage. It takes courage to adjust theirlives—daily and in all relations—to the need of the hour and to the service ofmankind; it takes courage to attack life problems on behalf of others and [196]to obliterate one’s own personal wishes in the emergency and need, and to do soconsistently and persistently. However, there is much to encourage the server.Humanity has now reached a point in development where there is a definite graspof the Plan of the Hierarchy—call it brotherhood, sharing, internationalism,unity or what you will. This is a growing and factual apprehension and is ageneral recognition by the thinkers and esotericists of the world, by thereligious people of enlightenment, by broad minded statesmen, by industrialistsand business men of inclusive vision and humanitarian insight, and even today bythe man in the street. There is also a more definite recognition of emergingspiritual values and a greater readiness to relinquish hindrances to service.The plans of the Christ for humanity’s release are more matured, for they had towait until such time that the trend of human aspiration became more clearlyemphatic; and the new era, with its latent possibilities can now be seen uponthe horizon, stripped of the veils of glamour and wishful thinking whichobscured it ten years ago. All of this is a challenge to the disciple. What isit that he must do?The disciple has to take himself as he is, at any time, with any givenequipment, and under any given circumstances; he then proceeds to subordinatehimself, his affairs and his time to the need of the hour—particularly duringthe phase of group, national or world crisis. When he does this within his ownconsciousness and is, therefore, thinking along lines of the true values, hewill discover that his own private affairs are taken care of, his capacities areincreased and his limitations are forgotten. He takes his place with those whoperceive the needs of the coming cycle—a cycle wherein the new ideas and idealsmust be stressed and for which a fight must be made, wherein the wider plans forthe good of the whole must be understood, [197] endorsed and preached, the newand clearer vision for human living must be grasped and finally brought intobeing, and a cycle wherein the effort of all members of the New Group of WorldServers must be given to the lifting of humanity’s load.There is a certain esoteric Mantram which embodies this attitude—the attitude ofthe disciple who is striving, in cooperative endeavour with others, to linkhierarchical intent with human aspiration and thus bring humanity nearer to itsgoal. The intent of the Hierarchy is to increase men’s capacity for freedom inorder to function effectively with that “life more abundantly” which the Christwill bring and which demands that the spirit of man be free—free to approachdivinity and free also to choose the Way of that approach. The Mantram bears thename, “The Affirmation of the Disciple.” It involves certain inner recognitionsand acceptances which are readily perceived by those whose intuition issufficiently awake; but its meaning should not be beyond the ability of anysincere student and thinker to penetrate if it appeals to them as significantand warranting their effort.I am a point of light within a greater Light.I am a strand of loving energy within the stream of Love divine.I am a point of sacrificial Fire, focussed within the fiery Will of God.And thus I stand.I am a way by which men may achieve.I am a source of strength, enabling them to stand.I am a beam of light, shining upon their way.And thus I stand.And standing thus, revolveAnd tread this way the ways of men,And know the ways of God.And thus I stand."},{"pageContent":"THE ARCANE SCHOOLTraining for new age discipleshipis provided by the Arcane School.The principles of the Ageless Wisdomare presented through esoteric meditation,study and service as a way of life.Contact the publishers for informationwww.lucistrust.org/arcaneschool [http://www.lucistrust.org/arcaneschool] ."},{"pageContent":"INDEXAAdepts, telepathic work, 3, 4Agents of directed impression, 118, 122Alignment—between head centre and heart centre of planetary Logos, 132bodies of transmitter and recipient, 26brain and mind, 12brain and soul, 107brain, mind and soul, 7, 8, 12, 21-22effect on invocation of energies by Shamballa, 134evolutionary today, 132-133in telepathy, 26, 31involutionary and evolutionary, 133Angels, effect on vegetable kingdom, 78-79Animal kingdom—karma, 79relation to humanity, 79-80Animal-man, production, 153Animals, domesticated—bridging function, 68rapport with, 68Antahkarana—anchoring centre, 50between Hierarchy and Shamballa, use, 70building, 51built by disciple, 70completion, results, 157, 160construction, 96, 107, 112, 130continuation through buddhic and atmic levels, 70effects upon soul, 165need for, 122prophecy regarding, 139relation to head centre, 190relation to nadis, 152use, 97, 104, 105, 156, 176, 190vehicle of dynamic Will, 122Approach to Divinity, basis, 47Aquarian Age—glory of, 33prophecies regarding, 33, 35Art—of responsiveness, 52solar plexus variety, 117Artist, creative, production, 189“As above, so below”, 167Ashram—definition, 194“freedom of”, 89group work, lesson, 32-33impression from, 86-87, 88, 89, 104, 105-106messages from, 88information, 86, 87members, functioning, 194, 195of Christ, 194of Master D.K., 160of Master K.
