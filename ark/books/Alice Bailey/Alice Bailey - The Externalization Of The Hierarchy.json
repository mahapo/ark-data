This necessarily invol ves the increased vibratory activity of the hum an mechanism, with a cons eque nt effect upon the psychic nature, produc ing an abnor mal sensitivity and psychic awareness. It woul d b e of value here to remember that the condi tion of humanity at this time is not the result of simply one factor, but of several — all of them being active simultaneous ly, because this period marks the close of one age and the inaugur ation of the new. The fac tors to which I refer are, primarily, three in num ber: 1. This is a transition period between the passing out of the Piscean Age, with its empha sis upon author ity and belief, and the com ing in of the Aquarian Age, with its empha sis upon indi vidua l unde rst andi ng and direct know ledge . The activity of these forces, characteristic of the two signs , produc es in the atom s of the human body a correspondi ng activity. We are on the verge of new"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST know ledge s and the atom s of the body are being tuned up for reception. Thos e atom s which are predom inantly Piscean are beginni ng to slow dow n their activity and to be \"occultly withdrawn,\" as it is called, or abstracted, whilst thos e which are respons ive to the New Age tende ncies are, in their turn, being stimulated and their vibratory activity increased. 2. The world war marked a climax in the history of manki nd, and its subj ective effect was far more pot ent than has hitherto been grasped. Through the pow er of prolonge d sound, carried forward as a great expe riment o n the battlefields all ove r the world dur ing a period of four years (1914 - 1918) , and through the intense emotiona l strain of the entire planetary popul ace, the web of etheric matter (called the \"veil of the temple\") which separates the phys ical and astral planes was rent or torn asunde r, and the amazing process of uni fying the two worlds of phys ical plane living and of astral plane expe rience was begun and is now slow ly goi ng on. It will be obvi ous , therefore, that this must bring about vast change s and alt erations in the hum an cons cious ness. Whilst it will usher in the age of unde rstandi ng, of brotherhood and of illum ination, it will also bring about states of reaction and the letting loos e of psychic forces which toda y menace the unc ont rolled and ignor ant, and warrant the soundi ng of a not e of warning and of caution. 3. A third factor is as follow s. It has been know n for a long time by the mystics of all the world religions and by esoteric stude nts everyw here, that certain members of the planetary Hierarch y are appr oaching closer to the earth at this time. By this I want you to infer that the thought , or the mental attention, of the Christ and of certain of His great disciples, the Masters of the Wisdom , is directed or focussed at this time on human affairs , and that some of Them are also preparing to break Their long silence and may appe ar later among men. This necessarily has a pot ent effect, first of all upon Their disciples and on thos e who are attune d to and sync hroni zed with Their Minds , and secondl y, it shoul d be remembered that the energy which flow s throug h these focal poi nts of the Divine Will will have a dua l effect and be destructive as well as cons tructive, according to the qua lity of the bodi es which react to it. Different type s of men respond d istinctively to any inflow of energy, and a tremendous psychic stimulation is at this time goi ng on, with results bot h divinely beneficent and sadly destructive. It might be adde d also that certain astrologi cal relations hips between the cons tella tions are releasing new type s of force which are playing through our solar system and on to our planet and thereby making pos sible developm ents hitherto frustrated in expr ession, and bringing about the demons tration of latent pow ers and the manifestation o f new know ledge s. All this must be most carefully bor ne in mind by the worker in the field of hum an affairs if the present crisis is to be right ly appreciated and its splendi d oppor tuni ties right ly employe d. I have felt it wise to write a few words conc ern ing the condi tion to be found in the world toda y especially in conne ction with esoteric, occult and mystical groups and the spiritualistic move ment. All true spiritual thinke rs and workers are much concerned at this time about the grow th of crime on every hand, by the display of the low er psychic powers, by the appa rent deterioration of the phys ical body, as show n in the spread of disease, and by the extraordinary increase in insanity, neurotic condi tions and mental unba lance. All this is the result of the tearing of the planetary web, and at the same time it is a part of the evol utiona ry plan and the provi ding of the oppor tuni ty whereby hum anity may take its next step forward. The Hierarchy of Adepts has been divided in opi nion (if so uns uitable a word can be appl ied to a group of soul s and brothers who know no sense of separateness, but onl y differ ove r problems of \"skill in action\" ) ove r the present world condi tion. Som e believe it to be premature and cons eque ntly unde sirable and provi ding a difficult sit uation, whilst others take Their stand upon the basic soundne ss of hum anity and regard the present crisis as inevitable and brought"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST about by the developm ents in man himself; They look upon the condi tion as educ ationa l and as cons tituting onl y a temporary p robl em which — as it is solved — will lead manki nd on the way to a still more glorious future. But there is, at the same time, no denyi ng the fact that great and freque ntly devastating forces have been let loos e upon the earth, and that the effect is a cause o f grave conc ern to all the Masters, Their disciples and workers. The difficulty can, in the main, be traced back to the ove rstimulation and the undue strain placed upo n the mechanism of the bodi es, which the world of soul s (in phys ical incarnatio n) have to employ as they seek to manifest on the phys ical plane and so respond to their envi ronm ent. The flow of energy, pour ing through from the astral plane and (in a lesser degree) from the low er mental plane, is brough t in cont act with bod ies that are unrespons ive at first, and ove r - respons ive later; it pour s into brain cells which, from lack of use, are una ccustom ed to the pow erful rhyt hm impos ed upon them; and hum anity's equi pm ent of know ledge is so poor that the majority have not sense enough to pro ceed with caution and to progress slow ly. Therefore, they are soon in dange r and difficulty; their natures are oft so impure or so selfish that the new pow ers which are beginning to make their presence felt, and so ope ning up new avenue s of awareness and c ont act, are subor dinated to pur ely selfish ends and prostituted to munda ne obj ectives. The glimpses vouc hsafed to the man of that which lies behind the veil are misinterpreted and the information gained is misused and distorted by wrong motives. But whethe r a person is uni ntentiona lly a victim of force or brings himself in touc h with it deliberately, he pays the price of his ignor ance or temerity in the phys ical body, even though his soul may \"go marching on.\" It is of no use at this time to close one 's ey es to the immediate probl em or to ende avour to lay the blame for the sad failures, the occult wrecks, for the half - demented psychics, the hallucinated mystics and the feeble - minde d dabbl ers in esotericism at the doo r of their ow n stupi dity, or upon the bac ks of som e teachers, groups or organisations . Much blame can inde ed be placed here and there, but it is the part of wisdom to face facts and to realise the cause of that which is everyw here transpiring and which can be stated as follow s. The cause of the grow th of the low er psychism and of the increasing sensitivity of hum anity at this time is the sudde n inflow of a new form of astral energy through the rent veil which has, unt il a shor t while ago, safegua rded the many. Add to this the inadequacy of the mass of hum an vehicles to meet the newly impos ed strain and som e idea of the probl em can be grasped. Let it not be forgot ten, how ever, that there is anot her side to the picture. The inflow of this energy has brought many hund reds of peopl e into a n ew and deeper spiritual realisation; it has ope ned a doo r through which many will pass before long and take their second initiation, and it has let a flood of light into the world — a light which will go on increasing for the next thirty years, bringi ng assu rance of immortality and a fresh revelation of the divine pot encies in the hum an being. Thus is the New Age dawning. Access to levels of inspiration, hitherto untouc hed, has been facilitated. The stimulation of the highe r faculties (and this on a large sca le) is now pos sible, and the coor dination of the persona lity with the soul and the right use of energy can go forward with renewed unde rstandi ng and enterprise. Ever the race is to the strong , and always the many are called and the few chos en. This is the occult law. We are now in a period of tremendous spiritual potency and of oppo rtuni ty to all upon the proba tiona ry path and the path of discipleship. It is the hou r wherein a clarion call goe s forth to man to be of good cheer and of goodw ill, for delivera nce is on the way. But it is also the hour of dange r and of menace for the unw ary and the unr eady, for the ambitious , the ignor ant, and for thos e who selfishly seek the Way"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST and who refuse to tread the path of service with pure motive. Lest this widespread uphe aval and cons eque nt disaster to so many shoul d seem to you unf air, let me remind you that this one life is but a second of time in the larger and wider existence of the soul , and that thos e who fail and are disrupt ed by the impact of the pow erful force s now floodi ng our earth will nevertheless have their vibration \"steppe d up\" to better things along with the mass of thos e who achieve, even if their phys ical vehicles are destroye d in the process. The destruction of the body is not the worst disaster that can ove rcom e a man. It is not my purpos e to cove r the whol e ground pos sible in relation to the situation in the field of psychism caused by the inflow of astral energy at this time. I seek to confine myself to the effect of this inflow on aspira nts and sensitives. These two words — aspirants and sensitives — are employe d by me in this article to distingui sh the awakened seeker after cont rol and mastery from the low er type of psychic, who is cont rolled and mastered. It is necessary here to remind you that psychism, so - called, can be divided into the follow ing two groups : Highe r Psychism Low er Psychism Divine Animal Cont rolled Uncont rolled Positive Negative Intelligently appl ied Autom atic Mediatorship Medium ship These distinctions are litt le unde rstood, nor is the fact appr eciated that bot h groups of qua lities indi cate our divinity. All are expressions of God. There are certain psychic pow ers which men share in com mon with the animals; these pow ers are inhe rent in the animal body and are i nstinctual, but they have, for the vast majority, droppe d below the threshol d of cons cious ness and are unr ealised and therefore useless. These are the pow ers, for instance, of astral clairvoya nce and clairaudi ence, and the seeing of colours and similar phe nom ena. Clairvoya nce and clairaudi ence are also pos sible on mental levels, and we then call it telepathy, and the seeing of sym bol s, for all visioni ng of geom etrical forms is mental clairvoya nce. All these pow ers are, how ever, tied up with the hum an mechan ism or respons e appa ratus, and serve to put the man in touch with aspects of the phe nom enal world for which the respons e mechanism, which we call the persona lity, exists. They are the produc t of the activity of the divine soul in man, which takes the form of what we call \"the animal soul ,\" which really corresponds to the Holy Ghos t aspect in the hum an microcosmic trinity. All these pow ers have their highe r spiritual corresponde nces, which manifest when the soul becom es cons cious ly active and cont ro ls its mechanism through the mind and the brain. When astral clairvoya nce and clairaudi ence are not below the threshol d of cons cious ness, but are actively used and func tioni ng, it means that the solar plexus centre is ope n and active. When the correspondi n g mental faculties are present in cons cious ness, then it means that the throat centre and the centre between the eyebrow s are becom ing \"awake\" and active. But the highe r psychic pow ers, such as spiritual perception with its infallible know ledge , the intuit ion with its une rring judgm ent, and psychom etry of the highe r kind with its pow er to reveal the past and the future, are the preroga tives of the divine soul . These highe r pow ers com e into play when the head and heart centres, as well as the throat centre, are brought into activity as the result of meditation and service. Let the stude nt, how ever, remember two things : That the greater can always include the lesser, but the pur ely animal psychic doe s not include the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST highe r. That between the low est type of negative medium ship and the highe st type of inspired teacher and seer are found a vast diversity of grades, and that the centres are not uniformly develope d in hum anity. The com plexity of the subj ect is great, but the general situation can be grasped, the signi ficance of the oppor tuni ty proffered can be unde rstood, and the right use of know ledge be employe d to bring good out of the present critical period, and thus the psychic and spiritual grow th of man be fostered and nur tured. Two que stions shoul d, I b elieve, at this time engr oss the attention of all workers in the field of esotericism and thos e who are enga ged with the training of stude nts and aspirants. I. How shall we train our sensitives and psychics so that the dange rs can be avoi ded and men can g o safely forward to their new and glorious heritage? II. How can esoteric school s or \"disciplines,\" as they are som etimes called, make right use of the oppor tuni ty? Let us speak first of the training and safegua rding of our psychics and sensit ives. I. The Training of Psychics The first thing to be borne in mind is that negative, uni ntelligent medium ship and psychism reduc es its expone nt to the level of an autom aton; it is dange rous and inadvi sable because it deprives man of his free will and his pos itivity, and militates against his acting as a free intelligent hum an being. The man is not acting in these cases as a channe l for his ow n soul , but is little better than an instinctual animal, if he is not literally an empty shell, which an obs ess ing entity can occupy and use. When speaking thus I am dealing with the very low est type of animal medium ship of which there is far too much these days, and which is the cause of conc ern to the best minds in all the move ments which foster medium ship. A med ium ship which is entered into with a fully conscious focussed attitude and in which the medium, know ingl y and intelligently, vacates his body to an entering entity of whom he is fully aware and who takes pos session with his cons cious permission in order to serve som e spiritual end and help his fellow men can be right and good. But how often is this type of medium ship to be seen? Few medium s know the techni que gove rning the passing in or out of an informing entity, nor do they know how to carry on this work i n such a way that never for a mom ent are they una ware of what they themselves are doi ng and the purpos e of their activity. Definitely and with pur pos e they lend their body tempor arily to anot her soul for service, preserving their ow n integrity all the time . The highe st expr ession of this type of activity was the giving of his body by the disciple Jesus for the use of the Christ. It is in the word service that the whol e story lies, and the safegua rd. When this true medium ship is better unde rstood, we shall h ave the medium passing out of his body in full waking cons cious ness through the orifice at the top of his head, and not , as is now the case in the majority of instances, through the solar plexus , with no preservation of awareness of the transacti on, nor any recollection of what has transpired. We shall then have the temporary entrance of a new tenant along the line of a sync hronous vibration through the entrance in the head, and the subs eque nt use of the instrum ent of the loaned body in service o f som e kind or anot her. But this procedur e will never be follow ed in order to satisfy idle curiosity, or"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST an equa lly idle grief, based on persona l lone liness and self - pity. At present many of the low er kind of medium s are expl oited by the curious or unha ppy publ ic, and thos e peculiar hum an beings whos e cons cious ness is centred entirely below the diaphragm and whos e solar plexus is inde ed their brain (as it is the brain of the animal) are forced to act as medium s to satisfy the love of sensation or desire for com fort of their almost equa lly uni ntelligent fellowmen. At the same time, there are medium s of a very much highe r order whos e lives are offered in service to adva nced soul s on the other side of the veil and who give themselves so that their fellow men ma y learn of them; thus , on bot h sides of the veil of separation, are soul s aided and given oppo rtuni ty to hear or serve. But these, too, woul d profit by a more intelligent training and by a more accurate unde rstandi ng of the techni que of their work and the organisation of their bodi es. They would then be better channe ls and more dependa ble intermediaries. Above all, let the psychics in the world toda y grasp the necessity of cont rolling and of not being cont rolled; let them realise that all that they do can be done by any trained disciple of the Ageless Wisdom shoul d the occasion warrant it, and circumstances justify such an expe ndi ture of force. Psychics are easily deceived. For example, it is of cour se obvi ous that on the astral plane there is a thought form of myself, you r Tibetan brother. All who have received the disciples' degree mont hly instructions , all who read the books which I have sent out into the world with the aid of A.A.B., also all who are working in my persona l group of disciples hav e naturally and autom atically aided in the cons truction of this astral thought form. It is not me, nor is it linke d to me, nor do I use it. I have definitely disassociated myself from it and do not employ it as a means of cont acting thos e I teach, for I wor k from choi ce entirely on mental levels thereby undoubt edly limiting my range of cont acts but increasing the effectiveness of my work. This astral thought form is a distortion of me and my work, needless to say, and resembles an animated and galvanised shel l. Because there is in this form much emotiona l subs tance and also a certain amount of mental subs tance, it can make a wide appe al and its validity is such that like all shells, for instance, which are cont acted in the seance room , it masque rades as mysel f and where the intuition is una wakened the illusion is com plete and real. Devot ees can therefore tune in with great facility on this illusory form and be com pletely deceived. Its vibration is of a relatively high order. Its mental effect is like a beautif ul parody of myself and serves to place the delude d devot ees in touc h with the scroll of the astral light , which is the reflection of the akashic records. These latter are the eternal scroll whereon the plan for our world is inscribed and from which thos e of us who teach gather our data and much of our information. This, the astral light distorts and steps dow n. Because this is a distorted image and func tions in the three worlds of form and has no source of validity highe r than thos e of form, it has in it t he seeds of separativeness and of disaster. Forms of flattery are sent out from it, ideas of separateness, thos e thought s which feed ambition and which foster love of pow er, and thos e germs of desire and persona l longi ng (which divide groups ) emerge from c ont act with it. The results to thos e who are deceived thereby are sad. I woul d like to poi nt out also that trance medium ship, as it is called, must inevitably be supe rseded by that medium ship which is offered by the man or wom an who is clairvoya nt or clai raudi ent on the astral plane, and who therefore in full waking cons cious ness and with the phys ical brain alert and active can offer himself as an intermediary between men in phys ical plane bodi es (and therefore blind and deaf on the subt ler level s) and thos e who, having discarded their bod ies, are cut off from phys ical com muni cation. This type of psychic can com municate with bot h groups and their value and their usefulness as medium s is beyond com put ation when they are singl eminde d, uns elfish, pur e and"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST dedicated to service. But in the training to which they subj ect themselves they must avoi d the present negative methods , and instead of \"sitting for developm ent\" in a blank and waiting silence, they shoul d ende avour to work pos itively as soul s, remai ning in cons cious and intelligent pos session of the low er mechanism of their bodi es; they must know which centre in that body they use whilst working psychically, and they must learn to look out , as souls , upon the world of illusion in which they are unde r taking to work; from their high and pure pos ition let them see clearly, hear truly and repor t accurately, and so serve their age and generation, and make the astral plane a familiar and well - know n place of activity, accustom ing manki nd to a state of existe nce wherein are found their fellow men, expe riencing, living and follow ing the Path. I cannot here write conc erning the techni que of that training. The subj ect is too vast for a brief article. I do say, with empha sis, that a more careful and wise training is needed and a more intelligent use of the know ledge which is available, if sought after. I appe al to all who are interested in the grow th of psychic know ledge to study, and think, and expe riment, and teach, and learn unt il such time as the entire level o f psychic phe nom ena has been lifted out of its present ignor ant, speculative and negative pos ition to one of pot ent assurance, prove d techni que , and spiritual expr ession. I appe al to such move ments as the Psychical Research Societies in the world and the v ast Spiritualistic Move ment to lay the empha sis on divine expr ession and not so much on phe nom ena; let them appr oach the subj ect from the angl e of service and carry their researches into the realm of energy, and cease to pande r so much to the publ ic. The o ppor tuni ty offered them is great and the need of their work is vital. The service rende red has been real and essential, but if these move ments are to avail themselves of the com ing inflow of spiritual energy, they must shift their attention into the realm of true values. The training of the intellect and the presenting to the world of a group of intelligent psychics shoul d be a main obj ective, and the astral plane will then be, for them, only a stage on the way to that world wherein all the spirit ual Guides and Masters are found, and from whence all soul s go forth to incarnation and all soul s return from the place of expe rience and of expe riment. It might be asked what groun d this training shoul d cove r. I woul d sugge st that teaching shoul d be give n as to the nature of man and the pur pos e and obj ectives of the soul ; training can be offered as to the techni que of expr ession, and careful instruction also given as to the use of the centres in the etheric body and in the developm ent of the ability to pr eserve invi olate the attitude of the pos itive onl ooke r, who is always the directing, cont rolling factor. There will have to be careful analysis of the type and character of the psychic, and then the appl ication of differentiated and suitable methods so tha t he may progr ess with the least hindrance. Training school s and classes which seek to develop the stude nt must be graded according to his poi nt in evol ution, and his passing into a group , opt imistically hopi ng that som ething will happe n to him whilst in i t, will have to cease. The goa l for the low - grade negative psychic shoul d be the training of the mind and the closing of the solar plexus unt il such time as he can func tion as a true mediator; if this invol ves the tempor ary cessation of his medium istic po wers (and cons equently of his com mercial expl oitation), then so much the better for him, viewing him as an immortal soul, with a spiritual destiny and usefulness. The instruction given to the intelligent medium and psychic shoul d lead him to a full unde rs tandi ng of himself and of his pow ers; it shoul d develop thos e pow ers without risk and with care, and he shoul d be stabilised in the pos ition of the pos itive cont rolling factor. His clairvoya nt and clairaudi ent pow ers shoul d gradua lly be perfected , and the right interpretation of what he sees and cont acts on the plane of illusion, the astral plane, shoul d be cultivated. "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Thus we shall gradua lly find emerging in the world a large body of trained psychics whos e pow ers are unde rstood and who func tion on the astral plane with as much intelligence as they func tion on the phys ical plane, and who are preparing themselves for the expr ession of the highe r psychic pow ers — spiritual perception and telepathy. These peopl e will cons titute eventually a body of lin king soul s, mediating between thos e who cannot see and hear on the astral plane because they are the prisone rs of the phys ical body and thos e who are equa lly the prisone rs of the astral plane, lacking the phys ical respons e appa ratus. The great need, there fore, is not that we shoul d cease to cons ult and train our psychics and medium s, but that we shoul d train them rightly and guard them intelligently and so link, through their means, the two worlds of the phys ical and the astral. 1 A Treatise on the Seven Ra ys, Vol. II (Esoteric Psychol ogy ) , pp. 555 - 598 .* II. Esoteric School s and Disciplines Our second que stion relates to the work of the esoteric school s or \"disciplines,\" as they are som etimes called, and the training and safegua rding of the aspirants foun d working in them. I woul d like first of all to make one point clear. The great hindr ance to the work of the majority of the esoteric school s at this time is their sense of separateness and their intolerance of other school s and methods . The leaders of th ese school s need to absorb the follow ing fact. All school s which recogni se the influence of the trans - Himalayan Lodge and whos e workers are linke d, cons cious ly or unc ons cious ly, with such Masters of the Wisdom as the Master Morya or the Master K.H., form o ne school and are part of one \"discipline.\" There is therefore no essential conf lict of interests, and on the inne r side — if they are in any way func tioni ng effectively — the various school s and presentations are regarded as a uni ty. There is no bas ic difference in teaching, even if the terminol ogy used may vary, and the techni que of work is funda mentally identical. If the work of the Great Ones is to go forward as desired in these days of stress and of world need, it is imperative that these various groups shoul d begin to recogni se their real uni ty in goa l, gui dance and techni que , and that their leaders shoul d realise that it is fear of other leaders and the desire that their group shoul d be num erically the most impor tant which prom pts the freque nt u se of the words, \"This is a different discipline,\" or, \"Their work is not the same as our s.\" It is this attitude which is hinde ring the true grow th of spiritual life and unde rstandi ng among the many stude nts gathered into the many out er organisations . At t his time, the \"great heresy of separateness\" taints them. The leaders and members talk in terms of \"our \" and \"your ,\" of this \"discipline\" and that, and of this method being right (usually their ow n) and the other method which may be right , but it is proba b ly doubt ful, if not pos itively wrong . Each regards their ow n group as specifically pledge d to them and to their mode of instruction, and threaten their members with dire results if they coope rate with the membership of other groups . Instead, they shoul d re cogni se that all stude nts in analogous school s and working unde r the same spiritual impul ses are members of the one school and are linke d toge ther in a basic subj ective uni ty. The time must com e when these various (and at present) separative esoteric bodi e s will have to proclaim their identity, when the leaders and workers and secretaries will meet with each other and learn to know and unde rstand each other. Some day this recogni tion and unde rstandi ng will bring them to the poi nt where they will ende avour t o suppl ement each other's efforts, exchange ideas with each other, and so in truth and in deed cons titute one great college of esotericism in the world, with varying classes and grades but all occupi ed with the work of training aspirants and preparing them for discipleship, or supe rintendi ng the work of disciples as they prepare themselves to take initiation. Then will cease the present attempts to hinde r each other's work"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST by com parison of methods and of techni que s, by criticism and defamation, by warning and the cult of fear, and the insistence on exclusiveness. It is these attitude s and methods which at this time are hinde ring the entrance of the pur e light of truth. Aspirants in these school s present a different probl em from that of ordinary ps ychism and medium ship. These men and wom en have offered themselves for intellectual training and have subj ected themselves to a forcing process which is intende d to bring the full flow er of the soul into premature blossom ing, and this in order more rapidly and effectively to serve the race, and to coope rate with the plan of the Hierarchy. Such stude nts thereby lay themselves open to dange rs and difficulties which woul d have been avoi ded had they chos en to go the slow er and equa lly sure way. This fact shoul d be realised by all workers in such school s and the probl em carefully expl ained to the entering aspirant, so that he may be on his gua rd and adhe re with care to the rules and instructions . He shoul d not be permitted to be afraid or to refuse to subj ect him self to this forcing process, but he shoul d enter upon it with his eyes wide ope n and shoul d be taught to avail himself of the safegua rds offered and the expe rience of the older stude nts. The empha sis in all esoteric school s is necessarily, and right ly, l aid upon meditation. Techni cally speaking, meditation is the process whereby the head centre is awakened, brough t unde r cont rol and used. When this is the case, the soul and the persona lity are coor dinated and fused, and at - one - ment takes place, produc ing in the aspirant a tremendou s inflow of spiritual energy, galvanising his whol e being into activity, and bringi ng to the surface the latent good and also evil. Herein lies much of the probl em and much of the dange r. Hence also the stress laid in such true s chool s upon the need of pur ity and truth. Over - empha sis has been laid upon the need for phys ical purity, and not sufficient empha sis laid upon the avoi dance of all fanaticism and intolerance. These two qua lities hinde r the stude nt far more than c an wrong diet, and they feed the fires of separativeness more than any other one factor. Meditation invol ves the living of a one - poi nted life always and every day. This perforce puts an undu e strain on the brain cells for it brings quiescent cells into ac tivity and awakens the brain cons cious ness to the light of the soul . This process of ordered meditation, when carried forward ove r a period of years and suppl emented by meditative living and one - pointed service, will successfully arous e the entire system, and bring the low er man unde r the influence and cont rol of the spiritual man; it will awaken also the centres of force in the etheric body and stimulate into activity that mysterious stream of energy which sleeps at the base of the spinal colum n. When this process is carried forward with care and due safegua rds, and unde r direction, and when the process is spread ove r a long period of time there is little risk of dange r, and the awakening will take place normally and unde r the law of being itself. If, how ev er, the tuning up and awakening is forced, or is brought about by exercises of various kinds before the stude nt is ready and before the bodi es are coor dinated and develope d, then the aspirant is headed tow ards disaster. Breathing exercises or pranayama tra ining shoul d never be unde rtaken without expe rt gui dance and onl y after years of spiritual appl ication, devot ion and service; conc entration upon the centres in the force body (with a view to their awakening) is ever to be avoi ded; it will cause ove rstimula tion and the ope ning of doors on to the astral plane which the stude nt may have difficulty in closing. I cannot impress too strongl y upon aspirants in all occult school s that the yoga for this transition period is the yoga of one - poi nted intent, of directe d purpos e, of a cons tant practice of the Presence of God, and of ordered regul ar meditation carried forward systematically and steadily ove r years of effort. When this is done with detachm ent and is paralleled by a life of lovi ng service, the awakening of the centres and the raising of the sleeping fire of kund alini will go forward with safety and sanity and the"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST whol e system will be brought to the requi site stage of \"aliveness.\" I cannot too strongl y advi se stude nts against the follow ing of inten sive meditation processes for hour s at a time, or against practices which have for their obj ective the arous ing of the fires of the body, the awakening of a particular centre and the movi ng of the serpent fire. The general world stimulation is so great at this time and the average aspirant is so sensitive and finely organised that excessive meditation, a fanatical diet, the curtailing of the hour s of sleep or undue interest in and empha sis upon psychic expe rience will ups et the mental balance and often do i rretrievable harm. Let the stude nts in esoteric school s settle dow n to steady, qui et, une motiona l work. Let them refrain from prolonge d hour s of study and of meditation. Their bodi es are as yet incapable of the requi site tension, and they onl y damage them selves. Let them lead nor mal bus y lives, remembering in the press of daily dut ies and service who they are essentially and what are their goa l and obj ectives. Let them meditate regul arly every morning, beginni ng with a period of fifteen minut es and never e xceeding forty minut es. Let them forget themselves in service, and let them not conc entrate their interest upon their ow n psychic developm ent. Let them train their minds with a nor mal measure of study and learn to think intelligently, so that their minds c an balance their emotions and enable them to interpret correctly that which they cont act as their measure of awareness increases and their cons cious ness expa nds . Stude nts need to remember that devot ion to the Path or to the Master is not enough. The Great Ones are looki ng for intelligent coope rators and workers more than They are look ing for devot ion to Their Persona lities, and a stude nt who is walking inde pende ntly in the light of his ow n soul is regarded by Them as a more dependa ble instrum ent than a dev oted fanatic. The light of his soul will reveal to the earnest aspirant the uni ty unde rlying all groups , and enable him to eliminate the poi son of intolerance which taints and hinde rs so many; it will cause him to recogni se the spiritual funda mentals which guide the steps of hum anity; it will force him to ove rlook the intolerance and the fanaticism and separativeness which characterise the small mind and the beginne r upon the Path, and help him so to love them that they will begin to see more trul y and enlarge their hor izon; it will enable him to estimate truly the esoteric value of service and teach him above all to practise that har mlessness which is the out standi ng qua lity of every son of God. A harmlessness that speaks no word that can damage a not her person, that thinks no thought which coul d poi son or produc e misunde rstandi ng, and which doe s no action which coul d hur t the least of his brethren — this is the main virtue which will enable the esoteric stude nt to tread with safety the difficult path of developm ent. Where the empha sis is laid upon service to one 's fellow men and the trend of the life force is out ward to the world, then there is freedom from dange r and the aspirant can safely meditate and aspire and work. His motive is pure, and he is s eeking to decentralise his persona lity and shift the focus of his attention away from himself to the group. Thus the life of the soul can pour through him, and expr ess itself as love to all beings . He know s himself to be a part of a whol e and the life of t hat whol e can flow through him cons cious ly, leading him to a realisation of brotherhood and of his one ness in relation to all manifested lives. THE PRESENT URGENCY Octobe r 10, 1934 I have som ewhat to say to thos e who are the recipients of my words as embodi ed in my books and pamphl ets and who, with mental interest and devot ion, follow out as far as may be my line of thought ."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST I have for years — ever since 1919 — sought to aid you to the best of my ability. The Hierarchy (a name cove ring the working discipl es of all degrees) has for hundr eds of generations sought to aid hum anity, and since the fifteenth century has steadily appr oached closer to the phys ical plane and sought to make a deeper impact on the hum an cons cious ness. This has resulted in a recogni tion which has in it (at this time) the seeds of world salvation . Until the fifteenth century, the pul l and the magne tic appe al was from the side of the watching Elder Brothers. Toda y, so num erous are the inne r and outer disciples, and so many are t he world aspirants, the pul l and the magne tic appe al are largely equa lised, and what will happe n in the world unf oldm ent and in the recogni tions by the races will be the result of mutual interplay of the two intents (I am choos ing my words with care) — the i ntent of the Masters to help hum anity, and that of the world aspirants and disciples to aid in that helping. Esoterically speaking, a poi nt of cont act, a mom ent of \"spiritual intercour se,\" is imminent, and out of that mom ent a new world can be bor n. If t hat can be brought about , then there can be re - established on earth the condi tion which was broug ht to an end in earlier days, when the Hierarchy (in order to further man's mental developm ent) withdr ew behind the scenes for a period. If this spiritual cont act can be brought about , it means that the Hierarchy will no longe r be hidde n and unknow n, but will be recogni sed as present upon the phys ical plane. This woul d at first be necessarily on a small scale, and the recogni tion will be conf ined to the aspirant s and disciples. Increasingl y the New Group of World Servers will be active in every nation and found func tioni ng throughou t the entire world. The two though ts which I seek to impress upon your minds are, first, the re - establishing of this closer relation , and secondl y, the work of a practical kind that each of you can do to bring about this general recogni tion. I seek to empha sise the poi nt that the final activity which will bring about this spiritual event must com e from the out er plane of phys ical life. All of us who are occupi ed with the Plan for \"the next three years\" are seeking earnestly for thos e who can help us and to whom appe al can be made for the put ting forth of that final last effort which will bring the desired and anticipated result. I woul d preface what I have to say with the reminder that I onl y make a sugge stion and that naught that I say carries with it the slight est weight of author ity; and also that I am aware of the freque nt futility of such appe als for coope ration. The hist ory of the world of thought evidences the fact that men are oft thrilled and enlightened and aided by ideas and by the prom ise of a developi ng future, but that when their aid is sought in the materialising of the idea, then their hope and interest fade out on the mental plane, or — if it reaches the world of emotion and of strong desire — the sacrifice requi red to bring the hope to birth on the phys ical plane is lacking or too feeble to produc e the longe d - for result. What I have to say as a result of the urgen cy upon me to bring about a more intensive coope ration upon the part of thos e who read with interest the pamphl et The Next Three Years , 2 A Treatise on White Magi c , pp. 401 - 433.

My sole respons ibility is to put the oppo rtuni ty before the world aspirants, to poi nt out to them the inhe rent pos sibilities of this particular situation, to indi cate lines of helpful acti vity, and then (having so done ) to withdraw the pow er of my mind and thou ght , and so leave each aspirant free to com e to his"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST ow n decisions . The pamphl et The Next Three Years is goi ng forth toda y upon its mission. Its obj ective is to educ ate publ ic opi nion . It carries bot h inspiration and the pow er to produc e cleavages in the life — cleavages which will produc e new activities and the cessation of old attitude s of mind . A pos sible happe ning is indi cated — the formation upon the phys ical plane of that group of as pirants and disciples which, given time and oppor tunity, can salvage a distressed world and bring light and unde rstandi ng to hum ani ty . As to this, I need say no more. All of you have read the plan as it is embodi ed in the pamphl et, and the chal lenge to faith and the appe al to your service is before you . The next two years will see the decision as to whether the fusion of the inne r and the out er groups of world servers can be made, or whether more time must elapse before the earlier ancient coope ration between the Hierarchy and hum anity can be re - established. I speak with love and almost anxi ety, and with a wider know ledge of the present urgency than you can pos sibly have. I couc h what I have to say to you in the form of certain que stions , which I ask that you shoul d put to you rselves with qui etness and sincerity. 1. Do I really and in truth desire the establishm ent of this closer interplay between the inne r and out er worlds? If so, what am I prepared to do in order to bring this about ? 2. Is th ere any way in which I can make a definite cont ribut ion tow ards this desired end? Recogni sing my special circum stances what more can I give in a. Meditation b. Unde rstandi ng of the Plan c. Love of my fellow men? Forget not that meditation clarifies the mi nd as to the fact and nature of the Plan, that unde rstandi ng brings that Plan into the world of desire, and that love releases the form which will make the Plan materialise upon the phys ical plane. To these three expr essions of your soul I call you. All of you , without exception, can serve in these three ways, if you so desire. 3. The obj ective of all the work to be done at this time is to educ ate publ ic opi nion and to familiarise the thinki ng peopl e of the world with the urgency and the oppor tuni ty of the next two years. If this is inde ed so, what am I doing to make this pos sible? To elabor ate this que stion: a. Have I spoke n to all I coul d in my envi ronm ent, or have I been held back by fear? b. Have I made pos sible the wide distribut ion of the pamphl et on this subj ect? Its distribut ion in its present form is pos sible onl y unt il the fall of 1936, and the time is therefore shor t. c. Have I aided in a material and financial way as far as is pos sible? Can I do more than I have done so far to help t o meet this requi rement? d. What more of my time can I give to help this work, to aid thos e who are distribut ing the pamphl et, or to gather peopl e toge ther for discussion?

Their hands need strengt hening, their work needs helping, and there is not one of you who cannot do more than you are doing, through the aid of meditation, mone y and thought , to salvage the world, to educ ate publ ic opi nion and so bring in the New Day. A CHALLENGING OPPORTUNITY April 1935 During the Wesak Festival this y ear, Thos e Who are seeking to lift hum anity nearer to the Light and to expa nd the cons cious ness of manki nd, will be gathering Their forces for a renewed appr oach with its inevitable cons eque nces. These cons eque nces are the stimulation of the hum an family t o a fresh spiritual effort; the process and the exalted Personnel invol ved have been described by me in my previous message ( A Treatise on the Seven Rays , Vol. II, Esoteric Psychol ogy , pp. 683 - 688) ; They will also bring about the strengt hening of the New G roup of World Servers so that they can work with greater effectiveness, vision the Plan with greater clarity and — within themselves as a group — bring about greater integration. Thus they can aid in carrying out the plans of the Counc il of the Hiera rchy to meet the immediate hum an emergency. As I told you before, the plans for humanity are not laid dow n, for hum anity determines its ow n destiny; the effort is directed tow ards establishing a closer relations hip between hum anity and the Hierarchy. It i s pos sible for all aspirants and disciples to participate in this effort to the extent of rende ring the task of the Masters easier by their clarity of thinki ng, their renewed spiritual effort, and the rededication of themselves to the task of service. To t his effort I call you. It is a cont inui ng effort which will be spread ove r many years. The oppo rtuni ty will be offered to all true servers and aspirants and, above all, to the New Group of World Servers to participate in the establishing of the necessary m om entum in the immediate cycle. I call you , therefore, to a mont h of inne r silence, of introspective thought , of self - cont rol and of meditation, to self - forgetfulness and attentiveness to oppor tuni ty and not to you r ow n inne r aspiration to achieve. I call you to conc entrate upon the world need for peace, mutual unde rstandi ng and illum ination and to forget utterly you r ow n needs — mental, emotiona l and phys ical. I call you to prayer and to fasting, though along what lines you r abstinence shoul d go is for you to decide. For the five days of meditation, I call you to a more com plete `fasting,' to a grave silence, to an inne r focalisation, to a pur ity of thought and to an active spirit of lovi ng kindne ss which will make you a pur e channe l.

SEED GROUPS IN THE NEW AGE July 1937 Earlier I gave you som e thought s anent the new groups which com e into func tioni ng activity unde r The Law of Group Progr ess. This law has a pe culiarly close relation to the new Aqua rian Age. 3 A Treatise on the Seven Rays , Vol. II (Esoteric Psychol ogy ) , pp. 174 - 194 .* Groups have always existed in the world, as for instance the family group uni t, but they have been predom inantly third ray groups with, therefore, a dom inant out er expression and cont rol, and originating as the result of desire. Their focus has been out standi ngl y material, and that has been part of the intende d plan. Right obj ectivity and expr ession has been the goa l, and s till is, of the evol utiona ry process. But the groups now forming are a second ray activity and are bui lding groups — bui lding the forms of expr ession in the new age. They are not the result of desire, as the term is usually unde rstood, for they are founde d b asically on a mental impul se. They are subj ective in fact and not obj ective in nature. They are distingui shed by qual ity more than by form. That they may eventually produc e pot ent obj ective effects is to be desired and such is their intent in our minds , bu t — at the present stage which is that of germination — they are subj ective and (occultly speaking) they are \"working in the dark.\" At som e distant date, groups will emerge which will be first ray groups , animated by the will aspect and cons eque ntly still more subj ective in nature and more esoteric in origin, but with these we need not conc ern our selves. These seed groups are embryoni c and therefore, like germinating seeds, their activity is at present dual. Every seed demons trates its life by put ting out two out ward evidences of its internal life and activity, and these seed groups are no exception to this uni versal law. Their activity is evidenced in a relation to the Hierarchy and their relation to each other. Not yet have they succeeded in emerging into out er plane"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST activity. Their inne r life is not adequa tely strong, but they are, as says the scripture, \"taking root dow nw ards\" in order to \"bear fruit upw ards.\" Shoul d these groups develop as intende d, shoul d the corpor ate life of the members persist in right integral relation and shoul d cont inuanc e be their keynot e, then these seed groups , tiny as they may be, will com e to flow er, and — through an eventual \"scattering of the seed,\" succeed finally in \"cove ring the earth with verdure.\" I am speaking here in the language of sym bol ism which is, as you well know , the langua ge of truth. One small plant which, in its turn, succeeds in produc ing a seed, through right ful fruition can thus reproduc e itself in multiple order. Be not therefore undul y impressed by the smallness of the effort. A tiny seed is a potent force — if dul y tende d, right ly nur tured and ripened by sun and water within the soil — its pot encies are unpr edictable. Certain germ ideas are emerging into the hum an cons cious ness. These differ peculiarl y from thos e of the past, and it is these widely different ideas which are the distinctive characteristics of the new age, the Aqua rian Age. Hitherto the great ideas which succeeded finally in cont rolling a race in any age have been the gift of the intuiti ve sons of men to their generation. Adva nced hum an beings have then seized upon the intuited idea, subor dinated it to the process of mentation, made it desirable, and then have seen it com e into being through the \"agency of recogni tion,\" as it is occultly called. One illum ined mind woul d sense the divine idea, needed for the grow th of the racial cons cious ness, and then woul d give it form; the few woul d recogni se it and thus foster its grow th; the many woul d eventually desire it and it then coul d manifest ex perimentally and spor adically all ove r the civilised world of any age, wherever culture of any kind made itself felt. Thus the idea was manifested. Two ways in which these determining ideas in the past came into being and played their part in leading the r ace onw ard might be mentione d. One was through the teaching of som e teacher who founde d a school of thought , thus working through the minds of a chos en few, and through them eventually colour ed the thought s of the men of his time. Of such a teacher, Plato, Aristotle, Socrates and many others are out standi ng examples. Anot her method was the evoc ation of the desire of the masses for that which is deemed desirable and their mass reorientation tow ards a fuller life expression. This life expr ession, founde d on s om e voi ced idea, was embodi ed in an ideal life. Thus the work of the Saviours of the world came into expr ession, and this brough t about the emergence of a world religion. The first method was strictly mental, and even today remains so; the masses, for ins tance, know little of Plato and his theories in spite of the fact that he has moul ded hum an minds — either through acqui escence in his theories or through refutation of them — dow n the ages. The other method is strictly emotiona l and so more easily c olour s the mass cons cious ness. An instance of this was the message of the love of God which Christ enunc iated and the emotiona l reaction of the masses to His life, His message, and His sacrifice. Thus the need of the mental few and the emotiona l many has b een met dow n the ages. In every case, the origin of the work effected and the medium whereby the race has been gui ded has been a hum an - divine cons cious ness; the medium has been a Persona lity Who kne w and felt and was at - one with the world of ideas, with th e inne r world order, and with God's plan. The result of these two techni que s of activity has been the emanation of a stream of force, com ing from som e layer or level of the world cons cious ness — the mental or the emotiona l planes — which are aspects of the con scious ness of the manifesting deity. This impact of force has evoke d a respons e from thos e who func tion upon one or other of these levels of awareness. Toda y, as the integration of the hum an family proceeds and as the mental level of cont act becom es more p otent, there is to be found a pow erful hum an reaction to school s of thought and a lessened reaction to the methods of orthodox religion. This is due to the fact that the trend of the hum an cons cious ness is (if I might so express it) away from the emotiona l to the mental levels of cons cious ness, and this, as far as the masses are"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST conc erned, will go on increasing. The time has now com e when there are enough peopl e to be found who — having themselves made the religious and the mental appr oaches to truth definit e factors in their cons cious ness in som e small measure, and having established enough soul cont act so that they can begin to touc h the world of ideas (upon the intuitiona l levels of cons cious ness) — can employ a new techni que . Toge ther and as a group they ca n becom e sensitive to the incom ing new ideas which it is intende d shoul d condi tion the new age that is upon us; toge ther and as a group they can establish the ideals and develop the techni que s and methods of the new school s of thought which will determine the new culture; toge ther and as a group they can bring these ideas and ideals into the cons cious ness of the masses, so that school s of thought and world religions can be blende d into one , and the new civilisation can emerge. It will be the produ ct of the mental and emotiona l fusion of the techni ques of the Piscean Age, and it will thus produc e an eventual manifestation upon the physical plane of the plan of God for the immediate future. This is the vision which lies behind the expe riment being ca rried on in the new seed groups . Looki ng at the whol e probl em from anot her angl e, it might be stated that the effort of the past has been to raise the cons cious ness of hum anity through the pione ering efforts of its foremost sons . The effort of the future will be to bring dow n into manifestation the cons cious ness of the soul through the pione ering efforts of certain groups . It has therefore, as you will readily unde rstand, to be a group effort because the soul is group cons cious and not indi vidua lly conscio us; the newer truths of the Aquar ian Age can onl y be grasped as a result of group ende avour . This is relatively a new thing. In the past, a man had a vision and sought to materialise it with the aid of thos e whom he coul d impress and influence to think as he did; a man sensed an idea or intuited an idea and then tried to give it form, later calling in the help of thos e who saw his idea as an ideal; a man had a great ambition which was, in reality, a dim grasping of a part of God's general plan, and he then became a group leader or a ruler, with the assistance of thos e who succum bed to his pow er or to his right to gui de, lead and dom inate them. And so, progr essively, the race has been led from poi nt to poi nt and from stage to stage of unfoldm ent unt il toda y m any are seeing the vision, sensing the plan, and dreaming dreams which they can work out toge ther. This they can do because they recogni se each other, because they are beginni ng to know themselves and each other as soul s, because their unde rstandi ng is uni ted and because (and this is of prime impor tance) the light of the intellect, the light of know ledge , the light of the intuition and the light of unde rstandi ng is evoke d within them; it enters not from without ; and in that light , toge ther, they s ee Light . It is a group activity, a group recogni tion, and the result of group at - one - ment. All this is, how ever, so new and relatively so rare that these groups remain as yet in an embryoni c stage. We call them the seed groups of the new age. There are m any such, as I told you before, but all as yet so small and so unde velope d that the success of their effort remains for the future to decide. This appl ies also to the groups which I began to bui ld in 1931 (Discipleship in the New Age , Vols. I and II). It will be appa rent to you therefore why it was necessary for the initial or first group to lay the empha sis upon telepathic rappor t, because upon that rappor t, unde rstandi ngl y cultivated and developed, the success of these seed groups must depend. It does no t mean that their success depends upon the established success of the first group, but upon the com prehension by all the groups of the meaning and pur pos e and techni que s of telepathy. (See Telepat hy and the Etheric Vehicle) The foundi ng upon the inne r pla nes of a school of telepathy to which hum anity can becom e sensitive, even if unc ons cious ly so, is part of the task which the first group, the Telepathic Com muni cators, has unde rtaken. They are the custodi ans of the group purpos e, and work on mental levels. The second"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST group, the Trained Observers, has the objective to see clearly through the use of the intuition; they serve on astral levels. The third group , the Magne tic Healers, has the obj ective of working with forces on the phys ical plane. The other six g roups will be mentione d later. You have becom e som ewhat accustom ed to the concept of these groups . The nove lty is dyi ng out and you are apt to ask your selves whether there is, in the last analysis, anyt hing really new in them. I will give you further on t hree reasons for the fact of their being a step in adva nce of anyt hing hitherto pos sible on the phys ical plane. This may re - establish their importance in you r minds and enable you to carry forward your work with fresh ardour . I have stated that t hese groups cons titute an expe riment and that they are conne cted paramoun tly with the work of the new age as it will express itself through the com ing civilisation and the future culture. It might be of value here if I poi nted out the distinction which exi sts between a civilisation and a culture. A civilisation is an expr ession of a mass level of cons cious ness as that cons cious ness works out in phys ical plane awareness, phys ical plane adjustments, relations hips and methods of living. A culture is essentiall y an expr ession of the intellectually and vitally mental signi ficances and the state of cons cious ness of the mentally pol arised peopl e of the race, of the intelligentsia or of thos e who cons titute the link between the inne r world of soul life and the out er world of tangi ble phe nom ena. In thos e words the raison d'être of the mental plane is conc isely stated. Its func tion in this conne ction will be increasingl y unde rstood dur ing the next few decades. The masses are negative to the plane of desire and of feel ing, and the civilisation of any age is largely the exteriorisation of that particular level of cons cious ness. The intelligentsia are pos itive and their pos itive mental orientation produc es the culture of their time, or their race or their com muni ty. We ha ve therefore in the hum an family: Masses . . . Negative . . . respons ive to desire . . . Civilisation Intellectuals . . . Positive . . . respons ive to mind . . . Culture In these you have the two pol es which distingui sh the race, and it is through the interplay between these two that hum an activity, progr ess and developm ent is generated and carried forward. There is anot her groupi ng which shoul d not be ove rlooke d. The spiritually minde d peopl e of the world are negative to the highe r spiritual world as it expr esses itself through or calls forth the highe r type of desire which we call aspiration. This produc es thos e expone nts of the spiritual nature who cons titute — in the aggr egate — the Chur ch of Christ or the world religions in the exot eric sense and in an y race or time. Positive to this group and giving them the keynot e of the culture of their particular age on this highe r turn of the spiral are the esotericists and aspirants throughout the world. These are respons ive to the mind aspect. In this way the spiritual culture and the resultant civilisation com es into being and to it the low er becom es respons ive. You have, therefore, the masses and the intellectuals toge ther negative in their turn to the pos itive impression of the deeper civilisation an d culture as it is expr essed through the religions of the world and the groups of idealistic esoteric seekers after reality. These latter are the glory of every age and the pos itive germ of the subjective unf olding impul se which is basically the sour ce of all current phe nom enal appe arance. This group of religioni sts and esoteric aspirants in their turn cons titute the negative pol e to the pos itive impression and energy of the planetary or occult Hierarchy. Cons eque ntly, we have: "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Negat ive Groups Positive Groups The Masses The Intelligentsia The Chur ches and religions The Esotericists, aspirants and occultists The Esotericists, in their turn The Planetary Hierarchy Broadly speaking, these groups divide themselves into the extrove rt ed groups and the introve rted groups , into the obj ective and the subj ective levels of cons cious ness, and into the major divisions of the phe nom enal world and the world of spiritual realities. The probl em before the Hierarchy at the beginni ng of the new or Aqua rian Age was how to fuse and blend these two distinct groups , attitude s or states of cons cious ness so that from their fusion a third group coul d emerge which woul d be exterior in its activity and yet cons cious ly alive to the interior values; they shoul d be able to func tion upon the outer plane of appe arances and, at the same time, be equa lly awake and active upon the inne r plane of reality and of spiritual living. This type of dua l func tioni ng is the easiest activity for the Members of the Hi erarchy and cons titutes the sine qua non prior to association with that Hierarchy. It was realised that many peopl e coul d be trained in the appr eciation of this pos sibility and slow ly develope d to the poi nt where theory coul d pass into practice. Yet these peopl e woul d not be equi pped throughout their natures in such a way that they were ready to becom e part of the occult Hierarchy, even in the stage of accepted disciples. It was the realisation of the need for a bridgi ng group which woul d be neither entire ly negative nor entirely pos itive which prom pted som e of the Masters (Who are conne cted with the Hierarchy) to form the New Group of World Servers. These peopl e belong to neither group and yet they can func tion more or less in relation to both. This, as yo u well know , has been done with qui te a measure of success and this large group now exists and is magne tic enough to draw forth respons e from the mass of world aspirants and servers (who represent the current civilisation and current culture) and at the sa me time to absorb and thus transmit know ledge , wisdom , force and light from the Planetary Hierarchy. It has now been deemed pos sible to form groups within the New Group of World Servers whos e members can begin to prepare themselves to expr ess bot h the phe nom enal and the impul sive, the negative and the pos itive, the material and the spiritual with such a measure of success that, in due time, there can exist on earth a replica of the Hierarchy, its methods and techni que s of work. Such is the pur pos e of the g roups which I have formed, and of other groups throughout the world who — in a different way and form, and employi ng perchance a different phr aseology — yet are motivated and actuated as are the seed groups for which I have made myself respons ible. The three reasons for their importance might therefore be stated as follow s: 1. They cons titute the germ of life which will result in the emergence of the Hierarchy at a later date upon earth, com ing forth from the seclusion of the ages to func tion again in the light of phys ical day. 2. They are a bridgi ng group , bridgi ng between the negative mass of manki nd and the pos itive agency of the Hierarchy. That is the reason why, in these groups , empha sis is laid upon service because that embodi es respons e to th e mass and its need, and upon soul cont act because that embodi es respons e to the world of soul s, as typi fied for us in the occult Hierarchy. 3. They also hol d within themselves as a group the seeds of the com ing civilisation and the germ of the new cultur e. The germ of the life of the new age is there, within the hus k of the old age and the old"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST forms. Hence the oppor tuni ty, the service and the probl ems of these groups . Let me ende avour to indi cate to you in what manner these groups can measure up to the t hreefold demand or oppor tuni ty mentione d above . 1. They conc eal and nur ture the germ or seed of the new civilisation of the Aqua rian Age. 2. They bridge between the old groups and the new group, between the mass of men (of whom the foremost find their wa y into the New Group of World Servers) and the Planetary Hierarchy. 3. They will cons titute in the future an aspect of the Hierarchy and its work upon the out er phys ical plane. You will not e that the first oppo rtuni ty conc erns the spirit aspect or the vi tal impul sive life aspect of divinity; that the second conc erns the soul aspect or the subj ective cons cious ness aspect of divinity; whilst the third conc erns the body aspect or the physical expr ession, through cons cious ness, of the divine life. The first t hree groups which I have formed are intende d to be small reflections of these three aspects from the angl e of mode rn need and the meeting of that need. I have indi cated som ewhat the intende d work of the first group from the angl e of telepathic i nterplay (Telepat hy and the Etheric Vehicle) . The method of com muni cation between the Members of the Hierarchy has to be externalised, eventually, upon earth and this is one of the tasks of the group . It might be of service to you if I out lined a little mo re clearly what is the pur pos e of the new seed groups, in terms of the new age civilisation and culture so that the practical results might be visione d with clarity and som e new ideals emerge as to the qua lity of the com ing new world order. The second gro up, the trained obs ervers, will inaugur ate the era of light and of a free cont rol of the astral plane, with its qua lity of freedom from illusion and glamour . This freedom will be brought about when \"right obs ervation\" takes the place of the disturbed visio n of the present, and glamour will be dissipated through the \"right direction\" of the light of the soul throughou t the plane of illusion. The Aqua rian Age will be predom inantly the age of synthesis and light . The third group carries the initial impul se th rough \"into the light of day\" and will bring the phys ical world into a condi tion whereby \"the healing of the nations through the arising of the sun of right eous ness\" will becom e pos sible, because the laws of healing (which are basic and funda mental) can be appl ied and worked out in all departments of life upon the out er levels of appe arance — for disease is onl y found in the world of phe nom ena. As regards telepathic com muni cation between the Members of the Hierarchy: within itself, the Hierarchy func tions pr actically entirely on the plane of mind. This is necessarily essential and for two reasons : 1. The members of the Hierarchy have freed themselves from the limitations of brain activity and brain cons cious ness. They can, therefore, in their essential Selve s and when they so choos e, carry on simultaneous ly two different lines of activity — bot h of real import. They can pur sue their nor mal avoc ations upon the phys ical plane (if func tioning in phys ical bodi es) and when so doing are condi tione d in the p erformance of thos e activities by the brain limitations of time cons cious ness and space cons ciou sness. But they can also work upon the mental plane with the chitta or mind stuff, and"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST can do this at the same time as they are condi tione d and limited by their phys ical mechanism. They are then entirely freed from the time cons cious ness and from any such limitations as space relations within the solar system. 2. The focus of their pol arisation is on the mental plane and they func tion there as sons of mind or of manas. Their nor mal mode of intercour se is throug h the medium of telepathic unde rstandi ng. This is the nor mal techni que of a divine and free manasaput ra. This is all made pos sible when a hum an being has pol arised himself in the soul cons cious ness, when t he egoi c lotus is unf olding and when, therefore, the mental method of working is that of mental relations hip or telepathy. I earlier told you that, as the race achieves increasingl y a mental polarisation through the developi ng attractive pow er of the ment al principle, the use of langua ge for the conve ying of thought s between equa ls or of com muni cating with supe riors will fall into disuse. It will cont inue to be used in reaching the masses and thos e not func tioni ng on the plane of mind. Already voi celess pr ayer and aspiration and worship are deemed of highe r value than the pleadings and proclamations of voi ced expr ession. It is for this stage in the unf oldm ent of the race for which preparation must be made, and the laws, techni que s and processes of telepathi c com muni cation must be made plain so that they can be intelligently and theoretically unde rstood. The method of com muni cation between members of the Hierarchy is a tenfold process, and onl y in the cont ribution of the ten groups (the nine and the synt hesising tenth) will their share in the externalising process, as it is to take place in the world, be com pleted. From certain angl es the work of the second group (the Trained Observers) is exceedingl y hard, harder perhaps than that of any other grou p — except that which is enga ged in pol itical work. In the latter field the work of the first Ray of Will or Pow er is beginning to make its presence felt, and hence the great difficulty. The energy which works out in pol itical activity is not yet unde rstood. The work of the Destroye r Aspect has been kept relatively in the backgr ound and onl y dur ing the past half century has it becom e definitely active. This became pos sible because the whol e world, practically speaking, was invol ved and onl y in the region or r ealm of synthesis can the first Ray func tion. This is a poi nt to be remembered and one that is little grasped as yet. I wonde r if you can appr eciate the impor tance of the two statements anent the first Ray found in this short paragraph? I oft give you so m uch real information of which you remain obl ivious . The second group is wrestling with glamour . The processes of light and their relation to group glamour and to indi vidua l glamour form a very close conne ction. Right illum ination — which is anot her name or aspect of right direction — will take the place of glamour , and the obj ective (persona lly cons idered) of this group of disciples is to bring \"light into dark places\" and illum ination into their lives. It is not my intention here to deal with the probl em of g lamour . With that I have conc erned myself in the instructions to this group (Glam our : A World Probl em) . The task of this group of disciples is closely conne cted with the astral task of the Hierarchy. This is, at this time, the dissipation of the world ill usion. That has been its probl em since Atlantean times, and the climaxing of its effort is imminent and immediate. It takes the form (for all illusions take to themselves form of som e kind or other) of the \"pour ing in of light ,\" esoterically unde rstood. Th is is an illusion and at the same time a great and signi ficant spiritual fact. Hence we have toda y upon the phys ical plane the emergence of much light everyw here; we have festivals of illum ination, and a cons istent ende avour on the part of all sp iritual workers to enlight en manki nd, and a great deal of talk on the part of educ ators"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST anent illum ination of a mental kind. The keynot e of this effort to eliminate world glamour was sound ed by Christ when He said (follow ing the example of Hermes, Who init iated the process of enlightenm ent for our race, the Aryan), \"I am the Light of the World.\" Disciples must learn the signi ficance of illum ination, received in meditation, and the necessity to work with light as a group for the dissipation of glamour . Herm es and Christ unde rtook this work of astral enlight enm ent and are cons tantly occupi ed with this task. Their work in the new age is to be aided by the intensive activity of certain groups of which this second group is one . Later, when the new civilisation i s nearing appe arance, these groups will all have in them two key persons or poi nts of energy through which the forces of Hermes and the will of Christ will be focussed, and through which They will be enabled to work. When this takes place, the task of diss ipating the world glamour will be much more rapid than it is toda y. In the meantime groups of disciples can \"nur ture and conc eal,\" thus protecting from troubl e the germ or seed of the new Aqua rian culture and civilisation along this particular line of free dom . Again, I repeat, they must do this along with other groups , working along similar lines, either cons cious ly or unc ons cious ly. The second task of this group of disciples is to act as a bridge for forces which are seeking etheric expr ession and which e manate from soul levels, via the mind. I have earlier poi nted out in A Treatise on White Magi c that the astral plane is itself an illusion. When the first task of the groups working with world glamour is accom plished this will be evident. I can give you as yet no real idea of the unde rlying meaning, for you are all working in som e measure upon the plane of illusion and of glamour , and for you the world illusion exists and the astral plane is for you a fact. But this I can say: for the initiate mem bers of the Great White Lodge the astral plane doe s not exist. They do not work on that level of cons cious ness, for the astral plane is a definite state of awareness even if (from the spiritual angl e) it has no true being. It embodi es the great creative wo rk of hum anity dow n the ages, and is the produc t of the `false' imagination and the work of the low er psychic nature. Its instrum ent of creative work is the sacral and the solar plexus centres. When the energies, findi ng expr ession through these two centre s, have been transmuted and carried to the throat and heart by adva ncing hum anity, then the foremost peopl e of the race will know that the astral plane has no true existence; they will then work free from its impression, and the task of freeing hum anity fr om the thraldom of its ow n creation will proceed apace. In the meantime a group of disciples is being slow ly bui lt up (of which this second group is a part and in which it can play an impor tant func tion, and occupy a key pos ition) , which can gradua lly aid in the task of dispelling the great illusion and can act also as a bridgi ng group so that thos e who are freeing themselves from glamour can find their way into the vor tex of influence wielded by the group , empow ered thus to work. Then three things can happ en: 1. Thos e who thus appr oach the group will find their efforts to live free from glamour greatly helped and intensified by the group assistance. 2. They will swell the num ber of thos e so working and hasten the processes of dissipation. 3. The Hierarch y will be enabled then to work more closely upon earth and to appr oach much nearer to manki nd. The third func tion of this second group lies in a more distant future. The Hierarchy has necessarily a department of workers whos e major task it is to work sole ly in the world of illusion and with astral matter. This department came into being in Atlantean days when the great cont rove rsy took place between thos e who embodi ed the cons cious ness or soul aspect of deity and thos e who were similarly"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST represen tative of the matter aspect of deity. Sym bolically speaking, the left - hand and the right - hand paths came into being; white and black magic were brought into conf lict with each other and the pairs of oppos ites (always existent in manifestation) became activ e factors in the cons cious ness of adva nced hum anity. The battle of discrimination was ope ned, and hum anity became active upon the field of Kuruks hetra. Where there is no cons cious respons e to a condi tion and no registered awareness, there is no probl em of respons ibility, as far as the soul is conc erned. In Atlantean times, this condi tion was evoke d and hence the probl em facing the race toda y; hence the task of the Hierarchy to free the soul s of men from the surround ing glamour and to enable them to achieve liberation. The culmination of the issue and the cont rove rsy, then initiated, is now upon us. The third func tion, therefore, of the group can be grasped at this time, and eventually this branch of the hierarchical effort can find due expression upon earth . From the above analysis of oppor tunity it is evident how the groups have a definite place in the plans of the Hierarchy. By developi ng spiritual sensitivity, and achieving freedom from glamour , the disciples who are members of these groups can raise the racial cons cious ness and bring in illum ination. It shoul d be remembered that it is inspiration which is the goal of all true telepathic work, and illum inat ion which is the reward of effort and the real instrum ent for the dissipation of world glamour . Thus these groups can nur ture the germ of the future culture, act also as bridgi ng uni ts, and externalise certain departmental activities of the planetary Hierarchy — the next great desire of its Members. Turning now to the work of the third group , we find our s elves conc erned with the task of the magne tic healers of the world. This has been dealt with elsewhere (Esoteric Healing) . I will here refer to one or two poi nts of more general interest, and to their threefold oppor tuni ty. It is of interest to n ote that the work of this group is perhaps one of the hardest to carry through , although from anot her angl e it is far easier than the task of most of the other groups , because the cons cious ness of the bul k of hum anity is found to be predom inantly upon the plane of illusion and therefore, as the Old Com mentary says: \"They who work to bring in light and yet are surrounde d by the maya of the senses, work from the poi nt of present being and need not to move out or in, or up or dow n. They simply stand. \" The he alers of the world upon the phys ical plane have to work upon that plane and their task is that of bringi ng through the energies of life, emanating from the soul plane, via the mind, but excludi ng the emotiona l. These energies have to be brought through int o phys ical cons cious ness and, from the phys ical level, do their necessary and magne tic work. The task of the healers, if successful, invol ves: 1. The bringi ng through of healing divine energy. 2. The exclusion of the astral world, and therefore illusion. 3. The utilisation of the healing energy in full waking cons cious ness upon the phys ical plane. Most of the healers in the world are working as follow s: 1. As pur ely phys ical healers, dealing with the vital forces of the phys ical body , and with their ow n cons cious ness pol arised in the etheric body . 2. As emotiona l astral psychics, with the cons cious ness pol arised upon the astral plane, and utilising the astral body and working in and with glamour and illusion. The effect of their work, if successful (and I woul d have you not e that \"if,\" for I deal with the idea of relative permanency) may be one of two"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST things : a. They may cure the phys ical ills in the patient which are of such a nature that the inne r astral desire (and therefore the low er desire ) has eventuated in phys ical disease, expe rienced in som e aspect or organ of the phys ical body. b. They may intensify the effect of the illusion of desire in the phys ical brain cons cious ness and cause such a violent increase of the active energies that de ath may occur before so very long. This is qui te a freque nt happe ning. Nevertheless death is a cure, remember this. Unde r these two categor ies the bul k of the world healers are found — som etimes doi ng good , oft doi ng harm, even if not realising it, and even if (as is usually the case) of good intention. There are three other categor ies of healers, how ever, to add to the two above : 3. Mental healers in the true sense of the word. Most mental healers undul y flatter themselves and work not with their minds at all. They have much mental theory and astral methods . Desire is the motivating pow er and not mental impul se. The true mental healer onl y brings about his results when he know s som ething of illum ination in the techni cal and academic sense, and of the pow er of light to dispel illusion. Disease is not an illusion; it is a definite effect of a real cause from the standpoi nt of average hum anity. When healers can work mentally, they deal with the causes of disease and not with the effects. 4. Thos e healers whos e soul cont act is established and who work through the soul s of peopl e, enabling them therefore: a. To stand in spiritual being b. To work, free from illusion c. To achieve true perspective upon the phys ical plane d. To coor dinate the persona lity and the s oul so that the will of the inne r spiritual man can work out upon the phys ical plane. 5. Thos e who can work (as is eventually intende d that this third group shoul d work) definitely as out pos ts of the cons cious ness of the Hierarchy of Masters. Th is work will be done in group formation and with a uni ted synt hesised effort. The persona l effect of such healers is therefore: a. To coor dinate the persona lity of the patient. They are themselves coor dinated. b. To bring about cont act with the soul , on the part of the patient. They are themselves vitally in cont act. c. To fuse and blend the persona lity and the soul and thus provi de an instrum ent for the distribut ion of spiritual energy. They are themselves thus fused. d. To unde rstand and use the laws of true spiritual healing through intelligent activity upon the mental plane, through freedom from glamour , and through such a right use of force that the instrum ent of the soul (the persona lity) becom es vitally magne tic. I woul d remind you that such effo rt in the early stages (and thos e stages are the present one s) results"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST inevitably in the developm ent of a critical spirit through the intelligent effort being made and the discriminative recogni tion of glamour in many cases, because onl y through such an ef fort can analysis of a right kind eventually be achieved and criticism be eliminated. In the meantime, thos e thus in training are oft a difficulty and a probl em bot h to themselves and to their friends and co - workers. But this pha se is tempor ary and leads t o a more lasting relations hip and to the emergence of that true magne tic link and love which must heal and lift and stimulate all that it may cont act. In the com ing Aqua rian Age we shall see hum anity produc ing a culture which is sensitive to the finer and highe r spiritual values, a civilisation which is free from glamour and from much of the illusion which toda y colour s the Aryan peopl es, and a racial life which will be embodi ed in thos e forms which will bridge the gap at present existing; it will be free from what we now know as disease of the worst kind, though death and certain forms of bodi ly breakdow n which may eventually end in death will, of cour se, still be prevalent. The ove rcom ing of death is not cont inge nt upon the elimination of bodi ly ills, but upon the establishing of that cont inui ty of cons cious ness which carries ove r from the phys ical plane of life to the inne r subj ective existence. Of this state of being, groups such as this third group can be the custodi an and their problem is the refore: 1. To establish that state of persona lity developm ent which will lead to magne tic living upon the phys ical plane. 2. To study the laws of life, which are the laws of health and of right relations hip. 3. To develop that cont inui ty of cons cious nes s which will \"ope n the doo rs of life and dispel the fear of the know n and of that which disappe ars.\" From the angl e of the work of the world healers, the above is a statement of oppor tuni ty. This they face as the nuc leus or one of the germs or seeds of th e new civilisation and the com ing culture. It embodi es the obj ective of all their work, and their cont ribut ion to the uni ted work of the groups . Equa lly so, they can bridge the gap at present existing in the racial cons cious ness between 1. Life and death . 2. The sick and the well. This is between a. The phys ically sick and the inw ardly well, which is the case with a few — a very few — of the adva nced peopl e, or the disciples of the world and the senior aspirants. b. The phys ically well and the psychically sick, which is som etimes the case, but of singul ar rarity. c. The phys ically sick, the psychol ogi cally sick, and the ove rshadow ing soul . This situation is often found toda y. 3. The phys ical plane and the world of soul s, because of the developm ent of a s ound instrum ent and the dissipation of thos e causes which work out as effects in the phys ical body as disease, and act as barriers to the inflow of soul energy and the entrance of soul awareness into the brain activity. This bridgi ng work, when it occurs toda y, is often simply a fortuna te but fortuitous happe ning and is"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST not the result of a cons cious ly planne d bridgi ng work. But it is the intent of the Hierarchy that the groups which will be later formed, and which are toda y in process of forming (includi ng this third group of mine) can aid in this process, if such is the will of the cons tituent parts. Finally, every initiate is a magne tic healer. This is a statement of fact. Though the members of the Hierarchy have each of Them Their dul y appoi nt ed func tions and Their planne d activity (depende nt upon Ray, upon race and upon dedication) there is one activity which They share in com mon and that is the pow er to heal. Their ability to act as magne tic healers works out in various ways, predom inantly in the realm of psychol ogi cal readjustments and psychic disentangl ements, and — onl y incidentally and as a result of the two above activities — in the processes of bodi ly healing. You will not e from the above , that the healing work done by the initiate members o f the Great White Lodge is threefold — psychol ogi cal , bringi ng in the soul ; psychic , releasing the low er psychic nature from illusion so that the psyche or soul can have full sway; phy sical , as the result of the inne r psychol ogi cal and psychic adjustments. This triple healing activity is intende d to be the objective of all groups working as this third group , the magne tic healers, shoul d work; thus will be broug ht about an emergence of hierarchical effort into out er activity. Thus you will not e, my brother, t hat the work of the first three groups just discussed, and viewing them as cons tituting one uni t, produc es a synt hetic ende avour in the three worlds, and leads from the plane of the soul to the plane of out er expression. THE WO RK OF THE SEED GROUPS Ja nua ry 1938 We have been ende avour ing to apprehend a little more intelligently the work of the new age seed groups , their interrelation and their work as part of the new age \"set - up, \" if I might employ such a term. We cons idered with som e care the three major groups . We saw that each of them had three tasks to perform and we attempted a slight analysis of their planne d unde rtakings . Now we can do the same with the remaining groups , particularly with the fourth and fifth which have educ ation and pol itical work as their projects. And then we will onl y briefly indi cate the triple intende d pur pos e of the sixth, seventh, eight h and ninth groups . We will not take time to cons ider the tenth, which will be com pos ed of the key peopl e in the other groups , bey ond stating that when its twenty - seven members (three from each group) are chos en and put in rappor t with each other, there shoul d com e to all the groups such a qui ckening of their life that they will becom e one living vibrant organism. The four th group h as ahead of it a rich and most interesting cour se of study and an illum inating obj ective. Its instructions (See Educ ation in the New Age ) will evoke more interested respons e from a larger group of readers than perhaps will be the case in the instructions o f any of the other groups , except thos e of the sixth whos e subj ect is religion in the new age, and the third (See Esoteric Healing ). I give them in the order of their impor tance. They will be more definitely popul ar and meet a more general need. The intere st which the teaching on educ ation will evoke will be ow ing to the fact that educ ation is toda y widely recogni sed as the major moul ding factor, next to econom ic pressure and circum stance, and there is a widespread interest in progr essive educ ation and in t he new ideals which shoul d — and will — eventually gove rn educ ators."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST There is a definite stirring among the masses and the life of the mind (not e that phr ase) is now more active and pot ent than ever before. For this there is an occult reason of a most interes ting nature. Thos e of you who have studi ed The Secret Doctrine will remember that in that mom entous period wherein animal - man made the great transition into the hum an family and hum anity came into being, developi ng the germ of indi vidua lity, the seed of self - cons cious ness and embryo intellect, we are told that this event was brought about in three ways: 1. The seed of mind was implanted in som e of the aspiring animal - men by the Hierarchy, and these animal men became hum an beings , of a very low o rder to be sure, but still men. They were \"sparked,\" if I might so expr ess it, and a poi nt of light appe ared where before there was none . Before there was onl y a diffused atom ic light but no central poi nt of light within the head, and no indi cation of the higher centres. These indi vidua ls, along with the more adva nced hum anity which came to the planet in Atlantean times (having indi vidua lised elsewhere), cons titute the most adva nced hum anity of our present period. They represent culture and unde rstandi ng, n o matter where it is found, or in what class or race. 2. The instinctual nature of animal - man (found active among thos e who had not reached the stage of any cons cious aspiration) was sudde nly stimulated or vitalised by the com ing into expr ession of the fi rst group and the directed attention of the Hierarchy, working unde r the ancient Law that \"energy follow s thought .\" Thus gradua lly, with a remarkable rapidity, instinct became blende d into, or resolved into, its highe r expr ession — the intellect. Thus in due cour se of time a large group of animal - men became hum an beings . They toda y represent civilisation and the masses of ordinary intelligent peopl e, educ ated unde r the mass systems of the present time, able occasiona lly to think and rise to mental emergencies , yet not highl y cultured. They cons titute the so - called general publ ic which we designa te by the words \"uppe r and low er middl e class\" peopl e, the professiona l classes and the bour geoisie everyw here. 3. At the same time there is to be found a vast num ber of peopl e who are hum an beings but who are not the result of either of these two processes. They are the produc t of the slow movi ng influences of life itself, of what we are apt to call the evol utiona ry urge, inna te in matter itself. They have p ainfully and with infinitely slow processes evol ved out of the animal condi tion into that of human beings , with an awakening cons cience, an urge to betterment, and an embryoni c mind of such a nature that it can respond to simple educ ationa l processes, when available, and is so respondi ng. They are the illiterate masses, the still savage races and the low grade human beings who are met with in their millions on our planet. The cause for the mom entous situation which calls for a re - alignm ent of our educ ation al systems and processes, and for a readjustment of our present conc epts of educ ation, is to be found in the fact that the light of know ledge and the benefits which accrue from it have penetrated to the low est grades of these slow ly evol ving peopl e; all th ree groups are now strictly hum an and not simply the first two. The highe st of them is therefore nearing the stage of demons trating that which is supe rhum an and the low est is separating itself (by almost imperceptible stages) from the animal condi tion. Thi s necessarily causes a cleavage but it is one of which the highe st group and the Hierarchy itself is cogni sant, and which they \"heal by their ow n inclusiveness.\" Forget not , that the greater can always include the lesser and thus bridge all gaps. "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST It is th e educ ation of these three groups which will be cons idered by the four th group which has as its project educ ation in the new age. Here again we touch the threefold pur pos e which each group has to hol d before itself and which in the present instance cons ist s of: 1. The educ ating of the low est of these groups into which hum anity divides itself, so that they can becom e strictly and cons cious ly hum an. This was the obj ective of the impul se which inspired the Renaissance and which lay behind the work of Rousseau , that great initiate, and this is the impulse which is toda y respons ible for mode rn Hum anism with its appa rent materialism and yet its deeply spiritual subj ective progr amme and pur pos e. This eventually produc es civilisation by the inflow of the light of k now ledge . 2. The educ ation of the second group so that it may be stimulated by the inflow of the light of wisdom and thus cons titute a bridging group between the other two, being — as it is — strictly hum an and self - cons cious . This process will make of its members cultural aspirants, with a new sense of values, with a recogni tion of spiritual obj ectives and with a develope d ability to make them the moul ders of publ ic opi nion. They will then be the most important group, expr essing the culture of the n ew age. They will set the standa rd of values for the masses. 3. The educ ation of the adva nced thinke rs, of the aspirants and world disciples in appl ied know ledge , expr essed wisdom and occult unde rstandi ng. This group synt hesises all that is available in t he other two groups and thus forms the nuc leus of the Kingdom of God, of the fifth kingdom which is so rapidly com ing into being. I cannot do more than indi cate these poi nts, for their prope r theme and their elucidation will be dealt with in the group's i nstructions . What I have stated, how ever, will serve to indi cate to you the general theme of the new educ ation and poi nt the way to som e of the cons iderations which are prom pting my handl ing of this subj ect. The work to be done (pol itical service) by the fifth group of disciples is by far the most difficult of any for it is in many ways far less adva nced. This is due to two facts: 1. The masses of men are, as yet, relatively so little evol ved that the task of this group of workers must therefore necessari ly be depende nt upon the success of the educ ationa l work of the world, as it will eventually be exemplified by the ideals and point of view of the four th group and similar groups everyw here. 2. So few truly first ray peopl e are manifesting on the planet a t this time and, when they do, their work perforce prove s destructive, ow ing to the une vol ved condi tion of the masses of men. That is why revol utions so seldom , if ever, can be carried out without bloods hed, for the intende d ideas have to be impo sed upon the masses and are not immediately recogni sed and adopt ed by thos e masses, they evoke count er respons es which arous e thos e in author ity to wrong activity. The above ideas shoul d arous e you to careful though t. Let it not be forgot ten that the obj e ctive of all true gove rnm ental cont rol is right synt hesis, leading to right nationa l and interior group activity. The problem resolves itself into a dua l one . First of all, we have the probl em of the type of author ity which shoul d be recogni sed by the peop les; and secondl y, we have the probl em of the methods which shoul d be employe d, so that the chos en author itative measures will proceed either by the method of enforced cont rol, or woul d be of such a nature that they will evoke"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST a generous ly rende red and rec ogni sed coope ration. Between these two ways of working, many change s can be rung, though the system of coope ration, willingl y rende red by an intelligent majority, has never yet been seen. But we are movi ng tow ards such a condi tion of world cons cious ness an d are on our way tow ards expe rimenting with it. Let me here briefly indi cate to you som e of the modes of gove rnm ent which have been tried out , or will be tried out in the future. 1. Governm ent by a recogni sed Spi ritual Hierarchy. This Hierarchy will be r elated to the masses of the peopl e by a chain of develope d men and wom en who will act as the intermediaries between the ruling spiritual body and a peopl e who are oriented to a world of right values. This form of world cont rol lies inde finitely ahead. When it becom es pos sible so to gove rn, the planetary Hierarchy will have made a major Appr oach to earth, and there will then be thous ands of men and wom en in touc h with Their organisation because they will be develope d enoug h to be sensitive to Its thought s an d ideas. 2. Governm ent by an oligar chy of illum ined minds , recogni sed as such by the massed thinke rs, and therefore chos en by them to rule. This they will do through the educ ation of the thinke rs of the race in group ideas and in their right app lication. The system of educ ation, then prevalent, will be utilised as the medium of reaching the masses and swingi ng them into line with the major ideas and this will be done not by force, but through right unde rstandi ng, through analysis, discussion and expe riment. Curious ly enough (from the poi nt of view of many) the spiritual Hierarchy will then work largely through the world scientists who, being by that time convi nced of the factual reality of the soul and wise in the uses of the forces of the soul an d of nature, will cons titute a linki ng body of occultists. 3. Governm ent by a true democracy . This again will be made pos sible through a right use of the systems of educ ation and by a steady training of the peopl e to recogni se the finer values, the more c orrect poi nt of view, the highe r idealism, and the spirit of synt hesis and of coope rative uni ty. Coope rative uni ty differs from an enforced uni ty in that the subj ective spirit and the obj ective form are func tioni ng tow ards one recogni sed end. Toda y, such a thing as a true democracy is unknow n, and the mass of the peopl e in the democratic count ries are as much at the mercy of the pol iticians and of the financial forces as are the peopl e unde r the rule of dictatorships, enlight ened or une nlight ened. These lat ter might be regarded as selfish idealists. But I woul d have you here not e the word \"idealist\"! When, how ever, the world has in it more truly awakened peopl e and more thinki ng men and wom en, we shall see a pur ification of the pol itical field taking place, and a cleansing of our processes of representation instituted, as well as a more exacting account ing requi red from the peopl e of thos e whom they have chos en to put in author ity. There must eventually be a closer tie - up between the educ ationa l system, the l egal system and the gove rnm ent, but it will all be directed to an effort to work out the best ideals of the thinke rs of the day. This period doe s not lie so far ahead as you might imagine, particularly if the first move in this direction is made by the New Group of World Servers. This first move invol ves a right com prehension of goodw ill. These three systems, which are the three major systems, correspond to the three major rays of synt hesis, of idealism, and of intelligence, which are onl y other names for the rays of Will or Pow er, of Love - Wisdom and of Active Intelligence. 4. Governm ent by dictatorship . This type of gove rnm ent divides itself into three parts: a. Rule by a mona rchy, limited usually toda y by the will of the peopl e, or rather by t he pol iticians of the period, but sym bol ic of the ultimate rule of the Hierarchy unde r the Kings hip of the Lord of the"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST World. b. Rule by the leader of som e democratic count ry, who is usually called a president, or by som e statesman (no matter by what name he may choos e to be called) who is freque ntly an idealist, though limited by his faulty human nature, by the period in which he lives, by his advi sors, and by the widespread corrupt ion and selfishne ss. A study of such men who have held office in this capa city, made by a fair - minde d neutral, will usually demonstrate the fact that they held office unde r the influence of som e idea, which was in itself intrinsically right (no matter how appl ied), which was forward - movi ng in its conc ept, and belonge d to the the n new age. This relates them to the second ray. c. Rule by dictators, whos e animating principle is not one of the new age ideals, emerging in their particular time, but an idealism of a more material kind — a generally recogni sed present idealism. They are not usually reactiona ry nor are they found among the intuitive workers of their age, but they take what is grounde d, settled and easily available — made so by the thinke rs of their time — and then give it a material, nationa l and selfish twist and obj ective, a nd so force it on the masses by fear, warlike means and material promises. They belong , therefore, more practically to the third ray methods of work, for they are intelligent, expe dient, and materially cons tructive. True idealism, invol ving as it must the new age patterns, and religious incentives are lacking in their techni que s. Nevertheless, they do lead the race on anot her step, for they have a mass effect in evoking thought , and som etimes eventual resistance, as the result of that thought . La ter we shall study these and other ways of gove rning, and analyse their ordinary mode rn expr essions and future spiritual corresponde nces. These will som e day appe ar on earth as a result of the many expe riments toda y goi ng on. Remember this. As I earlier s aid, the processes of educ ation, of law and of gove rnm ent are so closely allied and so definitely related that if ever the work of this fifth group reaches a stage where it is inde ed a germ of a new age organism (and many such groups will necessarily appe a r in the different count ries of the world), it will be found that they will act as a clearing hous e or a linki ng body between the educ ators of the time, thos e whos e task it is to enforce the law, and the statesmen who are chos en by the educ ated masses to f ormulate the laws whereby they shoul d be gove rned. It will be appa rent, therefore, along what three lines of study and work the members of this fifth group will proceed. These I will not further elabor ate in this place. In view of the steady progr ess tow a rds religious unity which has proceeded apace dur ing the past 150 years, the work of the sixth group (religion in the new age), as is also the case with the first group (telepathic com muni cation) prom ises rapid results. This is, how ever, necessarily depend ent upon the \"skill in action\" and the willingne ss of the group members and allied groups to proceed with slow ness and tact. The mom ent any idea enters the religious field, it gains immediate mom entum from the fact that the out standi ng character istic of the hum an cons cious ness is the sense of the Inne rmost or the Real, a recogni tion of subj ective destiny, and an inna te know ledge of and reaching out to the Unknow n God. Therefore, any truth or presentation of truth or method which has in it the pos sibility of produc ing a nearer appr oach to divinity or a more rapid unde rstandi ng of the \"deeper Being\" evoke s an immediate respons e and reaction. There is cons eque ntly much need for caution and cons idered action. I have already indi cated to you the form that the religion of the new age will take (See The"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Reappe aranc e of the Christ ). It will be bui lt aroun d the periods of the Full Moon , wherein certain great Appr oaches will be made to the world of reality, also around two periods of massed Appr oaches to be made at the time of the major eclipse of the moon and of the sun dur ing the year. The two major Full Moon Appr oaches will be thos e of the Wesak Full Moon and the Full Moon of June — one hitherto cons ecrated to the Buddha Who embodi ed the wisdom of God, and the other to the Bodhi sattva (kno wn to Christians as the Christ) Who embodi ed the love of God. The platform of the new world religion will have in it three major presentations of truth, or three major doc trines, if such an unde sirable word can be permitte d. It is with the elabor ation of these three poi nts of view, or evoc ations of truth, that the work of the sixth group of disciples will be conc erned. They are: 1. The fact of the Spirit of God, bot h transcende nt and immanent, will be demons trated, and als o a similar fact in relation to man. The mode of their appr oach to each other, via the soul , will be indi cated. This aspect of the emerging truth might be called Trans cende ntal Mysticism . 2. The fact of the divine qua lity of the Forces in nature and in ma n and the method of their utilisation for divine pur pos es by man. This might be called Trans cende ntal Occultism . 3. The fact, implied in the first, that Hum anity, as a Whol e , is an expr ession of divinity, a com plete expr ession, plus the allied f act of the divine nature and work of the planetary Hierarchy, and the mode of the Approach of these two groups , in group form, to each other. This might be called Trans cende ntal Religion. More than this I will not here indi cate as I seek to touc h briefly upon the remaining three groups . I will, how ever, poi nt out that we shall elabor ate som ewhat the Techni que of the Presence of God, appr oaching it from a new angl e, that of the Group , and also upon the Techni que of Light . Two lesser Techni que s I have at tim es called to you r attention and with these we will later deal, for they are in the nature of approaches to the other two — the Techni que of Indi fference and the Techni que of Service (See Glam our : A World Probl em). As we study the divine Appr oaches, we shall see that they invol ve two parties or two groups — thos e found on the obj ective and thos e on the subj ective side of life. The work of the seventh group, which is in the field of science, is closely allied to that of the seventh ray and is one with a most pra ctical phys ical pur pose. It is strictly magical in its techni que , and this techni que is intende d to produc e a synt hesis between the three aspects of divinity upon the phys ical plane, or between life, the solar energies and the lunar forces. This invol ves a difficult task and much unde rstandi ng; the work to be done is not easy to com prehend. It will be carried forward by first ray workers, assisted by seventh ray aspirants, but using fifth ray methods . They will thus com bine, in their personne l, the work of the destroye r of outgrow n forms, the findi ngs of the scientists who penetrated behind the out er form to its motivating energy, and the practical work of the magician who — unde r the law — creates the new forms, as expr essions of the inflow ing life. This group of disciples will make a close study of the probl em of evil, and they will bring about a better unde rstandi ng of the pur pos e existing in matter or subs tance, and the inflow ing enlight ened and different purpos e of the soul aspect. That is why (in my earlier discussion of the subj ect) I linke d the results of religion and of science toge ther; religion is conc erned with the awakening to cons cious pur pos e of the soul in man or form, whilst science is conc erned with the activity of the out er form as it lives its ow n life, yet slow ly becom es subs ervient to that pur pos e and to soul impress. This is the"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST thought cont ained in the words \"scientific service\" as used by me. The work of this group is therefore a triple one : 1. They will take the most adva nced i nferences of the workers in the field of science, and will then formulate the new hypot heses upon which the next immediate steps forward in any particular scientific field will be founde d. 2. They will avail themselves of the sensitive reactions which the new spiritual Appr oaches (as taught by the world religion of the time) will have made possible and — utilising the inferences thus made available in conne ction with the inne r world of spirit — will out line the nature of the incom ing forces which will determin e and motivate the culture of the time. 3. Taking the subs tance or material, and the spiritual inferences and the scientific hypot heses, they will formulate thos e forms of service on the phys ical plane which will precipitate with rapidity the Plan for the immediate present. They will release through this blend of scientific know ledge and intuitive idealism, thos e energies which will further hum an interests, relate the subhum an to the hum an throug h a right interplay of forces, and thus clear the way of thos e intellectual impediments which will (and always have) blocked man's appr oach to the supe rhum an world. I doubt that it will be pos sible to do much in conne ction with the forming of this group , and this for several reasons . The first is that suc h a group cannot be formed unt il a certain scientific discove ry has been made of such mom ent that our present scientific inhi bition in recogni sing the fact of the soul as a creative factor, will disappe ar. This discove ry will be part of the acknow ledge d \"f acts of science\" by the year 1975. Secondl y, A.A.B. has not the necessary scientific know ledge to do more than grasp the broader out lines of the intende d work, and then onl y primarily from the angl e of the more mystical and phi losophi cal appr oaches. Nor, m y brothers, have I. It will take a fifth or seventh ray initiate to deal with this matter, and though I coul d invoke the assistance of such a brother, it doe s not seem to me a profitable expe ndi ture of force at this time. The sigh of relief from A.A.B. as she grasps the fact that there is one less group to tackle on my and your behalf woul d almost warrant my making this a major reason! Let us now pass on to a brief indication of the work of the eight h group, which is psychol ogi cal service. In this field th e work will be lifted out of the realm of the strictly human and will conc ern itself with wider issues — for, my brothers — there are wider issues than thos e which conc ern the hum an family alone . The work of these disciples will cove r the follow ing three issue s: 1. The relation of the hum an soul to the subhum an kingdom s in nature and the place of the hum an kingdom as an intermediary between the three higher kingdom s and the three low er. 2. The qua lity of the soul in the three subhum an kingdom s, with particula r empha sis upon the animal and the vegetable kingdom s. The cons cious ness of the mineral kingdom is so far remove d from the hum an that it is not pos sible for us to formulate anything about it in words, or to identify our selves with it unt il after the expa ns ion of cons cious ness which takes place after the third initiation — that of the Transfigur ation. 3. A study of the Plan, as it appe ars at this time to be working out in the five kingdom s in nature. It will be appa rent to you that the teaching conn ected with this group will be more definitely and academically occult in its signi ficance than will be the case in the others, for it will be based upon information"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST cont ained in The Secret Doctrine and in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire . It will be founde d upon certain premises cont ained in thos e vol um es. Therefore, the members of this group of disciples will be of the more orthodox persuasion; they will be theosophi sts by nature, and academic by dispos ition. The nature of the anima mundi , the fact of the subj ec tive cons cious ness found in all forms without exception, and the existence of an interplay between these forms, through the medium of the soul , will be the major theme. Soul sensitivity and reaction to the energy in any form will be the training obj ective of the group members. Owing to the difficulty of this task, the members of this eight h group will be chos en from the personne l of the other groups , for they will have had a fair measure of training in their preliminary work. Two groups will then be interlo cking groups — that which is formed of the key peopl e in all the groups , and this one . The ninth group, whos e project is financial service, will be one of the most practical and interesting from the standpoi nt of the present world situation and mode rn condi tions . I may begin to organise this group before long, provi ded som e of my disciples show me the subj ective signs for which I look, which invol ves a right understandi ng and spiritual appr eciation of mone y. By this I do not mean that any of you who do show such signs will be in this group , but you will provi de the right condi tions which will make its inception pos sible; one or two of the key peopl e, how ever, may form part of the financial service group if the plan works out as hope d and intende d. The task t o be unde rtaken by this group is to study the signi ficance of mone y as directed and appr opr iated energy . This direction of force produ ces conc retisation, and the work is then in the field of magical ende avour . As with the work of the other groups , the task to be carried out falls into three categor ies of ende avour : 1. The effort to unde rstand the nature of prana or of vital etheric energy, and the three qua lities which distingui sh it; these are (as you well know ) inertia, activity and rhyt hm or — g iving them their Hindu names — tamas, rajas and sattva. When the mineral wealth of the world was undi scove red and unus ed, we had the stage of tamas at its deepest and most inert poi nt. Much conc erning mone y toda y is related to the karma and destiny of the mi neral kingdom . With this, how ever, we need not here conc ern our selves. The processes of the pranic life were originally carried out in the realm of barter and the exchange of that which is found upon the surface of the earth and later went dow n into the de pths, thus bringi ng into fluidity the deepest and densest expr ession (from the hum an standpoi nt) of divinity. This is a poi nt to be remembered. Toda y the process is being reversed and mone y is conne cted with the produc e of the vegetable kingdom in the for m of paper mone y, founde d upo n the mineral wealth of the world. This is an interesting subj ective reality to have in mind. 2. A study of the processes whereby mone y has been steadily deflected from persona l uses, bot h in the good and in the evil sense. I do not , how ever, intend to write a treatise upon finance. It woul d largely be a record of man's dire selfishne ss, but I seek to deal with mone y as the Hierarchy sees the probl em, and to cons ider it as a form of energy, prostituted at this time to material ends or to the selfish aspirations and ambitions of well - meaning servers. They are limited in their view and need to get a picture of the pos sibilities inhe rent in the present situation which coul d deflect much of this form of conc retised divine energy in to cons tructive channe ls and \"ways of light .\""},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST 3. A study of the Law of Suppl y and Demand, so that there can be made available for the Masters' work through the medium of the world disciples (of pur e motive and skill in action and tried respons ib ility) that which is needed, and, my brothers, sorely needed by Them. Mone y has been deflected into entirely material ends, even in its phi lanthropi c obj ectives. The most spiritual use now to be found in the world is the application of mone y to the pur pos es of educ ation. When it is turned away from the cons truction of the form side and the bringi ng about solely of material well - being of hum anity and deflected from its present channe ls into truly spiritual founda tions much good will be done , the phi lanthrop ic ends and the educ ationa l obj ectives will not suffer, and a step forward will be made. This time is not yet, but the spiritualising of mone y and its massing in qua ntities for the work of the Great Ones, the Disciples of the Christ, is part of a much need ed world service and can now make a satisfactory beginni ng; but it must be carried forward with spiritual insight , right techni que and true unde rstandi ng. Purity of motive and selflessness are taken for granted. THE IMMEDIATE TASK September 28, 1938 The Hierarchy is deeply conc erned ove r world events. I am asked to reque st you to cont inue with the goodw ill work at all costs and in the face of all obs tacles. The nuc leus already formed must be preserved. The New Group of World Servers must preserve its integrity and work undi smayed. All is not yet lost. The steadiness of thos e who know God's Plan will help hum anity and aid the efforts of the Elder Brothers. They are thos e who love and do not hate and who work for uni ty — bot h subj ective and spiritual. Thi s is all I can say at this time, for the Hierarchy itself know s not which forces will prevail. They know that good must ultimately trium ph but They do not know what the immediate future hol ds for hum anity because men determine their ow n cour ses. The Law of Cause and Effect can seldom be offset. In thos e cases where it has been offset, it has requi red the intervention of Forces greater than thos e available at this time upon the planet. Thos e greater Forces can intervene if the world aspirants make their voi ces penetrate. Will this be pos sible? The forces of destruction, militating against the Forces of good , have (to use your American phrase) \"cornered\" the mone y assets of the world and have turned the tide of prana — which autom atically crystallises into mone y and in the financial wealth of the world — tow ards entirely material, separative and persona l ends . It is not easily available, therefore, for the spread and culture of goodw ill and this appl ies equa lly to the mone y which is in the hands of aspira nts, as in the hands of thos e who are pur ely selfishly minde d. So many aspirants have not learnt to give with sacrifice. If you can reach som e of the financial abunda nce and deflect it tow ards the ends of the Great White Lodge of which the Christ is the Ma ster, it will be, at this time, one of the most cons tructive things you can do to help. In this time of stress and strain, my brothers, I would remind all aspirants and disciples that there is no need for the sense of futility or for the registration of l ittleness. The seed groups that will func tion in the new age are, at this time, in the dark and grow ing stage and in the process of expa nsion, working"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST silently. This stage is, how ever, most important for according to the healthiness of the seeds and their ability to cast strong root s dow nw ards and to penetrate slow ly and steadily upw ards into the light , so will be the adequa cy of their cont ribut ion to the new age which is upon us. I woul d empha sise that fact to you. The New Age is upon us and we are witness ing the birth pangs of the new culture and the new civilisation. This is now in progr ess. That which is old and unde sirable must go and of these unde sirable things , hatred and the spirit of separation must be the first to go. I told you before that accide nts to indi vidua ls are the result, usually, of an expl osion of force and that these expl osions are caused by the hatreds and the unki nd thought s and the critical words of thos e invol ved in the accident. The world situation toda y is not caused by the ambitions of any one person or race, or by the materialism, aggr ession and pride of any particular nation. It is not basically the result of the wrong econom ic condi tions existing in the world at this time. It is caused entirely by the widespread hatre d in the world — hatred of peopl e and of races, hatred of indi vidua ls and of thos e in pow er, or of influence, and hatred of ideas and of religious beliefs. Funda mentally, it is caused by the separative attitude s of all peopl es and races who, dow n the centuri es and also toda y, have hated each other and love d themselves. It is caused by peopl e in every count ry, who have sought to cast the blame for condi tions on everyone except themselves, and who have diligently sought for scapegoa ts whereby they may feel pers ona l immuni ty for their share in the wrong thinking, the wrong speaking and the wrong doi ng. This fact shoul d be grasped and faced by all aspirants and disciples, includi ng the members of the seed groups . They are not immune from the prevalent failings an d many of them have sought to appo rtion the blame for world condi tions and to criticise thos e who are seeking, in their ow n way and fashion, to deal with the situation. Clear thinki ng, a clear appraisal of causes and a lovi ng out goi ng to all, shoul d distin gui sh all disciples at this time.

It is time now , in the face of the difficulty and seeming inadequa cy, to begin the intende d group work, if such a beginni ng is ever to be made. Each group has been organised to fulfil a specific task. This uni ted group work h as not yet been started. That task must be begun. Group One can telepathically influence leading peopl e and speak to their minds so that they may be impressed with the need which has been described by one of the Great Ones as \"the lovi ng salvage of the wo rld.\" They must be led to realise that their policies must be determined by world good. The success that the group had in helping ... indi cated their ability to be cons tructively useful.

There are, my brothers, weakne sses to be found in all the group members. Persona lity tende ncies and errors exist and the mistakes which invol ve, primarily, a man's ow n interests and his ow n internal life; but these cons titute n o serious detriment to group work, for they can be ove rcom e or rende red entirely supe rficial with a very little effort. Impatience with the results already achieved, a feeling of smug supe riority, certain phys ical failings and persona l ambitions of a supe r ficial kind are present in several members in all of the groups . And in each group, at this time, there is one member whos e difficulties are of a more serious nature, because they cons titute a true detriment to the group life, provi ding (as they do) entran ce for forces which do, most definitely, hol d back the flow of spiritual life and prevent the work of a group nature movi ng forward to accomplishm ent. In these cases, what can I do? First of all, I must exert infinite patience and give to each p erson full time for change . This I have done — for years in som e cases, and have thereby taxed the patience of the group members who were not implicated in the particular situation and weakne ss, and who longe d to begin group work. The lesson of patience has not been lost and I woul d remind the group members that if they ever hope to have hierarchical standi ng, they must learn that love and that patience which can wait — thinki ng no evil and fostering onl y good. I made clear to you this year that a drastic reor ganisation might be in order and that the groups might have to be rearrange d som ewhat before the uni ted group work coul d be carried forward. This reorganisation seems now to me to be una voi dable. It is not final. It doe s not touc h the endu ring, unc hangi ng relation which has been established and which will persist among all of you eternally. Nothing can basically separate you. The obj ective of the work of these seed groups is to familiarise peopl e with the hierarchical Plan as it is working out toda y in thi s time of crisis. In these last three words you have the theme which is of paramount impor tance to you at this time. Is it? Your work is partly to dispel illusion, but primarily to impress the Plan upon the cons cious ness of the leading peopl e in the world. It has seemed to us that this crisis is more keenly realised by worldly peopl e than it is by world aspirants, who do have a slight vision of the obj ectives. Thos e who are not oriented to the spiritual Hierarchy and to the Path are now largely dedicated to activities of a world nature (either good or what you call bad) and this is not true of the world aspirants. They, instead of working actively to bring about the accom plishm ent of the ends indi cated by the Plan (which are of a spiritual nature and uni fyin g in their effect, breeding not hatred and separativeness, but world unde rstandi ng and fusion) spend their time in speculation, in criticism of the various world leaders and in fearful forebodi ng — none of which is in the least helpful and, in the last analy sis, is definitely harmful. This harmfulness is due to a pow erfully directed thought form, cons tructed by men and wom en of a certain aptitude in spiritual adva ncement. The respons ibility of thought is little grasped as yet by thos e who are num ber ed among the world aspirants; yet their thought - making activity is now either definitely cons tructive or pot entially destructive. I hesitate to enlarge upon this theme, owing to the proba ble persona lity reactions which thos e who read these words may genera te. I am, therefore, speaking here of the world in general and not so specifically of the world aspirants and pledged workers. SECTION TWO"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST THE GENERAL WO RLD PICTURE THE CAUSES OF THE WO RLD DIFFICULTY September 1938 In giving these Instructions I am anxi ous for you clearly to com prehend the end I have in view. Sincere stude nts and disciples must hol d ever before them the idea of Service; in conne ction with our present theme this is pol itical service — al ong the line of world planni ng and world gove rnm ent. This teaching will carry to the general publ ic som e idea of the trend of hum an destiny where nations and larger groups are conc erned, and shoul d give a convi ction of hierarchical pot ency and a sense of i llum ination. It will, how ever, do this far more easily if the ideas I attempt to conve y are backed by the unde rstandi ng thought , and the intelligent mental coope ration of a group of peopl e who have ponde red deeply on the theme. What is our theme? A study and an analysis, from the esoteric angl e , of the social organisation of hum anity. I seek to have you grasp som e of the universal implications which the signs of the times por tray and not be entirely engr ossed with the immediate situation or dilemma; too cl ose a perception and too near a poi nt of view doe s not tend to true unde rstandi ng. It fails, for one thing, to indi cate the particular place in the general world picture which the immediate happe nings out line. It is a platitude and a truism to state that humanity is toda y passing through a crisis of immense propor tions . The causes of this crisis must be soug ht in many factors. They lie in the past; in the grow th, through evol ution, of certain basic tende ncies in man; in past mistakes, present opp ortunities, and the pow erful activity of the Hierarchy of Love . The future is of great prom ise, provi ded man can learn the lessons of the present which have been closely presented to him; he must accept them and unde rstand clearly the nature of his probl em and of the crisis with its many ramifications and various implications . The seething turmoil in which the masses of the peopl e are now living and the emergence of one or two key peopl e in every nation have a close relations hip. These key peopl e make thei r voi ces heard and evoke attention; their ideas are follow ed, right ly or wrongl y, with attention, appr eciation or distrust. The slow and careful formation of the New Group of World Servers is indicative of the crisis. They are ove rseeing or ushering in the New Age, and are present at the birthpa ngs of the new civilisation, and the com ing into manifestation of a new race, a new culture and a new world out look . The work is necessarily slow and thos e of you who are immersed in the probl ems and the pains, find it hard to view the future with assurance or to interpret the present with clarity. I have listed som e of the reasons for the present world unr est in anot her book ( Educ ation in the New Age , pp. 116 - 125) remindi ng you that som e of the causes lie in so remo te a past that history know s not hing of them.

It gives the clue to all that is happe ning toda y in the world of pol itics and internationa l gov ernm ent s, and account s for the trend tow ard synt hesis, amalgamation and affiliation.

This period of judgm ent is a group interl ude to the full emergence of the New Age influences. 6. The levelling of all classes and distinctions so that the spiritual values may appe ar and the spiritual Hierarchy manifest on earth. 7. The fact of the Appr oach of the Hierarchy tow ards external con tact with hum anity. I woul d sugge st that you read my earlier writings on the Great Approaches. 4 Esoteric Psychol ogy (Vol. II A Treatise on the Seven Rays ), pages 268 - 283, 701 - 751. * 8. The pow er and signi ficance, pol itically cons idered, of the Great Invoc a tion. THE HIDDEN SOURCE OF THE OUTER TURMOIL Janua ry 1939 Anot her angl e from which the world situation can be viewed with profit is to look for the hidde n sour ce of the out er turmoil. This is seldom what men think it is, for the sour ce lies in the re alm of energies and forces. As I expl ained elsewhere ( The Destiny of the Nations , pages 3 - 47) , there are three great streams of energy working pow erfully in the world at this time and two others are also struggl ing for expr ession, making the five that — toge ther — will determine the trend of world affairs. To repeat briefly: 1. The first and the most pow erful force is that pou ring into the world from Sham bal la , the planetary centre where the Will of God is know n. Only twice in our planetary history h as this Shamballa energy made its presence felt directly : the first time, when the great hum an crisis occurred at the indi vidua lisation of man in ancient Lemuria; the second time, in Atlantean days in the great struggl e between the Lords of Light and the L ords of Material Form, also called the Dark Forces. Toda y, this force streams out from the Holy Centre; it embodi es the Will aspect of the present world crisis and its two subs idiary effects or qua lities are: "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST a. The destruction of that which is unde sirabl e and hinde ring in the present world forms (in gove rnm ent, religion and society). b. The synt hesising force which binds toge ther that which has hitherto been separated. The Shamballa force is so new and so unr ecogni sed that it is hard for hum anity to kno w it for what it is — the demons tration of the beneficent Will of God in new and pot ent livingne ss. 2. The second major force which is pot ently making itself felt toda y is that of the spiritual Hierarchy , the planetary centre where the Love of God hol ds swa y, as it swings into one of its major cyclic appr oaches to the earth. The probl em before the Hierarchy at this time is so to direct and cont rol all five of the pow erful energies that the Divine Plan can materialise, and the close of this century see the Pu rpos e of God for hum anity assum ing right direction and propo rtion. 3. Hum ani ty itself is the third major planetary centre through which one of the three divine aspects, Intelligence, is expr essing itself, produc ing its world effects. These three centres are closely interrelated and must be thought of as expr essions of divine livingne ss, as embodyi ng three stages in the unfoldm ent of God's Plan, and as cons tituting the three major centres — Head, Heart, Throat — in the body of the One in Whom we live and move and have our being. Stude nts can relate these three centres to the three solar systems, referred to in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire . In the first solar system, the centre which is Hum anity was prepared and the principle of intelligence came into man ifestation. In the second solar system, the Hierarchy of Love made its appe arance and must com e into full manifestation, thereby enabling the love of God to be seen. In the next solar system, the centre which we toda y call Shamballa, will manifest the Will aspect of Deity intelligently through love . It is interesting to not e that it is onl y through hum an beings , that these three centres ever com e into true func tioni ng activity; and likewise that the three major ideologi es (the totalitarian, the democratic, the com muni stic) may be the respons e — distorted and yet respons ive — to the forces playing from the two highe r centres on to the hum an. This we discussed earlier ( The Destiny of the Nations , page 22) . Thos e of you who are seeking to serve hum anity and to joi n in the Hierarchical effort to bring healing to a world in pain, must learn to penetrate behind appe arances, behind the methods and schemes, the results and effects on the phys ical plane and ende avour to cont act the forces of Shamballa or of the Hierarchy , plus the hum an need which has produc ed these mode s of expr ession and thus see them for what they are — not worn out systems and childish efforts at improve ment but embryoni c plans whereby, eventually, may com e release and the culture and civilisation of th e New Age. If you are seeking to bring illum ination into the dark places of the earth (which means into the minds of men), then you must you rselves see clearly and relate the abstract and the conc rete in such a manne r that, in your ow n lives, a working ide alism may be seen; only so can a working idealism of a nationa l, racial and hum an nature also be seen. The head as well as the heart must be used, and this many earnest peopl e are apt to forget. Can you pos sibly work at high tension in this ende avour — a ten sion produc ed by the interrelation of the head and the heart, working out creatively through the throat centre, esoterically unde rstood? In this last sentence I have expr essed for disciples the nature of the effort they need to make. It is in th e recogni tion of what is happe ning to mankind as a whol e and behind the scenes, that the thinke rs of the world and the New Group of World Servers can best serve; it is the unf oldm ent of the"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST hum an cons cious ness in respons e to the presented condi tions in any count ry or count ries that is of mom ent; the \"hum an state of mind\" is just beginni ng to focus itself on the things that matter and to expr ess itself in a living fashion. The thinke rs and servers must learn to conc entrate upon the awakening cons cious ness an d not upon the supe rficial move ments. This awakening goe s on apace and, my brothers, satisfactorily. The form or forms may suffer but the intrinsic awareness of man is becom ing, dur ing this century, expr essively divine. The two other forces which tend to increase the already prevalent tension in the world are: 4. The forces of materialism, streaming out into the three worlds from the so - called \"Dark Forces\" or Black Lodge , and from thos e groups of lives and workers which are the antithesis of the Great Wh ite Lodge . 5. The force emanating from that section of humanity which is found in every part of the world and which we call the Jewish peopl e. What I say here has no specific reference to any indi vidua l; I am cons idering the world probl em, centering aroun d the Jews as a whol e. These two forces greatly com plicate the probl em by which hum anity and the Hierarchy are faced, but it shoul d be remembered that they also produc e that balancing which is ever needed for the produc tion of right condi tions . There is little that I can tell you about the Dark Forces. They are not the probl ems of hum anity but that of the Hierarchy. The task of these Forces is the preservation of the form life and the working out of methods and aims which are inhe rent in the processes of manifestation. The Black Lodge , so - called, is occupi ed with the form aspect of manifestation; the White Lodge , with the cons cious ness aspect. It might , therefore, be stated that: 1. Shamballa is occupi ed with the life aspect in its graded impul s es. 2. The Hierarchy is occupi ed with the cons cious ness aspect in its graded series of expa nsions . 3. The Black Lodge is occupi ed with the matter aspect in its multiplicity of forms. Again, light may com e to you, if you relate this triple statement to t he three solar systems and to the three aspects of divinity. Evil or wrong , therefore, exists onl y when the empha sis is retained in the wrong aspect from the poi nt of view of the unfoldment attained or when that which has been used and develope d to the nec essary poi nt, hol ds the life or cons cious ness too long. Hence, my brothers, the beneficent nature of death. The Forces of Darkne ss are pow erful energies, working to preserve that which is ancient and material; hence they are pre - eminently the forces of cr ystallisation, of form preservation, of the attractiveness of matter, and of the lure of that which is existent in the form life of the three worlds. They cons eque ntly block deliberately the inflow of that which is new and life - giving; they work to prevent the unde rstandi ng of that which is of the New Age; they ende avour to preserve that which is familiar and old, to count eract the effects of the onc om ing culture and civilisation, to bring blindne ss to the peopl es and to feed steadily the existing fires of hate, of separateness, of criticism and of cruelty. These forces, as far as the intelligent peopl es of the world are concerned, work insidious ly and cloak their effort in fair words, leading even disciples to expr ess hatred of persons and ideologi es, foste ring the hidde n"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST seeds of hatred found in many hum an beings . They fan to fury the fear and hate of the world in an effort to preserve that which is old and make the unknow n appe ar unde sirable, and they hol d back the forces of evol ution and of progress for t heir ow n ends . These ends are as inscrutable to you as are the plans of the Ruler of Shamballa. These are forces which it is well for you to recogni se as existing, but there is little that you , as indi vidua ls or as groups , can do about them beyo nd seeing to it that there is not hing in you which could make you — uni mpor tant as you are — a focal poi nt for their efforts or an agent for the distribut ion of their peculiar type of energy — the energy of focussed and directed hate, of separation, of fear and pride. With them we who are conne cted directly with the Hierarchy have to deal, but you can aid more than you know through the regul ation of thought s and ideas, through the cultivation of a lovi ng spirit and through the general use of the Great Invoc ation. We com e now , for a brief mom ent, to a cons ideration of the Jewish que stion. Remember that it is an interesting fact that the Jews are found in every land without exception, that their influence is pot ent and widespread (far more so than they themselves a re willing to recogni se), and that they wield most pot ently that peculiar conc retisation of energy which we call mone y. They cons titute, in a strange manne r, a unique and distinctly separated world centre of energy. The reason for this is that they represe nt the energy and the life of the previous solar system. You have often been told how , at the close of this solar system, a certain percentage of the hum an family will fail to make the grade and will then be held in pralaya, or in solution, unt il the time for the manifestation of the next and third solar system com es around. Then they will cons titute the adva nced gua rd and the sym bol of the com ing hum anity of that system. The same thing occurred in the system before this one and thos e whom we now call the J ews (a purely mode rn name and distinction, as I tried to show in the last few pages of A Treatise on the Seven Rays , Vol. I, Esoteric Psychol ogy ), are the descenda nts of that earlier group which was held in pralaya between the first and second solar system s. If you will remember that the third ray gove rned that system and also gove rns the Jewish race, if you bear in mind that that system was occupi ed with the divine aspects of matter onl y and with external condi tions , and that the Jews were the hi ghe st produc t of that system you can come to an unde rstandi ng of the Jew, his separateness, his desire for racial pur ity and his interest in that which is com mercial and tangi ble. The Jew, dow n the ages, has insisted upon being separated from all other rac es but he brought ove r from the previous system the know ledge (necessary then but obs olete now ) that his race was the \"chos en peopl e.\" The \"Wande ring Jew\" has wande red from System One to this where he must learn the lesson of absorption and cease his wande ring. He has insisted upon racial pur ity, for that was his major probl em in early Lemurian times when the race came into a world that had in it no hum an beings , for it was before the com ing of the Lords of Flame; this insistence has been carried dow n the a ges and has gove rned the rules of marriage and the preparation of food instead of being droppe d (as it shoul d have been) thous ands of years ago. It is these facts (unknow n to the mode rn Jew) which has militated against him dow n the years and made it pos sib le for the forces of separativeness and of hate, to use the Jewish race to stir up world difficulty, and thus bring to a crisis the basic hum an probl em of separation. When hum anity has solved the Jewish probl em (with the unde rstandi ng coope ration of the Je w) and ove rcom e ancient antipathies and hatreds, it will do so by fusing the problem in one vast hum anitarian situation. When that happe ns, the probl em will be rapidly solved and one of the major difficulties will disappe ar off the face of the earth. Racia l fusion will then be pos sible. Our earth humanity and the group of hum an beings who are far more ancient in their origin than we are, will form one hum anity and then there will be peace on earth. Why our planet and this solar system shoul d have been cons tituted the nur sery for the seeds of"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST separativeness and why this remnant of hum anity, far more adva nced than our s, shoul d have been destined to work out its future on our earth, is hid in the know ledge of the Lord of Shamballa, and is una ttainable know ledg e for you and, inde ed, for many in the Hierarchy. It is simply a fact to be accepted by you. The solution will com e, as I said, when the races regard the Jewish probl em as a hum anitarian probl em but also when the Jew doe s his share of unde rstandi ng, love and right action. This he doe s not yet do, speaking racially. He must let go of his ow n separative tende ncies and of his deep sense of persecution. He will do this latter with great facility, when he grasps, as a race, the signi ficance and inevita bility of the Law of Karma, and from a close study of the Old Testament and of the acts and deeds there claimed by him as his racial acts and deeds (conque st, terrorism and cruelty), realises that the law is working out and incidentally releasing him for a greater future. There must, at the same time, be a realisation by the Jew and Gentile of equa l respons ibility and equa l liability for the present world difficulty. The two forces to which I have been referring must, therefore, be taken into account by al l disciples as they seek to serve in this critical cycle; these two forces must also be taken into your calculations as you start this new group work or your wrong idealisms and thought s may hinde r the group work. You must recogni se theoretically the five forces (three major and two minor ) which meet and clash in the hum an family at this time. It has been necessary for me to bring these facts to you r attention. If disciples are to do group work toge ther on mental levels, they must clear their minds of preju dice, hatreds and any tende ncy to supe riority and criticism. You cannot work, as a group, if these ideas and thought s are present, and I am preparing now to teach you som e of the first stages of group work and usefulness. It woul d not have been necessary f or me to deal with these world probl ems if you had been immune from emotiona l reactions to them, but very few of you have your minds clear from prejudi ce and free from hatred. Thos e few make the work possible and it is also pos sible for the rest of you to detach your minds from undue influence and wrong ideas. I ask you, in this work, to conc entrate upon the Shamballa and the Hierarchical forces. I ask you to regard your selves as pur e and unc logge d channe ls and to seek onl y to be linke d with the soul of each and all, whos e nature is pur e love , realised synt hesis and divine pot ency. It is essential, how ever, in spite of the work to which I have called these groups and which — as you know — is intende d to lay the basis for the work of the esoteric scho ols of the future, that the members of all the groups realise that exot eric group work must also be unde rtaken. Too many in these group s are satisfied with the signi ficance of their ow n group work and permit it to usurp the place of obj ective service. If it is so hard, my brothers, to arous e aspirants, such as your selves, to urgent service and a full sense of respons ibility; if men and wom en with all the information that you pos sess cannot be arous ed to sacrificing effort, you can gain som e idea of the mag nitude of the task with which the Hierarchy is conf ront ed at this time. You can realise, perhaps, the sense almost of frustration which coul d sweep ove r me (if I were limited by any time conc ept) when, for instance, thos e to whom I look for coope ration, ar e preoccupi ed with their ow n affairs, have no sense of immediacy and prefer to conc entrate upon their ow n developm ent, their ow n families, their ow n probl ems, rather than achieve the larger world view which woul d lead to full cooperation. The averting of a world debacle is the aim of our effort and tow ards this aim I have asked you r help.

The first thing, therefore, of which I woul d like to remind you is that The Hierarchy stands . Behind all that is goi ng on toda y, the same group of spiritual Forces and the same Elder Brothers and Masters are to be found as heretofore, gui ding hum anity along the path of life and bringi ng us safely and satisfactorily to our present poi nt of developm ent. The Buddha , Whos e festival we are celebrating, and the Christ, Who expr esses to us the unc hangi ng love of God, are still with us, and the Hierarchy stands as a bul wark of strengt h between us and pos sible disaster; this centre of spiritual life is \"like the shadow of a great rock in a weary land\" . The second thing I woul d have you al l remember is that manki nd has marched steadily forward from a state of blind ignor ance and una wareness to one of an intelligent preoccupa tion with life and a grow ing sense of respons ibility. This sense of respons ibility, which is awakening in all of you , is — on its present large scale — relatively new and is one of the factors definitely increasing the distress and pain you are all feeling. You ask your selves, where, as a race, have we failed and what can we do to rectify our mistakes? In spite of everything, how ever, men have gone from stage to stage of intelligent and spiritual unf oldm ent and no matter what the out er happe nings have been or may be, the race has made real progr ess. There has been no turning back, and there will be none . Manki nd has weathered many storms and survived many difficulties; men have emerged from periods of crisis better and stronge r, pur ified \"so as by fire\" and definitely nearer the goal. I woul d remind you also of the integrity and solidarity of the hum an family. We are one peopl e — one in our relations hips, and capacities and desires, our origin and our goa l. It is this essential and recogni sable integrity which is emerging at this time pow erfully in the hum an cons cious ness. You are apt to think that this may not be so, that your p osition in believing this is som ewhat uni que and that you stand som ewhat alone . But this is you r error and is not true to the facts of the case. In every land and among widely differing peopl es, the same desire exists for unde rstandi ng, for the establishin g of right and peaceful relations , and for the expr ession of that basic goodw ill which is one of the deepest hum an characteristics and our divine inhe ritance. These are the things which, it seems to me, are impor tant at this time, and which all of us woul d do well to remember. Will you try to do so? No matter what may take place in the world — whether war or peace, strife and aggression or unde rstandi ng conc iliation and conf erence — we face a difficult period of adjustment, and for this we must be pr epared. The next three years are critical, and this we have often been told. Much will depend upon what you and all men of goodw ill and disciples think and what they do. I woul d like to remind you of anot her most encour aging thing, and that is that the po wer wielded by thos e who are seeking to live as soul s and in touc h with the soul and the world of spiritual realities is out of all propo rtion to their registered sense of power and usefulness. You are, as you ende avour to wield spiritual force cons tructiv ely and selflessly, far more potent than you realise.

If this is a statement of fact (and I believe it to be so) then let us go forward in uni son with our brothe rs everyw here, cons cious of oppor tuni ty, of strengt h, of respons ibility and of the joy of service. As regards som e of the things which you can do, I woul d sugge st the follow ing.

Strive to stand in spiritual being. Each morning, in you r meditation, seek to take that attitude with a new and fresh definiteness and to hol d it dur ing the hou rs of service which lie ahead each day. This will not be an easy thing to do, but it can be done if you can get qui et enough for five minut es each morning — com pletely and interiorly qui et — and if you fill your days with vital occupa tion and true service, gua rding with care all thought and speech. Between now and the Wesak Festival in 1940 let each of you gain that cont rol of speech which has often been your goa l but seldom your achievement, and remember that the most pow erful factor in the c ont rol of speech is a lovi ng heart. Wild and fearful talk, hateful gos sip, cruel innue ndo , suspicion, the ascribing of wrong and wicked motives to persons and peopl es, and the divergences of attitude which have separated the many different nations in the w orld are rampant toda y and have brough t the world to its present distressing situation. It is so easy to drift into the same habits of speech and though t which we find around us and to discove r our selves participating in attack and the spirit of hate. Guar d your selves strenuous ly against this and say not hing which coul d inflame hate and suspicion in conne ction with any race, any person, any group or any leaders of groups and nations . You will have to gua rd your selves with care, so that even in defense of th at which you may persona lly or nationa lly appr ove you do not find your selves full of hate and breaking the law of love — the onl y law which can truly save the world. Perhaps the key to you r success along this line will be the silence of a loving heart. It w ill be good also to cultivate the joy that brings strengt h. This is not the time for gloom , despair or depression. If you give way to these, you becom e negative and destructive focal poi nts in your envi ronm ent. If you truly believe that the spiritual life is funda mental in the world toda y, if you do believe that divinity gui des the world, if you truly grasp the fact that all men are you r brothers and that we are all the children of the One Father, and if you are convi nced that the heart of humanity is sound — are these not adequa tely pot ent ideas to hold us joyous ly steady in the midst of a changi ng world? Will you, therefore, carry with you the follow ing ideas? First, that the Hierarchy of spiritual Forces stands in spiritual Being. Second, that we too can stand steady in spiritual Being. Third, that the silence of a lovi ng heart shoul d be our keynot e for the com ing year. Four th, that strengt h to stand is the result of a joyo us attitude and a true orientation to the soul .

(I woul d remind you that there woul d be no darkne ss without t he light and no light without the dark. Ponde r on this.) I woul d ask you to realise that the organised efforts of the Great White Lodge are directed tow ard lifting the organised forces of materialism to a highe r and spiritual plane. Toda y, gol d and separat iveness, materialism and selfishne ss are in conf lict with spiritual energy and with the spirit of coope ration or unde rstandi ng fusion. The law which will determine the results can be expr essed in the words that have been often used: by hol ding, man loses; by relinqui shing, he gains; by seeking to grasp that which he has, it must and will inevitably disappe ar. Reflect upon this law. The method whereby the forces of separation and of selfishne ss work are by com petitive coope ration. Throughout the world, grou ps are already formed (or are in process of forming) to bring about the attainm ent of various materialistic goa ls, the achievement of persona l or nationa l ambitions , and the impos ition of intellectual plans and conc epts (the so - called ideologi es) upon the mass of the peopl e. Parties, organisations , groups , societies, associations and alliances exist for the furtherance of political and sociologi cal aims and to carry forward the projects of many peopl es and the many and differing poi nts of view, plus the man y attitude s tow ard life and its arrange ment and re - arrange ment. I am not here dealing with the chur ches, the great religions or the religious organisations . I am conc erned with the determining factors which are toda y condi tioni ng the material lif e of the planet. Speaking broadly, these forces and groups are occupi ed with material values and mental ideas. They are not principally occupi ed with the more subt le values, though these are incidentally present. The empha sis is upon the econom ic situation ; upon the pos session of land or cultural predispos itions and tende ncies and with the relations between peopl e and nations ; these latter are based funda mentally, as you know , on that which is tangi ble and obj ective, gua rded, defende d or gained and procured by definitely tangi ble means which are in themselves separative and divided. This statement, I think, the peopl e of every nation woul d regard as true. The basic unde rlying methods employe d are thos e of organisationa l arrange ment (large, as in nations , or smaller, as in the groups within the nations ), propa ganda , the impos ition of favour ed ideas through the use of the spoke n and written word in every count ry, group loya lty, group adhe rence to the leader, and group methods . Success depends upon the gained gr oup cohe sion, the group willingne ss to sacrifice, plus loya lty and allegiance to som e directing persona lity. Behind these many groups stand the forces of ancient origin which are pledge d either to the material or the spiritual values. Because many ages ha ve gone by in the bui lding up of the material values, to the developm ent of the persona lity cons cious ness, and to the achievement of a tangi ble and obj ective civilisation, the forces of materialism are appa rently far stronge r and more pot ent than the force s of the spirit or of the intangi ble worlds. Up to the present this has not been wrong, though it has been accom panied by much that has been unde sirable and which has led to a one - sided evol ution. But the time has now com e for the shift of the hum an cons ci ous ness into the world of true and spiritual unde rstandi ng and of the intangi ble and more desirable standa rds of living.

At this poi nt I woul d remind you that the effect of t he impac t of energy is depende nt upon the nat ure of the vehicle of respons e . According to his equi pm ent and the nature of his bodi es, so will man react to the inflow ing energies. This is a funda mental statement. It is a law and shoul d be most carefully con sidered. The effects of a Master or initiate upon men are widely different, because each man brings to the impact of His vibration a type of phys ical body, an astral or emotiona l nature, and a mind which are in each case different from all the others. The use each makes of the stimulating energy will be different; the focus of his cons cious ness is very different; his type of mind is qui te different; his centres, their activity and their internal organisation are different. And it is the same for groups , org anisations and nations . Nations , for instance, have seven centres, as have all forms of existence from the hum an and animal upw ards, and it is an interesting study to discove r these centres and not e the type of energy which flows through them. In conne cti on with the United States of America, Chicago is the solar plexus centre, whilst New York is the throat centre and Washingt on the head centre. The heart centre is Los Ange les. The heart centre of Germany is Muni ch, and its head centre is Nuremberg, whilst Berlin is the throat centre. London is, of course, the heart centre for Great Britain (and tempor arily it is also the head centre, though this will not always be the case), whilst Ottawa is the throat centre and Sydne y is the solar plexus centre of the Bri tish Empire. Some day I may indi cate to you the centres through which the forces of manifestation have to work for the various nations . This information cons titutes one of the major hierarchical sciences and indi cates to us who know it the pos sibilities la tent in any nation, the poi nt of attainm ent and the oppor tuni ties for work and adva ncement, or the obs tacles to progr ess; this is gauge d by the light in the centres and the height ening and the obs curation of their vibration. It is this that makes pos sible or hinde rs the grow th of what is called spirituality in indi vidua ls and in nations , and this science will later be recogni sed. It is by means of this science that the Hierarchy can form its larger plans and know in what manne r indi vidua l nations will react to stimulation and to progr ess of the desired kind. This is the mode rn form of the ancient Atlantean laya - yoga , or the yoga of the centres. According, therefore, to the condi tion of the sensitive bodi es of the planet, of nations and of indi vidu als, so will be their reaction to the five kinds of inflow ing forces. The Shamballa force, for instance, in making its impact upon first ray type s, and upon the other ray type s on that line of major energy — the third, fifth and seventh ray type s — evoke s wide ly differing results than when it makes an impact upon the second ray line of energy; the results of the impact of Shamballa energy upon the first ray indi vidua ls and nations can be pot ent in the extreme. This impact, being relatively a new one to hum anity , evoke s in the world toda y all the pol itical and organisationa l change s which are so prevalent and so disturbing. There is little that hum anity can do about this except ende avour to balance this first ray display of energy with second ray or hierarchical force. This latter energy — working through the world religions and the men and wom en who respond to the love influence — can change methods (though not the pur pos e or the direction) by pou ring in the love force. Again, that force which we regard as emanating from the strictly hum an centre, the third ray type of energy, is of the third or creative order; and in these three energies you have, in reality, the expression of the three major centres of the planetary Logos . The first or will energy is, as you know , focussed in Sanat Kum ara, the Ancient of Days (as He is called in the Christian Bible), the Lord of Shamballa, Who is the embodi ment of the Persona lity of the planetary Logos . The love force is focussed through"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST the two great spiritual Lords of the Hierarch y, the Buddha and the Christ, Who are bot h embodi ments of the heart centre of the planetary Logos , for the Buddha represents the twelve - petalled lotus in the head, of which the Christ represents the count erpart, the twelve - petalled lotus of the h eart centre. This is a fact seldom grasped or even mentione d. The petals of the throat centre are represented at this time by certain of the leading world rulers, whos e activity is respons ible for the rapid creation of the new world with its rapidly alteri ng civilisations and culture. These thought s will provi de much that you woul d do well to cons ider. The four th type of force, which is respons ible for the state of world affairs at this time, is that of the Jews; they, as a whol e, cons titute the solar plex us of the planetary Logos ; their probl em is being used toda y to focus, qua lify and condi tion the world feeling - nature and the emotiona l reactions of the sensitive nature of hum anity and of the planetary Logos . Forget not that the Persona lity of our planeta ry Logos is not yet perfect, hence the fact that His body of manifestation, the planet, is not reckone d as being one of the sacred planets. Through the Jewish peopl e throughout the world, feeling — sym pathetic or antagoni stic, expressive of love or condi tion ed by hate — is being gathered to a focus in the planetary solar plexus centre, preparatory to a great and permanent change . It is for this reason that I have said to som e of my pupi ls that when hum anity will have solved correctly the Jewish probl em, and whe n it has been resolved in a hum anitarian and sound manne r, then the energy of the planetary solar plexus centre will have been raised to the heart and a great transmutation will have taken place. The Dark or Materialistic Forces correspond in their entire ty to the energies of the sacral centre of the planet, dealing with the generation of forms, and their work is to keep the direction of planetary interest upon the form side of divine expr ession. They are conc erned with the life of matter itself, with its magical usage, and with that which is regarded as dark because, for hum anity at its present stage of developm ent, that divine aspect shoul d have lost its major hol d and shoul d lie behind \"in the darkne ss of that which has been out grow n and which has no further hol d upon the son of God\" . You therefore have the follow ing tabul ation expr essing what I have sought above to make clear to you. I woul d poi nt out here that the four th energy, focussed in the Jewish probl em, is definitely produc ing cleavage as a part of the divine plan. The Jews are instrum ents in the working out of the Plan for the produc tion of certain synt heses and to bring hum anity to certain realisations and decisions . A close study of this tabul ation will bring you much of kno wledge . H ow ever, it onl y expr esses the present situat ion in this interim period between the old Piscean age which is passing and the new Aqua rian age which is com ing in. It depicts this present world cycle. The empha sis of the rays change s in conne ction with the la st two type s of energy expr essions qui te cons tantly, because they are sym bol ic (in this day and age) of the persona lity nature in its phys ical and emotiona l forms. I wonde r whether you can grasp the implications of this paragraph. When the mind aspect (th e third aspect of the persona lity) is more fully develope d, then the focus of the effort of the Dark Forces will change and the probl em of the Jews will disappe ar. Manki nd is not yet handl ing its probl ems intelligently. Thus the forces and energies of the creative process are exceedingl y active at this time in preparing what I might call the \"material of the world\" and the subs tance of all the four kingdom s in nature for the com ing change s. As the ploughm an turns the soil of his field and harrow s it, and so brings that which is unde rneath to eventual fruition, so a similar process is taking place in the world toda y, and all is preparatory for the sow ing and its resultant effects. These effects will cons titute the new Aqua rian culture and civilisation.

There are of cour se several meanings to these ancient wri tings . I have referred above to the five streams of energy and have related them to the five centres. Let me extend the idea som ewhat by poi nting out that these five energies are related to the centres or the lotuses to which I referred in A Treatise on C osmic Fire , or to the dyna mic poi nt within the lotus, through which the central life of the lotus flow s; in the case of the first three energies (of Shamballa, the Hierarchy and Hum anity) you have the permanent poi nt of life, light and activity in the lotu s; in the case of that pot ent energy conne cted with the Jews, you have a very tempor ary inflow of energy, and in the case of the Forces of Materialism, you have a relatively tempor ary — though appa rently permanent — focal poi nt of reactiona ry energy. In conne ction with the petals of the lotus, you will find a close conne ction with the forces of the five kingdom s in nature; therefore, to the tabul ation which was earlier given I woul d add the follow ing for your cons ideration: 1. 5th Kingdom ------- Intuitio n --------------- spiritual soul ------------------- head centre 2. 4th Kingdom ------- Intelligence ------------ hum an soul -------------------- throat centre 3. 3rd Kingdom ------- Instinct ----------------- animal soul -------------------- solar plexus 4. 2nd Kingdom ------- Sentiency -------------- feeling cons cious ness -------- heart centre 5. 1st Kingdom -------- Respons e -------------- sub - cons cious ness ------------ base of spine To this you may add the follow ing: 1.

The mineral kingdom and the Forces of Materialism do not really coincide today, for the one works through the sacral centre at this time, and the oth er through the centre at the base of the spine. Esoteric stude nts must always remember that no corresponde nces are correct and entirely accurate in their parallelism in this solar system of changi ng forces, shifting cycles and constant mutation directed to wards the inscrutable ends of Deity — inscrutable as far as the hum an cons cious ness is conc erned. They remain inscrutable to hum anity, because the three major ends or pur pos es which affect you , for instance, as members of the four th kingdo m in nature are: 1 . The direction in which the solar Logos is goi ng upon the Cosmic Path. Esoterically . . . . . . The Way tow ards the Central Spiritual Sun. 2. The plans of the planetary Logos upon the Systemic Path. Esoterically . . . . . . The Way tow ards the Heart of the Sun. 3. The pur pos e ahead for the hum an family upon the Path of Light . Esoterically . . . . . . The Way of the Sun. I put this in here onl y to show you how vague and unc ertain are your very highe st speculations . Be cont ent with your dut y and the im mediate service which will lead you a step further upon the way to which you are ordained, and this way you can travel rapidly and with eager feet or slow ly and with laggi ng steps. The above enum erated forces are, how ever, part of the tempor ary interlocki ng of energies which is goi ng on between the many expr essions of the creative process at this time. They are likewise condi tione d by the incom ing Aqua rian force and \"measured\" by the out goi ng Piscean forces. I woul d have you not e here my use of t he word \"forces\" and \"force,\" for not idly have I made them singul ar and plural. In this process of foundi ng the kingdom of heaven upon earth, the same procedur e is being follow ed as was used in the earlier stage of found ing the four th kingdom . The \"seven men, each on his ow n lot,\" reach a mom ent of tension and of creative pow er wherein the seeds of life, which they cont ain within themselves, can com e to fruition, and groups of such appe aring seeds can appe ar in the world \"on their ow n lot.\" Putting it mor e simply and in terms sym bol ic, and therefore more easy of unde rstandi ng, we might state that the seven rays, expr essing themselves in the hum an family through the seven ray types, are now at the stage of unfoldm ent where the process can be carried forward into the formation of the seven ray groups , and these in their totality will express the Kingdom of God. Groups will be formed which will be out standi ngl y of a particular ray type but which will work in all the nine major fields of hum an expr ession. These I out lined when indi cating the work of the nine groups planne d by me. How ever, let me here poi nt out that the groups which I planne d are not in themselves the com ing groups nor are they the onl y evidences of the emergence of these ray groups in the world. There are several similar expe riments goi ng on at this time upon the various streams of ray energy and unde r the direction of various Masters of the Wisdom . The groups for which I have made myself respons ible are second ray groups essentially and are in t he nature of a tentative move to see if the time is really ripe"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST for the distribut ion of such seed groups throughout the entire world. Will the respons e of humanity and the reaction of these groups be such that a network of them may be started on a large sc ale everyw here — groups which will be characterised by vision, cohe sion, love , impersona lity, sacrifice, persistency and creative ability? These are the que stions which we, the teachers on the inne r side, are toda y asking our selves as we study the probl em of the best way of helping the human family through this crisis. Bear in mind that the objective before these groups is to relate the Hierarchy, and that for which it stands , to hum anity; to bring into a close rappor t the two centres whos e energy must eventually be fused and blende d into one whol e. Perhaps you will grasp the unde rlying idea with greater clarity if you will remember the persona l work which you shoul d be ende avour ing to do with your self. This is, is it not , the effort to fuse and ble nd the persona lity and the soul , or the highe r Self and the low er selves. To do this you have to realise that the illumination of the mind is a vital and essential factor. There are, therefore, three poi nts to cons ider: the Soul , the illum ined Mind and the Persona lity. To these three you have to add a cons ecrated and awakened heart, full of love to all, vibrant with com passion and with unde rstandi ng. Bear, therefore, these four factors in mind: 1. The dedicated oriented man . . . . . . the persona lity 2. T he ove rshadow ing, spiritual man . . . . . . the soul 3. The illum ined mind . . . . . . the medium of relation 4. The cons ecrated, lovi ng heart . . . . . . the expr ession of these three. This is the persona lity and indi vidua l corresponde nce to the broader picture and the world factors and the wider unde rtakings with which hum anity is at this time faced. Just as in the life of the individua l a man is conf ront ed with the oppor tuni ty to func tion as a disciple in training with a view to initiation, so toda y hum anity is faced in the same way with a similar situation and pos sibilities. The highe r corresponde nce with which the Hierarchy is occupied at this time, and of which the out line just given is an inadequa te analogy, is as follow s: 1. The intellectual centre , Hum anity, receptive, ready and expe ctant. 2. The spiritual centre, the Hierarchy, pos itive, deliberate and muni ficent — ready and waiting to bestow that which is desired, reached for and claimed. 3. The New Group of World Servers. They are the more adva nced members of the hum an family, sensitive to hierarchical inspiration and to hum an need and to spiritual unf oldm ent as a determining factor in world affairs. 4. Small groups which correspond to the illum ined minds of the indi vidua ls — intuitiona l and acting as a cohe sive element and a fusing factor between hum anity and the Hierarchy. They are gathered out of the New Group of World Servers. Let me now present you with anot her vital cons ideration. Looki ng back ove r you r indi vidua l lives, you will b e cons cious that it was the poi nts of crisis and the cycles of tension which cons tituted for you the major oppor tuni ties and the moments of \"movi ng forward.\" Of these oppor tuni ties you either profited or — by neglecting them — you tempor arily failed. This same critical factor (if I might call it so) acts also in the world of men and in groups and masses; toda y the point of tension for hum anity in such a situation, similar to that to be found in the indi vidual life, can be not ed. The Hierarchy stands also at a"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST p oint of extreme and scientific tension — scientific because induc ed and directed; you can, if you so choos e, picture these two great groups as facing each other. The Hierarchy is aware of the need, of the pur pos e of the dua l tension, and desirous of bringi ng this tension to such a \"crisis of precipitation\" that the fusion of the two groups will be inevitable, whilst the other group, hum anity, una ware generally of the implications of the situation, is suffering, bewildered and full of fear. Between these two g roups stands the New Group of World Servers, cons tituted toda y of two bodi es of peopl e: 1. Thos e who are aware of the Plan, are subj ect to and sensitive to hierarchical impression and dedicated to the task of bringi ng about the desired fusion or group at - one - ment. These are the cons ecrated servers of the world who are free from all taint of separativeness, full of love to all men and eager for the spread of unde rstandi ng goodw ill. They correspond to the \"cons ecrated lovi ng heart,\" mentione d above . 2. A small minor ity who have emerged out of the New Group of World Servers and who can (in every count ry) func tion in group formation if they choos e, and so bring about the fusion for which the New Group of World Servers is working and for which the poi nt of tension in hum anity and in the Hierarchy predispos es and has prepared the hearts of men. Their oppor tuni ty and respons ibility is great, because they know the Plan, they are in touc h with the guiding teachers on the inne r side — and are sensitive to the highe r impression. They correspond to the poi nts of illum ination, and so to the \"illum ined minds ,\" referred to above . Here is the picture of these esoteric interrelations , and here you can note the pos ition which you coul d hol d, for these groups have a d efinite oppor tuni ty to bring about this world fusion and so precipitate the \"crisis of love \" to which I have so oft referred. The Great Appr oach upon the side of hum anity is now goi ng on, with the tension induc ed thereby grow ing mom entarily; this will incr ease with grow ing speed and tension unt il 1942 when either the first stage of fusion will have been made upon earth, resulting in widespread goodw ill and world unde rstandi ng or in pos tpone ment — with sad results to the hum an family and an inevitable break in the tension which will take a form that will cause much real suffering and widespread disaster. This disaster can take many forms, but upon them we will not speculate, except to realise the urgency and the need for immediate action which is demande d at th is time. There are two poi nts to remember in conne ction with these seed groups , and these are in line with, but also expa nsions of, analogous condi tions in the \"seeds\" which fructified — after implantation and developm ent — in animal - man, produc ing the living self - cons cious indi vidua l and, in their totality, the four th kingdo m in nature. The first point has reference to the qual ity of the implanted seed, and the second to the method of its implantation. The qua lity of the \"seed of the sons of God\" w hich was effectual in produc ing the hum an family was intellectual, and the self - cons cious self - directed man was the result. The fruit of this qua lity, plus the livingne ss of the seed itself, can be seen toda y in the more adva nced and cultured thinki ng peop le and in thos e who are in any sense of the word persona lities. The method employe d was the gift of mind to the more adva nced among the animal - men in a majority of cases, the stimulation of the instinctual faculty in others, whilst a third method was the leaving of a minor ity to the ordinary course of evol ution. These latter toda y cons titute the least develope d and the most backw ard of the races upon the Earth. They are, in fact, a very small num ber inde ed.

This intuition is a blend of the two divine qua lities of buddhi - manas, or intuitive spiritual unde rstandi ng (invol ving interpretation and identification) and the highe r abstract mind, which is essentially the pow er to com prehend that which is not conc rete or tangi ble but which is, in reality, an inna te recogni tion of the low er aspects of the divine Plan as it must affect life in the three worlds. Hum anity, being still pr imarily self - cons cious and self - centred, regards this Plan as the divine Plan for man, but — as the seed groups grow and develop — the narrow ness of this partial view will becom e increasingl y appa rent. God's Plan is all - embracing and His pur pos es are inclusive of all forms of life and their relations hips. This qua lity of the seed groups is described in current esoteric literature as love - wisdom (the heart nature and the highe r mind), and this is descriptive of the future groups ; it is not love , how eve r, as usually unde rstood, or wisdom as man generally defines it. This is free of emotion and of the astralism which is distinctive of the solar plexus life which most peopl e live; love , esoterically and in reality, is perceptive unde rstandi ng, the ability to recogni se that which has produc ed an existing situation, and a cons eque nt freedom from criticism; it invol ves that beneficent silence which carries healing in its wings and which is onl y expressive when the inhi bition aspect of silence is absent and the man no longe r has to still his low er nature and qui et the voices of his ow n ideas in order to unde rstand and achieve identification with that which must be love d. Can you follow the beauty of this conc ept and com prehend the nature of this silent depth of true unde rstandi ng? Wisdom is the subl imation of the intellect, but this invol ves the subl imation of the highe r as well as of the low er aspects of the mind. It is a blend of intuition, spiritual perception, coope ration with the plan and spont aneous intell ectual appr eciation of that which is cont acted, and all this is fused and blende d with and by the love which I have defined above , plus that esoteric sense which must be unf olded before the second initiation can be taken. I call this especially to your att ention. Seek to unde rstand and perceive the subt le evidences of the esoteric sense, and then define it and expl ain its processes and evidences, invoki ng as you do so the highe r sensibilities. And now , as to the methods to be employe d in creating these gro ups . The primary method is the presentation of the more adva nced ideas (which are stimulating in their effects upon the minds which are receptive) and the presentation of the vision, which is evoc ative in its influence and produc es amazing results. Ponde r on this. The basic method employe d, which lay behind the three methods out lined in The Secret Doctrine and referred to above , was the presentation (very dimly and vague ly) of the conc ept of the self, of the low er integrated self and its correlated inne r i mplications of self - centredne ss and self - direction. The presentation made toda y to self - cons cious man and to this self - directed indi vidua l is the revelation of the larger Whol e of which the indi vidua l is a part. To this Whol e the self must dedic ate its life, love and light . Thos e are the three gifts which the four th kingdom in nature has finally and cons cious ly to make to the planet — gifts of definitely directed energies produc ing peculiar and equa lly definite relations of forces; they are not the gift of strengt h, kindne ss and know ledge , which is man's feeble interpretation of the divine energies with which he will som e day salvage the planetary life. The presentation of this vision to the aspirants and disciples of the world has had a dua l effec t; first of all, it has produc ed an immediate respons ive cohe sion among them which resulted in the appe arance of the New Group of World Servers, and secondl y, it led to the formation along the line of the seven rays throughout the world of small groups (wi thin the New Group of World Servers) who were dedicated to"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST the produc tion of this inna te synt hesis and subj ective fusion and to the expr ession of this blende d dedicated cons cious ness. These latter groups , a small minor ity, correspond to the earlier and fir st method of mind - implantation in animal man, whilst the New Group of World Servers corresponds to the second method of general stimulation. In bot h of these embryon ic activities, which will eventually be respons ible for produc ing the manifestation of the Kingdom of God on earth, the two great necessities are vision, plus living organisation. The vision has to be sensed, sought and discove red indi vidua lly by each group member, and it is this persona l know ledge and this persona l dedication to the revelation which leads next to the organisation of the group life and relation, or to a determined process of correlation with the life and pur pos e of the Whol e. The indi vidua l who has for himself seen the vision relates himself to the group which is cons cious of th is vision along with him, and then follow s the relating of this \"visioni ng group\" to the kingdom of God as it exists on the subt ler planes, in the effort to exteriorise it and make the vision a fact upon the plane of manifestation. It is a proce ss of vision, activity and precipitation. It is in conne ction with vision that much of the group difficulty lies. Let me be specific and illustrate. I, your Tibetan brother, friend and teacher, have a vision of the Plan; I am aware (because of my status a s an initiate of a certain degree) of the nature of the pur pos e for this particular cycle and what its condi tioni ng activities shoul d be and to what end they are directed, for there is an esoteric distinction between the Plan as it exists for humanity and for the planet, and the pur pos e of the present world situation. Upon this, reflection woul d be profitable. Through the coope ration of A.A.B. I put this plan — as far as was pos sible — before you, calling your attention to the New Group of World Servers. As far as I coul d and dared I put it before the world aspirants and called attention to the general trend of world events from the spiritual and subj ective angl es. This evoke d from all of you an immediate and gratifying respons e; but it is pos sible, is it not , t hat this respons e has remained subj ective, intellectually perceived and aspirationa lly desired, but that the Plan and the purpos es of the kingdom of God are not yet truly a part of you r life pattern and do not yet thor oughl y condi tion your brain and your l ife activity. Perhaps, therefore, the vision is not a part of your life and so integrated into you r cons cious ness that you attach your self to it as you have, in the past, attached your self to individua ls; the vision is a vision of group work, of group rel ations hips, of group obj ectives, and of the group fusion to the larger Whol e. When this is realised, then the vision determines your life incentives, tende ncies and work, and when it is thus truly a part of you r mental equi pm ent, your emotiona l aspiration and you r activities, and when there are sufficient groups thus actuated, then the Kingdom of God will func tion objectively upon the earth. This is not yet the case, because the needed condi tions are not fulfilled. The early seeds sow n among animal - men wer e imbue d with, or qua lified by, separ ateness — a necessary qua lity for the unfoldm ent of self - cons cious ness, but one which must now be supe rseded. The seed groups now in process of forming will be distingui shed by the qua lity of fusion , and this shoul d be as inevitable a developm ent as is the separative and protective nature of the ordinary human cons cious ness. It is this sense of uni on and of at - one - ment which is the protective and essential characteristic of the fifth kingdom , and it is this lat ent, yet actively present, factor which leads une rringl y and inevitably to the organisation — interior and subj ective — of the seed groups , to their radiatory activity, and to the magne tic pul l they evidence when dul y organised. Thus they produc e fusion and bl endi ng. I am here put ting new ideals and pos sibilities into as simple langua ge as pos sible; I seek not to veil and"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST obs cure their simplicity and truth by many expl anatory paragraphs . What I have here said must be read with the eye of vision and the unde rst andi ng of the heart. Disciples must have these two faculties as part of their usable equi pm ent. Have you got them, or are you trying to cultivate and unf old them, my brothers? Anot her of the aspects of this group work is that its influence is pervasive, a nd not at the beginni ng dyna mic. The force which it later exerts will be due to cons tant pervasive pressures and the steady spreading of the group influence and ideals. It is therefore ultimately very far - reaching in its effectiveness, provi ding the work i s done as indi cated. This will be due eventually to two factors: one , the pow er of the groups upon the subt ler planes of thought and desire, and finally upon egoi c levels; this will becom e steadily more pot ent; secondl y, to the activity of thos e who form p art of the key groups ; they will themselves form correspondi ng groups of nine, or seven or five, and thus there will be a gradua l spreading throughout the world of an esoteric network. For this the majority are not yet ready, but I woul d have you bear it i n mind. True interest and acceptance of that which is indi cated as essential to the disciple and to the work must first of all be patiently evidenced. I have used the word \"subj ective\" a great deal in my writings ; I have done this in an effort to shift the focus of attention to that which lies below the surface. This refers, in the case of aspirants, to the subj ective synt hesis in the three worlds and not to the astral and mental planes per se, or specifically to egoi c levels. If the inne r kingd om of divine realities is to demons trate upon earth, it will com e throug h the emergence of the inne r synt hesis on to the phys ical plane, and this is brought about by vital recogni tion and an expression of the realities and laws gove rning that kingdom . The organisation which follow s the Vision is entirely subj ective in nature and pervasive in qua lity. It is a process of germination, but if that which germinates doe s not eventually appe ar in obj ective manifestation the activity is then abor tive. The influenc e of these new groups is due to the close inne r relation demons trated through uni form thinki ng and a recogni sed uni ty of pur pos e. It is for this reason (a truly scientific one in its nature) that I have empha sised so strongl y the ordinary characteristics o f the trained disciple, which are non - criticism, sensitivity and love . Where these are lacking, this simultaneous one ness and directed thoug ht and this \"group arom a\" (as it is esoterically called, though the word I am attempting to translate is more adequa te than the above ) becom e impos sible. I have not been interested in the elimination of hinde ring faults for the indi vidua l's sake, but for the carrying forward of the desired group pur pos es. The need is for group thinki ng of a pow erful nature along the ind icated lines; for visualisation of the Vision of such a clear nature that it becom es a fact for the indi vidual; for the developm ent and func tioni ng of the imagination, appl ied to the lines of out com e and results, and func tioni ng so creatively that the resu lts are seen with clarity and must inevitably materialise. It invol ves also the hol ding of the inne r subj ective link with each other with such firmness that potent centres of force and of creative energy — working unde r inspiration from the Hierarchy, via th e focussed minds of group members who are definitely en rappor t with their soul s and with each other — may func tion so successfully that the new civilisation and the new culture can be rapidly established. As this has to be founde d on a basis of l ovi ng goodw ill and upon nonde struction, and as its methods lead to right relations between men and nations , it is essential that the establishing groups shoul d themselves expr ess the subt ler aspects of these desired virtues. The empha sis upon the work whi ch serving groups must seek to develop is that of an organised, scientific activity. Esoterically, this invol ves an understandi ng of the basic science of occultism, which is that of energy. The qua lities, characteristics and activity upon which you shoul d be enga ged are definitely the expression and unde rstandi ng of energy along som e line; hitherto, for the majority, force"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST has been used and its impact on other forces has been not ed and recorded as force impacting force, leading thus to forceful results. But I seek to have you, as esotericists, deal with energy and the result of its impac t upon forces . This is the scientific aspect of the occult life. The world is toda y full of forces in conf lict and in wrong relation with each other, and this produc es the p resent chaos. The new order will be brought into expression by the play of the spiritual energy upon the forces in the three worlds, and this will be the task of the New Groups when organi sed and func tioni ng correctly . In these words, I have sum med up one of the first and most important obj ectives of the group work with which I and others of the workers upon the spiritual side of life are at this time occupi ed. Som e small unde rstandi ng of the signi ficance of these words can be gained if you will watch the e ffect that you produc e in you r envi ronment during thos e times when you do succeed in living as soul s, and are therefore expr essing soul energy, and are thus count eracting the persona lity forces in your selves and in thos e around you . The desire of the Hier archy at this time is to fill the world of striving forces with poi nts of spiritual energy, and to distribut e everyw here thos e who are affiliated with spiritual groups and are therefore linke d subj ectively to their group brothers in all lands , s o that a pervasive, intelligent influence can ceaselessly make its impact felt upon the minds of men and produc e finally the needed good feeling, good will and good lives. THE WO RLD CRISIS September 1939 Hum anity is passing through an acute crisis an d its karma or fate is heavy upon it. Being so close to events, it is not easy for hum anity to see them in their true perspective and it is in order that you may see more clearly that I write toda y. A broader vision and a wider hor izon may help you to unde rstand, and it may be of profit to you if you can be helped to see the picture as it appe ars to us, the teachers on the inne r side, and also in relation to its backgr oun d. There are two out standi ng and impor tant poi nts which are present in the cons cious ne ss of the Hierarchy as it looks on at manki nd goi ng through the present stupe ndous struggl e. The first is that hum anity is toda y and on a large scale aware that what is happening is entirely its ow n doi ng and the result of hum anity's ow n mistakes. Men eith er feel respons ible for what is occurring or they are shifting the respons ibility ope nly and deliberately on to shoul ders other than their ow n. Of these endl ess and age - old mistakes, the Versailles Treaty is onl y the sym bol and the practical focal poi nt. The second fact is that in spite of war and separation, of cruelty and of passions and selfishne ss runni ng wild, there is nevertheless, toda y, more true unde rstandi ng, more goodw ill and more out goi ng love than at any previous time in the history of the rac e. I say this with deliberation and because I have the hierarchical know ledge available to my hand. Be not deceived, therefore, by the out er clamour of war. I tell you that men's hearts everyw here are full of com passion bot h for themselves and for all othe r men; the wide scope and the vast extent of the conf lict is indi cative of an inne r uni ty and a subj ective interrelation of which all are som ewhat cons cious and which the conf lict itself doe s not negate. Is this a"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST hard saying? I seek to indi cate to you its basic truth if you will but ponde r upon what I say with an open mind. The task of all aspirants and of all men of goodw ill everyw here is to see that prolonge d suffering doe s not unde rmine the present right and essential attitude s and that the c haos and clamour doe s not shut out respons e to the voice of the soul which has been speaking with increasing clarity for the past four teen years. The stimulation which was set up and the light which was permitted to creep through after the last hierarchica l conc lave in 1925 has been real and effective. That meeting of the Masters of the Wisdom upon spiritual levels led to three results or happe nings , and these we are toda y expe riencing. The first was a fresh inflow of the Christ principle of spiritual or t rue love which is ever free from emotiona lism and selfish intent. This inflow resulted in the immediate and rapid grow th of all move ments tow ards peace, world unde rstandi ng, goodw ill, phi lanthropi c effort and the awakening of the masses of men to the issue s of brotherhood . The second was the stimulation of the principle of relations hip and this led to the grow th and the perfecting of all sour ces of inter - com munication such as the press, the radio and travel. The inner obj ective of all this was to bring hum an beings closer toge ther upon the out er plane of existence and thus parallel obj ectively the developi ng inne r, spiritual uni ty. The third was the inflow of the force of will or power from the Shamballa centre. This, as previous ly expl ained, is the most p ow erful force in the world toda y, and onl y twice before in the history of manki nd has this Shamballa energy made its appe arance and caused its presence to be felt through the tremendous change s which were brought about . Let us recapitulate briefly. The fi rst time was dur ing the great hum an crisis which occurred at the time of the indi vidua lisation of men in ancient Lemuria. The second time was at the time of the struggl e in Atlantean days between the \"Lords of Light and the Lords of Material Ex pression. \" This little know n divine energy now streams out from Shamballa. It embodi es in itself the energy which lies behind the world crisis of the mom ent. It is the Will of God to produc e certain racial and mom entous change s in the cons cious ness of the race which will com pletely alter man's attitude to life and his grasp of the spiritual, esoteric and subj ective essentials of living. It is this force which will bring about (in conj unc tion with the energy of love ) that tremendous crisis — imminent in the h um an cons cious ness — which we call the second crisis, the initiation of the race into the Mystery of the Ages, into that which has been hid from the beginni ng. It might be of value here if we cons idered the three great planetary centres and their relations h ips in tabul ar form and thus get the general idea more clearly in mind. 1.

HUMANITY -------------- Active Intelligence --- Planetary Throat Centre The City, standi ng four squa re --------------- Creativity Self - cons cious ness Ruler: Lucifer Son of the Morning The Prodi gal Son This Shamballa energy now for the first time is making its impact upon hum anity directly and is not steppe d dow n, as ha s hitherto been the case, through transmission via the Hierarchy of Masters. This change of direction cons tituted a som ewhat dange rous expe riment as it necessarily stimulated the persona lities of men, particularly thos e whos e persona lities were along the l ine of will or pow er and in whom the love aspect of divinity was not sufficiently expr essing itself; it was, how ever, permitted because it was realised that it woul d not affect the man in the street or the masses who woul d remain unr espons ive to it, though it might greatly stimulate and intensify the mental and more pot ent type of man. The effects of this widespread stimulation have been all that was anticipated and the so - called \"evil results\" of the Shamballa force upon ambitious and pow erful persona liti es in all count ries and all school s of thought have, nevertheless, been offset to som e extent by the grow th of the sense of relations hip everyw here and by the spread of the Christ energy which generates at - one - ment, lovi ng unde rstandi ng and goodw ill. You m ight here right ly enqui re how this can be so when hum anity is ove rwhelmed by a gha stly world war at this time. I woul d remind you that the Hierarchy is gui ded in its conc lusions by the mass light and by the inne r subj ective oft une xpr essed reactions of the multitude and never by the out er happe nings upon the phys ical plane. The fate of the form life and of out er organisations is deemed of small impor tance com pared with the sensed inne r spiritual developm ent. That developm ent must necessarily out run the out e r manifestation. Humanity is toda y further adva nced spiritually and mentally than might appe ar from external happe nings . The first result of such developm ent is eventually the destruction of the out er form because it is provi ng inadequa te to the pul sing, i nne r, spiritual life; then, secondl y, com es the bui lding of the new and more adequa te out er expr ession. This account s for the world crisis at this time. The cause is based upon four major factors upon which I woul d like som ewhat to enlarge: 1. Upon the poi nt achieved in racial evol ution. This toda y warrants the bui lding of a better vehicle for hum an and racial expr ession. 2. Upon the karmic causes which — as far as present hum anity is conc erned — can be traced back to an ancient conf lict upon old A tlantis."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST 3. Upon the com ing into incarnation of certain pot ent persona lities whos e dha rma or destiny it is to bring about great evol utiona ry change s. 4. Upon certain planetary happe nings , conne cted with the life of the One \"in Whom we live and move and h ave our being.\" These invol ve the impact upo n our planet of Forces and Energies which will be instrum ental in altering the existing civilisation and culture, in climaxing karmic necessity and in thus engi neering release, presenting hum anity with that stage in the expe rience of the disciple which we call \"the meeting of the Dweller on the Threshol d with the Ange l of the Presence,\" and induc ing as a cons eque nce a certain planetary initiation. These four stages of the Law of Cause and Effect (as it affects hu manity at this time) might be called: 1. The perfecting of form expr ession --------- Law of Evol ution 2. The precipitation of karma ----------------- Law of Cause and Effect 3. The achievement of personal ity ------------ Law of Polar Oppos ites (The Dweller on the Threshol d) 4. The attainm ent of plane tary initiation ----- Law of Initiation You may perhaps think at this poi nt that I am being academic and that the world stress at this time is such that love , sym pathy and kind words are needed far more than learned, historical retrospection and sugge sted hypot heses. I seek, how ever, to foster in you the spirit of unde rstandi ng. Such true com prehension necessitates head know ledge as well as heart reaction. The disciples of the world toda y must ende avour to see why and to what end the present terrible happe nings have occurred. A clear expr ession and statement of causes is needed — free from emotiona l bias and partisan empha sis. What is happe ning toda y is not the result of immediate occurrences. When I say \"immediate,\" I refer to all happe nings wh ich have occurred within the Christian era. I want you to attempt to regard the present crisis as being caused or initiated by events which are of so ancient an origin that mode rn, orthodox historians have no record of them. Only two poi nts of view will s erve truly to clarify what is happe ning at this time. First of all, a recogni tion that mode rn academic history cons titutes onl y one page in a vast historical record and that the initiating events of which we are in search and which are working out as effe cts in the planetary life at this time belong to an age so distant that no mode rn historian recogni ses its episode s. Information anent this ancient period must be sought in the many world Scriptures, in ancient monum ents, in the science of sym bol s, in the racial myths, and in inhe rited and transmitted legends . Secondl y, that a study of the microcosm, man, will be found to hol d, as always, the key to the study of hum an affairs as a whol e. Just as the aspirants and disciples are at this time being tested and tried and subj ected to the working out of inexpl icable conf licts and drastic change s in their lives, so the same is true of the world aspirant, Hum anity. To the above two reasons anot her might perhaps be adde d which will have signi ficance and meaning to esotericists and to all who have in any way grasped the teaching I have attempted to give you in my"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST books anent the three world centres — Hum anity, the Hierarchy and Shamballa. This world crisis is related to the appr oach or the relation of the Hi erarchy to Hum anity. That great spiritual centre of force, the Hum an Kingdom , has now reached a poi nt of such pot ency and of such a high vibratory activity that it is shaken to its very depths; all its evol utionary grades and groups are respondi ng to the s timulation, generated within the centre itself and also stimulated by Forces emanating from the hierarchical centre and from Shamballa. This precipitates a crisis which has had no parallel in hum an history but which finds a faint reflection in the crisis which ove rtook the animal kingdom and which resulted in the formation of a new kingdo m in nature — the hum an. As I have earlier told you , this present world crisis, if met correctly and right ly cont rolled, will result in the manifestation of the fifth or spi ritual kingdom upon earth. This (as you know ) will be brought about by the at - one - ing of the two centres — the hum an centre and the Hierarchy. One of the major planetary synt heses is taking place or, perhaps I shoul d say, can take place. (I am wording this w ith care and woul d call you r attention to my wording.) It might serve a useful purpos e if I enlarged som ewhat upon the four stages of the early causes, mentione d above . In so doi ng, I can give you som e idea of the unde rlying pur pos e of all the present hap penings and som e unde rstandi ng of the predispos ing condi tions which are to be found , lying far back in the night of time. If I can do this adequa tely and if you can read and study with unde rstandi ng and an ope n mind, som e of your natural bewilderment may d isappe ar and you may then be able to help others to live calmly through this crisis and to preserve an attitude of patience, goodw ill, balance and com passion. Let us, therefore, cons ider these four poi nts because, in so doi ng, we shall cove r the field suff iciently — I believe — to bring at least som e measure of light to you . Later I will try to expl ain the signi ficance of the Great Invoc ation and to give you som e idea of the nature of the Forces invoke d and of the esoteric meaning which these words (used so fre que ntly by you) are in tende d to conve y. The Caus e of the Present Crisis It is well know n to you that the great Law of Rebirth is the cont rolling and major law in all the processes of manifestation. It gove rns the exot eric expr ession of a sol ar Logos or of a hum an being, and the obj ect of this cons tantly recurring process is to bring an increasingl y perfect form to the expa ndi ng service of the soul . For the first time since its inception, the hum an family is in a pos ition to not e for itself th e processes of the rebirth of a civilisation as an expr ession of spiritual culture at a particular poi nt in evol ution. Hence the magni tude of this crisis as it assum es its place in the hum an cons cious ness. Many lesser crises, initiating specific tribal, na tiona l and racial expe riments in the renewal of form have gone on and have been registered by som e group within a nation or by a nation itself (if adva nced enough) . Such a nationa l registration took place for the first time in conne ction with the French Re vol ution. Such registrations of evol utiona ry intent have taken place with increasing clarity and unde rstandi ng during the past two hund red years. Such crises have taken place in practically every nation in mode rn times and have been recogni sed to som e degr ee, and upon them historians have enlarged and phi losophe rs speculated. But the crisis toda y is far vaster, embracing as it doe s the majority of nations in bot h hemisphe res. No nation remains at this time una ffected and the results are and must be register ed in som e aspect of the national life. Owing to the factual interrelation between nations everyw here and to the rapidity of intercom muni cation, the present crisis is the first major internationa l crisis in hum an affairs and covers a period of twenty - eigh t years (from 1914 till 1942 ). These are interesting numbers, for 28 is 4 x 7,"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST which are the years of a com plete persona lity cycle. I do not wish you to infer from the above that the period of active com bat and conflict must necessarily be prolonge d unt il 1942. Such is not the case. The early termination of the conf lict or its inde finite extension lies in the keeping of humanity itself; men must increasingl y determine their ow n fate as they emerge from the stage of adol escence into that of maturi ty, respons ibility and achievement. This period of twenty - eight years is, how ever, of paramount impor tance and upon the next three years much depends . Again I tell you that even the Hierarchy itself, with all its know ledge , vision and unde rstandi ng and wi th all its resour ces, cannot coerce and cannot forecast what manki nd will do. It can and doe s stimulate to right action; it can and doe s indi cate possibility and respons ibility; it can and doe s send out its teachers and disciples to educ ate and lead the ra ce; but at no poi nt and in no situation doe s it com mand or assum e cont rol. It can and doe s bring good out of evil, illum inating situations and indi cating the solution of a probl em, but further than this the Hierarchy cannot go. If it assum ed author itative cont rol, a race of autom atons woul d be develope d and not a race of respons ible, self - directed, aspiring men. This must surely be appa rent to you and may serve to answer the que stion which is uppe rmost in the minds of the unt hinki ng, occult stude nts toda y: Why coul d not the Hierarchy have prevented this catastrophe ? Unque stiona bly the Masters of the Wisdom with Their know ledge and Their com mand of forces coul d have interfered, but in so doi ng They woul d have broke n an occult law and hinde red the true develo pm ent of manki nd. This They will never do. At all costs, man must learn to stand and act alone . Instead, having done all that was permissible, They now stand beside suffering and bewildered hum anity and — with the deepest com passion and love — will help men to right the wrong s they have initiated, to learn the needed lessons and to com e through this crisis (which they have themselves precipitated) enriched thereby, and pur ified in the fires of adve rsity. These are not platitude s but eternal truths. This world crisis, with all its horror and suffering, is — in the last analysis — the result of successful evol utiona ry processes. We are ready to recogni se that when a man's life cycle has been run and he has learnt the lessons which the expe rience of any par ticular life has been intende d to teach, his phys ical body and the inne r form aspects (making the sum total of his persona lity expr ession) will begin to deteriorate; destructive agencies within the form itself will becom e active and eventually death will t ake place, resulting in the liberation of the indw elling life in order that a new and better form may be bui lt. This, we perforce accept either blindly or intelligently, regarding it as a natural and una voi dable process, but nor mal and inevitable. We are a pt, however, to forget that what is true of the indi vidua l is true of hum anity. Cycles of civilisation such as that we call our mode rn civilisation are analogous to a particular, indi vidua l, hum an incarnation with its inception, its progress and grow th, it s useful maturity and its ensuing deterioration and subs eque nt death or the passing away of the form. Forms are ever ope n to attack. A strong subj ective life and spiritual detachm ent are the two safegua rds. Where the form is more pot ent than the life, dan ger is imminent; where attachm ent to the material aspect or organisation is present, spiritual values are lost. Toda y we are watching the death of a civilisation or cycle of incarnation of hum anity. In all fields of hum an expr ession, crystallisation and d eterioration had set in. Worn - out religious dogm as and the grip of theology and the orthodox chur ches have no longer sufficed to hol d the allegiance of the pot ent, inne r, spiritual life; hum anity is deeply spiritual and inna tely religious but needs toda y a new form with which to clothe the ancient verities. Old pol itical school s have been deemed inadequa te and new ideologi es bear witness to the strengt h of the life which is seeking more adequa te expr ession; the educ ationa l systems, having served their pur po se, are fast being recogni sed as inadequa te to meet the"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST need of the demandi ng life of the race; there is everyw here a cry for change and for thos e new forms in the religious , political, educ ationa l and econom ic life of the race which will allow of freer an d better spiritual expr ession. Such a change is rapidly com ing and is regarded by som e as death — terrible and to be avoi ded if pos sible. It is inde ed death but it is beneficent and needed. It is this realisation of the passing of a civilisation w hich gives rise to the recurrent and forebodi ng cry, \"This is the death of civilisation; it must not be\"; \"This is the end of the order, and the old order must be saved\"; \"This is the destruction of the old and love d values, and it must not be permitted.\" That hum anity is bringi ng about this needed change in unne cessary, cruel and painful ways is inde ed true, just as it is true toda y that hum an beings by their wrong thinki ng, fool ish habits of phys ical living and unde sirable emotiona l attitude s do precipit ate a final, phys ical breakdow n and eventually death. Nevertheless, for the progr ess of the soul of the individua l and the soul of humanity, death is inevitable, good and necessary; it is also a practice with which we are all most familiar in our ow n expe r ience and in watching it in others. But we need to remember that the worst death of all (as far as hum anity is conc erned) woul d be if a form of civilisation or a body form became static and eternal; if the old order never altered and the old values were ne ver transmuted into highe r and better one s, that woul d inde ed be a disaster. We need to bear in mind also that the forces of destruction or death are two - fold: first, the rapidly emerging and developi ng life with its demand for more room for expr ession an d fuller expe rience, and its spiritual aspiration for change and progr ess; and secondl y, the reactiona ry forces and the cons ervative attitude s which adhe re to the well know n and the familiar, and which hate the new, the unt ried and the unknow n. Both of the se produc e the great and divine transition from the past into the future, and from the old into the new, from expe rience into fruition and then into expe rience again. The realities are eternal and undyi ng; the forms are ephemeral and tempor ary; the soul is persistent and deathless; the form is changi ng and doom ed to die. The processes of evol ution have in the past and will in the future prove successful in bringi ng forms to birth, to maturity and to death. But (and this is the interesting and signi ficant p oint) hum anity is for the first time aw are of process . It has for the first time chos en intelligently to obs erve what is goi ng on and to relate it to expe rience and to envi ronm ent. This in itself indi cates a stage of true and much to be desired developm ent. Reasoni ng, analysis and the presentation of differing viewpoi nts are goi ng on in every count ry on a large scale with varying results, based on differences of temperament, of tradition, of developm ent and of training. This stage of death and o f birth (for the two are proceeding simultaneous ly) can be easily grasped by the esotericist as he studi es the world war in its two distinctive periods : 1914 to 1918 , and 1939 unt il 1942. The first stage (if you coul d see the situation as it truly is) was most definitely the death stage; the second stage, in which we now find our selves, is literally the stage of birth — the birth pangs of the new order and of the new civilisation through which hum anity's sense of life can expr ess itself. The mother dies in or der that the child may live; the form is sacrificed to the life. But toda y, the form aspect, the Mother or matter aspect, is dyi ng cons cious ly, and just as cons cious ly the child, the infant civilisation, is com ing into being. This is the new thing and it i s in this that we are all participating. It is the death of the personal ity of hum ani ty and the coming in of the soul . Such a dyi ng is ever a painful process. Pain has always been the pur ifying agent, employe d by the Lords of Destiny, to bring about liber ation. The accum ulated pain of the present war and the inhe rited pain of the earlier stage (begun in 1914) is bringi ng about a salutary and changi ng world cons cious ness. The Lord of Pain has descende d from His throne and is treading the ways of earth toda y , bringing"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST distress, agony and terror to thos e who cannot interpret His ends , but bringi ng also a re - stimulation of the instinct to self - preservation which — in its higher aspect — is the instinct to immortality; it tends to focus hum anity's attention upon the life aspect and not upon the form. The names of the Lords of Karma signi fy, sym bol ically and from the angl e of their inne r meaning, Relations hip, Enlight enm ent, Pain and Return. Ponde r on this. They are all peculiarly active at this time, and i n their activity lies the hope of hum anity. Ancient Karmic Events It is not my intention to expl ain or elabor ate the subj ect of Karma. This occult yet funda mentally exot eric theme, the Law of Cause and Effect, evok es a general recogni tion when called by this name. When called the Law of Karma, it is immediately regarded as mysterious , Oriental and new. Called (as it som etimes is) the Law of Retribut ion, an entirely errone ous connot ation has becom e attached to it. Toda y, the karma of hum anity is descendi n g upon it. I woul d remind you, how ever, that the cont inuo us empha sis laid upon the malevol ent aspects of karma conve ys a wrong impression and negates the full grasp of the truth. There is as much good karma as there is bad; even in the present world situat ion, the good karma emanating from the soul of hum anity balances the evil which com es from the material aspect and is cont inuous ly ove r - empha sised. It is the rhyt hm of matter in cont radistinction to the rhyt hm of the soul , and these cons titute the initiati ng causes of the present conf lict, bot h in indi vidua l lives and in the general world situation. When this is prope rly grasped, the true picture may emerge in your hearts and minds with greater clarity. In my effort to make clear the picture, I shall have to ove rlook many essential details; I shall also be forced to take the always debatable pos ition of making statements which cannot be checked and which find their sole argum ents (as far as the average thinker is conc erned) in deduc tion from the effects pro duc ed by causes that do not appe ar to the occultly une nlight ened. In time to com e, man will develop that mental attitude which will cons ider causes of greater impor tance than effects; he will then learn to cons ider with care the first steps taken in initia ting any line of action, ponde ring upon and deduc ing the proba ble effects before com mitting himself to any specific deed. Only through pain, error and cons eque nt price - paying will this salutary stage be reached. Toda y, all that is taking place is due , first of all, to the essential dua lity of man; in the second place, it is due to certain major lines of cleavage which were brought about by this essential dua lism in an early stage of hum an history, and thirdly, to the grow ing tende ncy tow ards syn thesis which the inflow of the Shamballa force is produc ing at this time. This is the simplest statement I find it pos sible to make anent this com plex probl em. With broad generalities I cover the past, indi cate the effects which are now being expe rienced i n the present, and forecast the future. It was the com ing into incarnation of the spiritually self - cons cious hum an being which is the inciting cause of the present conf lict. Had the sons of God not \"com e in unt o the daught ers of men\" (which is the Biblica l and sym bol ic way of expr essing the great relations hip between spirit and matter which was established in the hum an kingdom ), had the spiritual entities which are hum anity itself not taken unto themselves material forms, and had the pos itive spiritual ele ment not attached itself to the negative material aspect, the present world conf lict woul d not be taking place. But the divine plan of evol ution was based upon the produc tion of this relations hip between spiritually cons cious man and the form aspect, and t hus the great Law of Duality came into action, bringi ng about the \"fall of the ange ls,\" as they descende d from their sinless and free state of existence in order to develop full divine awareness"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST upon earth, through the medium of material incarnation and th e use of the principle of mind. This was the divine plan, emanating from the Mind of God and swept into activity and progressive unf oldm ent by an act of His Will. At its inception, there took place the original \"war in the heavens,\" when the sons of God wh o responde d to the divine urge to expe rience, to serve and to sacrifice, separated themselves from the sons of God who responde d to no such inspiration but who chos e to stay in their original and high state of being. To this truth, Christ Himself bore witn ess in the story of the Prodi gal Son and his relations hip to his elder brother, who had not left the Father's hom e. It is obvi ous , is it not , from this parable, where the appr oba tion of the Father lay; a careful study of this story and an intuit ive unde rstandi ng of its implications may evoke som e day a respons e to the \"sin of expe rience,\" as it has been called, and a com prehension of the two major laws gove rning the process: the Law of Evol ution and the Law of Rebirth. Here lies the prime initiat ing cause of what is taking place toda y. The second cause arose slow ly out of the first. Matter and spirit, focussed in the hum an family and expr essing their basic qua lities and essential nature, were eternally in conf lict. In the early stages and dur ing the long Lemurian cycle, infant hum anity steadily evol ved and yet in spite of this the lines of cleavage, though present, were not recogni sed. The latent spark of mind served onl y to bring a relative enlight enm ent to the five senses and their purely phys ic al appl ication. The phys ical life was strong; the deduc tive or self - registering life was practically nil. The life of humanity was then focussed within the phys ical body, thus fortifying and stimulating the animal nature and developi ng the phys ical organis m and the various internal organs through the unf oldment of the five senses; man became primarily a selfish and a fight ing animal with, how ever, at times, vague tende ncies tow ards som ething dimly sensed as better and with mom ents of high grade desire which was not aspiration and the urge to progr ess, as we know it, but their embryoni c forms. It is not pos sible for mode rn man to vision or unde rstand such a state of cons cious ness, for he has left it too far behind. The focus of the life force was also in the region of the adrenal glands , produc ing animal cour age and resistance to shoc k. But the dualism of man's essential nature was, as always, present and the lines of cleavage gradua lly appe ared; slow ly yet steadily, the pione ering soul s (a very small minor it y) shifted their cons cious ness gradua lly highe r into the solar plexus and a recogni tion of the factor of desire for that which was material and a capacity for emotiona l reaction began to develop. Hitherto, in Lemurian times, desire and instinct were identical. Ponde r on this, for it is interesting because it conc erns a state of cons cious ness of which mode rn man know s practically not hing. But, in Atlantean times, the lines of demarcation between what cons tituted pur ely phys ical life and that which — though still material — coul d be the goa l of effort and thus acqui red, began to cont rol the purely animal nature; man began to be acqui sitive and to surround himself with that which he wanted. The lines of cleavage between the instinctual animal and acqui si tive man began to be more clearly defined. Gradua lly the mental element unf olded among these pione ers just as the intuitive element is toda y unf olding among the mental type s; men began to acqui re som e form of mental perception and to bring what little min d they had to the processes of increasing their material pos session s. The stage of civilisation (which is basically a recogni tion of group relation) began. A period of urban existence supe rseded that of a pur e nom adic and agricultural existence. Men began to congr egate toge ther for their greater material com fort and protection, and the rhyt hm ic processes of conc entration and their world - wide extension began. These cycles are similar to the inbr eathing and the outbreathing of the phys ical organism of man. So me day a study will be made of these basic and cont rolling factors of hum an existence, dispersion or decentralisation, and com muni ty life or the expression of the herd instinct on a highe r or low er turn of the spiral of existence. The past few hundr ed year s have seen a major probl em arise in the present tende ncy of humanity to collect toge ther in great cities and to"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST congr egate in vast herds, leaving the count ryside denude d of its popul ation and creating serious probl ems of sustenance, of health and also of crime. Right before our eyes this rhyt hm is toda y changi ng and a serious probl em is being solved; cities are being evacuated and — as men and wom en are driven forth for one reason or anot her into the count ry — the lords of evol ution are forcing the breaking up of the rhyt hm of conc entration and substituting for it the rhyt hm of dispersion. This will do much for the race and will facilitate the unfoldm ent of a subj ective synt hesis which will greatly enrich hum anity and give new values to living. The lines of cleavage between the animal, instinctual nature and som e form of desire (embryoni c aspiration) steadily grew during Atlantean times and this early civilisation began to demons trate its ow n not e and to set new standa rds of material com fort and of s elfish cont rol on an increasingl y large scale as the urban existence develope d. It is perhaps difficult for us to visualise a world as densely popul ated then as is the mode rn world but so it was. The animal nature, being dom inant, the tende ncy was tow ards sexua l relations hip and the produc tion of large families, just as it is among the low er orders in our civilised areas toda y, for the peasantry and the slum dw ellers produc e more children than do the intelligentsia. In thos e far - off times, the onl y peopl e w ho had any true measure of intelligence were the disciples and initiates; they guided and guarded infant hum anity, much as mode rn parents gui de and gua rd their children, and as the state assum es respons ibility for the welfare of the nation. The Hierarchy w as, in thos e days, present upon the earth as the priest - kings and they acted as focal points of attractive energy, drawing to themselves thos e in whom the more intangi ble values were slow ly assum ing a vague cont rol, thus making the lines of cleavage betwee n materialism and spirituality still more clear and definite. We must remember that the spirituality of that time was of a very different qua lity from that which now goe s unde r that name. It was in the nature of an aspiration tow ards a sensed hereafter, f or a satisfying beauty and for emotiona l com pletion. There was no thought — as we know thought — in this attitude but onl y a reaching out after a sensed unat tainabl e and for that which was desirable. This was fostered in the peopl e by the Hierarchy through the gift of various inve ntions and by the use of the instinctual masses of men in bui lding great and beautiful cities and stupe ndous structures, the remnants of which persist unt il toda y. This was done unde r the expe rt gui dance of the initiates an d adepts who employe d their know ledge of the nature of matter and energy to produc e much that toda y man is gropi ngl y ende avour ing to discove r and make pos sible. All that the mode rn processes of civilisation have made pos sible, and much more than that which toda y comes unde r the name of scientific discove ry were know n in old Atlantis, but they were not develope d by men themselves but given to them as a free gift, much as peopl e toda y give to a child beautiful and wonde rful things which the child uses and enj oys but which he doe s not unde rstand in any way. Great and beautiful cities, full of temples and great bui ldings (of which the Chaldean and Babyl oni an remains are the degenerate remnants, and the mode rn skys craper the child) were everyw here to be found . Mo st of our mode rn scientific know ledge was pos sessed by these priest - kings and cons tituted in the eyes of the masses a form of wonde rful magic. Sanitation, hygi ene, means of transpor tation and air machines were develope d and of a very high order; these were not the result how ever of man's achievement but gifts from the Hierarchy, develope d or cons tructed unde r a wise gui dance. There was com mand of air and water because the gui des of the race kne w how to cont rol and master the forces of nature and of the elem ents, but none of it was the result of hum an unde rstandi ng, know ledge or effort. The minds of men were unde velope d and not adequa te to such a task, any more than is the mind of a little child. The cleavage between the two groups (the one expressing the fo rces of materialism and the other the energy of light ) grew gradua lly wider until tow ards the close of the Atlantean Age it was so wide, and"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST the lines of demarcation between the two school s of life and thought were so clear, that a crisis was precipitated in the then civilised world of which the present conf lict is a definite effect. Let us also hope that it cons titutes a climax which will never again occur. Then took place the great war between the Lords of Form and the Lords of Being, or between the Force s of Matter and the Great White Lodg e. A careful study of vol um e two of The Secret Doctrine will prove enlight ening to stude nts, if they will study with particular care pages 275 - 466 . To our unde rstandi ng, this account may seem vague and obs cure , but the issues at the time were clear. The Forces of Light trium phe d because the Hierarchy was forced to intervene pot ently, and, with the aid of certain great Lives extraneous to our planetary life, They brought the Atlantean civilisation to an abrupt e nd after a long period of chaos and disaster. This took place through the medium of a culminating catastrophe which wiped hundr eds of thous ands of hum an beings off the face of the earth. This historical event has been preserved for us in the uni versal lege nd of the great flood. Thos e who survived are sym bol ically spoke n of in the Bible as thos e who were saved in Noah's ark, and in the ancient writings it is expr essed in the follow ing terms: \"Like as a dragon snake unc oils slow ly its body, so the sons of m en, led on by the Sons of Wisdom , ope ned their folds and spreading out like a runni ng stream of sweet waters.... Many of the faint - hearted among them perished on their way. But most were saved.\" A close study of the tale as given in The Secret Doctrine w ill reveal the state of immature developm ent (from the angl e of our mode rn standa rds) and of the basically emotiona l and phys ical focus of the hum anity of the period; it will show also man's magical ability to subdue and cont rol the subhum an kingdom s and t he elemental forces of the planet. These are two angl es which have been but little studi ed. Empha sis has, how ever, been right ly placed upon divine interference and intervention; this succeeded in salvaging an ethically sound minor ity (the word \"spiritual\" woul d not yet appl y, except relatively) and in destroyi ng thos e who were wrong ly focussed or oriented and, therefore, dedicated to the life of material aspiration and perception. This nuc leus which was saved, formed the basis of our present ro ot race, the Aryan. The whol e theme of the Old Testam ent is bui lt around the developm ent and grow th of this nuc leus. Sym bol ically speaking, the inha bitants of the ark and their descenda nts and the Jewish race stand for the salvaged remnant of hum anity — salv aged in spite of themselves and in face of stupe ndous difficulties by the Great White Lodge . Two poi nts warrant attention here. The first and least impor tant from the standpoi nt of the soul is the disappe arance off the earth of practically all signs of th e wonde rful Atlantean civilisation except for thos e few archaeologi cal treasures which intrigue and interest mode rn research workers, plus thos e dim memories of ancient scientific achievement which lead the mode rn stude nt to inve stigation and inve ntion, an d which incite him to discove ry and the produc tion of what we call the trium phs of mode rn science. The second poi nt is that for the good of hum anity, the Hierarchy withdrew into the backgr ound, leaving man to find his ow n way out of the mirage and illusio n of materialism in right ways and eventually to bring to an end the ancient cleavages. War must be brought to its final cons um mation and expr ession with a view to its final discarding as a means of arriving at desired ends ."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST The Mode rn Era I woul d like to pause here and remind you of one or two poi nts which shoul d be recogni sed as we appr oach this mode rn era in which all these culminating effects are taking place. Let me state them conc isely and clearly. The lines of cleavage between materialism and spi rituality (as we now unde rstand the terms) have becom e increasingl y clear. Two things have tende d to bring this about . First, the pronounc ement of the Ten Com mandm ents. These, though negative in their form and dog matic in their attitude , have made the issu es and the requi red attitude s adequa tely clear. Owing to the relatively low stage of the uni versal hum an intelligence at the time that they were given (for the Biblical dates are not correct and the date of their pronounc ement is far older than is thought ) they were expr essed by the formula, \"Thou shalt not ,\" thus turning hum an attention to the material expr ession of material tende ncies. In days to com e, the Ten Com mandm ents will be expr essed in a reversed form of which the Sermon on the Mount an d the Beatitude s are the embryoni c form. Second, the Hierarchy withdr ew in order that hum anity, on reaching maturity and years of discretion, shoul d not be handi cappe d and hinde red by coercion and undue safegua rding but shoul d expr ess its major divine cha racteristics. Of these, free will and the discriminating use of the mind are the out standi ng qua lities. There was no free will in Atlantean days. There is a tende ncy to free will (note that term) toda y and we call it liberty and inde pendence, freedom of th ought and the right of the indi vidua l to determine the issues which cont rol or shoul d cont rol the group of which he is a part. These are all attribut es and qua lities of free will but not the divine principle of free will per se. Of that we know as yet but little. Only the disciples of the world and the initiates know the true signi ficance and implications of freedom of choi ce, and the right use of the will, and this because they are motivated by group good and the need of the majority. The test to which hu manity was to be subj ected and which is toda y the cont rolling factor was whether — given mental developm ent and know ledge — it woul d cons ecrate that know ledge and its scientific and mental attainm ent to group good or to selfish ends , to material issues or to s piritual incentives and impul ses. This ancient conf lict has now been carried through into anot her field of human expr ession, that of the mind and — as the race has progr essed and the persona lities of hum an beings have reached a high stage of integration and achievement — the conf lict has becom e acute, the issues clearer and the rangi ng of the oppone nts into two clearly defined groups is now so com plete that the final struggl e has becom e pos sible. Intelligent appr eciation of the situation and a gener al capacity to present to the mind the unde rlying condi tions has now been achieved by the bulk of the intelligent peopl e upon the planet and, though the poi nt of view is necessarily colour ed by nationa l traditions , inhe rited ideas and pol icies as well as b y envi ronm ental cont rol and bias, the race has gone a long way tow ards its final emancipation. There is, therefore, a certain measure of free will displayed, and this cons titutes an entirely new factor and a most satisfactory developm ent. But I woul d remin d you of a most impor tant poi nt and that is that the masses of the peopl e — the middl e classes, the bour geoisie and the proletariat (I use these words in their general sense and simply because of their signi ficance and meaning) — are still victims of author ity , of cont rol, and remain relatively unt hinking and childlike. This means that the true conf lict is between a small minor ity to whom the issues are illum inatingly clear and who have definitely range d themselves"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST on one side or other of the embattled forces. A mere handf ul of men, the direct descenda nts or rather the reincarnations of the leaders in the ancient Atlantean conf lict, are now on earth, directing the forces of light or of darkne ss and bringi ng into being a direct line - up of millions of men whos e wi ll is that of their leaders. The lines of cleavage have grow n steadily unt il now they can be expr essed in terms of a hum anity which is oriented tow ards the highe r spiritual and altruistic values and whos e keynot es are sacrifice, group good and world unde r standi ng, and thos e whos e focus is predom inantly material and whos e aims are selfish, animated by ambition and the spirit of acqui sition. It was the acuteness of this situation, and the wide extent of the cleavage, which induc ed the watching Hierarchy to permit a direct inflow of the Shamballa force (in spite of its attenda nt risks) to pour into the world. The obj ective was to stimulate the free will of the masses; the result upon them has been relatively good as it has led to the formulation and expr essio n of the great world ideologi es — Fascism, Democracy and Com muni sm as well as that peculiarly distorted blend of Fascism and Com muni sm which goe s by the name of Hitlerism or Nazism. All these ideologi es are fostered by the desire of the masses for the betterment of the condi tion in which the popul ace in any count ry lives and it has becom e focussed, expr essive and creative by the force of the Shamballa influence. But anot her result of this inflow of the will - to - pow er has been to stimulate a certain group of out standi ng persona lities in many lands so that they have assum ed cont rol of the masses and can thus determine the pol icies and methods — religious , pol itical and social — of the different nations . In every nation a relatively small group of peopl e de cide all impor tant issues and determine all major nationa l activities. This they do either by force, terror and deception or by persuasion, fair words and the appl ication of ideologi cal motives. Of this situation in the world the Lords of Destiny are avail ing themselves in order to bring the ancient conf lict to an end and so enable hum anity to pass into the new Aqua rian Age relatively free and with a clearer unde rstandi ng of right hum an aims, right relations hips and man's predestined future. It will serve no purpos e for me to trace the relation of the present world conf lict and the present world leaders to the conf lict and the leaders in Atlantean times. Suffice it to say that many of the same persona lities (on a highe r turn of the spiral) are again playing their various parts in the great drama. It is no service to you and to your mental grip upon the situation for me to empha sise the details of that great war and its mode rn corresponde nces; it is of no value for me to com pare the old methods and the mode rn usages whereby one side or the other carries forward the struggl e for supr emacy. You are in no pos ition to verify what I say or to check the accuracy of my statements. The poi nt which is, how ever, of major impor tance is for you to arrive at a clear und ers tandi ng of what is at stake and a just appr eciation of the values invol ved and also a correct grasp of the ideals animating the two groups of oppone nts. In Atlantean days, it was stated that the battle was between the Forces of Darkness (the so - called \"Black Lodge of Adepts\") and the Forces of Light (the so - called Great White Lodge , the Hierarchy of Masters). That was then appr oxi mately true, for the conf lict was between two small groups and the masses of the peopl e were simply the blind and mis erable victims of the fight and of the situation. Toda y, it is not pos sible to make such a clear distinction between the forces enga ged, nor is it prope rly adm issible. No nation or group of nations can be classed in a broad generalisation as either black or white. Bear this in mind. Only thos e with no vision and an intolerant and prejudi ced spirit will speak thus . All nations have within them thos e who belong in their thous ands to the categor y of thos e who are swayed by the Forces of Light and who, therefo re, respond nor mally and easily to the conc ept of goodw ill, to the desire for right relations hip between all men and to the ideal of true internationa l and"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST world unde rstandi ng. In all nations there are thos e to whom this pos ition makes no appe al at all and they are still in darkne ss and blinde d to the true issues. This is a statement of fact. Thos e who seek to see the establishm ent of goodw ill and unde rstandi ng are in the majority but are — as I pointed out in earlier writings — relatively futile to cont rol the situation as yet or to force their leaders to follow the mass will - to - good. They are either inspired or protected by the Hierarchy of Light and it is with them that the task of stimulating the free expr ession of this goodw ill must be carried forward when the conf lict ends . As for the other group, they are thos e who through inclination or ancient karma are the descenda nts of the Lords of darkne ss; their actions and ideals make pos sible the activity of the forces of materialism. I woul d have you not e that p hrasing. Even the most dange rous of them are nevertheless cons cious of som e form or anot her of idealism, but they are misgui ded and full of respons e to the will - to - pow er (pow er upon the phys ical plane and through the medium of form activity). This is stimu lated by the inflow of the Shamballa energy. Because of these reactions and tende ncies, they cons titute focal poi nts for thos e Lives and Energies which are inhe rent in matter itself and whos e influence and work are dedicated to the preservation of form, and of that which is . They ende avour cons tantly to negate the new and to hol d back the evol ution and developm ent of the hum an cons cious ness. Forget not that the real issue is in the field of cons cious ness and that the struggl e is between form and the life within the form, and between progress, leading to the liberation of the hum an spirit, and reactiona ry activity, leading to the imprisonm ent of the human cons cious ness and the restriction of its free expression. I woul d pause here and solemnly beg you not to make the lines of cleavage wider by placing your self, and all who follow you r form of ideology , upon the side of the Forces of Light and all other peopl e and their ideologi es, with which you may not agree, upon the side of the Forces of Darkne s s. The issue is, in the last analysis, the right to expr ess the will - to - good, the right to expr ess hum an relations hips, unt rammelled by territorial barriers and nationa l habits of thought ; it invol ves the right and the felt necessity to shew love to all be ings and thus stamp out all hate and separateness. It conc erns the right of all nations to live at peace with their neighbou rs and harmoni ous ly with each other and to expr ess the true and subj ective synt hesis of hum anity, and not place nationa l pos sessions , front iers, culture, pow er and ambition before the general good and the happi ness of the world of men. This is the real and unde rlying issue. All the nationa l challenge s and patriotic calls are simply the attempts of the leaders everyw here to hol d the peo ple to a particular line of thought and of action. To make the world safe for democracy, to gain room to live, to defend the rights of little nations , to preserve the balance of pow er, to meet force with force, to restore ancient and historical bounda ries, to impos e som e culture deemed desirable, to prevent econom ic destruction, to cons erve nationa l stakes and interests are all the talking poi nts of the leaders toda y. But the real issue is the intangi ble one of Direction. Which way will hum anity go? Will it go the way of selflessness, expr essed in a willingne ss to act always in the interests of all, thus promoting world unde rstandi ng and world uni ty, or the way of selfishne ss and aggr ession, expr essed in an intense nationa lism, thus sacrificing th e true and larger values of liberty, inde pende nce and freedom to think. This selfishne ss may show itself through active aggr ession or an active neutrality . Thos e nations who participate in no way in this strugg le will lose much and — enha ncing their ow n self ish struggl e and cloudi ng the real issue in beautiful words — will help to prolong the struggl e and hol d back their ow n peopl e from useful oppor tuni ty. I woul d poi nt out here also that as in all families, business and organisations there are thos e who are t he focal poi nts of author ity and the designe rs of the planne d activities, so within that group or organised body which goe s by the name of hum anity there are similar focal poi nts or thos e who plan, direct and produc e the out er happe nings and events. They a re in the period of personal ity achievement — that time"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST in which hum an beings , having achieved integration and a blende d expression of feeling and perception and mind, are actively and effectively working upo n the phys ical plane. These focal poi nts are used to bring about two major change s in the world; the first is the fusion and blendi ng of peopl es and minor ities so that coordinated empires and cultural nations are appe aring everyw here and, secondl y, the changi ng of front iers and the altering of bounda ries so that a com plete re - adjustment of the map of the world in Asia, Europe and Africa can take place. It will be appa rent to you that three major methods or mode s of produc ing these fusions can be not ed. Great Britain, the United States of America and the U nion of Socialist Sovi et Republ ics (the U.S.S.R.) are working out the principle of federation, of relation and of the fusion of bodi es into conc entrated whol es, respondi ng to the same inspiration but employi ng their ow n specialised methods to bring about t he desired ends . Be not surprised by my includi ng Russia in this triplicity. Their ideology is funda mentally as sound as that in the other groups , but the difference lies in the factors of persona lity and the mode of appl ying the ideology . The c ont rol of pow erful and dange rous persona lities, and the use of the methods of force and cruelty have been avoi ded in the first two groups of nations , and the reason is based upon the different sour ce of the inspiration produc ing the effects. Anot her reason is to be found in the placing of pow er in the hands of those who are historically unp repared to rule and of thos e whos e past unf oldm ent has as yet brought them onl y to the nur sery stage of evol ution. Nevertheless in these three groups there is much of in terest to be not ed. One of them, Great Britain, represents a fusion, the founda tions of which have been laid in a long historical pas t of preparation for gove rnm ent; anot her, that of the U.S.A. represents a fusion which is unfolding and developi ng in the p resent which is new in its expe riments, though employi ng factors from every nation in Europe ; the U.S.S.R. in its turn represents a com ing fusion or future synt hesis. In these three, you have an interesting and immediate expr ession of the three divine aspe cts, each of which inspires and colour s the embryoni c civilisation. Great Britain expr esses the will - to - pow er but on account of age and expe rience, dearly bought , this is toda y mellow ed by justice and a grow ing unde rstandi ng of hum an need. This, in its tur n, is the result of the cont rol for many centuries in the past by the aristocracy , with its paternalism, cons ervatism and its method of slow adjustment. The U.S.A. expresses the will - to - love , which show s itself in an ability to absorb vastly divergent elem ents and yet to present equa l oppo rtunity to all. This is brought about very largely because the cont rol is, in this federation of states, in the hands of the bour geoisie , with its financial goa ls, its pow er to determine living condi tions , and its qui ck an d sym pathetic touc h upon life. Its method is not that of slow adjustment but of quick assimilation. It is in that count ry also that peopl e are most sensitive to the influence of the Hierarchy. The U.S.S.R. expr esses the will - to - create and to pro duc e new condi tions and a new order — planne d and determined and foreseen. This has been brought about through cruelty very often, by a willingne ss to com prom ise and to change or low er the original ideal. This, in its turn, is brought about by the activity o f the proletariat with its inability to gove rn, its desire to retaliate, and its igno rance of tradition and of inhe rited procedur es. A most interesting expe riment is, therefore, working out in these three groups of interrelated elements and differing nati ona l ideals. The U.S.S.R. will eventually place its empha sis and direct its major interest upon Asia, bringi ng about great change s on that cont inent, as far as the Pacific The other, Great Britain, through its successful demons tration of the principle of f ederation, can affect major change s in Europe if there is an awakened insight , a true and sym pathetic justice and wise patience. The U.S.A. has a similar task to perform for the Americas, calling for statesmanship of a high order and a spirit of unde rstand ing. "},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST It will also be appa rent to you if you have right ly unde rstood the above sugge stions that the Sham bal la force is working through that com munity of federated nations called the British Empire and is expr essing the will - tow ards - synt hesis and the will t o just and legal procedur e. It is the force of the Hierarchy which can expr ess itself increasingl y through the United States of America, for an intuitive recogni tion of subj ective realities and a real sense of the highe r values can and freque ntly do cont ro l the impul ses gove rning this group of federated states. The will - to - be of Hum ani ty with its almost extravagant empha sis upon hum an values and the will - to - rule creatively is the cont ribut ion of the U.S.S.R., that great federation of republ ics. Thus the inf luence of the three great world centres about which I have earlier written can be seen expr essing itself throug h these three groups of nations . At the same time, the Shamballa force is active in all of them, for it produc es federation and synt hesis. Its fi rst great expr ession or demons tration of the spirit of fusion took place in the 18t h and 19t h centuries, and led to the formation of such count ries as Italy and Germany which were created out of many smaller states, duc hies and kingdom s. A histo ry of the trend tow ards fusion in the mode rn world woul d prove a most illum inating study . It woul d be found that the first faint indications were felt around 1575 A.D. This was due to the fact that permission for the inflow of this force was given when dem ande d at the Centenni al Conf erence of the Hierarchy, held in 1425. I referred to this conf erence in my earlier writings . 5 A Treatise on White Magi c , pp. 401 - 433. A Treatise on the Seven Rays , Vol. I (Esoteric Psychol ogy ) , pp. 170 - 189 .* In the second group of changi ng ideologi es and of reaction to mass need, you will find France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Portuga l, all of whom have altered their ancient pol icies, change d their forms of gove rnm ent and reacted gradua lly and slowly to the Shamballa force. They have, how ever, reacted to that force through the medium of certain great and outstandi ng persona lities who were peculiarly sensitive to the will - to - pow er and the will - to - change and who (dur ing the past 150 years) have altered the character of their nation al life, and empha sised increasingl y the wider hum an values. The men who inspired the initiating French revol ution; the great conque ror, Napol eon; Bismarck, the creator of a nation; Mussolini, the regenerator of his peopl e; Hitler who lifted a distressed p eopl e upo n his shoul ders; Lenin, the idealist, Stalin and Franco are all expr essions of the Shamballa force and of certain little unde rstood energies. These have wrought signi ficant change s in their day and generation and altered the face of Europe , incide ntally affecting Asia and condi tioni ng attitude s and pol icies in America. The results even when dange rous and terrible, have develope d two vital characteristics in hum anity. One has been the widespread developm ent of the discriminating faculty, and second ly, a tende ncy to dispersion with its cons eque nces of diffusing civilised and cultural values and the diverse gifts of the many peopl e to the world soul . The drift of peopl e to the coloni es from Great Britain, the drift of the peopl e from every nation in Europe to America, North and South, the dispersal of peopl e within nationa l bounda ries as the result of war and expe diency such as the evacuation of cities has brought about toda y, the remova l of peopl e out of Italy and of groups of peopl e within Russia, and the cons tant movi ng onw ards of the wande ring Jews indi cate a breaking dow n, upon a world - wide scale, of all out er bounda ries and the institution of a process of blending and amalgamation such as the world has never seen before. It cons titutes an educ ationa l system of unt old value, leading as it doe s to the cons tant necessity to readjust viewpoi nts, to change mode s of living, to intermarriage and so - called illicit relations . The out er change is produc ing an inne r synt hesis and out er dispersion, and cleavages are working out interiorly in closer relations and a more tolerant spirit of unde rstandi ng. The pow er to cons ider, to choos e, to think and to discriminate is rapidly developi ng among all classes everyw here as a result of the many cataclysmic happe nings , the presentation of many changi ng circum stances and the many poi nts of view and theories of gove rnment and of religion; these grow naturally out of new"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST cont acts and the rapid presentation of events through the medium of the press and the radio. It is this that is of importance from the standpoi nt of evol ution and the grow th of the world cons cious ness. The phys ical plane happe nings are incidental and of no permanent lasting pow er. The phys ical plane events and precipitations are carried forward and made pos sible through focal poi nts of energy who are the world dictators, the world statesmen, and the out standi ng hum an beings in all lands as well as by groups which are actively working in every count ry for their ow n ends or — as is more often the ca se — unde r the influence of som e group ideal or wisdom plus persona l ambition, persona l will - to - pow er and persona l aggr andi sement. We call these peopl e dictators, demagogue s, inspired leaders, or just and wise men, according to our peculiar ideolo gy, tradition, attitude s to our fellow men and our particular pol itical, econom ic and religious training. But all these leaders are simply hum an beings and like other men — idealistic, mistaken, love rs of their count ry, egoi sts, impressiona ble, fool ish, cunni ng, pow erful, focussed on som e goa l or ambition, with clear vision and at the same time myopi c reactions , cruel or wise as the case may be — but , in the last analysis, highl y develope d persona lities. They are being used to engi neer great and needed change s a nd to alter the face of civilisation. The wrong methods employe d and the evil things done are the fault of hum anity as a whol e, and of the habits of though t which have made manki nd selfish and cruel and cause this great and uni versal spirit of the will - to - change to manifest so pow erfully and cruelly. Blame not the persona lities invol ved or the men who produc e these events before which we stand today bewildered and appa lled. They are onl y the produc t of the past and the victims of the present. At the same t ime, they are the agents of destiny, the creators of the new order and the initiators of the new civilisation; they are the destroye rs of what must be destroye d before hum anity can go forward along the Light ed Way. They are the embodi ment of the personal it y of hum ani ty. Blame your selves, therefore, for what is toda y transpiring and seek not to evade respons ibility by placing it upon the shoul ders of spectacular men or any statesmen, dictator or upon any group. Look not to one person or to one group of perso ns and accuse them of causing the present world condi tion. Look not also to any one person or group to bring liberation or to find a solution of the world probl em. That is for hum anity itself to do. Hum anity must take action and will do so, when the right time com es. To recogni se joint respons ibility, joint mistakes, ancient errors of judgm ent, wrong attitude s and habits of thought , world - wide selfish pur pos e and intent, a uni versal spirit of aggr ession which, dow n the ages, has influenced first one nation and then anot her, the tende ncy last century to crystallise and becom e static, the reactiona ry forces on every hand — these are uni versal qua lities and no nation and no race is free of gui lt or has entirely clean hands . Also, no one nationa l group is purely wrong and evil or pur ely good and uns elfish. There are mixed motives everyw here. Nationa lism, aggression, selfishne ss and cruelty in all count ries face a desire for world unde rstandi ng, peaceful relations , and an uns elfish and beneficent spirit a lso in all count ries. The Forces of Light find their adhe rents and their workers in every count ry though som e are subj ected to greater handi caps in expr ession than others. So also do the Forces of Materialism. And in between these two great groups stand th e masses — waiting for the emergence of fresh oppor tuni ty and new revelations . It is the uni versality of these condi tions and the clear - cut issues that have made this period one of planetary oppor tuni ty and planetary initiation. Initiation is essentially a movi ng out from unde r ancient cont rols into the cont rol of more spiritual and increasingl y highe r values. Initiation is an expa nsion of cons cious ness which leads to a grow ing recogni tion of the inne r realities. It is equa lly the recogni tion of a renewed se nse of the need for change and the wise engi neering of these needed change s so that real progr ess can be made; the cons cious ness is expande d and becom es more generous ly and divinely"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST inclusive and there is a fresh and more pot ent cont rol by the soul as it a ssum es increasingl y the direction of the life of the indi vidua l, of a nation and of the world. In the last analysis, and from the standpoi nt of the Hierarchy, the present conf lict between the persona lity of hum anity (expr essing the material values as the dom inating factor in life expe rience) and the soul of humanity (expressing the spiritual values as the dom inating factor in human affairs) is identical with the conflict which takes place within a hum an being's cons cious ness when he has reached the stage o f discipleship and is faced with the probl em of the pairs of oppos ites. This conf lict is expr essed in many ways according to the poi nt of view and the backgr ound of thought . It can be called the conf lict between Christ and anti - Christ but not as thos e who usually employ thos e phr ases unde rstand them. No one nation is expr essive of the spirit of anti - Christ, just as no one nation expr esses the spirit of Christ. Christ and anti - Christ are the dualities of spirituality and materialism, bot h in the i ndi vidua l and in hum anity as a whol e. Or you can speak of God and the Devil with the same basic implications . For what is man himself but an expr ession of divinity (God) in a material form (the Devil), and what is matter but the medium through which divini ty must eventually manifest in all its glory? But when that takes place, matter will no longe r be a cont rolling factor but simply a medium of expr ession. The battle is therefore on between the form side of life and the soul . The Dweller on the Threshol d (t he threshol d of divinity, my brothers) is hum anity itself with its ancient habits of thought , its selfishne ss and greed. Hum anity toda y stands face to face with the Ange l of the Presence — the Soul Whos e nature is love and light and inclusive unde rstandi ng. The great probl em toda y is which of these two will emerge the victor out of the conf lict, and which of these two great agencies of life will determine hum anity's future and indi cate the way which hum anity will decide to go. The issues at stake are clear t o all right - thinki ng peopl e. Intolerance and an intense nationa l pride and self - satisfaction can blind men to the facts of the case toda y, but there are enough peopl e thinki ng clearly to make the future of right decision more proba ble than at any previous time in the history of the race. Prepar ation for World Goodw ill The causes of the present war are ancient. This historical seque nce of the predispos ing factors can be clearly traced in the exot eric records of all nations as well as in the esoteric recor ds of the Hierarchy. The inhe rent human qua lities which have led to the developm ent of the present war are well know n. All who are cons cious of and obs ervers of the war within their ow n natures, between persona lity selfishne ss and the selflessne ss of the soul , are aware of the implications and the corresponde nces. Where then lies the solution? What must be done to arrest the fires of hate and of aggr ession, of revenge and of fear? What also must be done to prepare for that time when the rebui ldin g of the world of men and the inaugur ation of the new and better civilisation arrives? With this we might now briefly deal. As regards active participation in the work to be done in preparing the world for the expr ession of goodw ill, there is little to be done of an active exot eric nature at this time; it is necessary to wait with patience and to see what is goi ng to happe n and along what lines the activity of the nations will run. But there is very much to be done of an esoteric and a preparatory nature a nd it is this which I seek to impress upon your minds . "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Up to date and in spite of appe arances, the Forces of Light are victorious and are definitely hol ding things steady. It is for this reason that not hing has yet que nched the spirit of goodw ill and of s ym pathetic unde rstandi ng which exists among the peopl es of all nations , not excludi ng Germany; this has been the out standi ng signi ficant characteristic of the present conf lict. There is little hate or vindi ctiveness to be found, and this fact cons titutes t he difference between this war and the last, in 1914. It indi cates a trium ph for the Forces of Light and in it lies the hope of the future. It is here, how ever, that the time factor must be cons idered, for a prolonge d war may cause a change in this desirab le attitude , and much drastic expe rience may produc e deep psychol ogi cal and una voi dable change s in hum an thought and action. This must be cons cious ly offset. It has not yet occurred but it coul d happe n and if it doe s much pain, terror, fearful anticipation , suffering and the agony entailed by the sight of suffering might eventually turn this goodw ill into a dyna mic spirit of hate and revenge unl ess it is definitely and cons cious ly offset. Groups who are adhe ring to the principles of the Forces of Light , who are bendi ng every effort to end the spirit of aggr ession and to rid the world of the focal poi nts for material influence and pow er, must yet carry forward the task of bindi ng men and wom en of every nation toge ther in a spirit of lovi ng unde rsta ndi ng; they must interpret nation to nation in terms of brotherhood and of the new order. This is no easy thing to do at this time. The astral or emotiona l bod ies of hum an beings (which cons titute the astral body of hum anity as a whol e) are toda y in a sta te of chaos, and are swept by ancient desires, ancient and deep - seated selfish attitude s and by ancient hatreds. The task is also com plicated by the activity of the mental processes of man which is characterised by pronounc ed and develope d illusions , by se parative attitude s and by specious argum ents. But there are, at the same time, enough peopl e in the world who are respons ive to the spirit of goodw ill, of tolerant unde rstandi ng, and animated by a desire for permanent right hum an relations . I have earlier sugge sted to you 6 A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol II ( Esoteric Psychol ogy ), page 647. * that it shoul d be pos sible to have — at a later date — a world - wide recogni tion of a Day of Forgetfulness, of Forgiveness and of Fulfilment of the Biblical injunc tion to \"forget the things which lie behind and to press forward\" into the New Age, the new relationships and the new civilisation. For that time we can all begin to plan, and to work for that psychol ogi cal mom ent wherein this idea can be presented. It will com e i mmediately after the cessation of hos tilities. But toda y and in every land, where pos sible, the peopl es must be educ ated in this expr ession of human synt hesis and hum an interrelation. It invol ves, how ever, an empha sising of the values to which I have refe rred earlier in this article. This is hum anity's joint respons ibility because of hum anity's general mistakes, and the ancient wrong attitude s and cont rols. It invo lves, cons eque ntly, a steppi ng dow n from the pos ition of critics and assigne rs of respons ibility to that of a joint shoul dering of the stupe ndous task of changi ng present condi tions and of instituting thos e reversals of pol icy which will make a uni ted world order pos sible and beautiful. This is no easy task. It is one which calls all me n and wom en of goodw ill in the world toda y and challenge s them to prepare whilst the conflict is on for what can be done when it is ove r. I have given much in the past which can provi de a platform of obj ectives and of methods . Nothing that I have out lined is now abroga ted; onl y fulfilment is pos tpone d. For seven critical years, it lay in the hands of the spiritually minde d men of the world, in the hands of the Chur ches in all lands and of the men of goodw ill and of the world aspirants so to work that the p resent conf lict coul d have been avoi ded. But the spirit of Christ was lost in clerical organisation; empha sis has been laid upon techni cal theology; the spirit of goodw ill was not expr essed dyna mically and practically, but theoretically and negatively; the aspirants of the world had no true sense of values but were cont ent to give a little time"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST to the spiritual life and to other peopl e, but much time was lost in indi vidua l, persona l aims. A spirit of inertia settled dow n upon the better inclined and upon th e more unde rstandi ng peopl e; not hing that we coul d do served to arous e them to pow erful action or to sacrifice persona l tempor ary values to the lasting and uni versal values. The indi vidua l remained more important to himself than did the good of the whol e. Be not ove r - distressed, my brothers. You are not alone in this but part of a vast num ber, if that is to you any real satisfaction. But a renewed oppor tuni ty lies in front of you and it is of a practical nature, falling into definite sphe res of work and o f planne d activity. You are asked, first of all, to prepare for the great oppor tuni ty which will com e at the close of this conf lict, and 1. To expl ain clearly to all peopl e the cause which produc es the oppor tuni ty and which is dedicated to the endi ng of the present state of affairs. 2. To engi neer som e dramatic and uni versal event which will serve as the inspiration and the inaugur ation of the new era of goodw ill and of right hum an relations . Secondl y, to keep up a steady process of right thou ght , right interpretation of current events and a right preparation whilst the war lasts, so that any weakening of the gained spirit of goodw ill can be immediately offset, and so that unde rstandi ng can grow in pot ency and not suffer obs curation. In order t o bring this about , the follow ing activities are sugge sted beginni ng with thos e which conc ern the indi vidua l worker. 1. A close persona l watch ove r every word said or written, so that not hing said or written by any of you will have in it hate or bias of t he wrong kind and your minds and hearts will be kept clear of all unde sirable reactions . This is the persona l and practical thing to do and the difficult task set before each of you who read my words. 2. Study and appr ehend clearly the issues which lie be hind this conf lict, so that there is no inne r wavering as to the right ness of the side on which your interests lie — the side of the Forces of Light . Parallel this with an unde rstandi ng appr eciation of the probl em of thos e who are bewildered by the empha sis and the dyna mic activities of thos e through whom the Forces of materialism are working. At the same time, also, kill out all hateful criticism in your minds . 3. Ende avour to use the follow ing formula or mantram every day. It is a mode rnised and mystically worded version of the one which was used widely in Atlantean days dur ing the period of the ancient conf lict of which the present is an effect. For many of you this mantram will be in the nature of a recove ry of an old and well - know n form of wor ds: \"The sons of men are one and I am one with them. I seek to love not hate: I seek to serve and not exact due service. I seek to heal, not hurt. \"Let pain bring due reward of light and love . Let the soul cont rol the out er form and life and all events, and bring to light the love which unde rlies the happe nings of the time. Let vision com e and insight ; let the future stand revealed. Let inne r uni on demons trate and out er cleavages be gone . Let love prevail. Let all men love .\""},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST These words may seem inadequa te, but said with pow er and an unde rstandi ng of their signi ficance and with the pot ency of the mind and heart behind them, they can prove unbe lievably pot ent in the life of the one who says them. They will produc e also an effect in his envi ronm ent, and the accum ulated effects in the world, as you spread the know ledge of the formula, will be great and effective. It will change attitude s, enlight en the vision and lead the aspirant to fuller service and to a wider coope ration based upon sacrifice. My brothers, you cannot evade the sacrifice in the long run, even if you have evaded it unt il now . 4. Then appl y you rselves to the spreading of the use of the Great Invoc ation and help to carry forward the plan for distribut ion. The Great Invoc ation, as you will see in the next article which I am writing for your information, is a pot ent solar instrum ent designe d to bring about change s and needed readjustments. It is so pow erful that when it was sugge sted for general use in the world of men som e oppos ition was evoke d among the members of the Hierarchy because They feared its pot ent effects upon the unr eady, and unde velope d peopl e. Its use has, how ever, been justified and it is desired that its usefulness shoul d be very greatly increased and its use far more widely spread. 5. I woul d have you in your ow n way prepare for a major spiritual effort which is to take place when this conf lict has worn itself out and som e measure of peace and calm has com e about . Each of you has your ow n sphe re of influence and of co ntacts and each of you is in touc h with similarly minde d or enqui ring peopl e, with groups and chur ches, clubs , organisations and societies which are pledge d to som e form of effort tow ards hum an betterment, of goodw ill effort, and of ende avour of som e kind tow ards hum an welfare. Now is the time for much work to be done with the leaders and senior workers in such groups and with peopl e who can be prepared by each of you for active effort when the right time com es. To this task I call each of you . Later you ca n swing these peopl e into active goodw ill work and to effort which will tend to world unde rstandi ng and fusion. You can with them bring about the healing of the wounds of humanity which will be greatly needed and for which you can now prepare. You can get in touc h with such peopl e, keep records of names and addr esses and capacity to serve and help, establish group cont acts and so systematise your work that when the call goe s out (as it did in 1936) there will be found available to the organisers a wealth of ready cont acts and of interested and prepared peopl e who will then work intelligently to establish the new order. 6. The instructions in my earlier pamphl ets remain as before and shoul d be carefully follow ed in preparation for a campaign at the close of hos tilities. Mailing lists can be gradua lly brought alive by judi cious corresponde nce and new lists can be com piled; the Great Invoc ation can be increasingl y used if the method out lined by me is studi ed and right ly organised by each of you, and so the good will already present in the world can be brought to a point of dyna mic livingne ss, ready for later use. But, my brothers, not hing can be done unl ess you do it. THE GREAT INVOCATION - Stan za One Let the Forces of Light bring illum ination to al l manki nd. Let the Spirit of Peace be spread abroad. May men of goodw ill everyw here meet in a spirit of coope ration. May forgiveness on the part of all men be the keynote at this time. Let pow er attend the efforts of the Great Ones."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST So let it be and help u s to do our part. Octobe r 1939 In my last article, I sugge sted giving you som e facts anent the Great Invoc ation and som e expl anation of its signi ficance and meanings . These may enable the occult stude nts in the world toda y to use it with greater fervou r and with greater unde rstandi ng and, cons eque ntly, with greater success. There are several such mantric formulas and Words of Pow er in use by such stude nts but they fail to accom plish very much because the person using them has no real unde rstandi ng of the ir impor t and pur pos e and is usually so focussed in his emotiona l, aspirationa l, astral nature that all that he says and doe s (in conne ction with such Words of Pow er) is entirely innoc uous and futile. Words of Pow er, ancient mantrams (such as the Lord's Pr ayer) and the Great Invoc ation are onl y effective if used upon the mental plane and with the pow er of a cont rolled mind — focussed on their intent and meaning — behind the spoke n effort. They then becom e pot ent. When said with the pow er of the soul as well as with the directed attention of the mind, they autom atically becom e dyna mically effective. Stude nts all the world ove r have for years used the Sacred Word, and have sounde d the O.M. with great diligence. I woul d like here to ask: With what results? I mysel f will reply. With practically no results except a slight stimulation of the aspiration and a small awakening of the creative imagination. This means that the results achieved have had effect onl y within the aur a of the person conc erned and have not penetr ated into his envi ronm ent or produc ed any recogni sable effects. The O.M. is pot ent and dyna mically effective when right ly used and will produc e change s, destroy that which must be eliminated or ende d, and will bui ld in, by attraction and cons oli dation that which is desired into the fabric of the group life , produc ing incidentally (though none the less certainly) needed change s and the wise recons truction of the indi vidua l life. Ponde r upon this. If the above is true of the O.M. and of its group effects, it is infinitely more true of the Great Invoc ation. Words of Pow er (and this is true also of the O.M.) are all of second ray origin. This is the ray of the manifestation of cons cious ness. They are, therefore, intende d for soul use because the soul is the expr ession of the second aspect of divinity, and onl y the soul can really employ these Words and sounds and thus produc e the desired results which are always in line with the divine Plan. It is freque ntly forgot ten that they must be used by the sou l in a dyna mic manne r, invol ving the serious recogni tion of the will aspect . The Great Invoc ation, the O.M. and all such Words of Pow er must go forth from the soul (whos e nature is love and whos e pur pos e is solely group good) , backed by or \"occultly prope l led forth\" (to use a translation of an almost unt ranslatable occult idea) by the dyna mic will aspect, and carried out wards as an integrated thought form upon a stream of living, illum ined mental subs tance. This process therefore brings into activity the wil l, the love and the intelligence of the man who is using these words and formulas. Freque ntly, how ever, an hiatus occurs even when a man has integrated these three cont rolling factors within himself as far as he is able to do so at his particular poi nt in evol ution. All that he has succeeded in doi ng is the retaining of the created thought form upon the mental plane; he fails to make its presence felt upon the phys ical plane and to achieve the desired results because his brain (the low er receiving and distri but ing centre within the head) is incapable of the needed dua l activity — retaining awareness of the intent, meaning and pur pose of the formula being used and, at the same time, carrying on the task of sendi ng forth the pot ency, hidde n yet conve ye d by the Words or sounds . These two activities must be carried on simultaneous ly by the soul on its ow n plane through the medium of the mind and the brain. Here again is one of the obj ectives of all meditation work but one which is not empha sised as it is a seque ntial happe ning and"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST not an obj ective. Effectiveness is, therefore, dependent upon a grasp of the above facts and a develope d and trained integration between soul , mind, desire, brain and the spoke n Word or sound . What I am here telling you refers n ot onl y to the use of the Great Invoc ation but also to the daily and cons tant use of the Sacred Word by occult stude nts and aspirants in their daily meditation. They coul d change their lives, reorient their life purpos e and focus, and achieve spiritual unf oldm ent and expa nsion if they coul d use the OM as it shoul d be used. The Great Invoc ation, right ly used by the many hund red thous and peopl e who have already attempted to use it, coul d reorient the cons cious ness of hum anity, stabilise men in spiritual being , disrupt and rebui ld the planetary thought form which men have created in the past and which has had (and is having) such disastrous and cataclysmic results, and ope n the door into the New Age, thus ushering in the new and better civilisation. This coul d b e done so rapidly, that the needed change s woul d com e about almost ove rnight ; the present reign of horror woul d end and the race of men coul d settle dow n to a life of group goodw ill, indi vidua l harmlessness and right hum an relations . Nevertheless, for you r encour agement, I woul d state that the use of it has materially hastened world events, even though it has definitely stirred up a great deal of the troubl e and brought it into manifestation upon the phys ical plane. The basically selfish pur pos e (even if u nrecogni sed) of thos e who have used the Great Invoc ation has served to stimulate the selfish pur pos es of the forces of materialism. I woul d ask you: How many used the Great Invoc ation in a pur ely detached, spiritually pot ent and fully unde rstandi ng manne r? The merest handf ul. How many sent forth the Great Invoc ation in a spirit of pur e love and with a com pletely unbi ased attitude ? Very few inde ed. How many sounde d it out through the medium of a cont rolled mind, with a recogni tion and deep belief that it embodi ed the will of the planetary Logos and must, therefore, becom e dyna mically effective upon the phys ical plane? Hardly more than a tiny handf ul. Most of thos e who used it were intrigue d by its nove lty, or felt it to be com prehensive though in a n unrealisable manne r, or cons idered it must be occultly effective because they heard that it emanated from a member of the Hierarchy, was used by the occult Hierarchy of the planet, and was endor sed by thos e they trusted, or because — foremost reason of all — anyt hing that coul d make the world nicer, more com fortable, happi er and provide eventually easier living condi tions must be at least tried; it did not take long to say and was proba bly well worth doi ng. But the dyna mic pow er behind the effort in indi vidua l cases has often been persona l self - interest, distress at the existing terrible and unha ppy world condi tions and an emotiona l reaction at pain and horror and fear. In many ways, this has been a nor mal reaction to world tension and was to be expe cted. The standa rd that I have indi cated above is, I well know , too high and too impos sible for the average aspirant, and most peopl e are average. But the world need is such that they must now swing out of the nor mal and, for the sake of service, height en their cons cious ness and work more definitely from a highe r plane of awareness. I am seeking toda y all ove r the world for a group of aspirants and disciples who can and will use the Great Invoc ation in the right way and who will be willing, cons eque ntly, to be train ed to do so. In this way there will be a group upon the phys ical plane and in everyda y life who will be able to com bine their efforts with thos e of the Hierarchy and thus produc e an effective use of the Great Invoc ation with its stupe ndous results. I woul d remind you that for the pur pos e of developing hum an will and hum an freedom of action, motivated by group cons cious ness, the Hierarchy choos es to produc e the desired unf oldm ents and change s upon the phys ical plane onl y through the medium of a c ons cious and awakening hum anity. Such a hum anity (and it is rapidly com ing to this state of awareness through joint pain and suffering) will be impressed by and respons ive to the directed thought of the gui ding Elder Brothers of the race,"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST but will be free at all times to reject that impression and to proceed as they persona lly may choos e. There is no author itative cont rol ove r the minds of men assum ed or cultivated by the Hierarchy; all aspirants and disciples are free to choos e a different way to the one s ugge sted if they so prefer, or if they are unc onvi nced of the advi sability of the indi cated method of work, or fear the arduous task of carrying forward the stage of the plan which has been indi cated to them, or if they shirk the discipline implied and req uired by thos e who seek to make man correctly respons ive to spiritual cont act and teaching and so able right ly to interpret the intent of the Hierarchy. Ability to use the Great Invoc ation so that it may be effective can be develope d if thos e who are work ing along the lines of true meditation can make a beginni ng by the right use of the Sacred Word, which doe s not requi re such a sustained effort in occult conc entration. They must learn to breathe it forth in the manne r I have indi cated above when speaking of the Great Invoc ation, and must also learn to gauge its results in their indi vidua l lives, thus viewing thos e lives from the angl e of the trained spiritual Observer. I woul d like to touc h briefly and for a few minut es upon the signi ficance of the entire process and method of invoc ation. Much has been said and written in the past by the curious inve stigator and by thos e enga ged in magical work of any kind anent the use of invoc ation as it appl ies to elemental forces and subhum an agents, with the cons eque nt evoc ation of active agents and respons ible energies of som e kind or anot her upon the phys ical plane. What is oft forgot ten is that this process cons ists entirely of the produc tion of cont act and subs eque nt cont rol of the forces of earth, water, fire and air. This is one of the aims of the magical workers but it conc erns material nature and the cont rol of subs tance and, in the realm of the low er occultism, is allied to the invoc ation and evocation of mone y, good health and the tangi ble material results as practised in the realm of mysticism by many school s of thought . Note this, for it hol ds a clue to the relation of occultism and mysticism upon the low er levels of cons cious ness and indi cates the need of bot h groups to shift their focus of inter est and their empha sis on to the highe r and more spiritual values. The cont rol of the natural forces and the evoc ation of the desired material rewards will arrive nor mally and inevitably but as seconda ry effects; they will depend also upon the karma or des tiny of man recogni sed and cons idered, and the man will escape the dange r of being himself cont rolled and motivated by the forces of materialism, letting in — as this condi tion must — much that is evil and dange rous . The invoc ation, evoc ation and resultant ac tivity of the Hierarchy and of thos e Forces, Energies and Beings Who are not cont rolled by matter in any way, or by subs tance (the low er pol e of manifestation) but Who are related to the pos itive spiritual pol e is a new activity, and as yet relatively an u ntried expe riment on the part of hum anity and the formulas unknow n. Of what use was it to impart the formulas to humanity when it was as yet cont rolled by the low er values and una ble to lay hol d upon the soul aspect and to func tion on that level of cons cio usness whereon the soul is found . Only thos e can use the formulas effectively who live, work, think and feel as soul s, which means ever in group terms. Toda y, how ever, there are thos e in every land who are rapidly becom ing aware of the soul as a cont rollin g factor in cons cious ness, who respond to world affairs and condi tions increasingl y as soul s, and who can, therefore, be trained to work upon the phys ical plane. When this is so, it becom es pos sible to impart certain of these Words of Pow er and mantrams an d to institute that new and pot ent activity which will bring the Hierarchy and Hum anity into cons cious and direct coope ration, as well as Shamballa and certain great Forces which are interplanetary or solar, and also great cosmic Energies. It is now pos sible to discove r thos e who — being free within themselves and who are learning rapidly to"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST be detached and selfless — can institute and carry forward the task of invoki ng these highe r spiritual forces, thus reinforcing the efforts of the Great White Lo dge . It is this process of spiritual invoc ation which will motivate the new and com ing world religion. This is not magical invoc ation, as man unde rstands it, and which is conc erned with the invoc ation and cont rol of the subs tantial and elemental forces of the manifested world, but the invoc ation which will evoke cont act with the spiritual Lives and the divine embodi ed Energies as well as with the Hierarchy (which is Their intermediary) in order to bring about the manifestation on earth of the soul of hum ani ty and the qua lities of the subj ective and inne r divine life which all out er forms veil. This is now for the first time pos sible in the life of the planet. The obj ective of these processes of invoc ation is threefold: 1. To invoke the soul of hum anity and so bring about its freer expr ession upon the phys ical plane. This can be brought about in two ways: a. The stimulation of the soul s of men everyw here by the increased inflow of the Christ principle of love , which will expr ess itself in world unde rstandi n g, goodw ill, coope ration, and peace. b. The setting up of a vibration within humanity itself of such pot ency that it will magne tically attract a respons e from the waiting, watching Hierarchy and bring about a much closer and likewise cons cious rappor t bet ween the two planetary centres, the Hierarchy and Hum anity. This is called the invoc ation of the Great White Lodge . Much of this invoc ation of the Christ principle is carried forward by true believers in all lands (Christian and non - Christian) who addr ess themselves to the Christ, no matter unde r what name they recogni se Him and then, with love in their hearts to Him and their fellow men, seek to ameliorate world conditions , end hatred and misery and demons trate goodw ill everyw here. This refers t o the first stage of evoki ng the respons e to love and unde rstandi ng in hum an hearts and minds as the result of the invoc ation of the Christ and of the Christ principle. Pond er on these words and see on every hand the process goi ng forward. Esoteric stude nt s are apt to ove restimate the effectiveness of the work that they are doi ng. The focussed aspiration and the uns elfish struggl e to serve which characterises millions of peopl e in the world who do pray to, follow and seek to invoke the great spiritual head of the Hierarchy, the Master of all Masters, the Christ, has now reached a poi nt of true and real effectiveness. It may be, and usually is, unt inge d by much mental activity or intellectual perception of the implications or the scientific nature of their pr ocedur e but is, for that very reason, pot ent. Esoteric and occult students demons trate almost una voi dably a divided focus, ow ing to the activity of the mind and their failure as yet to blend perfectly bot h soul and persona lity. This leads to the dissipatio n of energy and oft rende rs their good intent futile. But, out of these groups are rapidly emerging thos e who can work in the right way and the results will be increasingl y effective. The evoc ation of the Hierarchy through right invoc ation is proceeding a lso rapidly, produc ing much activity and respons e from the Hierarchy of Light . 2. To set up a closer relation with the third, major divine centre on our planet, Shamballa. From that centre, the will of God goe s forth and the pow er of God becom es the messe nge r of His will. Hitherto that highe st form of spiritual energy has onl y reached hum anity (as I have before told you) via the Hierarchy. Toda y, it is deemed desirable that it shoul d be ascertained whether there are enough selfless and group - cons cious peop le upon the planet to warrant a direct inflow of that highe r energy to"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST hum anity, thus produc ing upon the phys ical plane a hastening of the divine plan and a more rapid working out of that which is to be. This direct cont act can be produc ed if the Great Inv ocation is used by the world aspirants and disciples in collabor ation with the Hierarchy. Hence the empha sis I have laid upon all of you using this Great Invoc ation as soul s and as thos e who are in touc h in som e small measure with the Hierarchy. When the not e of humanity and the note of the Hierarchy are sync hroni sed by the use of the Great Invoc ation, there will com e a dyna mic and immediate respons e from Shamballa, and that will rapidly take place which the Hierarchy and the world disciples desi re to see. The primary result of the correct use of the Great Invoc ation (as far as hum anity is conc erned) is acceleration. As I have also earlier poi nted out , such an acceleration carries with it its ow n risks, and cons eque ntly we have the appe arance of the truly terrific probl ems and the dire happe nings which have for many years ove rtaken the aspirants and the disciples in the world. They are by this process learning the work of world salvage and becom ing gradua lly fitted for the pos t of world saviour an d to be absorbers of evil karma. You might here qui te correctly poi nt out that all the world is now suffering and that the past twenty - five years have been thos e of a general and most unha ppy world karma. Wherein then lies the distinction between the pain and suffering of the world in general and that of aspirants and disciples in particular? I woul d reply that aspirants and disciples are cons cious of this karma and its results in all three vehicles simultaneous ly — in the mind as well as in the emotiona l bod y with resultant phys ical reactions . This produc es an intensification, retrospection and anticipation which the larger group doe s not register, invol ving as it does the entire persona lity. To this, in the case of the disciple in particular, must be adde d s ensitivity and the ability to tune in and to absorb world pain, world reactions , and world condi tions , thereby greatly increasing that which they may have indi vidua lly to bear. The capacity to shoul der and register group pain as well as to bear his ow n per sona l karma greatly aggravates the disciple's task. When, therefore, I call the world aspirants and disciples to the use of the Great Invoc ation, I call them also to the \"fellow ship of Christ's sufferings \"; this is ever preliminary to the resur rection or to the release of the hum an cons cious ness into highe r realms of spiritual awareness. The Forces which are cont acted by the use of this Great Invoc ation, in conjunc tion with trained hierarchical effort, are thereby attracted or magne tically impel led to respond and then pot ent energies can be sent direct to the waiting planetary centre, Hum anity. Two effects of an immediate nature are cons eque ntly induc ed over a specific period of time: a. The energy of the Will of God serves to awaken the illum ine d but latent will - to - good in men and this, onc e dyna mically awakened, will flow er forth as goodw ill. There is so much of this which remains latent and une xpr essed because the will to demons trate goodw ill activity has not been arous ed; it will be autom atica lly arous ed in the general publ ic onc e the world disciples have invoke d and evoke d the inflow of this highe r dyna mic energy. Hum anity awaits this and its arrival is depende nt upon the efforts of thos e who know what shoul d be done and who shoul d now make th eir spiritual theories facts in out er expr ession. Nothing can arrest the eventual progr ess of this will - to - good and its planne d activity any more than a bud which has started to unfold its petals in the light of the sun and subj ect to the prope r stimulatio n can revert again to the condi tion of a tight ly closed bud, potential but une xpr essed. The expr ession of what has been pot ential will be the result of the impact of first ray force, of the will - to - good at this time, induc ed by the efforts of the world dis ciples. b. The second effect will be the forming or cons titution of a planetary triangl e or recogni sable triad which will be the corresponde nce between the three planetary centres to the spiritual triad of Mona d, Soul and Persona lity (the atma - buddhi - mana s of the theosophi cal literature). Hitherto the word alignm ent has best described the planetary situation; there has been a straight line along which energy"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST has pour ed from Shamballa to the Hierarchy and from the Hierarchy to Hum anity, but this has meant no direct interplay between Hum anity and Shamballa. If the Great Invoc ation can be rende red effective, hum anity can then set up a direct relations hip with Shamballa. The resultant triangl e of force - relations hip will prom ote the circulation of spi ritual energies between the three centres from poi nt to poi nt so that there will be a triple relation. A planetary process of give and take between all three will then be established, and the empha sis upon giving will be far more pronounc ed. You will now see a little of the occult obj ective which lay behind the words which I asked you all to repeat in conne ction with the Great Invoc ation: We know , O Lord of Life and Love, abo ut the need; Touc h our hearts ane w with love, that we too may love and give. It is this thought of the free circulation of energy between the three world centres which motivates this mantric sentence. A study of this will show you how the implication and signi ficance of appa rently simple words may be far deeper and far more wide - reach ing in effect than you have been able to conc eive. A recogni tion of this and a creative impassione d use of the imagination may serve to add greater pot ency to your thought and to you r personal will - to - good as you use the Great Invoc ation and its subs idiary mantram. The keynot e of the first aspect is Sacrifice, and of the second, Love . The words therefore \"that we too may love and give\" can produce a cont act between the two. A clue also to the signi ficance of pain and of suffering will gradua lly emerge in t he world cons cious ness as study is made of the above statements. Suffering is the most effective and most rapid way of evoki ng world unde rstandi ng and of bur ning away the barriers which hum an beings have set up to the expr ession of the will - to - good . One of the most beneficent results of the inflow of the Shamballa force through the focussed demand of the aspirants and world disciples will be the intelligent recogni tion of the uses of pain and suffering. It is this truth — distorted and selfishly mi sappl ied and interpreted — which has led certain type s of peopl e and certain type s of gove rning bod ies among the nations to take the pos ition that the greater the suffering inflicted (as, for instance, in war time) and the greater the process of terrorism, t he qui cker the end which is desirable and right ; they hol d often that the more dire the effects of planne d condi tions , the more rapidly will the correct cons um mation be achieved. It is not, how ever, the dut y or right of man to turn first ray force to selfi sh ends or material obj ectives; respons ibility cannot be veiled behind specious and distorted half truths and evil cannot be done in order that good may com e. What is appl ied by the Lord of the World in Shamballa unde r the motivation of love , wisdom and se lflessness with a sure touc h and a judgm ent as to times and seasons cannot be so used by thos e motivated by persona lity obj ectives, either on an individua l or a persona lity scale (for nations as well as indi vidua ls have personalities). Ponde r on this and s eek enlight enm ent from the soul . 3. When the Great Invoc ation is thus right ly used and the world centres are cons eque ntly cons cious ly interrelated, then certain extra - planetary Energies can be called in by the Ruler of Shamballa to aid in the re - adjustmen ts requi red for the New Age and its com ing civilisation. These Forces — spiritual and pot ent in nature — exist in two categor ies: solar Forces which are inter - planetary and cosmic Forces which enter into our solar system via Jupi ter as the transmitter of divin e energies from Virgo and Aqua rius which Jupi ter esoterically gove rns. Virgo is esoterically the mother of the Christ child and is, therefore, the emanator of energies which nour ish and aid the grow th of the Christ cons cious ness; Aqua rius is the com ing exp ression of the group conscious ness which is the first and immediate revelation of the ever present Christ cons cious ness on a large scale in hum anity. Jupi ter also,"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST exot erically and from the angl e of orthodox astrology, rules Sagittarius, the sig n of discipleship, and also Pisces, the sign of the world saviour s. The implications will, therefore, be obvi ous to real stude nts. In cons idering these great Energies, there is little you can do beyond accepting — if you care to do so — my statements anent th em, regarding them as interesting and simply expl anatory hypot heses. There is little that you can do (or I either) to arrive at first hand know ledge of the facts along this line. Few even of the Members of the Hierarchy are cons cious of the impact of force from extra - solar centres or reservoi rs of spiritual force. Only the group of Contemplatives in the Hierarchy which are given the exot eric name of Nirmanakayas are respons ive to Their influence in any cons cious manne r and then onl y when that influence has been steppe d dow n by certain pow erful agencies in Shamballa. It is not necessary for me or for you to say more anent Them though I shall touc h upon Them again later in this article. Prior to taking up the Great Invoc ation sentence by sentence, I woul d lik e briefly to touc h upon the needed procedur e as you attempt to say it correctly and effectively: Forget not , first of all, the necessary process of alignm ent wherein you do two things : 1. Ende avour cons cious ly (which for most of you at present means imag inatively) to align or link soul , mind and brain so that there is a direct and free inflow from the highe r Self to the low er. 2. Ende avour to realise or register your relation to the Hierarchy, via your ow n group of disciples (if you know which it is) or in relation to whichever one of the Great Ones or Masters appe als the most to your heart and mind. If neither makes any appe al to your cons cious ness, the same results will be achieved if you seek to link up with the Christ. I might here poi nt out that the difference between the linki ng up that you can effectively do and that which is done by a Member of the Hierarchy itself is that you link up via the Hierarchy and then through the medium of the Great Invoc ation reach forth to Shamballa whereas the initiates and the Masters link Themselves directly with Shamballa and use the Great Invoc ation in a manne r totally different to that in which you use it. There is for you and the average aspirant no direct cont act, and that is definitely fortuna te for you . I may not further elucidate. The second thing which you do is then to focus yourself in as high a cons cious ness as you are capable of achieving. Then you aim at com plete self - forgetfulness and when that has been gained you direct your attention to th e dua l activity of the true disciple to which I earlier referred, i.e., the task of empha sising a signi ficant unde rstandi ng of the implications and meanings of the words said and of the results to be achieved. There com es next the sendi ng forth of the word s with their hidde n pot ency and this must be done by you as a soul , using the mind and the brain as agents. Integration, cons cious activity, and the expr ession of the work to be done upon the phys ical plane will cove r the entire story. These right ly carri ed forward will prove effective. Woul d it clarify matters for you if I state that: 1. Integration is a corresponde nce in cons cious ness to the Inha lation of the breath. This is the withdr awing of the cons cious ness to as high a poi nt as pos sible. 2. Cons ci ous activity corresponds to the right use of the Interlude between inha lation and exha lation. It"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST invol ves the recogni tion of the forces cont acted and their purpos e. 3. Right expression corresponds to the period of Exha lation. This is the sendi ng forth of the forces cont acted by an act of the will in order that they may produc e the desired ends . Forget not that this has to be a group ende avour and must be carried forward in coope ration with the Hierarchy. It invol ves also the recogni tion that the soul is o ne and that there is no such thing as my soul — onl y our soul . In cons idering the five sentences which form what might be called the manda te of the Great Invoc ation (see page 144) , I woul d like, first of all, to poi nt out a few unde rlying and bas ic ideas. This Great Invoc ation has been used by the Hierarchy ever since the year 1425 A.D. though it is thous ands of years older than that. Owing, how ever, to the unreadiness of hum anity to coope rate in its use, the results have been delayed and are reg arded as \"hove ring. \" I know not how else to expr ess the results already achieved. Toda y, they can precipitate, if right coope ration can be extende d by hum anity, and such coope ration now seems immediately pos sible. The first pha se, Let the Forces of Light bring illum inat ion to mank ind , definitely invoke s pot encies which are to be found upon mona dic levels of cons cious ness and upon what is occultly called the second plane of divine manifestation. These Forces include the Lord of the World and the Representat ives of the seven sacred planets Who are spoke n of in the Christian Bible as the \"seven Spirits before the Throne of God.\" They include also the three Agents of the Divine Triplicity Who are know n, esoterically and in the East as the three Kumaras, or the three Buddha s of Activity. What do these names and these great Indi vidua lities mean to you and to average humanity? Nothing at all and this is necessarily so. They remain but names and pos sible hypot hetical expr essions of divinity unt il after the third in itiation when the cons cious recogni tion of the Mona d becom es pos sible; then Forces and Energies, personi fied for us in these great and stupe ndous Lives, can be demons trated as having true existence. On the way to these funda mental recogni tions , Their three Representatives within the limits of the Hierarchy must be accepted and know n to be correspondi ngl y func tioni ng Activities. These Three are, the Manu, the focal point of the first Ray of Will or Pow er; the Christ, the head of the Hierarchy and the represe ntative of the second Ray of Love - Wisdom ; and the Lord of Civilisation, the expr ession of the third Ray of Active Intelligence. This know ledge is achieved during the process of training for the first three initiations . Therefore, all that I here tell you must be regarded as pos sible of verification, and as being testified to by all the world Scriptures and by the initiates of all lands , but it must necessarily remain persona lly unverified by you unt il a much later date in you r unf oldm ent. The Sp irit of Peace Who is invoke d in the second phr ase, Let the Spi rit of Peace be spread abr oad , is that mysterious and divine Entity with Whom the Christ came into touc h and Whos e influence played through Him at the time that He earned the right to be called the \"Prince of Peace.\" As I have elsewhere told you in my earlier writings , the Christ embodi ed in Himself the cosmic principle of love , the expr ession of which in manifestation will work out as \"glory to God, peace on earth and goodw ill tow ards men.\" To t his the ange ls testified at His birth. When He expr essed this principle of love in His life and world service, He definitely linke d up our planet and hum anity (in particular) with the Sour ce of the light, love and life to which we refer in this second phr a se.

When the world aspirants and disciples use this Invoc ation, the first phr ase takes the cons cious ness to the Hierarchy of Light, which is the intermediate centre between Hum anity and Shamballa. It serves then to empha sise and establish a close rappor t, blendi ng and fusing the hum an and the hierarchical centres. When this has tak en place, the Hierarchy can then use this Great Invoc ation with greater pot ency and can carry the relation to a highe r state still and produc e a blendi ng with the Shamballa centre, where the Forces of Light are found as embodi ed Presences and where Their f ocussed energy serves to provi de great reservoi rs of light and love . These have hitherto not been made available for planetary distribut ion, ow ing to the lack of established relation between the three centres: Hum anity, Hierarchy and Shamballa. That relation is now becom ing som ewhat established; the inflow of light and love to hum anity is now pos sible if the disciples and aspirants of the world can be led to make the needed effort to stand in spiritual being and, from that poi sed attentive attit ude , to invoke these great Entities. It was to this pos sibility that the story in the New Testament refers where reference is made to the pool which was stirred at times by the Ange l and thus a condi tion was produc ed which led to the healing of the sick. T he Ange l of the Presence, the soul of hum anity, as embodi ed in the Hierarchy and thos e who are cons cious ly ende avour ing to func tion as soul s can now stir these reservoi rs of force and light upon etheric levels in Shamballa so that a definite \"healing of th e nations \" can take place. When the thought behind the Great Invoc ation can be carried high enough in the cons cious ness of those using it through a joint effort of the world disciples and the Hierarchy of Light — as well as being reinforced by the Forces of Light — then the Spirit of Peace can be invoke d. On a low er turn of the spiral, you will not e that the Wesak Festival enacts a similar invoc ation and process. It is a re - enacting and training process. There and at that time, the three Representatives of Sh amballa within the Hierarchy — the Manu, the Christ and the Mahachoha n — invoke the Buddha , Who in His turn is the transmitter of still highe r Forces. He is invoke d by a special mantram and transmits the appe al to the One Whos e agent He is. If this Great Invoc ation which we are studyi ng can be right ly said, the three great planetary centres can be related in a similar manne r. The Lord of Civilisation, the Master R., representing hum anity, the Christ representing the Hierarchy and the Lord of the World, linke d t hrough the Manu and representing Shamballa can be brought into a close relation so that the result will be the setting up of such a pot ent vibration and not e that the Spirit of Peace will be invoke d and cont acted. By the voiced appe al His attention will be forced to turn itself tow ards our planet. The cons eque nces will be signi ficant and potent but as to the form which they will take it is impos sible for me to say. Perhaps it will lead to som e peculiar and pow erful demons tration of the meaning of peace as the expr ession of uni versal and planetary love ; perhaps it will produc e the sendi ng of an Avatar or Messenge r of Peace to lead the nations to right action; perhaps som e happe ning will take place of such signi ficance that its impor t will be immedi ately recogni sed by hum anity as a whol e, leading them to take all the needed steps to restore right hum an relations . The nature of the activities which the Spirit of Peace will institute is not our respons ibility. Our duty is to learn rightly to cont act th e Hierarchy, via our ow n soul s; right ly to use the Great Invoc ation as soul s, and right ly to rende r our selves respons ive to and sensitive to the resultant effects. Ponde r on the above . It might , therefore, be not ed that the Forces of Light expr ess Themsel ves through the Hierarchy of Light and Their major effect is the illum ination of the minds of men with love and light . This precipitates upon the mental plane. The persona lity or the form aspect of hum anity is thereby pervaded and illum ined. Thus the third great planetary centre, Hum anity, becom es creative and magne tic, and two divine aspects — intelligence and love — will reach fruition upon the phys ical plane, making it"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST pos sible for the first aspect and the will of God (understood by hum anity as the Plan) to be cons cious ly carried forward on earth in conf ormity with the activity instituted at Shamballa. The will of God is pur pos e and this is, for the first time, to be recogni sed cons cious ly by man. The Spirit of Peace will, when the right time com es, vitalise the respons iveness of hum anity, via the influence of the Hierarchy, to the will of God which has for basic intent the bringi ng of peace on earth. What is peace? It is essentially the establishing of right hum an relations , of synt hetic rappor t with its res ultant coope ration, of correct interplay between the three planetary centres and an illumined, lovi ng unde rstandi ng of the will of God as it affects hum anity and works out divine intent. It is for this reason that the Christ, Who established for the first time in planetary history a cont act between the Hierarchy, Hum anity, Shamballa and the Spirit of Peace in His Own high place, in His first recorded utterance said that He must be about His Father's bus iness and then at the end of His life, reite rated the same thought in the words: \"Father, not my will but Thine be done ,\" thus carrying the thought up to the highe st plane for He addr essed the Father, the first Aspect of Divinity. He then focussed in Himself the two major divine attributes and aspec ts — will and love (atma - buddhi ) — and because of this, His cons cious ness became extra - planetary as is the cons cious ness of the Lord of the World, and He coul d then touc h certain height s of awareness and cont act certain solar Agencies which had never before be en cont acted by man. This achievement enabled Him to put Hum anity in touc h with the Spirit of Peace. He thus Himself became the Light of the World and the Prince of Peace. In this manne r, Shamballa and the Hierarchy were brought into a close relations hip and two great streams of force were blende d and a definite interplay set up between them. The Buddha , through His achievement of illum ination, established the first major link with the Forces of Light . The Christ, through His ability to express the will of God in love and as world salvage, established the first major link with the Spirit of Peace. If you will study the above information with care, you will find that the importance of the Wesak Festival at the time of the full moon of May will assum e increa sing impor tance in you r minds . It is the festival at which three factors of importance to humanity are brought into relation: 1. The Buddha , the embodi ment or agent of the Forces of Light can then be cont acted and that which They seek to transmit to hum an ity can be cons ciously appr opr iated. 2. The Christ, the embodi ment of the love and the will of God and the agent of the Spirit of Peace, can also be cont acted and hum anity can be trained to appr opr iate this extra - planetary type of energy. 3. T hrough the Christ and the Buddha , hum anity can now establish a close relations hip with Shamballa and then make its ow n cont ribut ion — as a world centre — to the planetary life. Pervaded by light and cont rolled by the Spirit of Peace, the expr ession of hum anity 's will - to - good can emanate pow erfully from this third planetary centre. Hum anity will then for the first time enter upon its destined task as the intelligent, loving intermediary between the highe r states of planetary cons cious ness, the supe r - hum an states and the sub - hum an kingdom s. Thus hum anity will becom e eventually the planetary saviour . If you will have these thought s in mind, the first three phr ases of the Great Invoc ation will assum e great signi ficance.

Goodw ill , as the practical and pos sible expr ession of love demons trates on earth, evoki ng right relations hip; light , as the expr ession of the Hierarchy pour s into the hum an cons cious ness, irradiating all dark places and evoki ng a respons e from all forms of life in the three worlds of manifestat ion, and in the three subhum an kingdom s through the medium of the hum an; peace, as the expr ession of the will of Shamballa produc es balance, equi librium , synt hesis and unde rstandi ng, plus a spirit of invoc ation which is basically an action, produc ing react ion. This demons trates as the first great creative and magical work of which humanity is capable, swingi ng, as it doe s, all the three divine aspects into a simultaneous activity in line with the will of God. We com e now to the last two phrases which sum mar ise the effects — synt hetic and eternal (and cons eque ntly lasting) which the establishm ent of direct relations hip with Shamballa will produc e in the two other planetary centres, the Hierarchy and Humanity. I refer to effects which will expr ess themselves as a group activity, motivated by the essential values of selflessness and persistent effort (which is sustained conc entration, in the last analysis) and thereby produc ing condi tions for which the Lord of the World, the Ancient of Days, has long waited. The p atience and sustaining love of Shamballa is infinite. The four th phr ase runs : May forgiveness on the part of all men be the keynot e at this time. As you know , the word \"forgiveness\" is a curious and unu sual one and signi fies (according to the best derivat ive sour ces) simply \"to give for.\" Forgiveness is not therefore, a synonym for pardon though the word has been distorted in theologi cal circles to mean this, so little has the Chur ch unde rstood the basic, motivating pow er behind divine expr ession in our so lar system. Theologi ans ever think in terms of the hum an mind and not in terms of the divine mind. Forgiveness is sacrifice, and is the giving up of one 's self, even of one 's very life, for the sake of others and for the good of the whol e group. This spiri t of sacrifice is ever found when the Shamballa force is right ly cont acted, even in the smallest degree, and the unde rlying impul se behind the lovi ng will of God is sensed and unde rstood, accom panied as this always is with the desire to participate in that will and its spirit of divine sacrifice. Manifestation is itself the Great Forgiveness. The stupe ndous Lives — out side manifested existence — entered into manifestation in order to give Themselves for the lesser lives and forms of existence in orde r that these lesser lives might be enabled to proceed onw ard towards a goa l which is know n to Deity alone , and thus eventually reach high places of spiritual expression. Achievement is ever follow ed by sacrifice and the giving of the greater for the lesser . This is an aspect of the Law of Evol ution. Such is the note and theme of the entire creative process and is the basic meaning of the phr ase, \"God is Love ,\" for love signi fies giving and sacrifice, at least in this solar system. It is for this reason tha t the esoteric teaching emphasises the fact that the soul of man is a Lord of Sacrifice and of lovi ng persistent Devot ion — the two out standi ng qua lities of the Shamballa Lives, sustaining life and giving. This is lasting devot ion to the good of the whol e or the expression of the spirit of synt hesis and sacrifice in order again that all lesser lives (such as thos e embodi ed in the persona lity of man) may rise to the \"resurrection which is in Christ,\" through the crucifixion or sacrifice of the soul upon the Cr oss of Matter. It is this thought again which gives signi ficance to the life of Christ on earth for He re - enacted for us an eternal process, externalising it in such a way that it became the sym bol of the motive of the entire manifested uni verse and the i mpul se which shoul d direct each of us — crucifixion and death, resurrection and life, and the cons eque nt salvation of the whol e. It is this thought which is embodi ed in the challenge of this four th phr ase of the Great Invoc ation, and"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST means literally, \"May a ll men everyw here respond to the keynot e of the uni verse and give themselves for others.\" And, is not this in a faint and dim manne r, the present keynot e of hum an effort? In spite of a real inability to think truly, effectively and intuitively, the mass o f men in all lands are respondi ng clearly and definitely to this not e of sacrifice. Leaders of the great nations everyw here are using this not e and call to sacrifice in their appe als at this time to their peopl es. Men in Germany were called to b attle by their leaders with the challenge of sacrifice and told that they must give their lives in order that Germany may live. A study of the speeches by the German leaders will be found to cont ain this not e. The other group, whom you call the Allies (bec ause they stand more specifically for the good of the whol e and not for the good of the separated nation or uni t) are also calling the masses of their peopl e to fight for the good of civilisation and for the preservation of thos e values which are next upon the evol utiona ry scale and essential to the general goo d. The wording of these calls and the obj ectives expr essed may differ in formulation but the theme is the same and the effect is to call forth the spirit of sacrifice in the nations . Though the motive s behind such a call may be mixed and the leaders gui ded as much by expe diency and selfish, nationa l interests as by the general good , yet they know that the note which will evoke an immediate respons e from the uni t and the indi vidua l is funda mentally the good of the larger uni t (the nation or the group of nations ). Therefore, forgiveness or sacrifice in order to save others is increasingl y the recogni sed needed keyno te at this time and in this recogni tion lies much to justify the sorry story of past evol ut iona ry processes and methods . When it is recogni sed that the \"giving - for\" invol ves right living upon the phys ical plane and not (as is so often thought ) the dying of the phys ical body then we shall see a revitalised world. It is the living Christ (the livi ng world Saviour) Who saves hum anity. It is the sacrifice, day by day, in the process of daily living which can save the world of men — the sacrifice of selfish persona l interests for the good of the whol e and the giving up of one 's practical life to the sal vage of the world. It is living in order that others too may live which is the theme of the New Testament. When, therefore, the mode of sacrifice enters into the realm of the subt ler and subj ective values and the true meaning of forgiveness is intellectual ly, practically and spiritually com prehende d, the New Age will be abunda ntly realised with its truly hum an civilisation and a culture which will embody the realities of the esoteric teaching, as well as the best of the externalised past. Then an d onl y then will the new esotericism be revealed to a race of men who have made aspiration a fact in their out er expe rience. The attitude of the masses in the present conf lict is the gua rantee of this and the proof also of the success of Christ's mission. The result of what is happe ning toda y must, soone r or later, produc e an at - one - ment between all nations and peopl es. At - one - ment is ever (unde r evol utionary law) the cons eque nce of sacrifice. Of this, Christ's sacrifice was the sym bol and the gua rantee, i mpul sed as His life and activities were by the Spirit of Peace. As He made \"of twain, one new man, so making peace\" (Ephe sians 2:15) so toda y out of the dua lity of soul and body , hum anity is achieving the same ends and the result of this final stage of the Piscean Age will be the fusion in cons cious ness of soul and body . The Aqua rian Age will demons trate an increasing expr ession of this at - one - ment, wrough t out in the crucifixion of hum anity at the present time. The difference between this com ing stage and that of the past is that, in the past, the soul has sought this developm ent and at - one - ment and (from the angl e of evol ution) it has been slow ly and gradua lly attained, but in the future, it will be cons cious ly sought , achieved and recogni sed by man upon t he phys ical plane as a result of the present period of \"giving - for\" the whol e, of the best which the indi vidua l can give. I woul d poi nt out that just as the energies released by use of the first three phrases of the Invoc ation relate to the Head, Shamball a; to the Heart, the Hierarchy; and to the Throat centre, Hum anity; so the"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST right use of this fourth phrase will bring into cons cious , func tioni ng activity the centre between the eyebrow s, the ajna centre in indi vidua l man and in hum anity as whol e. This cen tre begins to becom e active and to func tion dyna mically, gove rning and directing the indi vidua l energies, onc e any real measure of persona lity integration has been achieved. It is, as you know , the fourth centre found abov e the diaphr agm in the hum an body and the phr ase which awakens it (bot h indi vidua lly and in the group ) is this four th phr ase. There is, therefore, a num erical relations hip. When used wisely and intelligently by hum an beings , many of the blende d pot encies which the first three ph rases have made available are invoke d and so made available to the indi vidua l as well as to the group. They can then be focussed for his use in the ajna centre. In many ways, therefore, this four th phr ase of the Great Invoc ation is of paramount impor tance to the indi vidua l as well as to hum anity, invoki ng as it doe s great and vital pot encies and indi cating process (Sacrifice) and purpos e, plus the identification of the uni t and the group with the basic intent of manifestation. The fifth phrase, Let pow er a ttend the efforts of the Great Ones , is definitely related to the effect in the Hierarchy of a cons tructive use of the Great Invoc ation, just as the previous one is related to the effect in hum anity. This effect in the Hierarchy is a relatively new one and is due to the participation of hum anity in the process of invoc ation, thus produc ing new effects and cont acts. It is the uni ted effort of the two great centres which is of such paramount impor tance and upon which I desire to have you conc entrate. Its utte rance by man throw s the weight of human appe al and desire behind the age - old efforts of the Hierarchy and this is now , for the first time, truly pos sible on a large scale. For aeons , the Hierarchy has struggl ed alone to help and lift hum anity and to stimul ate the pot ency of the hum an planetary centre so that its vibratory activity woul d eventually be sufficiently pow erful to swing it into the radius or magne tic field of hierarchical activity. This long task has at last achieved success. The Hierarchy and hu manity are at last en rappor t. This is the highe r reflection or corresponde nce to what goe s on within the cons cious ness of a hum an being who — having reached the stage of discipleship — is at the poi nt of blendi ng the light of the persona lity (as it is expr ess ed through the ajna centre and its externalisation, the pituitary body ) and the light of the soul (as it is, in its turn, expr essed by the light in the head, or by the head centre and its externalisation, the pineal gland) . You will, therefore, not e afresh the practical signi ficance of these four th and fifth phrases of the Great Invoc ation. One serves to arous e hum anity (as a planetary centre) to activity and realisation and the other serves to aid the Hierarchy in its ancient efforts so that th e two are then related to each other's magne tic fields and produc e a blendi ng and a synt hesis which will lead to a fuller expr ession of the soul of divinity through the medium of hum anity. Ponde r on this statement. In the esoteric teaching, this takes pla ce in the life of the indi vidua l when — by an act of the will — the centre at the base of the spine is arous ed and the fire and the light of the persona l threefold life (one aspect of which is often called the kunda lini fire) is carried upw ards and merged with the pow er and the light of the soul . The major approach of the two basic energies of form and soul (as an expr ession of spirit) are thereby related within the hum an being; the \"marriage in the heavens\" takes place and the task of the creative process of i ncarnation or indi vidua l manifestation is on the way to com pletion. Within the planetary life, the same process goe s on. The life of humanity as a whol e (which is intelligent form life) and the life of the Hierarchy (which is the life of the soul ), unde r i mpul se from the Spirit or will aspect as sym bol ised in Shamballa, are fused and blende d and then a new departure in the evol utiona ry process becom es pos sible. The kingd om of God, which is the kingdo m of soul s, and the hum an kingdom as mutually expr essive a nd interrelated, are perfectly synt hesised and anchor ed on earth. The glory of the One can then be faintly seen, which is the glory of Shamballa. The Dweller upon the threshol d of divinity and the Ange l of the Presence then stand face to face."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST This is the situation toda y. Tom orrow they will blend and synt hesise and the glory of God will appe ar on earth. The second great Appr oach will have been achieved. CALL TO A UNITED ACT OF SERVICE Nove mber 1939 The situation is serious . Sea and air an d land are arrayed against the Forces of Light; they are the agents of material subs tance and can be used pot ently against the spiritual Forces. The forces of the air are, how ever, increasingl y on our side. The Members of the Hierarchy are hard put to it t o turn the tide in favour of that true and more spiritual civilisation which is on the way. This civilisation will be a com bination of the best which has hitherto been produc ed and that which is new and, as yet, dimly sensed by the best of the world thinke rs. The tide must be turned in favour of that which we call right eous ness. The seeds of evil are in every count ry; thos e who war against that which is goo d are numerous in every land, whether they war with aggr essive and planne d intent, whether they prese rve an attitude of passivity and acceptance, or a planne d neutrality, as in America, or are actively fight ing for that which is against the material forces. The World Crisis was, as you know , inevitable, but phys ical warfare coul d have been avoi ded if rig ht psychol ogi cal methods had been employe d, and it coul d have been cured if a process of transmutation and of transference had been correctly carried forward, and if the spirit of sacrifice had also been demons trated by the world aspirants. The need for gr oup sacrifice has not met with adequa te respons e, except in thos e cases where it has been impos ed by gove rnm ents upon their nationa ls. Such is the sorry history of what is taking place toda y. What can be done at the present mom ent to arrest defeat and the ove rwhelming of the Forces of Light? Here I refer not to the out er phys ical victory. True victory will not be indi cated unl ess the highe r values which shoul d gove rn hum an civilisation emerge with clarity and pow er. I woul d here like to empha sise the fact that the tide must be definitely turned before the close of the year if a prolonge d conf lict is to be avoi ded. I woul d ask you , therefore, to participate in the subj ective focussing and rallying of the world thinke rs, and particularly the heads of organisations , groups and chur ches of all kinds and temperaments who can swing their many adhe rents into a uni form and uni ted activity. The Masters of the Wisdom have no time toda y to do the task Themselves; Their hands are full, com bating the forces o f materialism. These forces are active in every count ry; the Hierarchy in its cons cious ness doe s not isolate Germany, even though these forces have chos en that sad land for their major poi nt of departure and enterprise; in Germany They have Their peopl e wo rking as elsewhere. The Masters of the Wisdom are active in dispelling the depressions and terrors which settle dow n upon all Their workers in the arena of the world toda y, as these workers struggl e to stand steady unde r the fierce impact of wrong thinki ng and of world - wide despair; these workers are likewise sensitive (ow ing to their poi nt of integrated developm ent) to the agony of mind, the tension of emotion and the ravages"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST of phys ical pain which are felt by all thos e upon whom the War has had its dire e ffects, and upon whom it has laid the hand of suffering. Such a sensitivity and such a sym pathetic respons e are apt to produc e a condi tion of negativity and a psychic preoccupa tion with the immediate situation among all workers, and thus rende r them deaf t o the call of their actual dut y or else liable to becom e distraught by the dua l effort of being effective in service, whilst at the same time fight ing off emotiona l reactions . The capacity of the worker to respond, therefore, to the inne r voi ces and to ser ve dispassiona tely and selflessly is serious ly handi cappe d. I challenge all workers and all members of the New Group of World Servers to leave their persona l probl ems behind. This is a time of crisis and such probl ems must be solved throug h com plete self - forgetfulness. I ask you to work anew with fresh ardour in joyful service, forgetting past weakne sses and failures in the urgency of that which I ask all to do for the world. There has been much lack of joy in the service rende red to the world lately. When I speak thus , I refer not to happi ness, which is a persona lity reaction, but to that joyous conf idence in the law and in the Hierarchy which lies behind the Biblical words, \"The joy of the Lord is our strengt h.\" \"Rise up and fight , Arjuna ,\" pre serving the flame of love intact, permitting no breath of hate to disturb the serenity of love or ups et that inne r poi se which will enable you to sound forth the clarion note of world unde rstandi ng, that will rally all men and wom en of goodw ill to the aid of the Hierarchy. This will bring to an end all hatred, separativeness and aggr ession, which are the three major sins of humanity. All men have hated; all men have been separative in bot h thought and action; all have been and many still are materialistic, full of pride and the desire to gain that which is not their ow n by right. This spirit of acqui sitiveness belongs to no one group; it has been a uni versal and general fault, and has produc ed the present disastrous econom ic situation, thus precipitating the world into war, hate and cruelty. The fusion of many minds into one directed activity is toda y of supr eme importance; this has been sym bol ised in the uni on which now exists between two great nations , France and Great Britain. Unity of directed though t an d purpos e is the gua rantee of inevitable and future success. The pow er of massed thought is om nipot ent. The pot ency of focussed and directed mental activity is unp redictable. If you accept this premise and this statement, then act upon it. The Spirit of P eace is hove ring close to hum anity, seeking oppor tuni ty to make His Presence felt. The Spirit of Peace is not an abstract conc ept but a pot ent Indi vidua l, wielding forces hitherto unf amiliar to our planet. Great Forces are awaiting the hour when They can f unc tion as the Liberators and the Deliverers of manki nd. But the door to Their entrance must be ope ned by hum anity itself and it will be ope ned by a uni ted act of the will , expr essed through som e formula of words and expr essed in sound. It will be brough t about by an activity performed simultaneous ly by all men and wom en of goodw ill and by all the world aspirants and disciples.

Let there be peace on earth, and let it begin with us.\" THE COMING WO RLD ORDER April 194 0 This analysis of world condi tions is being written in America, where there is, as yet, relative phys ical safety and time for the re - adjustment of views, and the oppor tunity also to give direction — along with embattled Britain and her Allies — to a world sorely needing gui dance and vision. There is great conf usion of voi ces. Thos e who know the least speak ever the loude st and appor tion the blame for events with facility. There is much mental distress everyw here, occasione d by the war and also by t he desire of the well - intentione d to stress their particular solutions of the world probl em. It is necessary, therefore, to speak with directness, to indi cate the inhe rent dange rs of the present situation, to present its amazing oppor tunity to bring about needed change s, and to poi nt out the lines of demarcation between the right and the wrong ways of living, between a vision of the new world order and the retrograde plans of the so - called \"new order\" with which the totalitarian pow ers seek to bewilder hum anity. We start with the premise that two oppos ing world visions conf ront humanity and that two world orders are presented to manki nd. Between these man must choos e, and his choi ce will determine the future. The years 1941 and 1942 will be years of cris is and of tension. Thos e who perceive the risks, the oppor tuni ty, and the impor tant decision to be made are struggl ing with almost frantic haste to awaken the masses to the uni que ness of this mom ent. What manki nd decides dur ing the next twelve mont hs will condi tion the future as no other hum an decision has ever before done in the history of manki nd. There have been poi nts of crisis before in history, but not one that invol ved the entire planetary popul ation. There have been periods of dange r, difficulty, war, famine and distress, but none which condi tione d the lives of unt old millions as doe s the present. Time and again there has been the"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST emergence of leaders, conque rors, dictators and world figures, but they have hitherto com e at a time when their influen ce was limited by world com munications and by nationa l limitations ; therefore their pow er was not uni versal and their progr ess was arrested by the condi tions of the period in which they lived. Toda y, the entire planet is invol ved and all the nat ions of the world are definitely affected. There is the setting up of barriers in a futile effort to keep out of troubl e and avoi d war; dominant groups are swingi ng many nations unde r their banners so that they are either associated with the totalitarian pow ers or with thos e nations which are oppos ing them. The nations which are not actually belligerents are equa lly active in the task of ende avour ing to preserve their nationa l integrity. The conf lict toda y is a world conf lict. The follow ing groups of peop le are invol ved: 1. The fight ing aggr essor nations , ruled by ambitious dictators. 2. The nations which are seeking to defend themselves and the liberties of hum anity. 3. The neutral nations , seeing the issues invol ved and faced with the immediate necessit y to take sides. The mom entum of this struggl e is gaining daily. Fresh areas of the world are being swept into the conf lict every week. The real issues, the impendi ng econom ic results and the political implications are emerging with grow ing clarity in eve ry land and — make no mistake — even in thos e lands which lie num bed and suffering unde r the heel of the conque ror. Among them there is a silent and at present voi celess revol t. The inne r speechless revol t in itself cons titutes a menace to world peace and, if evok ed into full expr ession, may plunge the world still deeper into conflict. Facing hum anity toda y are two major dange rs. These are: first, the conf lict will be so prolonge d that hum anity will be com pletely exha usted, and thus a stalemate will be reached and a situation will arise which will bring to an end all civilised relations hips and all hope of an ordered life of beauty, peace and culture. Secondl y, the nations not yet invol ved will fail to see the realities of the situation and will not com e to the assistance of thos e fight ing for the preservation of nationa l and indi vidua l freedom . If this shoul d prove to be the case, then — without so intendi ng and yet inevitably — they will stand on the side of evil and share in the respons ibility of engi n eering world disaster. Toda y, there are no more than two parties in the world — thos e who are on the side of right hum an relations and thos e who are on the side of selfish and cruel pow er pol itics. The totalitarian pow ers are on the march — ruthless, selfish, cruel and aggr essive; the pow ers which are battling for hum an liberty and for the rights of the defenceless little nations are standi ng with their backs to the wall, facing the stronge st display of hum an might that the world has ever seen. The nations whi ch are not yet phys ically invol ved are preparing for som e form of action and for defence — defence against the dictator pow ers but not against the fight ing democracies. The battle toda y is being fought out on the land, on the sea, and in the air. From the e conom ic standpoi nt, every count ry is invol ved, and ruin stalks in the wake of war; the stoppi ng of imports or of expor ts in many lands is bringi ng about the financial ruin of thous ands ; the pressure of econom ic disaster, the fear of famine and pestilence a nd the cons tant risk of becom ing actively a part of the war faces every count ry not yet actually in the fight ing line. The fear of defeat, of death and injury, and of the loss of all pos session s is adde d to these probl ems, where the nations at war are conc erned. Hum anity must face up to these facts. No matter how peopl e may evade the truth, no matter how they"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST may escape into a dream world of wishful thinki ng, the fact remains — inevitable and unde niable — that the world is at war and everyone is invol ved. Th e Goodw ill Work Prior to September, 1939 , the obj ectives of our world - wide work, ove r a period of nine years, were the spreading of world goodw ill, the discove ry of the men and wom en of goodw ill throughout the world, and the ende avour to teach the meaning of the will - to - good. This is the main task of the New Group of World Servers. We inculcated a non - separative attitude and the need for right hum an relations . We ende avour ed to make clear that differing forms of gove rnm ent and varying ideologi ca l systems were right and pos sible, provi ded that hum an beings lived toge ther in goodw ill and recogni sed their blood brotherhood. Then hum anity made its decision to fight , and the war broke out : one group, the instigators of the war, fight ing to acqui re ma terial pow er, the glory of a nation and the subj uga tion of the defenceless; and the other, fight ing to preserve its ow n liberty of action, the preservation of its integrity, the right of the little nations and the spiritual values. Immediately, the issue w as abunda ntly clear in the minds of thos e who were in touc h with hum an affairs; immediately certain nations took sides against the forces of aggr ession; immediately, other nations , biased by similar distorted ideologi es and equa lly selfish pur pos es, stood with the aggressor nation; immediately, panic swept the remaining nations , who took refuge in shor t - sight ed neutrality and defence programmes — a neutrality and progr ammes which have prove d qui te futile to protect them. Where, then, shoul d the New Group of World Servers stand? What shoul d the men and wom en of goodw ill do? Shoul d they side with the totalitarian pow ers because in so doi ng they will bring the conf lict more rapidly to an end, or shoul d they stand on the side of the neutral pow ers, frantically pu rsuing ineffective peace programmes, pol icies of appe asement, and play into the hands of the totalitarian pow ers? Hum anity having decided to fight out the battle physically , there was not hing left to do but issue a challenge to the men and wom en of goodw i ll to take their stand on the side of such action as woul d release hum anity through the destruction of the evil forces. These had determined to prove that might was right . Therefore, the forces fight ing for progr ess and civilisation had to meet force with force. The challenge was taken up by the democracies who stand for hum an right s and liberty. Because of the decision to fight on the side of spiritual progress, the spiritual forces of the planet had no alternative but to align themselves on th e side of the allied democracies, and ende avour to awaken the neutral nations to the issue. They range d themselves against the leaders of the aggr essor nations , though not against their poor delude d or subdue d peopl es. They too must be liberated by the all ied democracies. On the basis of an active will - to - good, the men and wom en of goodw ill, acting unde r the inspiration of the New Group of World Servers, had no alternative but to take their stand with the spiritual forces and join the struggl e for the libe ration of hum anity from totalitarian ambitions and the intentions of a group of evil men. But the spirit of goodw ill must be, steadily and unc hangi ngl y, the motivating impul se. No hate must be allow ed to enter in. The greatest good of the greatest num ber l ies toda y in the release of the nations from the dom ination of the totalitarian pow ers. "},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST The Pacifist Position The second poi nt upon which I woul d touc h is the argum ents brought out by the pacifists of the world. All true and good peopl e are pacifically minde d and all hate war. This is a fact which the academic idealist and pacifist often forgets. Such peopl e tell us that two wrongs do not make a right ; and to meet murder with murder (which is their definition of war) is sinful; that war is evil (which no one denies) and that one must not take part in it. They cont end that thinki ng thought s of peace and of love can put the world straight and end the war. Such peopl e, fight ing the existent fact of war, usually do little or not hing conc rete to right the wron gs which are respons ible for the war, and permit their defence — persona l, muni cipal, nationa l and internationa l — to be unde rtaken by others. The sincerity of these peopl e cannot be que stione d. It shoul d be remembered, in count ering these ideas and in justif ying the fight ing spirit of the Christian democracies, that it is motive that count s. War can be and is mass murder, where the motive is wrong. It can be sacrifice and right action, where the motive is right . The slaying of a man in the act of k illing the defenceless is not regarded as murder. The principle remains the same, whether it is killing an indi vidua l who is murdering, or fighting a nation which is warring on the defenceless. The material means, which evil uses for selfish ends , can also be employe d for good purpos es. The death of the phys ical body is a lesser evil than the setting back of civilisation, the thw arting of the divine pur pos es of the hum an spirit, the negating of all spiritual teaching, and the cont rol of men's minds and libe rties. War is always evil, but it can be the lesser of two evils, as is the case toda y. The present war, if carried forward to a successful com pletion by the defeat of the totalitarian pow ers, cons titutes a far lesser evil than the subj uga tion of many nat ions to the unpa ralleled cupi dity, the appa lling educ ationa l process and the defiance of all recogni sed spiritual values by the Axis pow ers. If the totalitarian pow ers shoul d conque r, it woul d mean years of turmoil and revol t; their victory woul d result in unt old misery. It is no doubt an unde niable spiritual truth that right thought can change and save the world, but it is also true that there are not enough peopl e abl e to think to do this work. Also, there is not enough time in which to do it. The though ts of peace are mainly founde d upon a stubbor n idealism that love s the ideal more than hum anity. They are based also upo n an unr ecogni sed fear of war and upon an indi vidua l inertia which prefers the dream world of wishful thinki ng to the shoul dering of res pons ibility for the security of hum anity. Thus briefly have I sought to make the pos ition of the New Group of World Servers clear as it fight s for the right s of man, for the spiritual future of humanity, and for the new world order. What I have now to say will fall into four parts: I. The world as it exists today . The present situation is the result of past tende ncies, of unde rlying pressures and of hum an decisions . II. The new world order . This we will cont rast with the old order and with the so - called \"new order\" of the totalitarian pow ers. III. Som e probl ems involved . Four major world problems will call for discussion and these we must cons ider."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST IV. The task ahe ad. We will then deal with the interlude unt il peace is achieved plus som e sugg estions for the com ing period of recons truction. I. THE WORLD TODAY What are the causes which have produc ed present world condi tions ? What are the unde rlying pressures which are produc ing the present chaos or thos e which can produc e eventual order? Bef ore there can be correction, there must be appr eciation of error; there must be unde rstandi ng of the predispos ing causes produc ing the necessity; there must be realisation of the general gui lt and a shared respons ibility for the evil condi tions ; there must be determination to make restitution, and to cease from evil doi ng. The tende ncy to fasten the war on Hitler and his gang of evil men shoul d not blind us to the causes which have made his evil work pos sible. He is mainly a precipitating agency, for throu gh him world selfishne ss and cruelty have been brought to a focus. But, as Christ has said: \"Woe unt o the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences com e; but woe to that man by whom the offence com eth.\" (Matthew 18: 7.) The causes of thi s rampant evil are inhe rent in hum anity itself. Ancient and unt rammelled selfishne ss has ever been a characteristic of man; the desire for pow er and for pos session has ever motivated men and nations ; cruelty, lust, and sacrifice of the highe r values to th e low er have been deeply root ed human habits for ages. Of these ancient habits of thought and behaviour all peopl es and all nations are gui lty. Steadily, as the world grew closer, the lines of cleavage and the antagoni sm of the nations increased , and thus the present war (beginni ng in 1914) is the inevitable result of wrong thought , selfish goa ls and ancient hatreds. Indi vidua listic interest, separative aims and aggr essive desire march tow ards their inevitable finale — war and chaos. The econom ic situation also provi des a sym bol of this condi tion. The nations divide themselves into the \"Haves\" and the \"Have Nots,\" and thus bring in the present era of gangs terism. Organised gangs in the United States came into being as an expr ession of these tende nc ies in nationa l life. In the internationa l world, three nations are now playing the same part. The allied nations and the United States are recogni sing the menace of nationa l and international gangs terism and are ende avour ing to crush it. But — and this is t he poi nt of impor tance — these condi tions have been made pos sible by hum anity as a whol e. Materialism and Spi ritual ity There are toda y three major hum an trends : First of all, a trend tow ards a spiritual and free way of life; secondl y, a trend tow ards inte llectual unf oldment; and lastly, a pot ent trend tow ards material living and aggr ession. At present, the last of these inna te tendencies is in the saddl e, with the second, the intellectual attitude , throw ing its weight upon the side of the material goa ls. A relatively small group is throw ing the weight of hum an aspiration upon the side of the spiritual values. The war between the pairs of oppos ites — materialism and spirituality — is raging fiercely. Only as men turn away from material aggr ession and tow ards spi ritual obj ectives will the world situation change , and men — motivated by goodw ill — force the aggr essors back to their ow n place and release hum anity from fear and force. We are toda y reaping the results of our ow n sow ing. The recogni tion of the cause of the probl em provi des hum anity with the oppor tunity to end it. The time has arrived in which it is pos sible"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST to institute thos e change s in attitude which will bring an era of peace and goodw ill, founde d on right hum an relations . These two forces — mate rialism and spirituality — face each other. What will be the out com e? Will men arrest the evil and initiate a period of unde rstandi ng, coope ration and right relations hip, or will they cont inue the process of selfish planni ng and of econom ic and militant com p etition? This que stion must be answered by the clear thinki ng of the masses and by the calm and una fraid challenge s of the democracies. On all sides the need for a new world order is being recogni sed. The totalitarian pow ers are talking of the \"new order in Europe \"; the idealists and thinke rs are unf olding schemes and plans which vision entirely new condi tions that will bring the old bad order to an end. There is a cons tant demand for the Allies to state their peace aims and indi cate clearly what adjustmen ts will be made after the war, because a vision of the future world pol icy will help hum anity through the present crisis. Historical Background Throughout the Middl e Ages, the rule of pow erful mona rchs, the spread of empires and the march of nationa l co nque rors were out standi ng characteristics. A relatively small num ber of peopl e were invol ved. The Chur ch of the time had immense pow er in all Europe an count ries; it cont rolled the educ ation of the peopl e, but laid no founda tion for right pol itical thought . The history of the past is the history of many forms of gove rnm ent. Races and nations have com e and gone . Political regimes and religious forms have played their part, have persisted or disappe ared. The sorry history of humanity has been one of kings and pot entates, rulers and warriors, presidents and dictators — rising into pow er at the expe nse of their ow n or other nations . Conque rors com e and go — Akba r, Genghi s Khan, the Pharaohs, Alexande r the Great, Caesar, Charlemagne , William the Conque ror, Napol eon, H itler and Mussolini. These have all ups et the rhyt hm of their times and have com e to pow er through aggr ession and slaught er. As the nations grew more closely interrelated, their influence and their field of expr ession increased. The grow ing mean s of com muni cation brought this about ; Great Britain kne w not hing of the move ments of Alexande r; the peopl es of America kne w naught about Genghi s Khan; but the sound of the marching armies of Napol eon was heard ove r a far wider area, and the trium phs of Hi tler — diplom atic and military — are know n throughout the world. The totalitarian pow ers have turned the world into one armed camp — for offence or defence. Motivating all these conque rors was lust for gol d, lust for land, lust for pow er, lust for persona l triu mph. The mode rn dictators are no exception. They bring not hing new. World Anar chy The history of the world has been bui lt around the theme of war; its poi nts of crisis have been the great battles. The though t of revenge motivates som e nations ; the deman d for the right ing of ancient historical wrongs influences others; the restitution of lands , earlier held, directs the acts of others. For instance: the ancient glory of the Rom an Empire must be restored — at the expe nse of the helpless little peopl es; the c ulture of France must be paramount and French security must out weigh all other cons iderations ; British imperialism has in the past out raged other nations ; German hegemony and \"living space\" must dom inate Europe , and the German supe rman must be the arbiter of human life;"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST American isolationi sm woul d leave hum anity defenceless in its hour of need and hand men ove r to the rule of Hitler; Russia, in her silence, cannot be trusted; Japan is ups etting the balance of pow er in Asia. Such is the picture toda y. Anarch y rules the world; famine stalks the inha bitants of Europe ; the civilian popul ation of cities, the wom en and children, are in grave dange r of injury and death and are forced to live unde rground; pestilence appe ars; there is no safety on land or sea or in t he air; the nations are on the verge of financial ruin; science has turned to the inve ntion of the instrum ents of death; the popul ations of cities and entire districts are shifted from one part of a count ry to anot her; families and hom es are bro ken up; there is intense fear, hope less looki ng into the future, bewildered que stioni ng, suicide and murder; the smoke of count less fires blackens the skies; the seas are strewn with dead and with wrecked vessels; the thunde r of guns and the noi se of expl o ding bom bs are heard in appr oxi mately twenty count ries; war rises up from the waters, marches ove r the lands and descends from the skies. It is to this situation that the old order has brought hum anity. It is to this disaster that man's cruelty and selfis hne ss have tende d; no nations are exempt from this criticism, and all are more rapidly move d by selfish pur pos e than by the spirit of sacrifice. Even idealistic America can onl y be arous ed into action by an appe al to her self - interest and security. For o ur encour agement let us recogni se that the same hum anity which has brought about these terrible condi tions can also create the new world, the new order and the new way of life. The selfish, wicked past can give way to a future of unde rstandi ng, of coope rat ion, of right hum an relations and of good. Separativeness must be supe rseded by uni ty. The com bination of totalitarian aggr essors, of allied democracies and of anxi ous neutral nations must be change d into a world which is characterised by one ende avour — the establishing of thos e relations which will produc e the happi ness and peace of the whol e, and not onl y of the part. II. THE NEW WORLD ORDER I assum e that my readers recogni se som e intelligent or spiritual direction of hum anity. I care not by what name they call that gui ding Purpos e. Som e may call it the Will of God; others, the inevitable trends of the evol utiona ry process; still others may believe in the spiritual forces of the planet; others may regard it as the spiritual Hierarchy of the p lanet, or the great White Lodge ; many millions speak of the gui dance of Christ and His disciples. Be that as it may, there is a uni versal recogni tion of a guiding Pow er, exerting pressure throughou t the ages, which appe ars to be leading all tow ards an ulti mate good. Som e definite direction has led man from the stage of primeval man to that evol utiona ry poi nt where a Plato, a Shakespeare, a da Vinci, a Beethove n can appe ar. Som e pow er has evoke d man's capacity to formulate ideas, to produc e systems of theol ogy, of science and of gove rnm ent; som e inne r motivating pow er has given man the ability to create beauty, to discove r the secrets of nature; som e realisation of divine respons ibility lies behind the phi lanthropy , the educ ationa l systems, and the welfare m ove ments throughout the world. The progr ess of the hum an spirit has been one of irresistible unf oldm ent, of a developi ng appr eciation of reality, beauty and wisdom . Instinct has develope d into intellect; intellect is beginni ng to unfold into intuition. The signi ficance of God, the registering of man's divine pot entialities, and the increasing capacity to unde rstand and to share in the thought processes of others — all these indi cate progr ess and unf oldm ent. "},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST This picture of the beauty of the hum an spirit must be placed beside the earlier picture of man's selfishne ss and cruelty, of man's inhum anity to man. Both pictures are true, but onl y the one of beauty is eternal; the other is but transient. Man is a com posite of highe r and low er expr essions , and behind al l the wars and difficulties which accom pany man's progr ess through the ages lies this major factor — an ancient persistent fight between man's spiritual aspiration and his material desires. This condi tion is toda y brought to a focus in the conf lict raging be tween the totalitarian pow ers and the nations which are fight ing for the right s of the hum an spirit and for the freedom of hum anity. My use of the word spiritual has not hing to do with the use of this word as the orthodox religions use it, except in so fa r as the religious expr ession is a part of the general spirituality of manki nd. Everything is spiritual which tends tow ards unde rstandi ng, towards kindne ss, tow ards that which is produc tive of beauty and which can lead man on to a fuller express ion of his divine pot entialities. All is evil which drives man deeper into materialism, which om its the highe r values of living, which endo rses selfishne ss, which sets up barriers to the establishing of right human relations , and which feeds the spirit of separateness, of fear, of revenge . On the basis of these distinctions , it is surely appa rent that God is on the side of the allied nations , for it cannot be suppos ed that Christ is on the side of Hitler and the rule of cruel aggr ession. The spiritual Hiera rchy of the planet is throw ing the weight of its strengt h against the Axis pow ers just in so far as the spiritually minde d peopl es of the world can collabor ate, for there can be no coercion of man's free will. No one is afraid of the allied nations ; the si tuation has not been precipitated by the Allies; their methods are not the methods of lying propa ganda and the terrorising of the weak and the defenceless. Facts prove these poi nts, and it is this recogni tion which lies behind the cons tant aid of the Unite d States. The way of living and the spiritual obj ects of the democracies are recogni sed by all, and it is these which are threatened by the totalitarian conc epts of life. Through the democracies hum anity speaks. The Axis World Order The totalitarian ord er must go because it is cont rary to the spiritual vision. The world order, as visioned by Hitler, is based upon the subj ection of the weak to the rule of a supe r - Germany; it is one in which the life of the little nations will be allow ed to go on just in s o far as they serve the need of Germany. The lesser Axis pow ers are permitted existence onl y because they benefit German aims — Italy, to give Germany scope in the Mediterranean; Japan, to handl e the Asiatic probl em which is too large for Germany to handl e a lone . It is an order whos e intention is that the best of all indus trial and agricultural produc ts shall go to Germany and the unw anted residue to the little nations . It is an order in which the educ ationa l processes will be cont rolled by the dom inant supe r - race. All departments of know ledge will be subor dinated to the glorification of Germany. Germany will be por trayed as the seed of all world glory, and as the ruthless saviour of manki nd; the beauties of war, of struggl e and of phys ical strengt h will be empha sised, and these so - called adm irable obj ectives of the hum an spirit will be develope d to produc e a race of men in whom the \"effeminate\" beauties of lovi ng kindne ss and wise cons ideration for others will find no place. I woul d call your atten tion to the teaching now being given to the German you th. Might is right . The German belongs to the supe r - race, and all other races are inferior. Only a chos en aristocracy shoul d be permitted the privilege of educ ation and of rule. The masses of the peopl e are no more than cattle and exist onl y to be slaves of the supe rior race. War is to men what childbirth is to wom en. War is a natural process and therefore eternally right . All sour ces of suppl y must be cont rolled by Germany, and"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST cons eque ntly even thos e n ations at present neutral must be brought unde r the German sphe re of influence. The totalitarian pow ers will dom inate the econom ic system of the world and cont rol all impor ts and expor ts. The standa rd of living in bot h hemisphe res will be low ered; everythi ng will be related to the good of Germany, and no other nation will be cons idered. Christian teaching and Christian ethics must necessarily be eliminated, because Germany regards Christianity and its divine Founde r as effeminate and weak, as empha sising th e softer qua lities of hum an nature, and as respons ible for the decadence of all nations , except Germany. Christianity must also be overthrow n because it is based on Jewish sour ces; the rule of Christ must com e to an end, because onl y the rule of force is r ight. In the world order of the Axis pow ers, the indi vidual has no right s; he has no freedom except in so far as he serves the state; there will be no liberty of thought or cons cience, all issues will be decided by the state, and the private citizen will have no right to an opi nion. Men will be drafted like slaves into the service of the state. Such is the picture of the order which the Axis powers are preparing to impos e upon the world, and to this their ow n words testify. Only insight into th e true nature of this crisis, a determination to face the facts, and fearlessness will suffice to defeat Hitler. This conque ring fearlessness must be based on a recogni tion of the spiritual values invol ved, on a belief in God, and on a com mons ense which is determined to establish security, right hum an relations and liberty. It is important that peopl e face up to the facts immediately. They must realise what is the nature of the world order which Hitler is preparing to enforce, and what lies ahead of hum ani ty if the Axis pow ers trium ph. It is essential that the little children of the world be rescued from this ove rshadow ing evil and from the false educ ation to which they will be subj ected if the totalitarian pow ers hold Europe in their grasp. The intensive c ulture given to the yout h of Germany dur ing the past twenty years has prove d the effects of envi roni ng mental attitude s. These boys who roll their tanks and fly their planes ove r the count ries of Europe and who wage war on wom en and children are the produc t of an educ ationa l system, and are therefore the victims of an evil process. The children of Germany must be rescued from the future which Hitler plans, as well as the children of other count ries; the wom en of Germany must be set free from fear, as must t he wom en in other lands ; the popul ation of Germany must also be liberated from the evil rule of Hitler. This is recognised by the allied nations . Make no mistake. The German is as dear to the heart of humanity, to God, to Christ and to all right thinki ng p eopl e as are any other peopl e. The German must be rescued from Hitler's world order as much as the Pole, the Jew, the Czech or any captive nation. In effecting this freedom , the allied nations and the neutral pow ers must preserve the spirit of goodw ill, ev en when using force, which is the onl y means of conque st the totalitarian pow ers unde rstand. Steps Tow ards the New World Order In cont radistinction to the totalitarian world order, what shoul d the rest of the world plan? Tow ards what world ob jectives shoul d the democracies work? Utopi an schemes, idealistic forms of gove rnm ent and cultural living processes have ever been the playthings of the hum an mind, dow n through the centuries. But these Utopi as have been so far ahead of pos sibility that th eir presentation seems useless. They are most of them whol ly impractical. Certain immediate pos sibilities and attainable obj ectives can, how ever, be worked out , given a definite"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST will - to - good and patience on the part of humanity. Certain major and spiritu al premises shoul d lie back of all efforts to formulate the new world order. Let me state som e of them: 1. The new world order must meet the immediate need and not be an attempt to satisfy som e distant, idealistic vision. 2. The new world order must be a ppropr iate to a world which has passed through a destructive crisis and to a hum anity which is badly shattered by the expe rience. 3. The new world order must lay the founda tion for a future world order which will be pos sible onl y after a time of recove ry, of recons truction, and of rebui lding. 4. The new world order will be founde d on the recogni tion that all men are equa l in origin and goa l but that all are at differing stages of evol utiona ry developm ent; that persona l integrity, intelligence, vision and e xpe rience, plus a marked goodw ill, shoul d indicate leadership. The dom ination of the proletariat ove r the aristocracy and bour geoisie, as in Russia, or the dom ination of an entrenched aristocracy ove r the proletariat and middl e classes, as has been unt il l ately the case in Great Britain, must disappe ar. The cont rol of labour by capital or the cont rol of capital by labour must also go. 5. In the new world order, the gove rning body in any nation shoul d be com pos ed of thos e who work for the greates t good of the greatest num ber and who at the same time offer oppor tuni ty to all, seeing to it that the indi vidua l is left free. Toda y the men of vision are achieving recogni tion, thus making pos sible a right choi ce of leaders. It was not pos sible unt il thi s century. 6. The new world order will be founde d on an active sense of respons ibility. The rule will be \"all for one and one for all.\" This attitude among nations will have to be develope d. It is not yet present. 7. The new world order will not impos e a uni form type of gove rnment, a synt hetic religion and a system of standa rdisation upon the nations . The sove reign right s of each nation will be recogni sed and its peculiar genius, indi vidua l trends and racial qua lities will be permitted full expression. In one particular onl y shoul d there be an attempt to produ ce uni ty, and that will be in the field of educ ation. 8. The new world order will recogni se that the produc e of the world, the natural resour ces of the planet and its riches, belong to no one nation but shoul d be shared by all. There will be no nations unde r the categor y \"haves\" and others unde r the oppos ite categor y. A fair and prope rly organised distribut ion of the wheat, the oil and the mineral wealth of the world will be develope d, based upon the needs of each nation, upon its ow n internal resour ces and the requirements of its peopl e. All this will be worked out in relation to the whol e. 9. In the preparatory period for the new world order there will be a steady and regul ated disarmament. It will not be opt iona l. No nation will be permitted to produc e and organise any equi pm ent for destructive pur pos es or to infringe the security of any other nation. One of the first tasks of any future peace conf erence will be to regul ate this matter and gradua lly see to the disarming of the nations . These are the simple and general premises upon which the new world order must begin its work. These preliminary stages must be kept fluid and expe rimental; the vision of pos sibility must never be lost, and the founda tions must be preserved invi olate, but the intermediate processes and the expe rimentations"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST must be carried forward by men who, having the best interests of the whol e at heart, can change the detail of organisation whilst preserving the life of th e organism. Right Hum an Relations The obj ective of their work can be sum med up thus: the new world order will facilitate the establishing of right hum an relations , based on justice, on the recogni tion of inhe rited right s, on oppor tuni ty for all — irrespect ive of race, colour or creed — on the suppr ession of crime and selfishne ss through right educ ation, and on the recogni tion of divine pot entialities in man as well as the recogni tion of a divine directing Intelligence in Whom man lives, and moves and has his being. The difficulties conf ront ing the nations when the war is ove r may seem insupe rable but — given vision, goodw ill and patience — they can be solved. Assum ing that hum anity will not rest unt il the aggr essor nations are subdue d, it will be necessary for th e conque ring democracies to be generous , merciful, unde rstandi ng and attentive to the voi ce of the peopl e as a whol e. It is that voi ce (usually sound in its pronounc ements) which must be evoke d, recogni sed and listened to, and not the voi ces of the separat ive expone nts of any ideology, of any form of gove rnm ent, religion or party. The obj ective of thos e who are entrusted with the straight ening out of the world is not the impos ition of democracy upon the entire world or to force Christianity upon a world of diversified religions . It is surely to foster the best elements in any nationa l gove rnm ent to which the peopl e may subs cribe, or which they intelligently endor se. Each nation shoul d recogni se that its form of gove rnm ent may be suited to it and q uite uns uited to anot her nation; it shoul d be taugh t that the func tion of each nation is the perfecting of its nationa l life, rhythm and machinery, so that it can be an efficient co - partner with all other nations . It is equa lly essential that the new worl d order shoul d develop in humanity a sense of divinity and of relations hip to God, yet with no empha sis upon racial theologi es and separative creeds. The essentials of religious and pol itical beliefs must be taught and a new simplicity of life inculcated. Toda y, these are lost in the empha sis laid upon material pos session, upon things and upon mone y. The probl em of mone y will have to be faced; the problem of the distribut ion of wealth — whether natural or hum an — will need careful handl ing and a com prom ise reac hed between thos e nations which pos sess unl imited resour ces and thos e who have few or none ; the problem of the varying forms of nationa l gove rnm ent must be faced with courage and insight ; the restoration — psychol ogi cal, spiritual and phys ical — of manki nd mus t cons titute a primary respons ibility. The sense of security must be put on a firm basis — the basis of right relations hip, and not the basis of force. Men must feel secure because they are seeking to develop internationa l goodw ill and can trust each other, and are not therefore depende nt upon the strengt h of their armies and fleets. The recogni tion of a spiritual Hierarchy which is working through the New Group of World Servers must steadily grow in som e form or anot her. This will happe n when the world stat esmen and the rulers of the different nations and gove rning bodi es — pol itical and religious — are men of vision, spiritually motivated and selflessly inspired. The future world order will be the effective expr ession of a fusion of the inne r spiritual way of life and the out er civilised and cultural way of acting; this is a definite pos sibility because hum anity, in its uppe r brackets, has already develope d the pow er to live in the intellectual and phys ical worlds simultaneous ly. Many toda y are living in the sp iritual world also. Tom orrow there will be many more. "},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST III. SOME PROBLEMS INVOLVED The new world order will be conf ronted with many probl ems. These probl ems will not be solved by the impos ition of a solution by means of force, as in the Axis w orld order. They will be solved by right educ ationa l processes and by unde rstandi ng the objectives of the true world order. They fall roughl y into four categor ies: the racial probl em, the econom ic probl em, the probl em of gove rnm ent, and the religious probl em. The Racial Probl em There is no way of solving the racial probl em by legislation, segregation, or by the effort to produc e nationa l blocs, as in the case in Germany toda y when she proclaims Germany as the supe r - race. Such efforts will onl y produc e in supe rable barriers. With very few exceptions , there are no pur e races. Germany in particular, by its place at the crossroads of Europe , is definitely the fusion of many strains. Tides of emigration, marching armies throughout the centuries, and mode rn trav el have inextricably mixed and fused all the races. It may therefore be assum ed that any attempt to isolate a race or to enforce so - called \"racial pur ity\" is foredoom ed to failure. The onl y solution of this problem is the basic recogni tion that all men are brothers; that one blood pour s through hum an veins; that we are all the children of the one Father and that our failure to recogni se this fact is simply an indi cation of man's stupi dity. Historical backgr ounds , climatic condi tions and widespread inter - mar riage have made the different races what they are toda y. Essentially, however, hum anity is one — the heir of the ages, the produc t of many fusions , condi tione d by circum stances and enriched by the processes of evol utiona ry developm ent. This basic uni ty must now be recogn ised. The major racial probl em has, for many centuries, been the Jewish, which has been brought to a critical poi nt by Germany. This probl em is also capable of solution if prope rly recogni sed for what it is, and if coupl ed with an effort by the Jews themselves to solve it, and to be coope rative in the world efforts to adjust their probl em. This they have not yet done because the average Jew is lone ly and uns ettled, able to do little to put himself right before the world. Instinctive ly and intellectually, the Jew is separative; intuitively he has vision, but at the same time he possesses no sense of fusion with other peopl es. There is no scientific and hitherto unknow n mode of solving racial probl ems. It is finally a que stion of righ t thinki ng, decent behaviour, and simple kindn ess. The que stion will not be solved by inter - marriage, or by isolating groups for occupa tion of special areas, or by any man - made ideas of supe riority or inferiority. Right human relations will com e by a mutua l recogni tion of mistakes, by sorrow for wrong action in the past, and by restitution, if pos sible. It will com e when nations can be educ ated to appr eciate the good qua lities of other nations and to com prehend the part they play in the whol e picture. It wi ll be develope d when the sense of racial supe riority is killed; when racial differences and racial qua rrels are relegated to the unhol y past and onl y a future of coope ration and of unde rstandi ng is actively develope d; it will make its presence felt when th e living standa rds of right relation (sought by the enlight ened peopl e of every race) becom e the habitual attitude of the masses and when it is regarded as cont rary to the best interests of any nation to spread thos e ideas which tend to erect racial or nat iona l barriers, arous e hatreds or foster differences and separation. Such a time will surely com e. Hum anity will master the problem of right hum an relations and attitude s. It is inevitable that racial differences, nationa l qua rrels and caste distinction e xist, but it is equa lly imperative that they disappe ar. The world is one world. Hum anity is one uni t in the evol utiona ry process. Differences are man - made and enge nde r hatreds and separation. When the children of the"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST various races are taught from their ear liest years that there are no differences, that all men are brothers, and that the appa rent distinctions are essentially supe rficial, then future generations will appr oach the probl em of world interrelations unha ndi cappe d by prejudi ce, by pride of race, or by instilled historical resentments. By right educ ation little children can be taught right attitude s and will respond, for a child sees and recogni ses no differences, and the truth of the Biblical prom ise that \"a little child shall lead them\" will be prove n scientifically true. In the new world order this educ ationa l process will be started. The Econom ic Probl em This probl em is basically far less difficult of solution. Sound com mons ense can solve it. There are adequa te resour ces for the sust enance of hum an life, and these science can increase and develop. The mineral wealth of the world, the oil, the produc e of the fields, the cont ribut ion of the animal kingdom , the riches of the sea, and the fruits and the flow ers are all offering themselves to hum anity. Man is the cont roller of it all, and they belong to everyone and are the prope rty of no one group, nation or race. It is solely due to man's selfishne ss that (in these days of rapid transpor tation) thous ands are starving whilst food is rottin g or destroye d; it is solely due to the grasping schemes and the financial injustices of man's making that the resour ces of the planet are not uni versally available unde r som e wise system of distribut ion. There is no justifiable excuse for the lack of the essentials of life in any part of the world. Such a state of lack argue s shor t - sight ed pol icy and the blocking of the free circulation of necessities for som e reason or other. All these deplorable condi tions are based on som e nationa l or group selfishne ss and on the failure to work out some wise impartial scheme for the suppl ying of hum an need throughout the world. What then must be done , apart from the educ ation of the com ing generations in the need for shar ing , for a free circulation of all the essential com modi ties? The cause of this evil way of living is very simple. It is a product of past wrong educ ationa l methods , of com petition and the facility with which the helpless and weak can be expl oited. No one group is respons ible as certain fanat ical ideologi sts might lead the ignor ant to suppos e. Our period is simply one in which hum an selfishne ss has com e to its climax and must either destroy hum anity or be brought intelligently to an end. Three things will end this condi tion of great luxur y an d extreme pove rty, of gross ove r - feeding of the few and the starvation of the many, plus the centralisation of the world's produc e unde r the cont rol of a handf ul of peopl e in each count ry. These are: first, the recogni tion that there is enough food , fuel, oil and minerals in the world to meet the need of the entire popul ation. The probl em, therefore, is basically one of distribution. Secondl y, this premise of adequate suppl y handl ed through right distribut ion must be accepted, and the suppl ies which are ess ential to the health, security and happi ness of manki nd must be made available. Third, that the entire econom ic probl em and the institution of the needed rules and distribut ing agencies shoul d be handl ed by an econom ic league of nat ions . In this league , al l the nations will have their place; they will know their nationa l requi rements (based on popul ation and internal resour ces, etc.) and will know also what they can cont ribut e to the family of nations ; all will be animated by the will to the general good — a will - to - good that will proba bly at first be based on expe diency and nationa l need but which will be constructive in its working out . Certain facts are obvi ous . The old order has failed. The resour ces of the world have fallen into the hands of the selfish, and there has been no just distribut ion. Som e nations have had too much, and have expl oited their surplus; other nations have had too little, and their nationa l life and their financial situation have been crippl ed thereby. At the close of this war all th e nations will be in financial"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST difficulties. All nations will requi re re - bui lding; all will have to attend actively to the settlement of the future econom ic life of the planet and its adjustment upon sounde r lines. This period of adjustment offers the opp ortuni ty to effect drastic and deeply needed change s and the establishing of a new econom ic order, based on the cont ribut ion of each nation to the whol e, the sharing of the funda mental necessities of life and the wise pool ing of all resour ces fo r the benefit of everybody, plus a wise system of distribut ion. Such a plan is feasible. The solution here offered is so simple that, for that very reason, it may fail to make an appe al. The qua lity requi red by thos e engi neering this change of econom ic fo cus is so simple also — the will - to - good — that again it may be ove r - looke d, but without simplicity and goodw ill little can be effected after the world war. The great need will be for men of vision, of wide sym pathy, techni cal know ledge and cosmopol itan intere st. They must pos sess also the conf idence of the peopl e. They must meet toge ther and lay dow n the rules whereby the world can be adequa tely fed; they must determine the nature and extent of the cont ribut ion which any one nation must make; they must settle the nature and extent of the suppl ies which shoul d be given to any nation, and so bring about thos e condi tions which will keep the resour ces of the world circulating justly and engi neer thos e preventive measures which will offset hum an selfishne ss and gree d. Can such a group of men be found? I believe it can. Everyw here there are deep stude nts of hum an nature, scientific inve stigators with wide hum an sym pathies, and cons cientious men and wom en who have for long — unde r the old and cruel system — wrestled with the probl em of hum an pain and need. The new era of simplicity must com e in. The new world order will inaugur ate this simpler life based on adequa te food, right though t, creative activity and happi ness. These essentials are onl y pos sible unde r a right econ om ic rule. This simplification and this wise distribut ion of the world's resour ces must embrace the high and the low , the rich and the poo r, thus serving all men alike. The Probl em Of Governm ent Com ing now to the realm of gove rnm ent, unde r the new world order, one is faced with a very com plex situation. Certain great ideologi cal regimes have divided the world into oppos ing groups . There are the great democracies, unde r which certain of the few remaining mona rchies find a place; there are the t otalitarian pow ers in which the ancient dictatorships and autocracies of the past are sum med up. There is not hing new in the Axis pol icies. They are essentially reactiona ry groups , for tyrants, cruelty and the expl oitation of the weak are part of ancient h istory. The democracies, with all their present ineffectiveness, have in them the germ of that which is truly new, for they are the expr ession of an upw ard surging tow ards self - rule and self - mastery by hum anity as a whol e. There is also the com muni stic ide al which is a curious blend of indi vidua lism, dictatorship, the ancient conflict between labour and capital, the Sermon on the Mount , and the worst aspects of revol ution and expl oitation. The lines which it will follow , even in the immediate future, are un predictable. There are other count ries and peopl es whos e gove rnm ents are condi tione d by their envi ronm ent and who at present play no real determining part in world events, except in so far as a greater pow er uses them. Again, there are peopl es and tribes w ho still pursue their little lives, una ffected by the turmoil to be found in the more highl y civilised parts of the world. Behind all this diversity of gove rnmental methods , certain clear outlines are emerging which indi cate"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST wider fusions and a tende ncy t o bring about certain synt heses. Various basic trends of thought are appe aring which, in the new world order, will unf old into that major synt hesis so much desired by the spiritual Hierarchy of the planet, and which, whilst preserving the large nationa l an d racial out lines, will produc e an unde rlying and subj ective state of mind which will end the age of separateness. Desire is toda y being evoke d for the Federated States of Europe , mode lled on the lines of the British Com monw ealth of Nations or the United S tates of America; there is talk of a new order in Asia, of the Good Neighbour pol icy in America, of a Federal Union of the democratic nations ; there is also the steady spread of the Sovi et Socialist Republ ics. Certain major groupi ngs woul d seem pos sible and proba bly advi sable. They might be divided as follows: 1. A Federal Union of the great democracies after the war. This might include the British Empire as a whol e, the United States, the Scandi navian count ries and certain nor thern Europe an nat ions , including Germany. 2. A Union of the Latin count ries, includi ng France, Spain, all the Mediterranean count ries, the Balkan count ries (except one or two which might be absorbed into the U.S.S.R.), and Sout h America. 3. The United Soviet Socialist Re publ ics and certain Asiatic nations working in collabor ation with them, such as China, and later Japan. These three great blocs woul d not be antagoni stic blocs but simply geogr aphi cal sphe res of influence. They woul d all three work in the closest uni ty an d econom ic relation. Each nation within the three blocs woul d preserve its sove reign inde pende nce, but between these inde pende nt nations and between these blocs there woul d be identity of pur pos e, uni ty of effort and the recogni tion of the econom ic cont rol of a league of nations . This league , being formed of the representatives of all the nations and its inne r gove rning body being chos en by the three blocs, woul d cont rol all sour ces of suppl y, distribut e all such suppl ies and determine all econom ic pol icies . With the details of these future adjustments I shall not deal. They must be wrought out by the men and wom en of goodw ill in the crucible of expe riment and expe rience. Only uni versal disaster coul d have brought men to a state of mind wherein such propo si tions and solutions coul d be presented. The general recogni tion that the old order has lamentably failed is most valuable. The Religious Probl em When we com e to cons ider religion in the new world order, we are faced with a far more com plicated probl em and yet, at the same time, with a far easier one . The reason for this is that the subj ect of religion is one which is studi ed and som ewhat und erstood by the majority of men. On theologi cal interpretations there are wide differences; on a widespre ad recogni tion of a uni versal divine Intelligence or of God (by whatever name the all - embracing Life may be called) there is a general similarity of reaction. Forms of religion are so different, and the theologi cal adhe rents are so fierce in their loya ltie s and partisanships, that the emergence of a world religion is necessarily of profound difficulty. But that emergence is very close at hand and the differences are relatively supe rficial. The new world religion is nearer than many think, and this is due to two things : first, the theologi cal qua rrels are mainly ove r non - essentials, and secondl y, the younge r generation is basically spiritual but qui te uni nterested in theology . "},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST The intelligent yout h of all count ries are rapidly repudi ating orthodox theology, state ecclesiasticism and the cont rol of the chur ch. They are neither interested in man - made interpretations of truth nor in past qua rrels between the major world religions . At the same time, they are profoundl y interested in the spiritual values and are e arnestly seeking verification of their deep - seated unvoi ced recogni tions . They look to no bible or system of so - called inspired spiritual know ledge and revelation, but their eyes are on the unde fined larger whol es in which they seek to merge and lose thems elves, such as the state, an ideology, or hum anity itself. In this expr ession of the spirit of self - abne gation may be seen the appe arance of the deepest truth of all religion and the justification of the Christian message. Christ, in His high place, cares not whether men accept the theologi cal interpretations of schol ars and chur chm en, but He doe s care whether the keynot e of His life of sacrifice and service is reproduc ed among men; it is immaterial to Him whether the empha sis laid upon the detail and the v eracity of the Gospel story is recogni sed and accepted, for He is more interested that the search for truth and for subj ective spiritual expe rience shoul d persist; He know s that within each hum an heart is found that which responds instinctively to God, and that the hope of ultimate glory lies hid in the Christ - cons cious ness. Therefore, in the new world order, spirituality will supe rsede theology; living expe rience will take the place of theologi cal acceptances. The spiritual realities will emerg e with increasing clarity and the form aspect will recede into the backgr ound; dyna mic, expr essive truth will be the keynot e of the new world religion. The living Christ will assum e His right ful place in hum an cons cious ness and see the fruition of His plan s, sacrifice and service, but the hol d of the ecclesiastical orders will weaken and disappe ar. Only thos e will remain as gui des and leaders of the hum an spirit who speak from living expe rience, and who know no creedal barriers; they will recogni se the onw a rd march of revelation and the new emerging truths. These truths will be founde d on the ancient realities but will be adapted to mode rn need and will manifest progr essively the revelation of the divine nature and qua lity. God is now know n as Intelligence a nd Love . That the past has given us. He must be know n as Will and Purpos e, and that the future will reveal. When the racial problem has disappe ared through the recogni tion of the one Life, when the econom ic probl em has been solved by the nations working c oope ratively toge ther, when the probl em of right gove rnm ent within each nation has been determined by the free will of their respective peopl es, and the spirit of true religion is unobs tructed by ancient forms and interpretations , then we shall see a world in process of right expe rience, right hum an relations and a spiritual moving forward to reality. A study of these four lines of hum an living will show how truly Germany is toda y the focal poi nt of the world situation. In that unha ppy nation, the racial p robl em has attained such impor tance that the entire world is affected. From the econom ic angl e, Hitler has said that Germany has been forced to fight in order to preserve the life, econom ically speaking, of her peopl e; factually, the econom ic life of Germa ny was not as critically threatened as that of many smaller nations . The probl em of gove rnm ent has also been brought to a critical poi nt by German activity and conque st and by the empha sis laid by the Axis pow ers upon the relation of the state t o the indi vidua l. The attitude of the German rulers to religion is recogni sed as one of pronounc ed antagoni sm. Thus the four major world probl ems are today being precipitated by Germany into the arena of action ; they are evoki ng enqui ry everyw here; the att ention of men in every land is now focussed on these probl ems, and solution is inevitable when the war is ove r. When these probl ems are right ly appr oached by the men and wom en of goodw ill, then we shall see a \"world planni ng\" for the produc tion of harmoni o us living such as never before has been pos sible. It is for hum anity to solve its serious probl ems on the basis of brotherhood , and so bring in a way of"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST living which will provi de adequa te suppl y of the necessities of life through the prope r organising of time, labour and goods . This will lead to an interplay between the citizen and the state which will evoke the service of the indi vidua l and the right protection of the state. Hum anity will then be free for the expe riment of spiritual living, and this will expr ess itself throug h awakened hum an lives. Can more be asked for or expe cted than this? Such a way of life can be made pos sible if the men and wom en of goodw ill, of intelligence and of idealism can begin the task of inaugur ating the new world order. I V. THE TASK AHEAD This brings us now to the practical aspects of the subj ect and to the answering of the follow ing que stion: Given the pos sibility of the new world order, what can be done to bring it into being at this time, in the midst of the conf lict? The period into which we are now entering divides itself into two parts: 1. The present period of the war itself, unt il the defeat of Germany and the end of the actual fighting. 2. The period after the guns have ceased roaring. The needed pea ce, recons truction and rebui lding will then have to be determined. It is with these periods that we must conc ern ourselves. They are, and will be, times of great difficulty and of painful conf lict and adjustment. The task of restoring the world to harmony and order is a stupe ndous one . The educ ating of peopl e everyw here in the necessity for new ideals of right living, for the new rhyt hm s and the new \"sharing\" will not be easy. The work of healing the wounds of hum anity, of rebui lding the shattered civilisa tion, of instituting disarmament, of recogni sing nationa l, material and psychol ogi cal needs, and of rescuing and restoring the happi ness of the little children of the world and planni ng their future security will take the best that is in the men and wom en of goodw ill; it will call for the wise gui dance of the New Group of World Servers and will enga ge the attention of intelligent peopl e and unde rstandi ng minds in every nation. The first preliminary is for the men and wom en of goodw ill to decide onc e and fo r all with which of the two forces, battling toge ther, they will take their stand, mentally and spiritually, even if they are not called upon by their count ry to do so phys ically. I write at this time for thos e who take their stand on the side of the cons t ructive forces which are fighting for the democratic values and the freedom of the peopl es. I woul d here remind you that among the peopl e in Germany and Italy there are thous ands who also silently take their stand with thos e struggl ing for victory ove r the Axis pow ers. This must never be forgot ten, for such peopl e exist in their multitude s unde r totalitarian rule. The Forces of Light are found in every land but are at present onl y able to expr ess themselves effectively in the count ries range d against German y. The men and wom en of goodw ill, associated with the New Group of World Servers, shoul d seek intelligently to unde rstand the current problem, and to study the world situation from all pos sible angl es.

Men shoul d cultivate these qua lities, divor cing them from all sentimental emotion and dealing factually with circum stance and envi roni ng condi tions . It must be realised that the task to be done will take time, and the men and women of goodw ill must brace themselves for sustained effort, for oppos ition, and for that dead lethargy and sick inertia which afflicts the masses of"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST the peopl e in every land. The immediate activities are two in num ber: 1. The findi ng of thos e peopl e in every count ry who react to the vision of the new world order and who are the men and wom en of goodw ill. 2. The presentation of the future pos sibilities, by them, to the masses of peopl e in all lands . I woul d he re remind you that members of the New Group of World Servers and men and wom en of goodw ill must be sought for in every department of life. They will be found among the adhe rents of all the current ideologies and in pol itical and scientific circles, among t he world educ ators and phi lanthropi sts, among the creative workers, the indus trialists, in ordinary hom es and in the ranks of labour . The New Group of World Servers The New Group of World Servers is not a new organisation which is forming in the world. It is simply a loos e linki ng toge ther of all men of cons tructive peace aims and goodw ill who lay the empha sis upon the prior need of establishing right human relations before any lasting peace is pos sible. This group in no way interferes with the allegianc e and loya lties of any man. It is a bandi ng toge ther of all who seek to expr ess the spirit of Christ and who are free from the spirit of hatred and revenge . The challenge of this group to the world is to drop all antagoni sms and antipathies, all hatred and racial differences, and attempt to live in terms of the one family, the one life, and the one hum anity. The New Group of World Servers believes that (through the agency of goodw ill) the new world order can be firmly established on Earth. Toda y , in the interim period of the war, preparation for recons truction can go forward simultaneous ly with the effort to defeat the totalitarian pow ers. The men and wom en of goodw ill must not be energised into activity with the not e of sacrifice. The war has e xacted much of that from them. The clarion note of joy through goodw ill activity must be sent out. Let the beauty of what can be, the glory of the vision and the spiritual, scientific and phys ical rebui lding of hum anity be held before them, inspiring them to renewed effort. Through the work earlier done all ove r the world by the men of vision and of goodw ill, there exist toda y many thous ands of peopl e in Europe , America and elsewhere who are waiting for the gui dance which will start them into right activit y. In every land the men and wom en of goodw ill are to be foun d, ready to respond to a clear call and intelligent organisation in the service of recons truction. Let them be found. The message to be taught prior to any future peace cons ists of the follow ing three clear and practical truths: 1. That the errors and mistakes of past centuries, culminating in the present world war, are the joint errors and mistakes of hum anity as a whol e. This recogni tion will lead to the establishing of the principle of shar in g , so needed in the world toda y. 2. That there are no probl ems and condi tions which cannot be solved by the will - to - good . Goodw ill nour ishes the spirit of unde rstandi ng and fosters the manifestation of the principle of coope ration . This"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST coope rative spirit is the secret of all right hum an relations and the enemy of com petition. 3. That there is a blood relations hip between men which, when recogni sed, dissolves all barriers and ends the spirit of separativeness and hate. The peace and happi ness of each is t he conc ern, therefore, of all. This develops the principle of respons ibility and lays the founda tion of right corpor ate action. These are the basic beliefs of the men and wom en of goodw ill and provi de the incentive to all service and action. Th ese three practical and scientific truths embody the three basic facts and the initial acceptance of all world servers. They are cont rary to no world pos ition, subve rsive of no gove rnm ent or religious attitude and are inna te in the cons cious ness of all men , evoki ng immediate respons e. Their acceptance will \"heal\" internationa l sores. I call on all the men and wom en of goodw ill in the world to study the principles of the new world order. I call upon them, as they fight for justice and the rights of the litt le nations and the future of the children of all nations , to begin to educ ate thos e whom they can reach, in right attitude s and in that foresight ed vision which will make the mistakes of the past impos sible in the future. One basic divine attribut e is not yet as strong as it shoul d be in hum anity — the attribut e of forgiveness. It is still associated with magna nimity. It is not seen to be essentially a condi tion of future relation between all nations , based upon a recogni tion of our com mon humanity. Germany, unde r her misgui ded and evil rulers, needs forgiveness. All the great Pow ers have also sinne d in som e degree and all have grievous ly erred in the past. Germany has precipitated the evil which has com e upon the world, but she has within herself the seeds o f her ow n pun ishm ent; these seeds will not com e to fruition if excessive puni shm ent is inflicted from out side. Three recogni tions will save the world when the guns cease firing: 1. The recogni tion of joint respons ibility for past world condi tions . The tr uth that \"all have sinne d\" must be faced. 2. The recogni tion that, though the German peopl e weakly acqui esced in the rule of Hitler, they are basically the victims of an organised deception. Since 1914 they have been told onl y lies. The future new world order will inaugur ate an era of truthful propa ganda and nationa l and internationa l information. 3. The recogni tion that the past has gone with all its evils, and that a future of unl imited pos sibilities for good and for cons tructive change s lies ahead. The future must be develope d by all nations in the closest collabor ation. These three poi nts must be cons tantly presented to the publ ic in the simplest langua ge, because it is the inert mass of unt hinking peopl e who will cons titute the hardest pro blem. Appe al must be made to the best that is in them, because the immediate task ahead is the developm ent of thos e right attitude s without which no peace can be lasting and justice will not be pos sible. Peace must not be impos ed by thos e who hate war. Pea ce must be a natural out come and expr ession of the hum an spirit, and of a determination to change the world attitude into one of right human relations . This is no impos sible idealistic dream, but an immediate pos sibility, given the spirit of forgiveness a nd goodw ill. Patience will be requi red, because the nervous strain of war and pain and anxi ety, fear and"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST unde rfeeding will have to be reckone d with. Hum an beings will be the same as before the war, except for exha ustion and a willingne ss on the part of the majority to accept almost any terms which will allow them to live qui etly again, free from the immediate fear of bom bs and starvation and ruin. The great need will be for slow action, leaving time for the needed healing processes and adjustment before the final peace terms are settled by the nations , sitting in conc lave. Nations will have to shift from a war foot ing to settled peace activities, and from the organised tensions of war to the com parative relaxations of peace. Disarmament must go forward as an initial move , but in such a manne r that the que stion of une mploym ent is not undul y aggr avated. The \"turning of the cannon into ploughs hares\" must be carried out with judgm ent, and onl y wide internationa l planni ng can take care of this stupe ndou s process. The settling of nationa l bound aries and sphe res of influence will be one of the utmost difficulty and can onl y be satisfactorily determined if goodw ill is actively present and cons cious ly used , and when the wishes of the people invol ved are cons ulted in a non - partisan spirit. The empha sis upon past historical bounda ries as a determining factor is ever dange rous . Wise and slow action will here be needed and prope r cons ideration of popul ation desires. It is not the restoration of the ancient landm a rks which is desirable, but the restoration of nationa l and racial sphe res of influence in accordance with the present situation. It is not the impos ition of any particular ideology upon the world, or its remova l, which is of impor tance, but the establish ing of thos e world condi tions which will give all the nations adequa te food, the necessities of life, and oppor tunity then to expr ess themselves, and to make their uni que cont ribut ion to the welfare of the whol e family of nations . The working details will have to be develope d by all peopl es in the closest collabor ation. Men of vision, and not just pol iticians; world servers, and not just military leaders; and humanitarians, and not just the rulers of nations , must determine these tremendous issues. As they do so they must be able to count upon the suppor t of the men and wom en of goodw ill in every land. To sum up: The interim between the present time and the final adjustment falls into two major periods and the practical work in each can be clearly defined: 1. The interim between toda y and the cessation of war. This must be used in the follow ing ways: a. To educ ate and stabilise all men and wom en of goodw ill. b. To discove r the workers, hum anitarians and thos e men and wom en of unde rstandi ng and vision who will respond to the principles here given. c. To prepare these men and wom en to work in uni son for justice and right hum an relations in all count ries after the cessation of the war. 2. The interim between the end of the phys ical fighting and the final peace settlement. It is to be hope d — for the sake of justice — that this interlude will cove r several years of rehabilitation and educ ation. During these interlude s between the past and the new world order, the men and wom en of goodw ill can actively aid the statesmen of all nations by intelligent coope ration, in the planne d focussing of enlight ened publ ic opi nion, and in defining and teaching the real meaning of right hum an relations . It is with the first interlude that we are now conc erned."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST It is desirable to get into immediate touc h with those whos e names are already know n to you , and set them to work and let them — in their turn — find others, and gui de them also into the way of recons truction. Let all these names and addr esses be gathered toge ther i n central and nationa l mailing lists, but let them also be kept in both New York and London, for it is the task of the Engl ish speaking peopl es to rebui ld the world with the help of all other nations . There must, therefore, be som e measure of centralisatio n of the work and som e way in which these peopl e can be reached and swept into coope rative activity. With goodw ill to all, with a staunc h belief in the divine pos sibilities of hum an beings and in the future resurrection of hum anity, with an exalted recogn ition of God, with an acknow ledgm ent of the funda mental values of Christ's teaching, and with a joyf ul determination to go forward with the work of recons truction, I call upon thos e who respond to this vision immediately to set to work. I call you to no o rganisationa l loya lties, but onl y to love your fellow men, be they German, American, Jewish, British, French, Negro or Asiatic. I call you from your dreams of vague beauty, impos sible Utopi as and wishful thinki ng to face life as it is today ; and then to beg in, in the place where you are, to make it better. I call you to the expe riment of right hum an relations , beginni ng with your ow n personal relations to your family and friends , and then to the task of educ ating thos e you cont act so that they als o start a similar work. It is the work of attaining right indi vidua l relations , right group relations , right intergroup relations , right nationa l relations and right internationa l relations . I call you to the realisation that in this work no one is futile or useless, but that all have a place of practical value. I call you to recogni se that goodw ill is a dyna mic energy which can bring about world change s of a funda mental kind, and that its mode of expr ession is through the activity of the indi vidua l man and wom an and through their massed intent. The massed pow er of goodw ill, the dyna mic effect of intelligent and active unde rstandi ng, and the pot ency of a trained and alive publ ic opi nion which desires the greatest good of the greatest num ber, are beyond belie f. This dyna mic pow er has never been employe d. It can, toda y, save the world. THE WO RLD CRISIS FROM HIERARCHICAL VIEWP OINT April - May 1940 Anot her Wesak Festival will be close at hand when you receive this com muni cation. Its urgency, imminence and final ity prom pt me again to attempt to awaken thos e of you who receive it to the present oppor tuni ty and to the spiritual urgency of this high mom ent in hum an affairs. The three Full Moon periods of April, May and June are most signi ficant and determining, and upon what happe ns dur ing the next few weeks, whilst the sun is still movi ng nor thw ards, much will depend. In this com muni cation I would like to do two things: First of all, give you a better idea as to how the spiritual Hierarchy of our planet regards the present world crisis, and secondl y, indi cate to you certain major eventualities which are depende nt upon three things : 1. A pos sible divine intervention which may be brought about through the aspiration of all right - minde d peopl e, plus the intelligent an d cons tant use of the Great Invoc ation, now being used in its tens of thous ands by the world aspirants in every count ry."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST 2. The emergence of certain clear lines of demarcation between the activities of the Forces of Light and the forces of mate rialistic aggr ession. 3. The place which clear thinki ng, wise speech and skill in action shoul d play in the attitude of the world disciples and the men and wom en of goodw ill everyw here. I shall ende avour to speak with a reasona ble brevity and clarity, an d I do so with com plete freedom from what you call bias. I speak in terms of hum anity — without distinction of race, colour or nation; I have no particular pol itical views, because I know that all pot ential theories, ideologi es and gove rnm ents are tempor ary states and condi tions , cont rolling different groups of hum an beings on their way from the hum an state to the divine. This is a point of view oft ove rlooke d by many of you who — tempor arily and oft fanatically — belong to one or other of these ephe meral states of mind and passing hum an attitude s. I have no particular religious preferences, know ing as I do that all roads lead to God and that the sense of divinity is so dom inant and inherent in the hum an heart that naught at any time can crush it out ; life, expe ri ence, trial, pain and instinctive hum an orientation lead all men finally back into the light of God. I can and do, therefore, love all men, irrespective of nationa lity and present ideas, as do all with whom I am associated. Looki ng upo n the movi ng screen o f time with a vision which reaches into the future and is inclusive of the past (for this is the preroga tive of all trained world disciples) I know that present events will play their timely part, will give place to others in due time, and that — when the im mediate processes of readjustment in hum an values, spiritual obj ectives and pol itical schemes, religious orientations and territorial synt heses are com pleted — the world will settle dow n again to the processes of daily living. The immediate oppor tuni ty and s ituation in which we find our selves will have prove d dyna mically useful or (such is the sad pos sibility) negatively futile. A fresh cycle of civilisation, culture and grow th will have been inaugur ated which will be colour ed by the ancient hue s o f selfish desire and aggr essive acqui sitiveness, or by the newer and more beautiful colour ing of happy and satisfactory internationa l relations hips, of religious unde rstandi ng and of the much needed and demande d econom ic coope ration. Such a dua l pos sibili ty confront s us now . One — new, right and spiritually oriented; the other, ancient, evil and unde sirable. Whether man will go forward into the better way of life or permit the perpetuation of the old ways and the domination of selfish personal, nationa l and racial interests remains yet to be determined. Two things are, how ever, obvi ous to us as we look at the present world situation; first, that the lines of demarcation between the two ways of living and the two obj ective attitude s are far more clearly defin ed than at any previous time in the history of hum anity; secondl y, that it is the muddl ed thinki ng of vast masses of well - meaning peopl e (many of them not immediately implicated in the world conf lict) which is largely respons ible for the slow ness of the fi nal crisis and the pos tpone ment of the adva ncing decision. For decades, we, the teachers of the race of men, have watched certain great world (or planetary) tende ncies take shape, assum e defined and pronou nced out lines and becom e condi tioni ng potencies. T his shaping and definition was essential if the issue was to be presented with clarity to hum anity, thus enabling a basic choi ce to be presented to the sons of men and the placing in their hands of certain determinations which coul d, if right ly directed, c arve out for them a new and better future. Such a presentation has never before been pos sible, because never before has manki nd been at the stage where it coul d grasp the situation intelligently, or been so closely and rapidly interrelated by the radio,"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST te lephone , the press and the telegraph. The needed choi ces can now be made in coope ration, in cons ultation and with ope n eyes. The choi ce is clearly before the thinki ng peopl e in every count ry, and upon their decision rests the fate of the less in telligent masses. Hence the present respons ibility of the nationa l leaders, of the representatives of the peopl e in the gove rnm ents, of the churches, and of the intelligentsia in all lands , without exception. There shoul d be no shirking or evasion of respo nsibility. There is, how ever, much. In past com muni cations I have oft spoke n of the Forces of Light and the Forces of Materialism, meaning by these terms the cont rolling trends tow ards brotherhood , right hum an relations and selfless pur pos e, and thos e whi ch reverse these highe r tendencies and bring into hum an affairs selfish acqui sitiveness, empha sis upon material interests, brutal aggr ession and cruelty. The two pos itions are clear to the unp rejudi ced onl ooke r. To these two groups I woul d add a third. Th is third group is taking shape in the world toda y with extreme definiteness and is com pos ed of thos e who throw the weight of their influence and of their action on neither side; theoretically, they may advoc ate the highe r way, but practically they do not hi ng to further its interests. This third group is formed internally of two groups : first, thos e peopl e who are pot entially weak and are therefore ridde n by fear and terror, feeling that they dare not move in any way against the forces of aggr ession, and sec ondl y, an intrinsically pow erful group who, through selfish material interests, plus a sense of separative supe riority, or distance from the seat of troubl e and the dom ination of false values, hol d aloof from the situation and shirk their evident respons ib ility as members of the hum an family. This latter group include s, among others, a num ber of pow erful democracies and republ ics. Fear, terror and a sense of helpless futility gove rn the reactions of the one , and who can criticise? Selfishne ss and separative ness cont rol the other group. You have, therefore, in the world at this time three groups of peopl e who embody the three major views of the whol e of humanity, plus the unt hinking masses, swayed by propa ganda , cont rolled by their gove rnm ents, and the prey of the loude st voi ces. It is of value to you to get this picture clearly in your minds , and I woul d like again to define them. 1. The ancient entrenched forces of aggression, of material acqui sition and pure selfishne ss, working through a prono unc ed cruelty which reaches out and grasps what it wants, irrespective of any other right s, historical and legal pos sessions or the will of anyone . 2. The forces of spiritual pur pos e, embodi ed in the will to protect the right s of others, along with indi vi dua l right s; to end aggression and its cons eque nt fear, and to throw the weight of their com bined influence on to the side of the most spiritual values, of hum an freedom , of the right to think, and of kindne ss. I use the word \"kindne ss\" advi sedly because i t embodi es the idea of kin - ship, of brotherhoo d and of right hum an relations . It is world goodw ill in expr ession, just as the will - to - good is the basis of any pos sible peace — a goodw ill which woul d negate any premature peace at this time, because the latter woul d give time for the Forces of Materialism to cons olidate their gains and prepare the way for further aggression. Kindne ss, the will - to - good and peace — such shoul d be the practical expr ession and the formulated intention of thos e who are condi tioned by the Forces of Light . 3. The force of mass negativity, as expr essed toda y by the dominated peopl e in the stronghol ds of aggr ession and by the neutrally minde d peopl e everyw here. They are all colour ed by racial fear, by the instinct to self - preservation, an d by shor t - sight ed selfish interest. "},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST The probl em is one of exceeding difficulty because, even though the lines of demarcation are becom ing steadily more distinct, yet the expone nts of these three groups are to be found in every land and among all peopl e — i n every church and in every hom e. No nation or group is exempt from this triplicity. It is root ed in hum an attitude s, and that is why this conflict is a strictly hum an conf lict and not a Europe an war . Every nation has its selfish, aggressive peopl e, who be lieve that might is right and that men must be gove rned by the law of the jung le, taking what they want, no matter at what cost to others. Every nation has thos e within its borders who see the vision of right human relations , who seek to live by the law of brotherhood, who respond to the influence of the Forces of Light and of the spiritual Hierarchy, and who desire peace, kindne ss and goodw ill to rule world affairs and cont rol the pol icies of the gove rnm ents. Every nation has also within it thos e neutrally - minde d peopl e who fail to think clearly, who seek to place the blame upon the shoul ders of all except themselves, who theorise and speculate, advi se, and assign respons ibility, but who refrain from any active participation in the processes of a djustment, from reasons of pride or unw illingne ss to pay the price. Many of them are group cons cientious obj ectors who will eventually profit by the victory of the Forces of Light but who refuse to share in the struggl e, reserving themselves for the future peace settlements, longi ng for the conf lict to end, but doi ng not hing to bring that about . Many are entirely sincere, but their thinki ng needs adjusting. If you will right ly grasp the reality of the statements made above , you will do your share in the me ntal clarification which is going on in the world. These three groups are func tioni ng toda y and are in conf lict. The neutrally - minde d group is definitely hinde ring the work of the Forces of Light . These three world attitude s are to be found in every nation , as well as in the cons cious ness of every singl e indi vidua l. The realisation of this may enable you to grasp and shoul der you r indi vidua l respons ibility better. You will realise the need to ascertain for yourself where you stand and will refuse to be cond itione d by other peopl e's poi nts of view and the world - wide propa ganda ; you will appr eciate where your nation stands and on which side, and where you, as a soul , stand. You will then be able — if you are sincere and clear - thinki ng — to work for that group with in the whol e which seems to you to embody the highe st pos sible activity and aims, and you will relinqui sh that attitude of futile negativity, smug neutrality or bewildered confusion which may distingui sh you. You will then emerge from the glamou r of propa ganda and of world illusion into the clear light of you r ow n soul , whos e essential nature is love and selflessness and whos e major aspiration is to bring peace and goodw ill among men and to see the cons um mation of the mission of Christ. This wil l lead eventually to the disappe arance of so - called neutrality upon earth — a neutrality in act, for there is never neutrality in thought . One of the things which the spiritual leaders of humanity have sought to do is to bring clearly to the attention of me n the basic dua lity which is found in the world toda y — the dua lity of selfish, material living and that of uns elfish spiritual obj ectives. This is now clearly defined. The second stage of their task now lies ahead, and that is so to stimulate the vision of men everyw here that — beginni ng with the intelligentsia — they can cons cious ly take their stand unde r one or other of the two banne rs, and so know what they are doi ng and why. The neutrally - minde d waver between the two and, to date, do not hing. I woul d like i n this conne ction to deal with one problem which has som ewhat disturbed the least clear - thinki ng among thos e whom I have for som e time taught . I have for years sought to develop in the world a group of men and wom en who woul d stand for the spiritual values , who woul d love all men, who woul d foster the spirit of goodw ill, and who woul d stand to hum anity (as far as they coul d) as the"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Hierarchy of Light , as Christ and His disciples seek to do. This has been interpreted by som e of you as meaning that you must r efrain from rebelling against the evil thing in you r midst, and from all criticism and partisanship. You seem una ble to love with steadfastness the offende r and yet to rid the world of the offence. The situation might clarify if you answered to your self on e or two que stions : Do you believe that the Hierarchy of Light , unde r the leadership of Christ, is on the side of cruelty, aggr ession and the slaught er of the defenceless? Do you believe that the world can be saved by a refusal to think and by the shirking of individua l respons ibility, thus ignor ing a situation which doe s exist? Do you feel that there are no issues and principles which are worth fight ing for and dyi ng for, if need be? Do you stand with the Forces of Light or with the Forces o f Materialism? What are you doi ng to aid the side which claims your allegiance, loya lty and idealism? Are you gove rned by a sense of indi vidua l futility — that weapon which the Forces of Materialism are using now so pot ently to stun pos sible oppone nts into helplessness? A clear and searching analysis of the spiritual objectives of hum anity will enable you to answer these que stions . If you do not need to answer them because your pos ition is clear in you r mind, the study of the que stions may enable you to se rve your day and generation more ably and to present the situation more clearly to the bewildered. A hor ror of war and a longi ng for peace are no excuse for slack thinki ng, nor do they provi de an alibi or the oppo rtuni ty to shirk indi vidua l or nationa l re spons ibility. The conflict is on. It is of ancient lineage. The issues are clearly marked between right and wrong , between cruelty and kindne ss, between aggr ession and freedom . To evade respons ibility because of past nationa l mistakes and historical sins a nd failures is an unw arranted alibi; the shirking of due participation in the struggl e because every nation has certain materialistic obj ectives is wrong; a nation is but the sum total of its peopl e. To refuse to think because of the general condi tion of f atigue in which you share is no excuse, and is unw orthy of the world disciples and aspirants. The Hierarchy of Light is seeking to arous e men everyw here to the basic dua lism unde rlying this conf lict and to the essential signi ficance of the issues with whi ch hum anity is faced. Hence the empha sis which I am laying upon the need to face the probl em, to think clearly and intelligently abou t what is goi ng on around you , and to take right and coope rative action. The whol e world probl em will be clarified and the end of the conf lict more rapidly reached when there are onl y two parties and not three. The recogni tion of this unde rlying dua lism is necessary prior to the shifting of hum anity's cons cious ness away from its major preoccupa tion — acqui sitive mater ial desire, aggr essively obt ained — into soul cons cious ness, with its correlations , group interests, the meeting of group need, and the func tioni ng of a steady group coope ration on a world scale. This is true of indi vidua ls, of nations and of races; as you, an individua l, work out your ow n probl em in you r daily life, you are helping to solve the world probl em. This is the situation as the Hierarchy sees it toda y and with which it challenge s all men and wom en of"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST goodw ill. They ask you to share in the conf lict in som e way, and remind you of the occult signi ficance of thos e oft misunde rstood words of Christ, \"He that is not with me, is against me.\" In closing these remarks upon clear thinki ng I would add two more. There is som e conf usion arising out of the basi c idealism which unde rlies the activities of many peopl e in many count ries. It is the impor tance of the som ewhat new ideal of the good of the state as a whol e versus the good of the indi vidua l and the good of hum anity. The state becom es almost a divine ent ity in the cons cious ness of the idealist. This is necessarily part of the evol utionary plan, but in so far as it cons titutes a probl em, is too big for the indi vidua l to solve alone and una ided. Of one funda mental truth I can, how ever, assure you. When men everyw here — within the bounda ries of their particular state and whilst uphol ding its author ity and its civilisation — begin to think in terms of manki nd, then pub lic opi nion will becom e so pot ent and so right in its inclusiveness that state pol icies must inev itably conf orm to the larger ideal, and the sacrifice of the indi vidua l and of hum anity in large num bers to the indi vidua l state will no longe r be pos sible. The part will be seen in its proper relation to the larger whol e. It is this arous ing of publ ic opi nion to world right s, to inclusive hum an interests and to internationa l coope ration that is the true goa l of all present spiritual ende avour . Eventually it will be realised that the respons ibility for what gove rnm ents do rests squa rely upon the shoul ders of the indi vidua l citizens who put gove rnm ents in their pos ition of pow er. This is a respons ibility from which no citizens of any nation are or shoul d be exempt, and to this all nationa l thinki ng of the right kind is fortuna tely awakening. The s econd poi nt I woul d briefly add is that, with the precipitation of the present world situation, the citizens of all nations are invol ved in a condi tion from which there is no escape except through right action and wide vision on their part; to this world s ituation they must conform their lives tempor arily, patterning their activities upon the needs of their own particular nation. For thos e who are swept into the world conf lict unde r one or other of the clearly defined banne rs, their immediate action is clea r — participation in the nationa l emergency. This is, however, whol ly com patible with a subj ective process of right and clear thinki ng, which must run parallel to the demande d out er activity and which will lay a founda tion for the increasingl y right action a s time elapses. This will invol ve right action on the part of thos e who are fight ing unde r the Forces of Light , and will lead to an eventual right and just peace; it will invol ve also right action upon the part of thos e who have been swept into a bewildere d activity unde r the Forces of Materialism, leading finally to a revol t against that which is wrong and evil — for the hearts of all men and the springs of the divine life are not to be permanently directed into wrong channe ls of activity. The respons ibility for the immediate world move s and the present gigantic nationa l enterprises is now out of the hands and the cont rol of the indi vidua l; the respons ibility for the future, nevertheless, still lies in his hands . This shoul dering of right respons ibility must be preceded, how ever, by an interlude of clear thinki ng plus right action as a citizen. The probl em of thos e living in neutral count ries is different, and along what lines it shoul d be solved I have earlier indi cated. As for the world disciple s and aspirants (among whom you range your selves), the entire probl em can be seen along still wider and more com prehensive lines. You are forced by circum stance and karma, and by the free decision of your soul s, to work und er one or other of the two banne r s or in som e one of the neutral and negative count ries. Your problem in all three cases is to see clearly the spiritual focus of this world crisis, to swing the weight of any influence you may have — obj ective or subj ective, spiritual, emotiona l or mental — on to the side of the Forces of Light. As you do so, you must preserve an unde rstandi ng attitude of steadfast love (not sentiment or emotiona l reaction) to men and wom en everyw here, without any exception or reservations in your cons cious ness. That action has to be taken,"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST at times, which hurts or damages the form side of life or the phys ical forms, is entirely com patible with the cons tant preservation of soul love — a thing which it is hard for the disciple to learn and master, but which is nevertheless a gove rn ing principle in evol ution. This world crisis and the present world war will, it is hope d, awaken men to the realisation that the form side of manifestation, with its aggr essive selfishne ss, its cruel empha ses and its separative tende ncies, carries inevita bly with it the seeds of its ow n eventual elimination and the una voi dable results of pain, suffering, war, disease and death. This situation is therefore of man's ow n making and the result of his material nature and lack of soul cont rol. But — the soul is et ernal; its nature is inclusive love ; and the whol e aim of the present crisis is to shift the focus of human awareness out of the form and the material aspect of living, into the cons cious ness of the soul , and to do this at any cost to the hinde ring forms. It is against this transference of empha sis that the Forces of Materialism are toda y fight ing. For this reason, hum anity is swept into a vor tex of conf lict, and the issue depends upon the clear thinki ng, wise speech and selfless intent of the world discip les, working in collabor ation with all the forces for good in the world toda y, doi ng their duty as citizens of their ow n count ry but cultivating ceaselessly and unr elentingl y a world - cons cious ness. Let me now enlarge som ewhat upon the pos sibili ty of divine intervention. Hove ring toda y within the aura of our planet are certain great spiritual Forces and Entities, awaiting the oppor tuni ty to participate actively in the work of world redemption, readjustment and recons truction. Their Presence is s ensed at times by the spiritually - minde d peopl e of the world, and Their reality is recogni sed by the mystics and occultists working in every land. Men and wom en express this recogni tion according to the trend of their religious and psychol ogi cal training a nd their particular mental or emotiona l bias. The adve nt of Christ, or His \"second com ing, \" is anxi ous ly anticipated by many orthodox Christians, who regard this world war as indi cating the end of the world and as preparatory to the appe arance of the Chris t, to bring peace on earth. Others, more orientally minde d, await the appe arance of an Avatar Who will transmit from God the needed world message or new type of energy. Prophe cy and astrology indicate a Com ing One and their many differing opi nions seem to conve rge on Him; occultists invoke everyw here the Forces of Light and call for the appe arance of that extra - planetary Potency to Whom they give the title, \"Spirit of Peace.\" Thos e with no religious or metaphys ical bias recogni se, how ever, that all times of emergency seem ever to evoke som e Liberator or som e man or group of men who are capable of changi ng world affairs and inaugur ating — unde r the stress and strain of the times — the new and needed fresh cycle of civilisation and culture. Many refrain from speci fication of the requi rements of such a Com ing One toda y, because of the magni tude and planetary nature of His task, but they secretly hope and pray for His appe aring. Still others regard such an idea and hope as simply a psychol ogi cal fulfilment and the em bodi ment of the wish - life of the peopl e — this time of hum anity as a whol e, for the first time in racial history. Such peopl e are apt to feel that this embodi ment has no true subs tance or place in the life of manki nd, but wish that it had. They forget that w hen a thought form has been cons tructed of sufficient pot ency and has been bui lt ove r a long period of time by the peopl e of the world, a further and final stage becom es ever pos sible. The form can be rende red so magne tic that it can attract an E nergy which will inform it and give it active pot ency; it can then becom e a vital link between the subj ective world of energy and the obj ective world of forces and a thing of pow er, of impelling and guiding activity, and therefore the expr ession of a Life. This thought form, dul y informed, becom es a mediating factor, cons tructed by hum anity but animated by the will - to - good of som e great and spiritual Entity. That thought forms, embodyi ng evil lives can be and are cons tructed is equa lly true, but with these we are not at this time dealing. "},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST We com e now to the signi ficant poi nt of what I have to say toda y in this conne ction. A great and vital thought form is in process of cons truction upon our planet and within our planetary aura. It is being bui lt by the pow er of sound, by the magne tic pul l of invoc ation leading to eventual evoc ation, and by the force of desire - subs tance, animated by the pow er of thought . It is being cons tructed by the uni ted efforts of the Hierarchy, of the world disciples and aspirants, of the men and wom en of goodw ill in all nations , and also through the inchoa te longi ngs of men everyw here, of all religious beliefs, pol itical views and group loya lties. It is safely anchor ed upon the phys ical plane, is of vast propor tions upon the astral or emo tiona l plane, but lacks vitality and pow er upon the mental plane. It is here, within the realm of thought subs tance, that the weakne ss of the structure of this thought form becom es appa rent. It is already pot ent spiritually, owing to the scientific work of the occult Hierarchy and Their trained helpers. This spiritual life relates the thought form to the waiting extra - planetary Forces and can make Their work pos sible and effective. It is pot ent phys ically and emotiona lly through the work of the love rs of hum a nity, the well - meaning efforts of the emotiona lly oriented peopl e and the agoni sed longi ngs of the masses, who hate war, desire qui et, and demand peace and good living condi tions . There is, how ever, a gap or hiatus upon the mental plane, for th e minds of men are not func tioni ng correctly. The disciples and world aspirants are not thinki ng with clarity, nor are they working in uni ty. They are evading issues or are thinki ng separatively or nationa lly or fanatically; they are not convi nced of the p otency of invoc ation or of prayer; they are failing to realise that it is pos sible to work ardently for thos e condi tions which will lead to peace, and yet fight simultaneous ly so that thos e condi tions may be available; they fail to love all men without exc eption in their longi ng to see their ow n loya lties emerge trium pha nt; they work doubt ingl y, hopi ng for the best but believing in the worst; they use the method of prayer and of invoc ation because such methods seem to have been successful in the past, and b ecause they are told that \"faith can move mount ains,\" but they feel inw ardly qui te hope less and uni nspired and are not at all sure what faith intrinsically is; they realise that a uni ted front and a spirit of joyous certainty are psychol ogi cal assets of we ll - nigh invi ncible pot ency, but they feel una ble to arouse within themselves the slight est enthus iasm. It is this negative and luke warm attitude , this mental unc ertainty and this failure to link up the spiritual and the phys ical worlds in a pos itive relat ions hip which is hol ding back the Forces of Light and the actual presence of the Spirit of Peace, and thus negativing a pos sible divine intervention. It is the test of group work. The faith of many indi vidua ls is real and deep, but they stand alone ; the kn ow ledge that the few have of the nature of the waiting Forces of intervention is being negated by the faithlessness of the world disciples and aspirants, weighe d dow n by world karma, by their ow n phys ical fatigue and by their hor ror of the present situatio n, plus the difficulties of indi vidua l circum stance. The probl em can be most simply stated. Either the spiritual Hierarchy exists, with all its pot encies of love , wisdom and skill in action, or for ages hum anity has suffered from hallucinations ; either Christ and His group of Masters, initiates and disciples are facts in the natural processes of evol ution, historically prove n and know n through Their spiritual activity dow n the ages, or men have been victims dur ing thos e ages of a gigantic fraud — emanating from what and where? Either the cons istency of the evol ving presentation of the spiritual effort of the Hierarchy is a witness to a great reality or manki nd has develope d a mentality which is an instrum ent for the fabrication of non - existent fact s, and this is in itself so paradoxi cal as to give the lie to the inference. Either the spiritual worlds and the three worlds of hum an ende avour can be related, or there is not hing to past beliefs, to ancient stories of manifesting divinity and to the cons tantly recurring periods of divine intervention."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST I woul d here face you with these alternatives and woul d ask you to cons ider your ow n pos ition in these matters. Does the story of Easter and of the living Christ carry no truth, and is it not pos sible for t hat Risen Christ to expr ess His pow er on Earth throug h His chos en instrum ents? Is there no founda tion for the myth of the annua l return of the Buddha , hol ding the door ope n between Shamballa and the Hierarchy so that, at need, intervention may be pos sible through that ope n door ? Is it onl y a silly dream and a fantasy that at the time of the June Full Moon, Christ — in the closest coope ration with the Buddha — links the Hierarchy with Hum anity? Is it qui te impos sible that when hum anity awakens to the fact of thi s mediatorship and can then avail itself of the straight line of ascent and descent through the door s held ope n by the Buddha and the Christ, som e stupe ndous appe aring may be imminent and sudde nly take place? May it not be pos sible that through the ascent of man's aspiration and spiritual desire, and through the descent of the waiting Potencies, certain great change s may take place, for which all the past has been onl y preparatory and through which the Aqua rian Age of brotherhood and unde rstandi ng may make itself felt by virtue of these great Potencies? The two Full Moons of May and June present to you a new oppor tuni ty to participate in the release of the planetary Life from the thraldom of the Forces of Materialism. If you are to do your share in this work of salvage, it will necessitate certain attitude s and activities on you r part which I woul d like briefly to touc h upon , leaving you to take right and appr opr iate action and to follow , with all other disciples and aspirants, the indi cated stage s: 1. Study with care and answer with sincerity and to your ow n com plete satisfaction the que stions I put to you earlier in this com muni cation. When you have done this, you will know where you persona lly stand. 2. For the entire week prior to the May Ful l Moon and the June Full Moon ende avour to do the follow ing things : a. Link up with all disciples, aspirants and men and wom en of goodw ill throughout the world and in all nations , using the creative imagination. b. Eliminate out of your cons cious ness all negativity, seeing your self clearly as range d on the side of the Forces of Light ; you are, therefore, not neutral in thought . See to it also that when taking right action in the conflict against the forces of materialism you preserve ever a spirit of love for all indi vidua ls who have been swept into the vor tex of their potency. c. When meditating and invoki ng the Forces of Light, ende avour to forget entirely all your ow n persona l difficulties, tragedies and probl ems. Disciples have to learn to carry forwa rd their work for hum anity in spite of persona lity stresses, strains and limitations . d. Prepare your selves thus for the work of the two Full Moons , keeping you r obj ective clearly in mind and subm itting your selves to an adequa te tempor ary discipline. 3. For the two days prior to the Full Moon, on the day of the Full Moon itself, and for the two succeeding days (five days) ende avour at sunr ise, at noon, at five o'c lock P.M., and at suns et, plus the exact time of the Full Moon in your ow n land, t o say the Great Invoc ation with the intent to invoke , precipitate and anchor in out er manifestation the waiting Potencies. Do this aloud when pos sible, and in group formation whenever feasible. It is the focussed pow er of your une motiona l thought which wil l"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST bridge the present existing gap and link more closely the two worlds of spiritual activity and of hum an demons tration. 4. Repeat this activity for three days each and every mont h — the day prior to the Full Moon, the day of the Full Moon, and the succeedi ng day. As a preliminary exercise to these three days, you coul d take an earlier three days of preparation, and thus increase the effectiveness of your effort. Many peopl e the world ove r have for years been trained to recogni se two things . First, the impo rtance of the Wesak Festival at the time of the Full Moon of May, because it not onl y objectively links the major Eastern religion with the major Western faith, but because it esoterically provi des the key to the ope n door between Shamballa and the Hierarc hy, between the pur pos e of God (still uni dentified by man, ow ing to his relatively low stage of evol ution which makes it beyond hum an com prehension at present) and the method of God, which is love ; it provi des also the link between the Buddha , tempor arily embodyi ng will - wisdom , and the Christ, embodyi ng love - wisdom , and also between hum anity, focussed in cons cious ness through the Christ, and the Hierarchy, focussed in cons cious ness through the Buddha . Owing to the stress of hum anity toda y and the urgency of the respons e which that distress evoke s in the Hierarchy, the synt hesis of these two reactions to the world crisis can prove adequa te to bring in that out side assistance which coul d end the conf lict along right lines and bring not onl y relief, but illum in ation to the hum an cons ciousness. But again — speaking here to a representative body of aspirants and disciples — I woul d state that the focus and the empha sis is not yet adequa te to gua rantee this extra - planetary respons e. Nevertheless, it coul d be if, in yo ur ow n life of meditation and of discipline, in you r speech with others and in the general tone of your intercour se with your envi ronm ent, you can eliminate the negative and more selfish reactions and (for the sake of hum an welfare) tempor arily, at least, live at your highe st poi nt of aspiration. Secondl y, you have been trained in the belief that all the information which I have given out anent the relation of the Buddha and the Christ, and of the Hierarchy, Hum anity and Shamballa, will form par t of the com ing new world religion and that the theme of the Great Appr oaches will cons titute the basic funda mentals of the future spiritual teaching. This too you must have in mind, for the work you are asked to do at the com ing two Full Moons , and dur ing the less impor tant full moons of the year, is not onl y related to the present emergency, but is also cons tructively related to the future faith of hum anity. Bear this also in mind. You will not e that what I have said conc erns you r mental attitude s and yo ur emotiona l reactions to present world affairs. It conc erns also your soul tension, your willingne ss to unde rgo soul tension, and your capacity to stand as part of the great chain of intermediaries who are toda y being called to the service of the race in an hou r of urgency. It conc erns the organising of your self as an integrated persona lity in relation to you r soul and to humanity; it invo lves the recogni tion of the work which you can do from the poi nt of integration. I woul d ask you to ponde r with care up on this paragraph, stating the pos sibilities of your task. I call you to a period of clear thinki ng. I seek not to moul d you r pol itical appr oach to life, but I do seek to aid you to see hum anity and its welfare — not only in terms of your ow n nation or you r ow n political group — but in terms of the whol e, and as we, the teachers on the inne r side, are forced to see it. I seek to see you free your selves from the condi tion where you are swayed by propa ganda of a pol itical, nationa l or religious kind, and decidin g for your self where you , as a soul , must stand in this world crisis"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST and on which side you will place the empha sis of any influence you may wield; I woul d have you not e where your highe st ideals will lead you and whether the springs of your life 's decisions and attitude s are truly pur e and una dul terated. I seek to draw your attention away from the many minor issues, the many clamour ing voi ces, and from the widespread conc entration upon the unw orthy pasts and the unde sirable aspects of all nation s (without exception) , and help you to see with clarity the major dua lism which unde rlies the present world conf lict — might against right , materialism against the highe r values, freedom against imprisonm ent, cruelty against fair dealing, liberty and safety against fear and aggression. Then, having balanced these pairs of oppos ites within you r cons cious ness, decide where your loya lty, your interest and your ability to serve will be placed, and then go forward to further the ends of one or other of the two gro ups , at no matter what cost, but know ing where you stand and why you stand there. That the will of Shamballa may be enabled to expr ess itself through love and through the meditation of the Hierarchy, working through all disciples, aspirants and men and wo men of goodw ill, is the earnest prayer of your fellow disciple and co - worker. THE WO RLD CRISIS TODAY June 30, 1940 Events and situations change with such rapidity at this time, as hum anity takes action or refrains from action (which latter cour se is ju st as determining for good or evil as is the former), that I feel again the need of writing on the world crisis, as I did last autum n, thus carrying forward my theme. I write as one who is working on the inne r side toda y, sensing and seeing what is hidde n from many of you. The exot eric out er history of events is know n to all of you, and with its detail I need not deal. The action taken by the com batant nations , or withhe ld by the neutral nations , is also registered in your cons cious ness. The implications of such activity can onl y be truly know n and appr eciated by thos e peopl e who toda y think in terms of hum ani ty as a whol e , and not in terms of a particular nation, such as the good of Germany or the destiny of America. Few disciples there are at th is time who can thus think synt hetically or who see the vision as a whol e, precipitating as that which will condi tion eventually the entire hum an family. Many there are who are awakening to the need so to do and who are finding, in their processes of readj ustment, many bewildering probl ems. For these sincere but bewildered peopl e, I write. I find that there is little that I can say to the provi ncially minde d or to thos e with the pur ely parochial poi nt of view. Their limitations of vision lie within themselv es and onl y dire events and strenuous emergency will enable them finally to transcend the petty qui bbl ing and qua lity of their low er mind, with its conc rete tende ncy to hark back to the past and its fear to venture with faith into the future. I have been interested in the respons e to my earlier article, written in April, 1940. The majority of those whom I sought to reach and with whom I have communi cated for many years accepted my premises without much que stioni ng but refrained from pos itive action or the use of any influence. A few resented the implications of the existent divisions between the Forces of Light (focussed through the allied nations ) and the Forces of Aggr ession (focussed through Germany) . They embody a true, but errone ous ly interpreted, idea of hum an uni ty. They fail to unde rstand that — as the New Age is ushered in — there must inevitably com e a judgm ent day (speaking sym bol ically) and the emergence of a clear"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST line of demarcation between that which is new and that which is of the old age; there must appe ar the distinction between exot eric happe nings and esoteric attitude s and between thos e who see a new world order, develope d and brought to func tioni ng activity by the Forces of Light , through coope ration, coor dination and unde rstandi ng, and a wor ld order which will be impos ed by terror, through dictatorial gove rnm ent, by the suppr ession of liberty of cons cience, and by the enthrone ment of a race whos e values are, at this time, anti - spiritual and anti - social. This judgm ent day is now upon hum anity, and the final decision will be arrived at by thos e whos e nor mal inclinations and natural tende ncies are on the side of law and order, and whos e will - to - good is directed tow ards right hum an relations and true hum an welfare. These enlight ened peo ple will back their judgm ent with a focussed will to bring in the era wherein these values will dom inate, and they are also willing to take the necessary measures to make these values pos sible. I woul d like to deal ope nly and frankl y with the probl ems wit h which you are being confront ed when you face the world as it is toda y and the world as it may be tom orrow — a world whos e fate is still uns ettled. I woul d present pos sibilities with a definite appl ication to the reactions of such empires as thos e of Great Britain, France and Holland, and with indi cation as to how the United States of America shoul d be expe cted to respond. I write as one who represents the Hierarchy, as a member of a certain standi ng in its ranks , and as one also who works day and night for the success of thos e nations in the hum an family who, with their backs to a wall of misunde rstandi ng, vilification and dislike, are strenuous ly oppos ing Germany and her satellite, Italy. I refer to that group of Allies who toda y stand with their pur pos e fo cussed in Great Britain, driven there by the trend of events. I do this because the basic hope of right hum an relations , of true and lasting peace, of liberty of cons cience and of free and happy hom es rests upon their trium phi ng; they are, at this time, th e poi nt of pos itive attack by the Forces of Evil. It is not pos sible for us as yet to reach the soul of the German peopl e within that unha ppy land, so com plete is the glamour unde r which they are labou ring. The day will com e when again they will be reached , and this respons ibility rests upon thos e Germans who remain free from glamour in other lands ; it will com e when the forces acting through the medium of a band of evil - intentione d men have been remove d. With their disappe arance will com e the dissipation o f the cloud s of evil propa ganda , lying information and distorted imput ations and interpretations with which the masses of peopl e, even in neutral lands , have been deluge d. Woul d you have me at this time of planetary crisis refrain from direct s peech, have me withhol d from you who read my words the truth — a truth which is already appa rent to thos e who ponde r the signs of the times with an unpr ejudi ced mind, unbi ased thought and a true love of hum anity? This last qua lity, a true love of hum ani ty , c ons titutes a basic test of wrong or right action. It is phe nom enally clarifying if appl ied at this time to the com batants. Woul d you have me deal with pleasant platitude s anent a future happy world, when perhaps the very pos sibility of such a world tremble s in the balance? Woul d you have me present the attitude of the Hierarchy as that of a placid band of onl ooke rs, ready to help the world when the conf lict is ove r, but at present insulated from all action and simply waiting till the dus t and clamour of bat tle settle, to stimulate in men's minds the vision of a new world order wherein everyone will have a good time, where there will be no une mploym ent, wherein fear and terror will find no place and everyone will be happy , well fed and reasona bly intelligent? Woul d you have me picture to you the great band of disciples, initiates and aspirants as a band of pacifists, cherishing the form side of life, afraid of death and remaining passive in the face of the death struggl e of hum an liberty, of life, cons cience a nd mind? I tell you that this I cannot do. The Hierarchy is very different from this. Pacifism, as interpreted by you, has no place in its ranks . The destruction of form in battle (which causes so much fear to many of"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST you) is of small importance to thos e who know that reincarnation is a basic law of nature and that there is no death . The forces of death are abroad toda y, but it is the death of liberty, the death of free speech, the death of freedom in hum an action, the death of truth and of the highe r spir itual values. These are the vital factors in the life of hum anity; the death of the phys ical form is a negligible factor in relation to these, and one easily right ed again through the processes of rebirth and fresh oppor tuni ty. I woul d say to thos e who pr each a passive attitude in the face of evil and hum an suffering and who endor se a pacifism which invol ves no risks: With what do you propos e to fight the forces of aggr ession, of treachery, evil and destruction which are toda y stalking ove r our planet? What weapons do you bring to this com bat? How will you begin to stem the onslaught and arrest the whirlwind? Will you use prayers for peace, and then patiently wait for the forces of good to fight your battle and for God to do the work? I tell you that your prayers and you r wishes are una vailing when divorced from right and pot ent action. Your prayers and petitions may reach the throne of God, sym bol ically speaking, but then the reply com es forth: The Forces of Light will strengt hen your arms and tu rn the tide in you r favour if you stand up and fight for that which you desire. Who will arrest the progress of aggr essive selfishne ss if the men and wom en of goodw ill rest back upo n their idealism and do naught that is practical to justify their hope or a id in the materialisation of the desired ideal. There are thos e in the world toda y who (despite past nationa l selfishne ss and wrong) are fearlessly and with true insight fight ing hum anity's battle, and with them the Hierarchy stands , as it has ever stood on the side of liberty, right unde rstandi ng and correct attitude s in hum an affairs. I woul d say to thos e who cry, \"Peace, peace when there is no peace\": Are you goi ng to profit by their death and sacrifice when the ultimate trium ph of the Forces of Light c om es to pass? Are you goi ng to take the pos ition that you can then live in a safe world because others gave their lives that you might do so? Are you goi ng to issue forth from the safe security of your pacifist alibi and gratefully acknow ledge what they ha ve don e and grasp your share of the gains which they have pur chased at such a cost? I woul d warn you not to be glamour ed by the false premise that you must stand by your hard - earned convi ctions , even at the expe nse of other peopl es' lives and the dow nfall of nations , forgetting that fear and false pride will make this argum ent of importance to you . Are the peace - minde d peopl e of the world goi ng to reap the benefits of a peace for which they have paid no price? It is the peopl e who value peace above all else who are toda y seeking by every pos sible method to stop Germany. Let me tell you som ething about the peace for which the Hierarchy works and which the spiritually minde d peopl e of the world envi sage even whilst they fight , and for which they ar e ready to pay the ultimate price. Peace, when it com es, will be the result of right world condi tions and right hum an relations hips. It is an effect and not a cause; it is the effect of certain subj ective attitude s which are not yet present in the world on a sufficiently wide scale. Against these emerging condi tions Germany has assembled her pot ent war machine, after years of scientific and planne d preparation. Toda y the Allies stand waiting the oppor tunity for the final struggl e with that pot ent nation, pr epared to institute afterwards thos e condi tions which will gua rantee peace. There is no peace on the planet anyw here toda y. There is no peace in the que stioni ng hearts of thos e who are not actively sharing in the struggl e against evil. There is no peace in any field of hum an ende avour . It is not to be found in the econom ic field, torn as it is by the conf lict between labour and capital, and between great school s of econom ic thought ; it is not to be found in the religious field, where the struggl e is going o n between author ity (tainted with old world chur chianity) and expe rimental religion; it is not to be found in the social order, where class is range d against class, poor against rich, and man against his brother; it is certainly not in the pol itical field, where party strife cont rols and blinds the warring groups , hiding the wider vision of world affairs and the needs of hum anity as a whol e. There is no peace, and peace will not com e through"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST an appl ied and fanatical pacifism or through the loud talking and wishful thinki ng of thos e who hate war and who at the same time swell the tide of conque st and delay true victory by their violently uttered oppos ing views. I tell you that all nations hate and oppos e war; even Germany, behind the impos ed terror, shrinks in hor ror at what is being done . The same love of peace which inspires the ordinary pacifist inspires those who are toda y fight ing in order that peace may be the result of their sacrifice and the effect of the establishing of thos e right condi ti ons which Germany is set to prevent. Yet many neutrally minde d and pacifist peopl e are unw illing to pay any price for what they profess so much to cherish. A com plete refusal to fight on the part of the Allies and of thos e who are seeing with clarity the i ssues at stake woul d ope n the doo r to the world dom ination of the Forces of Materialism and Aggr ession. It is upon this that these evil forces count when they face the greatest neutral of all, the United States of America, and for which they are preparing as they disseminate their lying propa ganda and plant their agents in every count ry and every state — preparatory to a peaceful conque st of a peopl e who refuse sufficiently to value the spiritual issues at stake to take pos itive action. And we, the teachers on the inne r side, who for aeons have aided in the preparation of hum anity for the com ing age of peaceful coope ration and brotherhood, see all this future hope imperilled. Aggression and the rape of peaceful nations go steadily forward, as nation after nat ion crum bles unde r the iron heel of Germany, grindi ng the peopl es of the world and sweeping them into slavery on a scale of serfdom and cruelty that the world has never before seen. As thos e who sought to arrest German progr ess succum b to treachery and pai n and desert their comrades, the machine of evil marches on; neutral nations , resting back upon their peaceful intent and the claims of civilisation, are absorbed by the forces which impos e the German demand for living space, and are thus denude d of libert y, of territory, and of all econom ic resour ces. And, at the same time, the greatest and most pow erful neutral nation in the world arms for defence of its territorial right s, but refuses to arm for the defence of hum an liberty . Do I speak too strongl y to t hos e of you who are not participating in this planetary war? I speak with clarity because I seek to arous e you to the true issues whilst there is yet time. I seek to arrest in you the idea that the western hemisphe re is the seat of all civilisation, the cu stodi an of the best that there is in hum anity, and that the spiritual future of hum anity lies in the cherished land of liberty. Liberty is a thing of the hum an soul and is found throughou t the entire hum an race. Civilisation is a uni versal hum an right and not the preroga tive of one nation. I tell you that hum anity is everyw here spiritually minde d and that the new race, the com ing civilisation, and the new age culture will be found throughout the world — the uni versal inhe ritance of the hum an race. But everyw here hum anity is the victim of propa ganda — a propa ganda which can only be seen in its true light when men think in terms of hum an liberty; when they toge ther take the needed steps to ensure hum an happi ness, and learn in so doi ng to face world cond itions as they are , not hiding their heads in a dream world of their ow n making. The world of the future, of which men in all lands dream, is more than a pos sibility if men will shoul der their just respons ibilities and toge ther make it a fact in hum an expe rience. But such a world will not be pos sible for many long years if Europe goe s dow n in the crash of battle and unde r the impact of the German war machine. It will emerge into realisation when there are enough peopl e in the world who think clearly, see th e vision truly, act intelligently, and meet force with force, which is the onl y method which the forces of aggr ession can understand. Toda y the forces of evil have swept ove r France, Belgium , Holland, Norway, Poland, Finland and Roum ania. Nothing has arr ested their progr ess — neither truth nor armed might nor sacrifice.

Behind stand their great empires with their resour ces as yet unt ouc hed. Behind them again stand the spiritually minde d peopl es in every nation, and behind them all stands the Hierarchy of Light . In this interlude prior to the final struggl e I write to thos e who are looki ng on with sym pathy but without sacrifice and I ask you: Where do you stand? I bring to you som e of the cont ra sts in this war, in all simplicity and in an effort to enable you to choos e right action. The first great cont rast might be called the way of appe asement and the way of aggr ession. The method of peaceful discussion was tried by the peace - lovi ng peopl es of France and Great Britain, and the way of aggr ession, develope d for many years, is the way of Germany, of Russia, and in a lesser degree of Italy. I woul d remind you that it is to the eternal credit of the Allies (e'en though it lacked worldly com mon sense ) that their preparations for war proved inadequa te in the face of German preparedne ss. They were not one - poi nted in their war effort, for the highe r value of world civilisation engrossed them and the activities of their empires, which live at peace within themselves. They have made many grievous errors in the past (as have all peopl es), but the way of expi ation and of sacrifice is theirs, willingl y accepted, and their reward is the freedom of hum anity. I will give you anot her cont rast, grow ing out of the above . This is the empha sis upon a new world order within a rapidly changi ng world. The Allies uphol d one poi nt of view; the Germans, anot her. It is for this new and better world and the bringi ng in of the condi tions wherein peace can be pos sible and the n ew world order develope d that toda y the men of vision fight and die. The cont rast is the enforced world order, empha sised by the so - called \"German supe r - race,\" which will centralise the world aroun d Germany, for the aggr andi sement of Germany, for the expa n sion of the German living space and the suppl y of Germany's econom ic need — an order enforced by terror, by cruelty and death, igno ring the needs of hum anity as a whol e and the right s of all other nations , and sacrificing the whol e world, if need be, to the glory of Germany. With this German - enforced rule and order, her greed for territorial expa nsion and her ruthless acqui sition of the goods and pos session of other nations , I woul d ask you to cont rast the expr essed aim of the Allies, reiterated ag ain and again in the speeches of the statesmen of bot h France and Great Britain and sum med up in the words of a great Engl ishm an, a gove rnm ent official and an aspirant to right and truth: \"We shall use all our influence when the time com es in the bui lding of a new world in which the nations will not permit insane armed rivalry to deny their hope s of fuller life and future conf idence nor be forever ove rbor ne by grim forebodi ng of disaster. The new world that we seek will enlist the coope ration of all peopl e s on a basis of hum an equa lity, self - respect and mutual tolerance. We shall have to think out many things that lie on the rout e of internationa l cont acts — social, pol itical and econom ic — and find means of reconc iling the necessity of change in a cons tantly c hangi ng world with security against the disturbance of the general peace through resort to violence. To this order that we shall create, all nat ions hav e their cont ribut ion to make , and a great respons ibility bot h in though t and action will rest upon our p eopl e. We, not less than others, have our lesson to learn from past failures and disappoi ntments.\" I woul d have you not e the recogni tion, by this spokesman for the Allies, of the need of change , the realisation of the com ing world order and the hum ble sta tement anent past mistakes. I woul d call your attention very briefly also to the cont rast in the methods employe d: cruelty versus"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST kindne ss, merciless bom bing and machine gunni ng on the one side, and the cons tant refraining from attack upon the enemy by th e Allies, for fear of killing the defenceless; I woul d call your attention to the broadcast from Great Britain, warning the Germans to take cove r when they hear the British planes ove r Germany. I woul d call you r attention to the reticent but truthful propa ganda which lays no empha sis upon that which coul d stir up hate, and the lying information from Berlin and conque red cities. It is not my pur pos e to do more than indi cate these cont rasts which grow out of a widely differing subj ective attitude t o hum anity. It is, how ever, of value for us all to face them in the process of clarifying issues. The basic cont rast between freedom of speech, thought and action which distingui shes the democracies, and the cruel suppr ession of all liberty of thought and persona l activity which cont rols the masses in Germany toda y, is too well know n to requi re empha sising by me. But I bring these cont rasts to you r attention, asking you to recogni se your respons ibility to stand behind those who fight for liberty and to end the activity of thos e who are the enemies of all hum an freedom . I woul d ask you to exercise your imagination in an effort to visualise a world in which there is a com plete defeat of the Allies, expr essing as they do the ideals for which the Forces of Ligh t have ever stood. I woul d remind you of two things : First, that these Forces were defeated in the earlier pha se of the conf lict thous ands of years ago, and secondl y that — if They again go dow n to defeat — it will be largely due to the unpr eparedne ss and to t he pacific attitude of the neutrals of the world. Had the Allies been ready (and that in itself woul d have indi cated attitude s similar to thos e now being expr essed by Germany) and had the neutrals stood toge ther from the out break of hos tilities and proclai med as one voi ce: This thing must not be — Germany woul d then have been arrested in her trium pha nt progr ess. The Allies, how ever, were not prepared for the ons laught of the forces of evil; on the phys ical plane, their pos ition was not impregna ble. The neutr als at the same time have chos en and are still choos ing the negative and weak way; and through fear, a misplaced idealism, or a separative spirit, plus the failure to grasp the acuteness of the world crisis and its signi ficant implications , have placed hum anity in a pos ition of imminent though not inevitable disaster. These are poi nts which requi re careful cons ideration and cons eque nt readjustment of the attitude of thos e who are doi ng not hing to further the efforts of the Forces of Light and of the men of goodw ill throughout the world. What shall be done to stop the progr ess of aggr ession, of selfish nationa lism and cruel attack upon the weak and the defenceless? These qua lities are rampant in Germany. They are to be found in a lesser extent in many other nations and selfish nationa lism is to be found in all to som e degree, even when una ccom panied by militancy or paralleled by a true idealism. It is self - interest, shor t vision, and prejudi ce that basically gove rn neutrality and make the neutral nations , includi ng the Americas, arm for defence but refuse to fight for hum an welfare. How, then, shall we awaken the world to the realities of the situation and so focus and direct a great world effort to throw off the yoke of the dictators as they seek to dom inate the lands out side their ow n? How shall we free hum anity to take its next step forward, without fear and terror and onl y condi tione d by a world which is seeking uni tedly to do that which is best for the whol e, and not simply that which is best m aterially for the part? These are the que stions with which we are toda y conf ront ed. Desperately and fearfully, men are seeking a solution and turning hither and thither for help and com fort. Shall the demand, so widely prevalent at this time, for divine in tervention, rise so strongl y to heaven that it will perforce draw forth a respons e and, at the same time, deprive manki nd of its right to settle its ow n affairs, decide its ow n issues and make progress by the method of trial and error, by the success of it s ow n clear vision and its firm determination to find the right way out of the situation? Such intervention is pos sible, but it is not deemed desirable by the Forces of spiritual know ledge . They are therefore hol ding Their hand, feeling that this time hum a nity must be encour aged to battle to the end on behalf of its hope and its vision. Men pray for peace but will"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST not pay the price of peace. Calmly praying and leaving the work to other men, forces or God, is the easy way, satisfying the emotiona l nature, bu t not invol ving clear thinki ng. Humanity has com e of age; the child stage is ove r, and for weal or woe, for good or ill, men must decide for themselves the way that the world, their gove rnments and their social order must go. A new world order is pos sible, and there are certain steps which need to be taken if the vision of this new world is to enter into the realm of accom plished fact. Certain angl es of the vision I can — with the greatest brevity — poi nt out to you ; I can indi cate the sign pos ts on the way to the future world order. I shall find myself in the pos ition of assuring you at the same time that every step of that way will entail a fight , the ove rturning of that which is old and loved and the destruction of that which is inhu man, selfish a nd cruel; I shall have to impress upon you the prime and initial necessity to ove rthrow the entrenched forces of aggression as they func tion today through the medium of the totalitarian pow ers. First, I woul d ask you all to ponde r on the vision of this ne w world order, preserving an ope n mind and realising that this new mode of living hove rs ove r hum anity and will materialise when selfishne ss is defeated, right hum an relations are correctly envi saged, and the ideal of this new world order is divor ced from all nationa listic conc epts and aspirations . It will not be an American world, or a French world, or a British world, or a totalitarian world. It will be the outcom e of the civilisation which is passing and the culture which is the flow er of that civilisati on, but at the same time it will be neither of them. It will be a hum an world, based on right und erstandi ng of correct hum an relations , upon the recogni tion of equa l educ ationa l oppor tunities for all men, for all races and all nations , and upon the funda me ntal realisation that \"God hath made of one blood all the peopl es upon the earth.\" It will be a world in which racial distinctions and nationa l uni ties will be recogni sed as enriching the whol e and as cont ribut ing to the signi ficance of hum anity. Such dist inctions and nationa lities will be preserved and cultured, not in a separative isolation, but in the realisation that the many aspects of hum an unf oldment and differentiation produc e one nobl e whol e, and that all the parts of this whol e are inte rdepende nt. All will com prehend their relation to each other in one progr essive, synt hetic, hum an ende avour , and the enterprise of uni ted living will produc e an interior work which will flow er forth in the produc tion of a beauty and a richne ss which will d istingui sh hum anity as a whol e. In this all will share, with wisdom and a planne d efficiency, offering to the planetary life and to each other that which they have to cont ribut e. This will be made pos sible because the whol e of manki nd will be recogni sed as the essential uni t and as being of greater spiritual impor tance than the part. This is no idle and visiona ry dream. It is already happe ning. Embryoni c move ments tow ard this world synt hesis are already being made. There is a dream of federation, of econom ic interdepende nce and of religious uni ty, plus social and nationa l interrelation which is rapidly taking form, first in the minds of men, and then in expe riments. There is a tie of uni ted pur pos e, felt by many in the pol itical and econom ic fields, which i s no wish fulfilment or fantasy but indi cative of an emerging reality. It is felt and recogni sed by thinke rs everyw here, and has worked out in the field of gove rnm ent through the medium of the federation of the British Dom inions and their relation to Great Britain, and in the federation of the United States of America. It finds itself distorted and parodi ed in the conc ept of the supe rstate with which the dictators of the world glamour their peopl es. But the links are being forged which will draw dow n the vi sion and precipitate on earth the pattern of things as they shoul d be in this next world cycle. When this vision of the new world order has been grasped by the men and wom en of goodw ill throughout the nations , and has becom e part of the life and mind of e very disciple and aspirant, then the next step will be to study the factors which are hindering its materialisation. For this a broad tolerance"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST and an unpr ejudi ced mind are essential, and these qua lities are rare in the average stude nt and the small tow n m an. Past nationa l mistakes must be faced; selfishne ss in the sphe res of bot h capital and labour must be recogni sed; blindne ss, nationa listic ambitions , adhe rence to ancient territorial demands and assum ed right s, inhe rited pos sessiveness, the re fusal to relinqu ish past gains, disturbances in the religious and social areas of cons cious ness, unc ertainty as to the realities of subj ective and spiritual life, and the insincerities which are based on glamour and fear — all these factors are wove n into th e life pattern of every nation, without exception, and are expl oited by the evil forces and evaded by the well - meaning but weak peopl e of the world. These must all be seen in their true perspective. The eyes of the peopl e who seek to work unde r the Forces of Light must be lifted from the world of effects into the realm of causes; there must be appr eciation of the factors which have made and condi tione d the mode rn world, and these predispos ing factors must be recogni sed for what they are. This sizing up of t he situation and this recogni tion of blame and respons ibility must preface every attempt to bring dow n into active being the new world order. This new world will not com e as an answer to prayer or by the passive wishful thinki ng and expe ctation of the pea ce - lovi ng idealist and mystical visiona ry. They poi nt the way and indi cate the needed obj ective. It will com e when the mystic and the man of vision awakens to the need of the hou r and com es dow n from the world of dreams, of theories, and of words into the hard arena of daily and publ ic life. He must be willing to fight for that which he desires and know s to be good and true and right , and must stand firm against thos e who seek to distort the vision and to arrest its appe arance, arming for battle so that fin al disarmament may be pos sible. A clear vision of the future world order (in broad and general out line but not in detail), an intelligent recogni tion of the hindrances and impediments which block its appe arance, and a willingne ss to take the necessary ste ps upon the phys ical plane and to pay the requi red price and tende r the demande d sacrifices are essential attitude s, prior to the elimination of the hindr ances which stand in the way of the com ing new world. It is a practical vision — long desired , much discussed and clearly out lined. The hindr ances appe ar to be many, but they can all be sum med up in the one word Selfishne ss — nationa l, racial, pol itical, religious and indi vidua l selfishne ss. The practical aspect of the mode of elimination of the hi ndr ances can also be simply stated. The vision will appe ar as fact on Earth when indi vidua ls willingl y subm erge their persona l interests in the good of the group; when the group or groups merge their interests in the nationa l good , when nations give up the ir selfish pur pos es and aims for internationa l good, and when this internationa l right relation is based upon the total good of hum anity itself. Thus the individua l can play his part in the bigge r whol e, and his help is needed, and thus the sense of indi vi dua l futility is negated. To the most uni mpor tant man in the most uni mpor tant nationa l uni t there com es the call for sacrifice and service to the group of which he is part. Eventually hum anity itself is thus swung — again as an integral uni t — into the service of the Planetary Life. In the above you have an attempt to por tray the wider vision with its demande d, practical effort, and also an indi cation of the larger pos sibility which faces hum anity. It is in truth for this the Allies fight and against which Ger many toda y rallies her war machine. What now of the immediate present, and what can the indi vidua l do to aid the cause of hum anity and arrest the tide of evil? If he is fight ing already upo n the side of the Forces of Light and of the Allies, he know s his destiny and service. But what of thos e who que stion what they can do, and yet are eager to see clearly and to play their part when right vision is theirs? To them I woul d say the follow ing things :"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST 1. Eliminate prejudi ce, nationa l pride, and religious anti pathies out of you r cons cious ness. The past mistakes of the Allies, as history gives them, are facts which they themselves do not deny. They stand not alone in selfishne ss, for the same faults taint every nationa l record. But they stand toda y fo r a new and spiritual order, based on a desire for synt hesis, right methods of gove rnm ent and the good of the peopl e. The unha ppy past of all nations is toda y used as an alibi by thos e who do not choos e to shoul der respons ibility, or to sacrifice anyt hing for the cause of hum anity. A recogni tion of our ow n shor tcom ings and a spirit of tolerance and forgiveness are needed by all toda y. 2. Refuse to be afraid of any results of right and positive action. Fear lies behind much of the dissenting attitude s toda y , and fear kills truth, hides the vision and arrests right action. The great Leader of this Christian era has warned us not to be afraid of thos e who kill the body , but to fear onl y thos e who seek to kill the soul . The forces of aggr ession are slow ly and r uthlessly killing out love and hope (qua lities of the soul ) in the conque red lands and in Germany. This, along with the great hum anitarian plea, is sufficient reason to impel all men of goodw ill to take up arms on the side of the Forces of Light . I woul d c om mend this to your imaginative attention. To put it even more practically, I woul d ask you if you woul d care to have your children subj ected to the educ ationa l processes of the Nazi regime — with its crushing of all hum anity, its empha sis upon pride of race and its cult of cruelty? Can you then stand idly by or simply resort to prayer and talk about the beauties of peace when the little children in the appr opr iated lands com e unde r the soul - killing system of Germany? Refuse, then, in their interests, to be a fraid. 3. Having sensed the vision, recogni sed the hindrances, and dealt with inna te prejudi ce and fear, it will then becom e appa rent to you what (in the face of this dange rous crisis) you must do. It is not for me to tell you what it is. The details are for you to decide; the methods which you must employ will becom e clear to you; the hum anitarian issues will becom e increasingl y plain to you; you will then range your self on the side of the Forces of Light, and will uphol d the hands of thos e who are fighti ng for world peace and security, preparatory to the inauguration of the new world order. This you will do with no thought of self. You will face life truly and sincerely, with a fully dedicated sacrifice of time, self, mone y and, if need be, of life. You will realise dyna mically that the attitude of the passive onl ooke r is not that of the agent of the Forces of Light or of a love r of hum anity. 4. You will also learn to keep you r mind free from hate, refusing to hate the delude d sinne r even when impos ing upon him the penalty of his sin. Hate and separation must cease, and they will cease as the indi vidua l aspirant stamps them out in his ow n life. The great error of the neutrally minde d and of the pacifist is his refusal to identify himself cons tr uctively with hum an pain. Even when he reacts with violent emotion ove r the suffering, for instance, of little children in this great war, and of the defenceless refuge e, he doe s not truly care enough to do anyt hing about the situation, invo lving as it doe s sacrifice. This sounds harsh, but is a needed statement of fact. Sympat hy which doe s not produc e pos itive action of som e kind becom es a festering sore . Thus , by thought and word and deed, the love r of hum anity will enter the battle against evil; with co mplete self - forgetfulness, he will take up the cause of hum anity, hiding not behind the sense of futility and seeking no alibi in a misinterpreted idealism. He will face the facts of the present situation in the light which streams from the vision itself. He will then press forward into the age of right hum an relations , of spiritual uni ty and shared resour ces with com plete conf idence because his sense of values is adjusted. He know s that hum anity has a divine mission which must be carried out on the wings o f love , through unde rstandi ng action, selfless service and the willingne ss to die in battle if that is the only"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST way in which his brother can be served and freed. Having now presented the attitude tow ards the present world crisis which seems to me cons iste nt with all that I have taught in the past and in line with the teaching of the Hierarchy, and having made clear the basic dua lism which unde rlies this conf lict, and poi nted out the lines of demarcation which are clearly emerging, I now call upo n all of you to stand with the Forces of Light . These are difficult and terrible days. Men and women are needed who have the cour age and the insight to stand with steadfastness and to take the steps which are needed — no matter what they may be — to bring thi s war to an end. Vast sections of hum anity can do no more than acqui esce in the unha ppy fate which has ove rtaken them. They are una ble to think or pray or even to sum mon faith to their aid. They feel without hope . For them, you must think; for them, you mu st pray; for them, you must have faith and — above all else at this time — for them you must act. The work of recons truction lies in the future. The demand toda y is for the bui lding of a bul wark of defence around hum anity; then — having fulfilled every phys ical plane requi rement — to stand immovable. But you must stand with faces turned tow ards the enemy of the soul s of men, ready to do battle, literally and phys ically, ready to take every needed step to drive the enemy back, and ready to sacrifice to the uttermost so that he may adva nce no further. Your work will, therefore, be of a threefold nature. On the levels of mental cons cious ness, your vision of the need and of the future will be clear, inspiring you and enabling you to be a sour ce of strengt h to all aroun d you; your faith will see behind the obvi ous to the \"subs tance of things hope d for, the evidence of things not seen,\" as the initiate, Paul, expr esses it; your thought will then be anchor ed in right action, soul directed. On the emotiona l side of life, yo u will find no time for idle tears or for vague , sym pathetic talk, because you will be com pletely identified with what is going on and all emotiona l energy will be directed to the pur suit of every available mode of practically alleviating the pain. The hea rt energy will be occupi ed with the task of giving unde rstandi ng help so that there is no scope for the usual emotiona l solar plexus reactions . On the phys ical plane you will not be occupi ed with the problem of what to do, because every phy sical effort, time, and persona lity empha sis will be directed to the shoul dering of your due share in arresting the forces of aggr ession from any further adva nce. This might mean fighting in the ranks of the Allied Armies, or it might mean driving an ambul ance unde r Red Cross auspices; raising funds to succour the refuge es; speaking on publ ic platforms or to groups upon the issues at stake, or participating in som e form of nationa l effort to bring aid and strengt h to the Allies. Whatever it is, it will call for all that is in you and all that you are, integrated and directed to a sustained, subs tantial, one - poi nted effort. It will throw your will - to - good behind every attempt to frustrate the activities of the evil alliance which you may find in your envi ronm ent; it will lead you to work with watchfulness for the good of your own count ry, whilst at the same time swelling the tide of the nationa l effort to end war through the tangi ble victory of the Forces of Light . Ponde r on these words. The goodw ill effort of th e world, which I sought earlier to inaugur ate and to synt hesise, has passed through a negative stage and through an interlude wherein it was not pos sible to work actively. The needs of the New Group of World Servers calls it now into a renewed pos itive act ivity. The rediscove ry and the immediate sustaining of the members of this group must be unde rtaken anew. In all lands they must be reached, if pos sible, and rehabilitated with wisdom , and re - established subj ectively. They must be aided obj ectively and aga in inspired to work in order that they may form the nuc leus of the Forces of Recons truction when the Forces of Light have won the victory ove r the forces of aggr ession. This is the first poi nt which I woul d ask you to cons ider doing."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST The second thing is t o begin the dyna mic use of another Stanza of the Great Invoc ation. That which you have hitherto used has now served its immediate pur pos e, though it can again be called into use after the war is ove r. I give you now anot her set of phr ases which can (if rig htly used) invoke the Forces of the Divine Will on to the side of the Forces of Light . It is not easy to give an adequa te translation or paraphr ase of this pow er - mantram, nor is it easy to step it dow n sufficiently so that it can be safely used by all, yet at the same time preserve its challengi ng, dyna mic qua lity. The follow ing sentences will suffice, how ever, and if used by you with focussed intention and with the attitude of a sacrificial persona lity (held silently dedicated in the light of th e soul ), much pow er may be generated. Along the lines of pow er which you may thus succeed in setting up may com e that which is needed to release hum anity from the thraldom of evil, provided the nature of the sacrificial will is som ewhat unde rstood by you. Let the Lords of Liberation issue forth. Let Them bring succour to the sons of men. Let the Rider from the secret Place com e forth, And com ing, save. Com e forth, O Might y One.

The saying of this Invoc ation is not a subs titute for the phys ical plane effort on your part; it is com plementary to that, and the more you are serving upon the phys ical plane, the more effective will be your use of the new Invoc ation. I said earlier that the war coul d have been averted from expr ession on the phys ical plane had the disciples and aspirants of the world measured up to their oppo rtuni ty and respons ibilities. The Great Invoc ation was rende red rela tively pow erless, from the angl e of dyna mic usefulness, because the majority of thos e who used it turned it into a peace prayer. It was instead a great spiritually militant invoc ative demand. This must not happe n with this Stanza of Invoc ation. It is a dem and; it is also an author itative affirmation of existent fact; it sets in motion agencies and forces hitherto qui escent, and these can change the face of the world battlefield; it invoke s the Prince of Peace, but He carries a sword, and the effe cts of His activity may prove surprising to thos e who see onl y the needs of the form aspect of hum anity. That strengt h and enlight enm ent may be your s and the pow er to stand and the ability to fight for the release of hum anity is the prayer and the appe al of your brother, the Tibetan. THE GREAT INVOCATION - Stan za Two September 1940 It has seemed to me after due thought that it woul d serve a most useful purpos e if I elucidated som ewhat the theme of the new Invoc ation and dealt also with the idea of di vine intervention. There is much loos e thinki ng in this conne ction, due to the truth as well as the misinterpretation of the Christian teaching anent the return of the Christ. Men's theologi cal, analytical minds have distorted God's revelation, and I woul d like to do som ething to produc e a wiser attitude to the reality of this inevitable return. This loos e thinking prevents much intelligent and coope rative work. I woul d remind you that the success of invoc ation and the true efficacy of prayer are depende nt upon clear thinki ng and not upon emotiona l desire or a pow erful wish com plex. They are depende nt, too, upon a certain dyna mic freshne ss and enthus iasm which it is hard to attain in a time of stress and strain. The present time is peculiarly hard. Perhaps a clearer unde rstandi ng of the nature and pur pos e of divine intervention may clarify som ewhat the issue. To the casual thinke r and the unt rained occult stude nt it might appe ar that — given an almight y Deity or Planetary Logos — He coul d with little troubl e and much usefulness and com passion intervene in this sad world situation and bring to an end the warring of the nations through the medium of som e spectacular happe ning, som e dramatic cataclysm of natural process or som e supr eme appe aring which wou ld work much good. It might , it coul d be argue d, conc lusively convi nce the attacking, aggr essive groups that their day is ende d and that their efforts had better be drawn to an immediate finish. Woul d that it were so relatively simple a matter; but the law s of nature, the free will of hum anity itself and the inevitability of karma com bine to prevent an intervention in just these terms. This doe s not mean that som e form of intervention may not be pos sible but it must conf orm to law; it must not interfere wit h"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST hum anity's right to handl e its ow n affairs, and it must be timed in such a way that the best and maximum results can be attained. I woul d like first of all to touc h upon the three poi nts which I have made above — natural law, free will and karma. In so do ing I may succeed in clearing up som e of the conf used thinki ng of many stude nts. Natural law is the inevitable working out upon the phys ical plane of forces and energies which have long been generated. Peopl e are apt to think that these must lie out side o f human cont rol and cons titute part of the inscrutable will of God, and that with them man has naught to do. When it is realised that certain aspects of natural law are conc erned pur ely with the forces — subt erranean, supe rficial and aerial — of our planet, th e premise will be seen as correct in the present condi tion of the mental attitudes of the race and will remain so for a very long time. There are, nevertheless, causes and effects which can com e unde r the categor y of natural law which are yet not so far re move d from human cont rol. For ages man has generated energies which must inevitably produc e events upon the phys ical plane, evok e respons e upon the plane of the emotions , and indu ce mental reactions . It is here that natural law and the law of karma meet an d interact upon each other. There are many peopl e toda y who find an alibi for themselves in the present world situation, and a cons eque nt release from definite action and respon sibility, by saying that what is toda y happe ning is simply karma or the workin g out of cause and effect, and that there is not hing, therefore, that they can do about it; they take the pos ition that it is not their affair, and that in due cour se of time the process will be worked out and everything will be all right again. The slate will then be cleaner and incidentally they will not have been embroiled, but will have safely (even if unc om fortably) looke d on. In so doi ng they ove rlook the third aspect of this same law, to which we have given the name of free will. It is the right use of free will and its unde rstandi ng expr ession which must eventually straight en out and adjust the working out of karma and transmute that which now works such evil and havoc in the world into a demons tration of good and of the successful found at ion for the pursuit of true happi ness. Therefore, thos e who are looki ng on at the tragic sufferings of hum anity and who refuse to be implicated, and thus succeed in evading respons ibility as an integral part of the hum an family, are definitely storing up f or themselves much evil karma. In som e way they must learn participation, because the present situation has in it the seeds of release for hum anity when the nature of evil is som ewhat grasped, and above all when the one ness of hum anity and the right s of hu man beings are truly recogni sed. Thos e who war against the race of men and who seek to wrest from them their God - given goa l of freedom must be driven back from whence they came. Thos e who refuse to share in that struggl e for freedom will be left out of the gains of freedom , even if it onl y means within their ow n hom e limits, in their life habits and in their private circum stances. When I here speak of \"being driven back from whence they came\" I am using phr ases in bot h the simple and the occult sense. It i s therefore the free will and the will - to - good of hum anity which must actively end the present conf lict. One of these, the first, conc erns man's respons ibility to man; the other, right ly unde rstood, conc erns the right relations hip of man to divine purpos e, his right orientation to the divine goodw ill, and his correct participation in its expr ession. Where these condi tions exist, there can be drawn forth an act of divine intervention. Natural law is toda y produc ing great change s in nature through the effects of aerial and phys ical com bat, through the results of the fluid move ment of whol e sections of the world popul ation and through the effects of vast econom ic change s and processes. Condi tions have been set in motion which must now work out to th eir predestined end, and it is the task of thos e who gui de hum anity spiritually"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST to see that out of the surface evil and material activity good may eventuate, and that out of the wicked, materialistic intent lying behind the present aggr essive activity of c ertain groups ultimate good may be engi neered and the evil activity ende d. But this pos sible good will be the result of the spiritual activity of thos e who know the law and who unde rstand the pur pos e of the will of God; it will be wrought out in spite of, and not because of, the brute force and the selfish goa ls of the world aggressors; these embody and ensoul the materialistic forces of the planet in a manne r utterly new in expr ession. Free will invol ves a basic unde rstandi ng of the lines of world cleavag e; it conc erns right choi ce and cons eque nt correct action for the group and is determined every time by that which is right for the whol e and not so much by that which is right for the part. Hum anity is onl y now reaching the poi nt where free will can be of signi ficant impor tance. There has been little free will to date. This is definitely the needed demons tration at this mom ent. It is the lack of true free will which is toda y hol ding up the final activity. This is a statement of impor tance and it is here th at the great and free neutrals can give a right lead to hum an affairs. Aggression, fear, terror, forebodi ng and the num bne ss that com es from undue and ceaseless mental and phys ical pain are stultifying and negating free will in many sections of the world a t this time. There is no free will in many parts of Europe toda y. Prejudi ce, the misinterpretation of presented facts, false and ove r - empha sised idealism, racial and nationa listic thought forms and the withdr awing fear of respons ibility are hinde ring the e xpr ession of free will in the less damaged parts of the world. Moral unpr eparedne ss and the refusal to relinqui sh the many and differing misinterpretations of truth or of Christ's teaching are hinde ring many peopl e toda y. Release for hum anity wi ll com e when the so - called good peopl e of the world give up their pet theories and their belove d ideals and grasp the essential fact that entry into the Kingdom of Heaven and into the new age will take place when manki nd is truly loved and selflessly serve d, and when the true, divine pur pos e is seen and hum anity is found to be one indivisible whol e. Then petty nationa lisms, religious differences and selfish idealisms (for that is what they often are as most peopl e are idealists because they seek to save the ir ow n soul s) are subor dinated to hum an need, hum an good and the future happi ness of the whol e. The simplification of the attitude of men is the crying need at this time. Ideologi es must go; old ideals must be relinqui shed; petty pol itical, religious and s ocial schemes must be discarded, and the one driving pur pos e and the one out standi ng determination must be the release of hum anity from the impos ition of fear, from enforced slavery and the reinstatement of men in freedom and with due oppo rtuni ty to expr es s themselves through right hum an relations . This is not as yet pos sible and it is the appa lling situation of terror, of slavery and of impos ed and penalising rule which is breaking the heart of hum anity and causing deep distress and que stioni ng in thos e wh ose hearts are not yet so broke n. As to Karma , what man has made he can unm ake. This is oft forgotten. Karma is not a hard and fast rule. It is change able, according to man's attitude and desire. It is the presenting of the oppo rtuni ty to change ; this gro ws out of past activities, and these right ly met and correctly handl ed lay the founda tion for future happi ness and progress. The present situation is the fault of all peopl es in all count ries (particularly the more intelligent) and include s also the great neutrals if the Law of Rebirth and of joint respons ibility means anyt hing at all. Karma is not all that is bad and evil. Men make it so through their stupi dities. There are toda y great forces of evil seeking expr ession in the world; these emerge out of the past and seek to determine and bring about a very evil future wherein selfishne ss, material obj ectives, and the good and well - being of one race out of the many must be impos ed upon the world — a world which inna tely revol ts against such an impos i tion and distortion of reality. The force of evil example is show n in the fact that two other races seek abjectly to copy or aid the forces of aggression, focussed at this time through the aggressor race."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST At the same time, the forces of goo d are seeking t o offset this impos ition of material selfishne ss and are now at bay with the issue still unde cided — except upon the mental plane. It has yet to work out as the trium ph of good upon the phys ical plane. When those who are not so drastically implicated in the present conf lict relinqui sh their selfishne ss, their prejudi ces and their interpretations and see the basic dua lity of this conf lict in its true light, they will throw the weight of their influence increasingl y on the side of goodw ill and right hum an relat ions ; then the bad karma which they appa rently placidly accept for others and reject for themselves will be change d into the good karma which is the true destiny of hum anity and will usher in the new era of joy and of peace and spiritual synt hesis — that syn thesis which we call brotherhood. It is because of the delay in right unde rstandi ng, and the slow ness of many to appr eciate the true situation, that Thos e Who gui de the race and work on the spiritual side of life have been una ble to do much up to date exce pt spiritually strengt hen the hands of the workers with the Forces of Light . The faith of many has kept the door ajar, yet even these have forgot ten freque ntly that \"faith without works is dead.\" It is onl y when faith finds active expr ession upon the phys i cal plane in right coope ration and sacrifice (even unt o death) that the door can be forced wide ope n and divine intervention becom e pos sible. It is onl y when the vision and dream of peace — which begui les so many well - meaning peopl e — gives way to the determin ation to take every pos sible means to achieve that peace in practical ways upon the phys ical plane that the inne r spiritual forces will be enabled to work also more actively on earth. Curious ly enough, they are often hinde red toda y by the ideal ists, who love their ideals more than they love hum anity and who cling to their special interpretations of what they think Christ meant, at the same time excludi ng that real love which characterised His every act and which woul d drive them into active, sel fless service to the Forces of Light . They do not hing to bring the conf lict to an end because they are preoccupi ed with their ow n dreams, ideals and interpretations ; when they can let these go because of love of humanity, then the new vision will com e and the world will be saved; the Forces of Light will find pot ent expression and the forces of aggr ession will go dow n to defeat. Given, therefore, an eventual fusing of vision and phys ical plane activity (the major need at this time), what form is it pos sibl e for the hope d - for divine intervention to take? I make no prophe cies. All that I seek to show is that the blocking or hindr ance is to be found toda y on the side of hum anity. It doe s not lie on the side of the forces of light , life and love ; it is not to b e found on the side of Christ and His disciples or of the Masters of Wisdom , as these (unde r diverse names) cons titute the spiritual Hierarchy of the planet. Call Them by what name you choos e, the most cherished belief of hum anity is that there exists in t he world always and for ever a hidde n Reality, Thos e Who have conque red death, Who pos sess illimitable pow ers to help, and Who can be reached by prayer and invoc ation. It is the pot ency and grasp of things material and the fact of und ivided focus upon the phys ical plane that has given the forces of aggression so much success up to the present time. These forces, through their very pot ency, have fused and blende d toge ther a group of seven men who personi fy in themselves great and specific aspects of materia l forces (conne cted with the seven type s of energy in their low est and most material expressions ) and their manifestations — war, fear and cruelty. They are united by one poi nt of view and by one goa l, and hence their success. (It is interesting t hat, again in their case, there appe ars inevitably an initiatory seven — the base and dark parallel of the initiating Seven who lead hum an beings into light and who are sym bol ised in the seven Masons who cons titute a Lodge of Mason s.) They are the custodi ans of forces which cont rol them and ove r which they themselves have no slight est cont rol. You ask who these seven are: Hitler, von Ribbe ntrop, Goebbe ls, Goering, Hess,"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Himmler and Streicher — names well - know n to you all. These men embody and personi fy the forc es of aggr ession and rule by fear not onl y the enslaved nations but also their few allies who are not by any means in the same categor y of pow er — fortuna tely for them. When thos e who are on the side of the Forces of Light and of non - aggr ession can see thei r goa l with equa l clarity and are equa lly and uni formly uni ted with the obj ective of endi ng oppr ession and slavery and of freeing hum anity, then we shall see also an embodi ment of spiritual force which will bring disaster to these pot ent seven. Such a uni f ication of obj ective and of purpos e is pos sible and needed; and when it doe s take place, the force generated and the pow er let loos e upon the phys ical plane will be of so stupe ndous a nature that hum an liberation will rapidly be brought about . It is for t his that I have worked and for this I have sought to arous e all of you . This spirit is grow ing among the allied forces, though the falling away of France was inevitable. France was animated by som ewhat selfish pur pos es — the security and safety of France mor e than with the integrity and happi ness of hum anity, and this led to an inevitable collapse; France is learning, how ever, and its uns hakable masses and its spiritual nuc leus will save the day for the broke n nation. The neutral pow ers are still selfish (tho ugh they seek by phi lanthropy to veil it), but they are rapidly awakening to the true issues, and when there is real synt hesis of goa l and of purpos e and a true uni fication of vision upon the mental plane, of fixed and una lterable desire upon the emotiona l plane, and a dedication to practical effort upon the phys ical plane, then there will be hope that the embodi ment of \"the desire of all nations \" will appe ar. That embodi ment is one mode in which divine intervention can take place. The Prince of Peace will lead His peopl e — through war — to peace. Thos e who think onl y in terms of peace as they unde rstand it and desire it are apt to forget the Biblical implication that the Prince of Peace takes a definite part in the battle of Armageddon (now in full progr ess). After achieving victory, He will then lead His trium pha nt cohor ts through the gates into \"Jerusalem,\" the city of peace. The sym bol ic and practical signi ficance of this is becom ing increasingl y appa rent. This not able event can and will take plac e when the free will of the peopl e, blende d by invoc ation and prayer, can make this pos sible. Divine intervention coul d also take the form of a cataclysmic happe ning which woul d bring aggr ession to an end through destruction. It woul d proba bly be at such a cost of hum an life that there is definite hesitation ove r employi ng it by the custodi ans of natural law and the workers who unde rstand divine pur pos e, apart from the fact that hum anity has now reached the poi nt in evol ution where the expr ession of hum an free will is definitely pos sible. The use of cataclysm was the method employe d in Atlantean days, as you well know from the tales of the flood; and through the flood there was almost com plete destruction of the civilisation of that time. It is hop ed that s uch a drastic step will not be needed toda y, though there are ancient prophe cies which foretell the pos sibility of the destruction of this world at this time through fire — instead of flood . Which of the two methods — divine embodi ment and natural cataclysm — wi ll be employe d will really be decided by hum anity through its use or non - use of free will and unde rstandi ng. If hum anity fails to uni te unde r the banne r of the Forces of Light against the forces of material aggr ession and selfishne ss, then the \"fiery ordea l\" might be una voi dable. There are also sleeping hos ts which may be evoke d for the aiding of the spiritual forces, and certain ancient prophe cies hint at these, but as we study the new Invoc ation phrase by phr ase, I may be able to make this mat ter clearer, for there are several signi ficances and meanings behind each phr ase. The one thing I seek to make clear in these ope ning remarks is that natural law, free will, and karma are becom ing increasingl y related and are all aspects of one great law, embodyi ng divine pur pos e — a"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST pur pos e which must work out through the medium of hum anity itself if the present oppor tuni ty is to be met correctly and in line with divine pur pos e. The stimulation of certain peopl e to phe nom enal action, and the instigation of others to emerge as dyna mic and inspired leaders, is also anot her way in which divine intervention might find expr ession. Oft, dow n the ages, men have been ove rshadow ed by divinity and inspired by God to accept pos itive leadership, and so make divine pur po se a fact in condi tioni ng world affairs. Had they not so responde d to the influencing impression, and had they not accepted the respons ibility impos ed upon them, the cour se of world affairs and world events might have been very different. I refer not here specifically to spiritual leaders but also to leaders in other departments of hum an living — to such expr essions of the divine will as Moses, the Lawgiver, Akba r, the warrior and stude nt, Leona rdo da Vinci, the inspired artist, and to other great and out stan ding figures who have determined the basic trends of hum an civilisation; I refer also to the cons tructive forces which have gui ded manki nd into the increasing light of know ledge and unde rstandi ng. All these leaders have produc ed lasting effects upon the hu man cons cious ness and their work has lain therefore in the dom ain of the second aspect of divinity. Their activities parallel thos e of the workers who are, or have been, inspired by the material or matter aspect of manifestation, whos e influence has been p redominantly upon the phys ical plane, and whos e effect has been out standi ngl y along selfish persona l lines. This type of influence is felt predom inantly upon the phys ical plane, and therefore, from certain angl es, the present conf lict might be regarded as one between the second aspect, the develope d spiritual cons cious ness, and the material aspect of manifestation, with hum anity cons tituting the great field of divine conf lict at this time. We have, therefore, hinted at the follow ing forms of div ine intervention: 1. Divine embodi ments 2. Natural cataclysms 3. Evoc ation of slum bering Entities 4. Emergence of inspired leadership. There still remains one mode of intervention which is still more mysterious , illimitably more pow erful, and definitely more difficult both to evoke and subseque ntly to cont act. This is the emergence, respons e, or appe aring of great Sons of God Who dw ell in sour ces far remove d from our planetary life altoge ther; this invol ves the appe arance of Lives of such stupe ndous and d ivine expr ession and pot ency that onl y the massed spiritual pur pos e of vast num bers of men can be pot ent enough and far - reaching enough to pierce beyond the veil which protects the Earth, to thos e far distant realms where They have Their natural and everla sting abode . They cannot be reached by prayer or even by well formulated desire — the expr ession of the wish life of the masses. They lie utterly beyond the realm of feeling (as hum anity unde rstands it) and dw ell ever in that high place which can onl y be rea ched by intentiona lly directed, selfless thought . Are there enough peopl e in the world toda y whos e focussed and illum ined thought can be organised and directed tow ards these Lives in such a manne r that They can be attracted and led to respond to hum an nee d for deliverance? Such is the probl em. It is pos sible, but not , perhaps, proba ble. The probl em of a blende d demand from the spiritual Hierarchy and from hum anity — simultaneous ly expr essed — will have to be met, and this is by no means easy of accom plishm ent. It is for this reason that these three stanzas from a very ancient invoc ation have been made available and put in your hands at this time. If you can use these phr ases as voiced demand s and affirmed beliefs — in uni son with the highe st spiritual forces which claim your allegiance, no matter unde r what"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST name — then there is just a chance that this type of divine activity might be set in motion along a particular line, and this might lead to change s of so auspicious a nature that a new heaven and a new earth might be rapidly precipitated. There is at least no harm in this attempt and this effort at participation in hierarchical ende avour . Planne d collabor ation with the work of the Christ at this time is useful and needed; it will serve at least to eleva te hum anity and its thought , and produc e a permanent spiritual stabilisation. Great pot encies and the expr ession of anc ient evil from the pas t are rampant upon earth at this time, released through unus ual hum an selfishne ss, cruelty and error, and focussed throug h the medium of one unha ppy race and the pow er of certain dange rous men — men who are easily subj ect to evil impression and influenced, obs essed, by selfishne ss and evil — by forces of destruction. Is it pos sible to evoke at this time eternal good , laten t in Lives which woul d nor mally cont act hum anity in som e far distant future, and thus hasten the day of height ened and deepened spiritual cont act in the immediate present? Such is the que stion. If this can be done , the evil past and the glorious future may perhaps be brought into cont act in the unha ppy present, and an event take place which will produc e stupe ndous change s. I woul d remind you here that the evoc ation of this divine cont act will be, in itself, dange rous , disrupt ing and destroyi ng. The results are unp redictable for the hum an being, for men are as yet una ccustom ed to respond to Lives and Influences of so high and divine a nature. There is nevertheless a pos sibility that it might now be more safely permitted if enough peopl e can stand toge ther sp iritually and selflessly, and so offer themselves as channe ls for these new and unknow n spiritual Forces. There are divine attribut es, divine qua lities and divine potencies which the most enlight ened hum anity of all time have as yet failed even to register , sense or vision — all three aspects escaping cont act with these pot encies. Yet these pow ers exist, and the right handl ing of the present crisis by spiritually oriented hum anity may bring about the release of som e of these highe r energies and the establishing of a line of factual influence along which They can move and cons eque ntly cont act the Earth. Ponde r on this and limit not Deity through the rigidity and finiteness of little minds . The release of great impersona l forces is ever a critical ma tter. The effects produc ed are depende nt upon the qua lity of the recipient aspects and the nature of the form qua lity upon which they make their impact. In the world of chemistry, a catalyst, broug ht into cont act with certain subs tances, will produc e som et hing entirely new and bring about change s not nor mally anticipated. These we are now beginni ng to study and to unde rstand. The intervention into the situation of certain pot encies of stupe ndous gravity and uni que ness, and their effect upon the interacting Forces of Light and forces of aggression, is still more unp redictable, and onl y the grasp of the spiritually minde d peopl e of the world and their steadfastness in sacrifice — plus their clarity of vision and their uni ted world focus — can make the situation sa fe for hum anity as a whol e. Bear these thought s in mind as you use the great and new Invoc ation. One other thought I woul d like to touc h upon prior to an analysis of the phr ases of the Invoc ation. It is a recogni zed truth toda y that all expr ession upon t he phys ical plane is the result, first of all, of thought , then of desire, and finally of phys ical plane activity. A man sees a vision and a pos sibility. He broods ove r it and it enters then into the realm of mental inve ntion. A thought form is then organis ed, whether it is the thought form of a sewing machine, of a pol itical party, of an econom ic idea, or som e other type of organisation with som e planne d obj ective. Much reflection and broodi ng will eventually produc e a magne tic field which will becom e so pot ent that desire will enter in; then the dream or vision enters into a new stage of vitalisation. In due time, when the processes of desire have adequa tely develope d, the vision will precipitate upon the phy sical plane. Phys ical activity and conc rete method s"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST of manifestation are then coor dinated and gradua lly the thought form becom es an expressed reality, recogni sable by all men. Thought , desire, activity — such is the history of human vision and dream. Dow n the ages, from the very night of time, ma n has dreamed, expe ctant of divine revelation and of divine intervention. When all else seems to fail, men look to God. Again and again in the history of the race, the vision has taken form and the dream has materialised upon the wings of pow erful desire a nd demand. Again and again, God has revealed and sent His Messenge rs and Representatives to aid and gui de hum anity. But this happe ns onl y when the demand is adequa tely voi ced and the need has cried to high heaven. Never yet has the respons e failed. Again a nd again lately, the nations of the world have been called to prayer, and this proclaimed appe al of millions cannot be disregarded or remain negligible. An answer must be forthcom ing, though it may not take the same form as of old, because man is toda y — in spite of appe arances — more capable of handl ing his ow n affairs and determining cons cious ly his ow n events. No matter how unr ealised, back of all these demands and prayers in the many Christian count ries, lies a subt le, deep - seated convi ction that the return of Christ is imminent; there is widespread acceptance of the conc ept that the Presence of the Son of God can be evoke d and that He must com e to the assistance of His peopl e. No matter what the dogm atic interpretation or the theologi cal idealism, som e form of this belief lies behind the cry of the millions . Will this demand from the hearts of men induc e the return of the Christ of Galilee? Will it bring abou t the emergence into manifestation of som e great Son of God Who will embody perhaps anot her and unkn ow n aspect of God's life and qua lity? Will it perhaps produc e the embodi ment of anot her divine revelation, and — just as the Buddha expressed the Wisdom of God and Christ revealed to us the Love of God — is it not pos sible that He Who may com e will unf old to u s the nature of the Will or Purpos e of God, thus presenting that will - to - good which must be called into activity if the evil will - to - pow er is to be swept from the Earth. I present this pos sibility to your attention and woul d ask you to think abo ut it. Thus , if this shoul d prove the correct result of all invoc ation and prayer, we shall have the balancing of the persona lity will, of material selfishne ss and acqui sitiveness, and the selfless will which seeks to aid the whol e of hum anity. The will of the low er self and the will of the Self or Soul will be brought into conf lict with each other, with hum anity throw ing the weight of its influence upon one side or the other. When I speak of throw ing the weight of hum an influence upon one side or anot her, I refer not alone to thought pow er and to what so many euphe mistically call \"work on mental levels.\" I refer to the cons cious activity of the whol e man, working mentally, emotiona lly and most empha tically phys ically also. Only thos e, therefore, who are in tegrated persona lities can work in this manne r, and herein lies a difficulty. Thos e peopl e toda y who work onl y mentally or who sit and send thought s of love broadcast into the world, and who bask thus in the beauty of their ow n idealism (making freque ntly no adequa te balancing phys ical effort to bring this present evil situation to an end through right choi ce, sacrifice and strenuous service), are in reality of no service at all to any except themselves. There are thos e who send thought s of love to the grou p of evil men who are respons ible for world disaster, believing thereby to influence them for good . I woul d remind them that love is essentially an impersona l pot ency or energy, depende nt for its effect upon the type of form which it cont acts and upon whic h it makes an impact. Pour ing, therefore, upon the selfish materialistic nature, it will onl y enha nce desire and prom ote increased acqui sitive aggr ession, and thus foster the low er nature and distort the true expr ession of love , leading to increased evil a ctivity. Pouring upon the selfless, the pure and the disinterested, it will foster reality and true love . These are poi nts which shoul d be remembered at this time by the well - intentione d but occultly ignor ant server. "},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Let us now proceed to the a nalysis of the three stanzas or verses. The first of these refers to the waiting attentive group of spiritual Lives who seek to aid when right demand coincides with right time. The second stanza refers to hum anity and its reactions , and to the pos sibility of interplay between the two groups — of spiritual Lives and men. The third indi cates methods and results. We will take each phr ase or expr essed idea separately, for each carries its own impor t and all of them pos sess several signi ficances. With all the mean ings I cannot deal, but will present the simplest and the most impor tant. Let the Lords of Liberation issue forth. Let Them bring succour to the sons of men. Who are the Lords of Liberation, and from whence do They com e? All the ideas and conc epts which cont rol hum an life and have given rise to our civilisation have started as emanations from certain great Lives, Who are Themselves an expr ession of a divine Idea. The not e They strike and the qua lity They emanate reaches out and makes an impact upon the mo st develope d of the sons of men found at any particular time upon the Earth. These then proceed to make the sensed idea their ow n and to familiarise the thinke rs of their time with the formulated conc ept. In this way great motivating, divine pur pos es becom e cont rolling factors in hum an progr ess. It is in this way that the basic urge to liberation and to freedom has slow ly and cons istently dom inated human ende avour , leading first of all to the struggl e for indi vidua l freedom and liberation (with the incident al ideal of heaven, of initiation and of spiritual attainm ent), and gradua lly moul ding hum an thoug ht to such an extent that the greater ideal takes shape. The freedom of hum anity and the liberation of its pow er to be self - determining (which is an aspect of freedom ) has becom e the dearest ideal and the best thought of the thinke rs in all nations . In the last analysis, it is this interference with indi vidua l and group freedom which is the worst sin of the evil men who seek at this time to enslave the weaker n ations and bend them to the rule of Germany, depriving them of their nationa l assets and means of subs istence, and wresting from them — by force and fear — their dearest pos session s, liberty of life and cons cience. All great ideas have their emanat ing Sour ces of life, therefore, and These are called in the ancient invoc ation with which we are occupi ed \"Lords of Liberation. \" They are three in num ber, and one of Them is closer to the Earth and to humanity than are the other two, and it is He Who can b e reached by thos e who com prehend the nature of freedom and who desire beyond all things to be liberated and to see all the oppr essed and enslaved peopl e of the world also liberated. Every move of an enlight ened cons cious ness (such as that of a Lord of Lib eration) tow ards hum anity produc es a correspondi ng shift or move on the part of men. This in itself cons titutes a definite probl em, because no such move can be made by a Lord of Liberation unl ess hum anity is ready to raise its ideal of freedom to a highe r level of expr ession. Unless this world war has in it the seeds of a revelation of a highe r hum an freedom , and unl ess hum anity is ready to expr ess this highe r freedom to the best of its ability, it will not be pos sible for the Lords of Liberation to take ac tion. They cannot be move d by prayer, demand and invoc ation alone . Such demand must have behind it the ideal of a newer freedom and a greater liberty for man. In the abroga tion of the French idealism, sum med up in the words — \"Liberty, Equa lity, Fraternity\" — the attention of the whol e world was focussed on the theme of liberty, and the sym bol ism of the event is of far greater impor t than has yet been grasped. France has not relinqui shed the ideal of hum an liberty which she originally brough t (on a large scale) to the attention of manki nd. Her action, unde r the influence of the enemies of hum an freedom , simply focussed the dange r with which humanity was conf ront ed, and brought it empha tically to the attention of humanity, num bed by disaster, and bewildered by th e accum ulated weight of misery. By so doi ng, the probl em was simplified for the unt rained mind. It also produced, spiritually speaking, a direct line of com muni cation between men who know the signi ficance of freedom and long for hum an release, a nd the Lords of Liberation Who are respons ible for implanting this inna te desire in hum anity."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST The reason why these Lords of Liberation are the first mentione d in the stanza is that They are essentially related to desire - will , and are therefore the more ea sily cont acted by man. The place from which They issue forth to the aiding of hum anity is a certain area of the divine Cons cious ness which is ope n to the hum an sense of awareness, if sufficiently enlight ened and selfless. You can see from the above remark how the effective use of invoc ation is therefore depende nt upon the poi nt of spiritual developm ent of the one who seeks the aid of true prayer and invoc ation. One thing which shoul d be grasped anent all these great Lives is that what is com monl y called \"wo rship\" is abhor red by Them. Worship, the pow er to adore and the sense of awe (which is one of the highe st aspects of fear) are not desired by Them. Such attitude s are emotiona l in origin and based upon the sense of dua lity, and therefore upon feeling. Thes e Lives are embodi ments of service and can be reached by true servers with the appe al of service. Bear this in mind. As man progr esses upon the Path he forgets worship; he loses all sense of fear, and ador ation fails to engross his attention. All these att itude s are obl iterated by the realisation of an ove rpow ering love and its conseque nt interplay and tende ncy to increase identification. The Lords of Liberation can be reached, therefore, by the call of the world servers, and They will then issue forth thro ugh the agency of One of Them, Who will uni fy the energies of all Three, and so produc e thos e condi tions which will bring about effective and recogni sed freedom . How They will do this is not for us to say; the most probable method will be through the ove rs hadow ing of som e man, or som e group of men, so that they will be inspired to bring about the victory of liberty. Let the Rider from the secret place com e forth and com ing — save. Com e forth, O Might y One. Here we com e up against one of the oldest tradition s in the world and of the ancient East; one , too, which finds its count erpart in the New Testament, where the Com ing One is seen com ing forth to the rescue of the peopl e \"riding upon a white horse.\" In the Occident we have for long thought in te rms of the \"Lamb, slain from the founda tions of the world,\" and in this statement lies a profound astrologi cal truth. It refers to that great round of the zodi ac (a period of appr oxi mately 25,000 years) in which the sun passes through all the twelve signs of the zodi ac. The period to which reference is made started in the sign Aries, the Ram. The Orient, how ever, harks still further back, to a much earlier period and to a still more ancient date, remote in the night of time, when the greater world cycle sta rted in the sign Sagittarius, the Archer. The sym bol of this is som etimes (tow ards the latter part of the cycle) depicted as an archer, riding on a horse and (in the early part of the cycle) as a centaur, half man and half hor se. Both refer to an emerging revelation of the cons cious ness of Deity as revealed through som e Great Divine Expr ession, through som e manifesting Son of God. The poi nt to bear in mind is that this Rider on the white horse is no extra - planetary Entity or Life, but is essentially One lik e unt o our selves — hum an and animal com bined as are we all, but fused with divinity and inspired from on high, informed by som e cosmic and divine Principle, as Christ was informed with the Love of God and carried the revelation of love to man. The Rider is o ne of our hum anity Who has reached a predestined goa l and Who — for very love and unde rstandi ng of man — has remained for ages in the secret place of revelation (as it is esoterically called), waiting unt il His hour com es around again and He can then issue for th to lead His peopl e to trium pha nt victory. This com ing One is on the Path of a world Saviour just as the more pot ent Lives, the Lords of Liberation, are on the Path of world Service. They issue forth via that highe st spiritual centre wherein the Will of God is held in solution or custody, for gradua l release or revelation as hum anity can arrive at the needed poi nt of unde rstandi ng respons e and receptivity. Though They can be reached relatively easily, it must be through the massed intent of the many focussed minds . The Rider on the white hor se can be reached by the individua l aspirant if he can raise his cons cious ness adequa tely high. This Rider com es forth (from the centre wherein the Love of God is held for distribut ion) as the hum an centre (w hich we call hum anity) becom es attune d to true love and"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST can identify itself with all men, respondi ng freely and without any inhi bition to divine Love — which is wisdom , unde rstandi ng, and effective, skilful activity. When this invoc ation is right ly used and voiced by an adequa te num ber of peopl e, thos e who can in som e measure employ the enlight ened will may succeed in reaching the Lords of Liberation and produc e, as a result, a phe nom enal intervention of som e kind. Thos e who work more emotiona lly will reach the Rider from the secret place and may bring Him forth to save and lead the masses of peopl e. Are there enough focussed minds and intense attentive hearts to reach the two centres where wait Thos e Who can aid at this time? That is the que stion. It will ha ppe n when the three centres — hum anity, the spiritual Hierarchy of the planet, and the \"place where the will of God lies hidde n\" (called in the ancient scriptures Shamballa) — are aligne d and en rappor t with each other. There will then be established a direct relation between all three, and a direct channe l for the inflow of liberating force. This has happe ned onl y onc e before in the history of the race. Owing to the fact that manki nd is so weakened by pain, strain and suffering, the proba bility is that it wil l not be deemed wise for the Lords of Liberation directly to cont act hum anity. They will more proba bly do three things : 1. Stand behind and strengt hen the Rider on the white hor se as He responds to the demand of the peopl e everyw here, pour ing through Him that dyn amic energy which embodi es the first divine aspect, the will aspect, the pow er expr ession. Thus They will enable Him to carry out the will of God in such a manne r that hum anity can grasp what is being don e. Manki nd will then see the Love which animates the Will and Pow er of God. The true signi ficance of liberty will then be revealed. It is not yet unde rstood. 2. Pour Their strengt hening will - to - good into the New Group of World Servers in all lands , so that there may be pot ent, simultaneo us action in line with the pur pos es of the Rider from the secret place. 3. Stimulate and integrate into the minds of certain adva nced disciples a num ber of new ideals which must gove rn the liberating process and find expr ession in the New Age. This was do ne in a small way at the time of the French Revol ution when the three major conc epts of freedom were expr essed in the three words, Liberty, Equa lity, Fraternity, and were intellectually presented to the race. These have now been tempor arily relinqui shed, a nd this in itself cons titutes an important sym bol ic happe ning. It had to occur, because these three words stood for no factual truth but simply for a hope and for an academic conc ept; the events of the last few mont hs reduc ed them to a farce. So they were deliberately withdr awn in order to enha nce their impor tance, and will later be restored and will then assum e a new and pot ent signi ficance in the minds of all men. They are the three words which must gove rn the New Age. Certain racial interpretations of i deals will also have to disappe ar in order to be succeeded by new and better one s. This appl ies even to man's unde rstandi ng of the three words which we have been cons idering. \"Liberty,\" as the Lords of Liberation may endor se it, is in reality the recogni ti on of right hum an relations , freely adjusted, willingl y unde rtaken and motivated by a sense of respons ibility which will act as a protective wall; this will take place, not through coercive measures, but through correct interpretation and qui ck appr eciatio n by the masses, who are apt to confound licence (persona lity freedom to do as the low er nature choos es) and liberty of soul and cons cience. Yet this liberty is the easiest aspect of the divine will for hum anity to grasp. It is in reality the fi rst revelation given to man of the nature of the Will of God and of the qua lity of Shamballa. \"Equa lity\" is that peculiar unde rstandi ng"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST which the Com ing One will reveal and which is based on a right sense of propo rtion, correct Self - respect, and unde rstand ing of the spiritual, yet natural, laws of Rebirth and of Cause and Effect, and which will be founde d in future centuries on the recogni tion of the age of a soul 's expe rience and gained developm ent, and not at all on the loud empha tic affirmation that \"all men are equa l.\" \"Fraternity\" is som ething that humanity itself will cont ribut e as an expr ession of the third aspect of divinity, basing it on right cont act and right reaction to cont act. Thus there will be develope d gradua lly the true life - theme of hum ani ty, which is brotherhood, founde d on divine origin (equa lity) and leading to a free and true expr ession of divinity (liberty). Perhaps with these thought s in mind, this first stanza of the new Invoc ation will assum e more impor tance, and you will then be a ble intelligently to invoke Thos e Who can inspire to right action, thus bringi ng succour , and call forth the One Who can save the situation through right leadership. On what level of cons cious ness He will ride, it is not for us to say. It is pos sible that He will not appe ar upon the phys ical plane at all. Who can say? But the sound of His com ing will be know n and, speaking sym bol ically, the thunde r of His hor se's hoof s will be heard. The influence which He will wield and the energy which He will transmit f rom the Lords of Liberation will inevitably be potently felt, evoki ng an immediate hum an respons e. This will prove an incont rove rtible fact. That His radiation will reach forth and surround His disciples, struggl ing in the conf lict with evil, is also certa in and sure. This will enable them to make the supr eme effort which will win the battle for hum anity. That He will com e in \"the air\" is a well - know n prophe cy from the New Testament, thus enabling \"every eye to see Him.\" These words have more meaning toda y than when written nearly two thous and years ago, for this world conf lict is out standi ngl y an aerial one . Stude nts and thos e using this Invoc ation would be wise to bear this in mind or they may fail to see and recogni se the Deliverer when He com e s — a thing which has happe ned before. We com e now to the second stanza, with its direct references to hum an attitude s and recogni tions . For decades, I, as one of the spiritual teachers, along with many others, have sought to awaken all to the fact of Light — light in the world, light com ing from the plane of desire (called the astral plane qui te often), light illum ining science and hum an know ledge , the light of the soul , produc ing in due time the light in the head. You have been carefully taught that the righ t use of the mind in meditation and reflection will lead to the correct relation of soul and persona lity, and that when this has taken place, the light of the soul igni tes or fosters the light in the head and the man reaches the stage of illum ination. The reference in this second stanza is to the more extende d idea of the relation of humanity (the kingdom of men) to the spiritual Hierarchy (the kingdom of God). When these two are more closely aligne d and related, light will break out among the sons of men a s a whol e, just as light breaks out in the indi vidua l aspirant. This much - to - be - desired event can be brought about by the spiritually minde d peopl e in the world, by the men and wom en of goo dw ill, and by the world disciples, standi ng with \"massed intent.\" T his means with a uni form, uni ted focus — a thing as yet rarely seen and much needed at this time. So many peopl e are animated by wishful thinki ng, by hopi ng and by prayer; so few are motivated by intention . Intention here is that unb reakable, immova ble deter mination that a situation shall be handl ed, that what is needed in order to release manki nd assuredly must appe ar, for such is the mental intention of the focussed minds of many. I woul d ask you to give much thought to these words \"massed intent\" and to di fferentiate with care between intention and desire. When hum anity has fulfilled the condi tions through a focussed mental demand, based on correctly formulated mass intent, then will com e the affirmation from the spiritual Forces. Let the fiat o f the Lord go forth: the end of woe has com e."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST The endi ng of the present evil situation is, therefore, a coope rative measure; and here, in this conne ction, we have the appe arance of the Lord of Civilisation Who voi ces and engi neers upon the phys ical plane the fiat of the Lord of Liberation and of the Rider from the secret place. He aids and makes pos sible, ow ing to His cont rol, the precipitating upon the Earth and in the arena of com bat, of the pow er generated by the Lords of Liberation, expr essed by the Co ming One and focussed through Him as the hierarchical Representative in Europe . The work of the Master R. has always been recogni sed as of a peculiar nature and as conc erned with the probl ems of civilisation, just as the work of the Christ, the Master of a ll the Masters, is conc erned with the spiritual developm ent of hum anity, and the work of the Manu is occupi ed with the science of divine gove rnm ent, with pol itics and law. Thus the incom ing focussed energy, called forth in respons e to right invoc ation, is steppe d dow n still nearer to hum anity, and the masses can then respond to the new impul ses. You have, therefore: 1. The Lords of Liberation, reached by the adva nced spiritual thinke rs of the world whos e minds are right ly focussed. 2. The Rider on the whit e hor se or from the secret place, reached by thos e whos e hearts are right ly touc hed. 3. The Lord of Civilisation, the Master R., reached by all who, with the first two groups , can stand with \"massed intent.\" On the uni ted work of these Three, if hum anity can succeed in calling Them forth, will com e the alignm ent and the correct relation of three great spiritual centres of the planet, a thing which has never occurred before. Then: 1. The Lords of Liberation will receive and transmit to the Hier archy energy from the centre where God' s Will is know n and furthered . 2. The Rider will receive this energy and take such action as will express it, plus the motivating energy from the centre where God' s Love is expressed. 3. The Lord of Civilisation wil l stimulate and prepare the centre which we call hum anity for right reception of this re - vitalising, stimulating and releasing force. Thus Shamballa, the Hierarchy and Hum anity will stand cons cious ly related and dyna mically in touc h with each other. The W ill of God, the Love of God and the Intelligence of God will thus fuse and blend on Earth and in relation to hum an probl ems. Condi tions will cons eque ntly be brough t about and energies will be set in motion which will end the rule of evil and bring war to a n end through the victory of the Forces of Light , recogni sed and aided by Hum anity. This synt hesis of the three energies, evoke d throug h invoc ation and the respons e of certain divine Potencies, is esoterically given the name of \"the saving Force.\" Of its exact nature and intende d effects we know practically not hing. It has never before appe ared in action on the phys ical plane, though it has been for som e time active upon the mental plane. Though it is a blend of the energies of the three centres referred t o above , it is primarily the energy of the divine Will, which will be its out standi ng characteristic. One hint here I will give. Just as the externalisation of the materialistic lodge of seven men, to which I made reference above , has made its appe arance a nd must be dealt with prior to the future externalisation of the lodge of spiritual Lives (the appe arance of the kingdom of God on Earth)"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST which we call the planetary Hierarchy, so the will - to - pow er of the forces of aggression has appe ared on Earth and soug ht to gain cont rol ove r hum anity. Note that aim. This will - to - pow er can onl y be dissipated when the highe st aspect of the same energy is given free rein among the sons of men. The divine and spiritual Will, carried on the impul se of selfless lov e, can and must be evoke d for the destruction of the selfish and wicked will - to - pow er, rampant now on earth unde r the direction of the focussed seven in Germany. The \"saving force\" must, therefore, be spread abroad. For long ages men have prayed in the wo rds of St. Paul: \"Let the love of God be shed abroad in our hearts. \" Toda y the need is for the spread of the \"saving force\" to take hol d of our minds and to control from that directing centre, for it embodi es the needed salvation at this time. It will take the uni ted efforts of all the three focal points of divine expr ession on our planet to make this pos sible, but it can be done . In the final stanzas (which we need not take phrase by phr ase, as their signi ficance is sufficiently clear) we have plainly put before us the methods whereby hum anity can play its part and do its share in aiding all thos e who are coope rating with the Forces of Light to bring this planetary war to an end. Look for a mom ent at the four words which embod y the thought of what can be done by men to bring to fruition the mission of the Com ing One, the Rider from the secret place. We are told that Light and Love and Pow er and Death must be invoke d to fulfil the pur pos e of the Com ing One . Here we com e right dow n to the practical theme of man's indi vidual part in the processes of liberation. Here we are conc erned with that which — within hum anity itself — needs evoc ation in order to produc e right coope ration, right preparation and right unde rstandi ng. Four pot encies within the soul of man are a vailable for his indi vidua l use in helping the Forces of Light — potencies he shares with all men to a greater or less degree, according to the expressive pow er of the soul . They are pot encies which are not inna te in the low er self, but only in the highe r. T he low er self reflects onl y distorted forms of the higher divine energies. This is a poi nt to be carefully not ed. Of Light and Love I can say but little to you. To esoteric stude nts, these words are so familiar as to be som ewhat meaningl ess, and onl y thos e who can walk in the light , and whos e major reaction is love of hum anity, will com prehend the signi ficance and the inter - relation of these four words. Light , with which to see the new vision, is needed by all. This will proba bly not be an inten sification of any earlier vision, no matter how appa rently spiritual, but som ething so entirely new that you will need all the light that is in you , and a trained insight , if you are to recogni se it when cont acted. Love , which is not emotion or sentiment, and which is not related to feeling (which is a distortion of true love ), but is the fixed determination to do what is best for the whol e of hum anity, or for the group (if the larger conc ept is not pos sible to you) , and to do this at any persona l cost and by means of the uttermost sacrifice. Only thos e who truly love their fellow men can see the issues clear and can grasp the inevitability of the things which must be done to end the present rule of terror and so usher in the new rule of peace. Peace is not the goa l for our race or time, no matter what many men think. This is a cycle of steadily grow ing activity, with the aim in view of establishing right hum an relations , intelligently carried forward. Such activity and intense change is not cons ona nt with wh at is usually unde rstood as peace. Peace has relation to the emotiona l side of life and was the goa l in Atlantean days, where peace was a great spiritual issue. But peace and the love of peace can be a deadening sopor ific, and are so at this time. It is us ually selfish in purpose, and peopl e long for peace because they want to be happy. Happi ness and peace will com e when there are right hum an relations . Peace and war are not a true pair of oppos ites. Peace and change , peace and move ment, are the real one s. War is but an aspect"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST of change , and has its root s deep in matter. The peace usually desired and discussed conc erns material peace, and in every case is related to the persona lity, whether it is the indi vidua l persona lity or that of hum anity as a whol e. The refore I deal not with peace, but am conc erned with love , which oft disturbs the equi librium of matter and material circum stance, and can cons eque ntly work against so - called peace. Pow er is som ething which has ever been of interest, dow n the ag es, to adva nced hum anity and to thos e men who coul d respond to the will aspect through their mental unfoldm ent. It is toda y becom ing of interest to the masses and to the more mediocre types of men, and is hence oft misused and turned to selfish pur pos es. T he pow er here to be evoke d out of the hum an soul , in this hou r of need, is the ability to know the Plan and to work for its furtherance, thus coope rating with thos e forces which are ende avour ing to re - establish order on Earth and to end the cycle of aggr es sive wickedne ss in which toda y we find our selves. The que stion arises here whether the cycle is susceptible to interference and whether it must not perforce run its appoi nted course. I woul d remind you that the law of cycles is the law gove rning the appe a ring and the disappe aring of great and active energies which pass in and out of manifestation, fulfilling the purpos es of Deity and yet limited and handi cappe d by the qua lity of the forms upon which they make their impact. If any intervention is pos sible a nd takes place, it will be an \"intervention in time.\" Such an intervention is hinted at in the sacred scriptures, such as the New Testament, where it is foretold that \"for the sake of the elect, the time shall be shor tened.\" The real meaning of this (which is not appa rent in the rather inadequa te translation which we have) is \" becaus e of the elect or because of thos e who know and who take right action, the progress of evil can be arrested.\" This is encour aging, and I com mend the thought to you r attention. T here is a pow er which such \"elect\" can wield — unde rstandi ng its nature, preparatory and selfless. And Death — to what doe s this refer? Not to the death of the body or form, for that is relatively uni mpor tant; but to the \"pow er to relinqui sh,\" which becom es i n time the characteristic of the pledge d disciple. The new era is com ing; the new ideals, the new civilisation, the new mode s of life, of educ ation, of religious presentation and of gove rnment are slow ly precipitating and naught can stop them. T hey can, how ever, be delayed by the reactiona ry type s of peopl e, by the ultra - cons ervative and closed minds , and by thos e who cling with adamantine determination to their belove d theories, their dreams and their visions , their interpretations and their pec uliar and oft narrow unde rstandi ng of the presented ideals. They are the one s who can and do hol d back the hour of liberation. A spiritual fluidity, a willingne ss to let all preconc eived ideas and ideals go, as well as all belove d tende ncies, cultivated ha bits of thought and every determined effort to make the world conform to a pattern which seems to the indi vidua l the best because, to him, the most enticing — these must all be brough t unde r the pow er of death. They can be relinqui shed with safety and securi ty and no fear of results, if the motive of the life is a real and lasting love of hum anity. Love , true spiritual love as the soul know s it, can ever be trusted with pow er and oppor tunity and will never betray that trust. It will bring all things into line with soul vision.

Only when hum anity offers all that it has to give to the service of the sad, the suffering, and the oppr essed, and will work actively and intelligently to bring about release, can that full coope ration be established between the inne r and the out er pot encies which is so deplorably needed at this time. Unless, for instance , thos e who can use this Invoc ation parallel its voi ced expr ession with som e form of definite phys ical plane service, and so aid cons tructively the Forces of Light, their efforts will prove negligible. It is hum anity alone which can precipitate the new incom ing energies from the Lords of Liberation and make pos sible Their activity on Earth. It is hum anity alone which can ope n the doo r on to the phys ical plane for the Rider from the secret place. The stupe ndous inne r Potencies can reach certain le vels of hum an activity and cont act, such as the mental plane, but their further progr ess dow nw ard into out er expr ession, pow er and manifestation, is depende nt upon the pot ent, magne tic, indr aw ing pow er of man himself. The thought lying behind the words Co nstruct a great defendi ng wall might be simply expr essed in the words: Thus far and no further. The limit of effectiveness of the evil expr ession and of the pow er of the aggr essors has been reached if the disciples and the men of goodw ill actually now play their prope r part. Symbol ically, they can put up an impregna ble wall of spiritual light which will utterly conf ound the enemy of hum anity. It will be a wall of energy — vibrating, protective, and at the same time of such pow er that it can repul se thos e who seek to pass in their pur suit of evil and wicked obj ectives. I speak in sym bol s but my meaning will be clear. One poi nt you need to grasp more clearly, and it is bot h an encour agement and a poi nt difficult of belief. If the sons of men who are coope rating with the Forces of Light at this time stand with steadfastness, and if the \"massed intent\" of the men of goodw ill is brought dow n from the mental plane (where most goodw ill, desire, prayer and invoc ation becom es \"frozen\") and is carried away from its easy focus in the wish life of the aspirant, goodw ill becom es active in expr ession and in tangi ble deed upon the phys ical plane, so that the work done through the means of invoc ation and prayer, plus the needed fight ing for the right , is done by thos e who can truly coor dinate and integrate on all three levels and thus func tion as a whol e. This will mean the finish of the dominance of matter for all time. Such a desirable condi tion may com e very slow ly, from the standpoi nt of man's myop ic vision, and may even not becom e appa rent in its full signi ficance to you in this life; nevertheless the victory will have been gained. Matter and materialistic interests will no longe r rule the com ing generation as they have ruled the last two. When the forces of aggr ession, of greed and cruelty are driven back, it will mean the conque st of selfish desire by uns elfish love and sacrifice. This is the reward of thos e with whom we work, if reward is desired. This achieved situation will then bring into closer relation hum anity and the spiritual Hierarchy; they will be en rappor t in a manne r new in history. The defeat of the oppr essing nations and the liberation of the oppr essed will be onl y the out er and visible sign of an inne r and spiritual event — one for which all enligh tened people are working. It will — after a period of adjustment, which will necessarily bring its ow n peculiar difficulties — usher in the new world, with all that is entailed in that phr ase. I have placed before you the pos sibility. I woul d reiterate, as I have in the past, that it is hum ani ty which determines its ow n fate .

So the out com e is unpr edictable, though we may see a ce rtain measure of inevitability in future happe nings .

With these thought s upon the new Invoc ation I would leave you to work out these ideas in the recesses of your reflective cons cious ness.

SECTION THREE FORCES BEHIND THE EVOLUTIONARY PROGRESS OF THE RACE THE DOCTRINE OF AVATARS May 1941 As we enter the mom entous mont h of May this year, I have asked myself if there is any way in which I can arous e the world aspirants and my disciples to a truer appreciation of the immanent signi ficance of the presented oppor tuni ty, and also if there is any way in which I can simplify and make more real to y ou the Doctrine of the Com ing One — linke d as it is to the teaching of every great religion. In all of them, the idea of a subj ective, spiritual Order, conc erned with the developi ng welfare of hum anity, is to be found. This is an age of culminations . Such c ulminations appe ar toda y in the field of religion as well as in the field of science and pol itics. All the great lines of hum an appr oach to reality and to truth are passing out of the realm of the tangi ble and exot eric, into that of the intangi ble and esot eric. Science is rapidly becom ing the science of the uns een and of the unp rova ble; religion has emerged from the realm of the mystical into the clearer atmosphe re of the occult, and must now empha sise the reality of the uns een as the efficient cause of the seen; pol itics and gove rnments are enga ged with processes of thought and ideologi es. What then is the true inne r structure of reality which will provi de the needed strengt h for hum anity at this time, thus sufficing to satisfy man's demand for truth and p rove adequa te to answer his ceaseless yet intelligent que stions ? I woul d assert here that the great and satisfying reply to all hum an que stioni ng and hum an need is to be found in the doc trine of Avatars, and in the cont inuity of divine Revelati ons . This is the persistent belief — ineradicable and una lterable — that (at major mom ents of world need) God reveals Himself through Appe arances, through a Com ing One. This doc trine is found in all the basic world religions , in every time and age; it appe ars in the doc trine of the Avatars of the Hindu faith, in the teaching of the return of Maitreya Buddha or the Kalki Avatar, in the belief in the Western world in the return of Christ and His Adve nt or second Com ing, and in the prophesied issuing forth of the divine Adve nturer of the Moslem world. All this is tied up with the undyi ng belief of manki nd in the lovi ng Heart of God, Who"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST ever meets man's need. The witness of history is that always the appe arance of man's necessity has been met with a divine Revelati on. The reason for this faith, inna te in the hum an heart, is to be found in the fact of the nature of Deity itself. The Christian statement that \"God is Love \" is founde d on that deepest, recogni sed, spiritual fact . The expr ession of this divine characteri stic can be sum med up in the words from The Voice of the Silence: \"Com passion is no attribut e. It is the Law of Law s — eternal Harmony, Alaya's Self; a shor eless, uni versal essence, the light of everlasting right and fitness of things , the law of love etern al.\" To this everlasting Com passion the cyclic appe arance of the Sun Gods of the ancient myths, the World Saviour s and the Avatars bear witness and are the gua rantee. The Wesak Festival At the time of this Wesak Festival, I woul d call your attention to the fact that the annua l return of the Buddha to bless His peopl e everyw here and to convey the message of wisdom , light and love to hum anity — com ing as He doe s from the very Heart of Deity Itself — is the out er evidence and gua rantee of inne r divi ne gui dance and revelation in this present world cycle of 2500 years. Year by year He returns. For a brief minut e He reminds us that God exists and ever love s; that He is not unm indf ul of His peopl e; that the heart of the uni verse is una lterable com passion , and that man is not alone . To bring this recogni tion about and to make this appe arance pos sible, a living Triangl e of Energy is created and focussed through three great spiritual Indi vidua ls, Who evoke recogni tion bot h in the East and in the West. They a re know n to believers of every faith and all nationa lities. These Three are: 1. The Lord of the World, the Ancient of Days, Sanat Kum ara, the planetary Logos , Melchizedek, He to Whom Christ referred when He said, \"I and My Father are One.\" 2. The Buddha , the Illum ined One, the Revealer of the light and the wisdom which com e to us from sour ces far greater than our planetary Life, a Messenge r of the Gods . 3. The Christ, the Son of the Father, the World Saviour , the Redeemer. He Who has remained with us and Who is gathering His sheep into His fold, the Lord of Love . In these Three, Whos e nature is radiant love and light , hum anity can grasp in som e measure the nature of divinity. They are greater than is know n or realised; hum an intelligence and aspiration c an onl y sense Their essential nature; Their spiritual potency has to be steppe d dow n if manki nd is to bear the pressure of the impact of the energy They wield and seek to transmit. It is this steppi ng dow n process which takes place at the time of the May F ull Moon, and it is brought to a \"focus of transmission\" by the massed intent of the Hierarchy and the massed demand of the world aspirants and disciples — itself drawn forth by the massed need of the peopl e of all lands . Here, my brothers, is a simple statement of the facts which must be grasped by all of you who seek to participate intelligently in the Wesak Festival and who are anxi ous to act as transmitters of the spiritual energy which will, at that time, be pou red out to suffering humanity. This Wesak Festival in 1941 can prove to be a \"Change r of Condi tions\" and a major turning poi nt in the life of manki nd if every"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST spiritually minde d person can bring himself to the needed poi nt of selflessness, disciplined pur ity and resultant receptivity. There are certain funda mental truths which lie behind all revealed religions . They are essential to the spiritual grow th and the progr essive realisations of divinity by man. All else found unde r the term \"doc trine\" and allied phr ased are but expa nsions of these funda mentals, expl anatory in nature, expr essive of hum an interpretations , and formulations of evol utiona ry recogni tions . These are mainly addi tions and are in the nature of adornm ent, speculation and prediction; they are cons tantly subj ect to change , to rejection or developm ent as man's intellect and spiritual perception unf olds; they are not basic or una lterable. It is the una lterable truths which must be discove red and recogni sed as the new world religion takes form on Earth and condi tions hum an tho ught and cons cious ness in the com ing New Age. The Basic Truths To Date These basic truths never change because they are related to the nature of Deity Itself and have becom e appa rent to manki nd through revelation, as evol ution has proceeded and man has develope d the needed perceptive faculties and the requi red persistence of search, plus the unfolding of the inne r light of the soul . These truths, inhe rent in the divine nature, reveal the soul of God. They are: 1. The Law of Com pas sion . This is the truth of right relations hip, of lovi ng unde rstandi ng, of actively expr essed Love . It is the founda tion of brotherhood and the expr ession of the inne r uni ty. 2. The Fact of God . This is the truth that Being is God Immanent and God Transcende nt; it in vol ves the recogni tion of the great Whol e and the related part; it is the know ledge of divinity, ascertained throug h right relations hip and identity of origin. It is the revelation of the life of God, pervading all that is (God Immanent), and of that same life, provi ding that still greater cosmic relation (God Transcende nt) which is the final gua rantee of all progress and of progr essive revelation. `Having pervaded this whol e uni verse with a fragm ent of Myself, I remain' is the challenge of Deity and the et ernal hope of hum anity. This is the answer of Life Itself to the demands of hum anity, to the enqui ries of science and to the whol e world probl em. God is here, present among us and in all forms of expr ession; He include s, pervades and remains beyond. He is greater than all appe arance. He reveals Himself progr essively and cyclically as man gets ready for further know ledge . 3. The Cont inui ty of Revelation . Ever dow n the ages and at each hum an crisis, always in the hou rs of necessity, at the foundi ng of a new race, or in the awakening of a prepared hum anity to a new and wider vision, the Heart of God — impelled by the law of com passion — sends forth a Teacher, a World Saviour , an Illum inator, an Avatar. He gives the message which will heal, which will indi cate the next step to be taken by the race, which will illum ine a dark world probl em and give to man an expr ession of a hitherto unrealised aspect of divinity. Upon this fact of the cont inui ty of revelation and upon the seque nce of this progr essive manifestation of the divine nature is based the doc trine of Avatars, of divine Messenge rs, divine Appe arances, and inspired Prophe ts. To all these history unm istakably testifies. 4. The Inevitabl e Respons e of Hum ani ty . I have expressed in these simple words the instincti ve spiritual reaction of man and of the undyi ng hum an spirit to the three above founda tiona l truths. This divine spirit in hum anity must ever, and most surely doe s, respond to the divine Appe arance. The witness to"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST this is sure and prove d. There is that in manki nd which is akin to God and which recogni ses its ow n when it appe ars. Such is the uns hakable reality in the hum an heart, and recogni tion is the inevitable reward and result of revelation. 5. Progr ess. The reaction of the indi vidua l man and of the masses of men to the cont inui ty of revelation — historically prove d — cannot be denied. It is the basic fact of religion. The type s of that revelation may vary but each new revelation — given in respons e to hum an need and demand — has ever led hum anity onw ard tow ards a steadily bright ening goa l and a greater glory. The revelation may com e on varying levels of the human cons cious ness. It may be the revelation of new lands to conque r, terrestrial or mental. Som e person poi nted the way. It may be the recogni ti on of new laws and facts in nature, scientifically grasped and used; it may be the respons e of intelligent man to increased know ledge , produc ing a new type of civilisation. Som e liberated spirit poi nted the way. It may be the respons e of the hum an heart to the Heart of God, leading to the mystical beatitude , and to the recogni tion of spiritual Being. It may be the reaction of man to som e new teaching, som e further unf oldm ent, resulting in a new and enriched religious appr oach to the centre of life. Som e Mes senge r poi nted the way. But always it has meant progr ess, a movi ng forward, a rejection of som e existing limitation, a repudi ating of the unde sirable and the evil. Always it invol ves the recogni tion of the pos sible, the ideal and the divine. 6. Trans cende nce. This means the inna te capacity to pass beyond so - called natural law. This surmount ing of limitation is ever taking place and this process of transcende nce will call forth increasing recogni tion. It marks the next major pha se in the manifestation of di vinity in man; it signi fies dom ination ove r phys ical law and hum anity's imminent trium ph ove r the forces which have for so long held him to earth. Of this transcende nce the present mastery ove r the air is the sym bol . Man is rapidly mastering the four eleme nts. He cultivates the earth; he rides the waters; he cont rols the electrical fires of the planet, and he flies trium pha nt through the air. The que stion now emerges: What, my brothers, next? Anot her transcende nce lies ahead. It is one of the thi ngs which the com ing Avatar will reveal. With the lesser leaders, whom the hum an spirit evoke s to its assistance, I shall not deal. I seek to unfold som ewhat the Doctrine of Divine Messenge rs, of Avatars. From whence com e They? What is Their nature? Who a re They and what is Their relation to hum anity, to the Hierarchy and to still greater groups of Lives? These are que stions which nor mally arise and need clear answering. An Avatar is a Being Who — having first develope d His Own nature, hum an and divine, and then transcende d it — is capable of reflecting som e cosmic Principle or divine qua lity and energy which will produc e the desired effect upon hum anity, evoki ng a reaction, produc ing a needed stimulation and, as it is esoterically called, `leading to the rend ing of a veil and the permeation of light .' This energy may be generated within the human family and focussed in a respons ive Messenge r; it may be generated within the planet itself and produc e a planetary Avatar; it may be the expr ession of the life impul se and energy of the solar system, or of sour ces out side the solar system and therefore cosmic. But always it is focussed through a manifesting Entity, is called forth by a demand or massed appe al, and evoke s respons e and cons eque nt change s in the life act ivity, the culture and the civilisation of manki nd. The respons e or reaction of hum anity to the divine Messenge r establishes in due time the recogni tion of som ething transcende nt, som ething to be desired and striven for, som ething which indi cates a vision which is first a pos sibility and later an achievement. This is the historically prove n process and testifies eventually to a fact . This new fact, when adde d to the facts established by other and earlier Avatars,"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST enriches the spiritual cont ent of the hum an cons cious ness, enha nces the spiritual life of the race, and stimulates man to move a step forward into the world of reality and out of the world of illusion. Each revelation brings him nearer to the world of causes. At the present time, the Av atars most easily recogn ised and know n are the Buddha and the Christ, because Their messages are familiar to all and the fruits of Their lives and words have condi tione d the thinki ng and the civilisations of bot h hemisphe res; because They are divine - hum an Avatars and represent som ething which hum anity can more easily unde rstand; because They are of like nature to manki nd, \"flesh of our flesh and spirit of our spirit.\" They therefore mean more to us than any other Divine Emergence. They are know n, love d and follow ed by count less millions . I woul d ask you to ponde r on the pot ency of the nuc leus of force which They have set up. The establishing of a nuc leus of energy, spiritually pos itive, is the cons tant task of an Avatar. He focusses or anchor s a dyna mic trut h, a pot ent thought form or a vortex of attractive energy in the three worlds of human living. Then, as the centuries pass, that truth and the effect of Their lives and words begin steadily to condi tion hum an thinki ng; the established thought form acts incre asingl y as a transmitter of divine energy as it expr esses a divine idea, and this in time produc es a civilisation, with its accom panyi ng culture, religions , pol icies, gove rnm ents and educ ationa l processes. Thus is history made. History is but the record of man's cyclic reaction to som e inflow ing divine energy, to som e Avatar or som e inspired Leader. Divine Intervention In cons idering the subj ect of Avatars I woul d like to poi nt out that (from the standpoi nt of manki nd at his present poi nt in evol ution) A vatars are of two kinds , as might be expe cted when the cons cious ness of hum anity is subj ect to the cont rol of the pairs of oppos ites. These two are: 1. Thos e Avatars Who are the embodi ment of the Ange l of the Presence, whether that Presence is the soul in man, the planetary Logos , som e extra - planetary Entity, som e Cosmic Being, or an Expr ession of Cosmic Good. 2. Thos e Avatars who are embodi ments of the Dweller on the Threshol d, whether that Dweller is the hum an Dweller on the Threshol d, plane tary Forces of Materialism, or som e Aspect of Cosmic Evil. Let me attempt to make this analogy a little clearer. Just as in the case of indi vidua l man there com es a poi nt in his life expe rience when the Ange l of the Presence is sensed, know n, seen and rec ogni sed as the revealer of divinity, so in the history of the race of men, the same great illum ination may com e. Revelation conf ront s the aspirant. Revelation conf ront s hum anity. God is know n within the human heart. God is know n by manki nd. This recogni tio n of divinity in its varying aspects is naturally a progr essive one — each stage and each life bringi ng its ow n revelation of the beauty of divinity and the glory of light more truly and clearly before the disciple. Similarly, there com e cycles wherein the D weller on the Threshol d appe ars and confront s the aspirant, challengi ng his pur pos e and progress and blocking the door which leads to expa nde d life and liberation. The Dweller challenge s the freedom of the hum an soul . So it is also in the life of a nation, a race, and humanity as a whol e. The Ange l of the Presence indi cates divine pos sibility, reveals to the attentive disciple the next step tow ards liberation which must be made, and throw s light upon the immediate stage of the Path to Light which must be t rodde n. So doe s the Avatar Who reveals the Light ed Way to hum anity. "},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST The Dweller on the Threshol d sum marises in itself the evil tende ncies, the accum ulated limitations and the sum total of the selfish habits and desires which are characteristic of the mate rial nature of the disciple. The Ange l of the Presence indi cates the future pos sibility and the divine nature. So doe s the Avatar. The Dweller on the Threshol d indi cates the pas t with its limitations and evil habits. So do those Avatars Who from time to time appe ar as the embodi ments of evil and of the low er nature of manki nd. And, my brother, They do appe ar from age to age. Som e cycles in a disciple's life present one aspect of a \"conf ront ation\" and som e anot her. In one life he may be entirely occupi ed with fight ing the Dweller on the Threshol d or with orienting himself to the Ange l of the Presence and permitting the divine condi tioni ng energy to flow into him; he may be succum bing to the influence of the dread sum total of his evil and material desires or he may be drawing gradua lly nearer to the Ange l. But — and this is the poi nt of impor tance — it is he himself who evokes one or other of these mani festations . So it is with hum anity. The call of hum anity's soul , or of hum anity's material nature, mu st evoke respons e, and thus an Avatar can manifest. It is the magne tic appe al or the massed intent of the disciple or of humanity which produc es the manifestation. In other lives, the disciple may simply swing between the two pol es of his being, with no co nscious effort, no direct conf ront ation and no clear unde rstandi ng of life pur pos e. So doe s hum anity. Eventually, how ever, there com es a life wherein the disciple is conf ront ed by bot h the Dweller and the Ange l simultaneous ly and the major conf lict of his expe rience takes place. So it is toda y in the world. The spiritual and the material are in conf lict, and hum anity itself is the battleground . Again, a corresponde nce to the Doctrine of Avatars can be seen in the disciple's indi vidua l life. When he has ac hieved right desire and has made a true effort tow ards correct orientation, then — when the conf lict between good and evil is at its height — there com es a mom ent when he demands more light , more pow er, more unde rstandi ng, and liberation to take his next forwa rd step. When he can make this demand with firm intent and can stand steady and una fraid, respons e will inevitably com e from the very Presence Itself. A manifestation of light and love and pow er will stream forth. Recogni tion of need has then evoke d respon se. The conflict ceases; the Dweller departs to his ow n place; the Path ahead lies clear; the disciple can move forward with assurance, and a better life dawns for him. So it is for hum anity. A demand rises to the very gates of Heaven; the mass ed intent of hum anity is that evil must end and a better and truer life becom e possible. At the mom ent of greatest tension and of difficulty the demand goe s forth. Respons e com es. The Avatar appe ars and light pour s in, making the way clear. New hope awaken s and fresh determinations are made. Strengt h to establish right relations hips streams through the body of hum anity, and manki nd emerges into a more spacious life, condi tione d by truer values. A fusion becom es pos sible between the out er world of daily livi ng and the inne r world of spiritual realities. A fresh influx of love and light is pos sible. Toda y the mom ent of adequa te tension in the life of hum anity has been reached. The Ange l of the Presence and the Dweller on the Threshol d are at grips. Hum anity s tands appa rently at its darkest hou r. But the cry is goi ng forth for aid, for relief, for revelation, for light , and for strengt h to shake off that which is evil. The massed intent of the world aspirants is directed tow ards the world of truer values, tow ar ds better hum an relations , more enlight ened living and a better unde rstandi ng between all men and peopl es. With massed intent they stand, and their ranks are steadily increasing. With an increased focus of the will - to - good, with a clearer appr ehension of f uture pos sibility, with a fixed determination that the world move forward in conf ormity with the divine pattern, and with an urgent cry for help, hum anity stands expe ctant of relief. In every land there is a grow ing recogni tion that when manki nd"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST reaches th e psychol ogi cal poi nt where, hav ing don e all , there is naught to do but stand, then som e Expr ession of a divine determination to intervene will appe ar; there is a grow ing belief that hum an effort tow ards right eous action will be suppl emented by the emergen ce of a divine Force, Person or Event which will bring the conflict to an end. It might here be poi nted out that in similar though som ewhat less pot ent crises in the past, this divine intervention supe rseded hum an effort, but that it is hope d b y Thos e Who are seeking to aid hum anity that such intervention will toda y simply suppl ement hum an effort — a very different thing. Therefore, hum anity everyw here toda y awaits the Com ing One. The Avatar is sensed as being on His way. The second Com ing (accor ding to prophe cy) is imminent, and from the lips of disciples, mystics, aspirants and all enlight ened peopl e in all lands the cry goe s up, \"Let light and love and pow er and death fulfil the purpos e of the Com ing One.\" Thos e words are a demand, a cons ecrati on, a sacrifice, a statement of belief and a challenge to the Avatar Who waits in His High Place unt il the demand is adequa te, and the cry clear enough to warrant His descent and His appe arance. Demand without paralleling action is useless, just as faith without works is dead. It is here that there is a break in the magne tic link which shoul d uni te the Avatar with the demand for His com ing forth. His emergence must be caused by a fivefold chain or thread of energy: the focussed will of the peopl e, the mass ed intent of the world disciples and aspirants, plus their desire, their active participation in the task of clearing the way for Him, and com plete selflessness. Only when hum anity has itself done everything pos sible to adjust that which is wrong and to en d that which is evil, and has carried this effort even to the sacrifice of life itself, can He, the Desire of all nations , appe ar. Toda y this is being attempted. The great event of the appe arance of the Avatar can be made pos sible by a little increased ef fort. The mission of the Buddha at this particular Wesak Festival is to add that new impetus, that fresh illum ination, and that adde d power and fixed pur pos e which will enable manki nd to surmount this crisis. From the side of the spiritual Forces of the pl anet, everything will then have been done to make the appe arance of the Avatar pos sible. From the side of hum anity, I woul d ask you: What will be done ? Between the Sour ce from which all Avatars com e forth and hum anity, stands the Hierarchy of L ove , stands Christ and His disciples, stand the Masters of the Wisdom . They are uni ted, all of Them, in one stupe ndous effort to aid manki nd at this time to surmount the Dweller on the Threshol d and to com e closer to the Ange l. This necessitates som e great er help and this help will be forthcom ing when hum anity and the Hierarchy in one fused and blende d effort stand with massed intent, invoki ng that aid and expe cting it also. The Appe aranc e of Avatars Since the year 1400 (a date to which I referred earlie r) there have been cons tant appe arances of lesser avatars, called forth in respons e to minor crises, to nationa l dilemmas and religious necessity. They have taken the form of thos e men and wom en who have champione d successfully som e truth or som e right cau se, som e hum an right or correct hum an demand. All these peopl e have worked actively upon the phys ical plane and seldom received recogni tion for what they truly were; onl y history, at a later date, laid empha sis upon their achievement. But they change d the current of men's thought s; they poi nted a way to a better life; they pione ered into new territories of hum an achievement.

With these disciples I shall not deal. They embodi ed ideas and made history — not the history of conque st but the history of progr ess. I seek to cons ider with you thos e still greater Appe arances Who com e forth from som e hidde n centre, remote from or near to hum anity, and Who \"release from crisis the sons of men.\" These fall mainly into four relatively minor group s: 1. Racial Avatars . These Appe arances are evoke d by the genius and destiny of a race. The typical man (in qua lity and cons cious ness, not necessarily phys ically) foreshadow s the nature of som e race. Such a man was Abraham Lincoln, com ing forth from the very soul of a peopl e, and introduc ing and transmitting racial qua lity — a qua lity to be worked out later as the race unfolds. Com ing forth correspondi ngl y from the realm of cosmic evil, and respons ible for the focus of materialism upon the planet toda y was Bismarck. Both men came forth within the same one hund red years, thus demons trating the balance in nature and the cons tant interplay of the pairs of oppos ites. They are bot h type s of the most pow erful Avatars which hum anity itself has as yet prod uced. They emerge along the lines of gov ernm ent , of the first ray and in the department of the Manu, and are very sensitive to Shamballa force. Such Avatars freque ntly emerge at the foundi ng of a nation. This is true of both Bismarck and Lincoln. 2. Teach ing Avatars . These Appe arances sound a new not e in the realm of thought and of cons cious ness; they reveal the next needed truth; they pronounc e thos e words and formulate thos e truths which throw light upon the spiritual development of hum anity. Such Avatar s were Plato, the first Patanjali and Sanka racharya; they emerge upon the second ray line of energy, in the department of the Christ and are expr essions of hierarchical force. When I say the department of the Christ, I woul d remind you that the name \"Chris t\" is that of an office — an office that has always had its Head. I do not mention the Christ or the Buddha as among these Avatars because They are Avatars of anot her class and of infinitely greater pot ency. 3. Ray Avatars. These great Beings com e forth at relatively long intervals when a ray is com ing into manifestation. They embody the qua lity and the force of a particular ray. Next century, when the seventh ray has achieved com plete manifestation and the Piscean influence is entirely remove d, the seventh ray Avatar will appe ar. His work will demons trate the law, order and rhyt hm of the creative process as it works out on the phys ical plane, blending spirit and matter. And as this ray is called the Ray of Ceremoni al Order or Ritual, He will be la rgely instrum ental in produc ing thos e condi tions which will permit of the reappe arance upon Earth of the Mysteries of Initiation, of which the Hierarchy is the custodi an. He is necessarily conne cted with the Great White Lodge on Sirius. This fact doe s not , how ever, conc ern us now , for we await the com ing of a still greater Avatar. 4. Trans mitting Avatars . These manifestations of divinity appe ar at thos e great cyclic mom ents of revelation when hum anity needs the expr ession of a new truth or the expa nsion of an old one in order to progr ess still highe r on the evol utiona ry ladde r. These Avatars issue forth in respons e to demand and are not so much conc erned with racial developm ent as They are with the subj ective unf oldm ent of cons cious ness and with the stimula tion of hum anity as a whol e . Of these Avatars the Buddha and the Christ are out standi ng examples. They were not only hum an - divine Avatars, and hence able to link hum anity with the Hierarchy, but They were som ething far greater and more impor tant. They had reached the poi nt where They coul d act as Transmitters of certain cosmic principles which — focussed in Them in an extra - planetary sense — coul d stimulate the deeply hidde n and latent correspondi ng"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST principle in humanity. They transmitted and broug ht som ething from out side the planetary life — from the very Heart of God to the heart of man. The Buddha , because He achieved illum ination, stimulated the light in the world, in hum anity and in all forms. He served the soul of man. The Christ, because of His stupe ndous achievement — along the line of understandi ng — transmitted to hum anity, for the first time in hum an history, an aspect and a potency of the nature of God Himself, the Love principle of the Deity. Prior to the adve nt of the Buddha , light , aspiration, and the r ecogni tion of God Transcende nt had been the flickering expr ession of the hum an attitude to God. Then the Buddha came and demons trated in His Own life the fact of God Immanent as well as God Transcende nt; the idea of God in the uni verse and of God in hum ani ty evol ved. The Selfhood of Deity and the Self in the heart of indi vidua l man became a factor in hum an cons cious ness. It was a relatively new truth to be grasped by hum anity. It had always been know n by disciples and initiates. How ever, unt il C hrist came and lived a life of love and service and gave manki nd the new com mandm ent to love , there had been very little empha sis upon God as Love in any of the world Scriptures. After He appe ared as the Avatar of Love, then God became know n as Love supe rn al, love as the goa l and obj ective of creation, love as the basic principle of relations hips, and love working throughout all manifestation tow ards a plan motivated by love . This divine qua lity Christ revealed, and thus altered all hum an living and hum an g oals. At that time too there came a great impetus and extension to the work and grow th of the Hierarchy, as there was in a lesser degree when the Buddha came. Many initiates became Masters; many Masters passed to still highe r work, and many disciples took their places in the ranks of the initiates. There was num erically a great influx of aspirants into the ranks of accepted disciples. I have cons idered som e of these Avatars in my earlier writings unde r different names and categor ies. I deal with Them here simply in an effort to reach a wider publ ic with the teaching on the doc trine of Avatars or of divine Appe arances. The Bible is full of such Appe arances, but little is really unde rstood about Them. The above are the more familiar groupings . In September 1 940 I gave an interpretation of a new Stanza of the Great Invoc ation, and in that com muni cation I spoke of Divine Embodi ments as the highe st type of Avatar for which hum anity coul d look at this poi nt in its evol ution. I spoke of the activity of the Hierarc hy and of Shamballa, shoul d these two divine Agencies decide that intervention in the form of a widespread cataclysm (engul fing all peopl es) was necessary, and I referred to the emergence of inspired leadership as anot her and low er aspect of divine gui danc e and participation. Such inspired leadership is now being given to humanity by Winston Chur chill and Frankl in D. Roos evelt, in cont ra - distinction to the focussed leadership of the forces of materialism through Hitler and anot her man in his gro up. But it is not with this form of leadership as expr essive of the avataric principle that I deal here. Such leadership is called forth by elements present in humanity itself. I deal now with a fifth type of Avatar, greater than the other four . These Avat ars have not , in this world cycle, expe rienced hum an life. 5. Divine Embodi ments . These Avatars appe ar rarely; and when They do, the effectiveness and results of Their work are very great. They issue forth into manifestation via the centre at Shamballa, b ecause They are an expr ession of the will nature of Deity; They embody divine pur pos e; the energy pour ing through Them and transmitted by Them is focussed through the Lord of the World; They can onl y be reached by the uni ted voi ces of the Hierarchy and of hum anity speaking in uni son; Their service is evoke d onl y by realised need, and onl y after thos e who call Them forth have adde d to their faith"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST strenuous action and have done their utmost, alone and una ided, to ove rcom e evil. They never descend low er than the mental plane, and the main empha sis and attention of Their work is directed to the Hierarchy; the Hierarchy is Their transmitting agency; They occasiona lly reach thos e thinki ng peopl e, focussed on the mental plane, who have clear vision, pot ent resolve , directed will and ope n minds , plus of cour se, essential pur ity of form. These Avatars expr ess the Will of God, the energy of Shamballa, and the impul se lying behind divine pur pos e. When They do com e forth, it will be the destroye r aspect of the first ray of pow er which They will expr ess; They bring about death — the death of all old and limiting forms and of that which hou ses evil. Their work will, therefore, fall into two categor ies: a. They will destroy the forces of evil, using the agency of the Forces of Light . b. They will reveal as much of the divine pur pos e as hum anity is able to grasp through its best minds and most dedicated aspirants; They will clarify the vision of the world disciples and of all who have the disciplined will - to - know a nd who are dedicated to and expr essive of the will - to - good . This know ledge and this will are needed in the com ing period of readjustment. How They will bring the present evil condi tions to an end and how They will destroy the present evil state of materia listic aggr ession I may not reveal. It is not yet certain that hum an developm ent and unde rstandi ng and the massed intent of hum anity will be adequa te to the needed demand and strong enough to call Them forth. Time alone can determine that. God grant that t he aspirants and disciples of the world will awaken to the oppor tunity and the imminent and waiting pos sibility. The plight of vast groups of peopl e upon the planet toda y lies heavy upon the heart of the Hierarchy. But to bring release and the Appe arance o f the Pow er that can liberate, hum an coope ration is needed. Now here is this more desperately needed than among the German peopl e in their unha ppy land. God grant, therefore, that thos e Germans who have vision may join the forces of thos e who are seeking to free Germany and the German peopl e from the impos ed tyranny of the evil Lodge , working through their seven representatives in Germany. Once the Germans who are living free lives in other lands can think in terms of hum anity as a whol e and not in terms of nationa l glamour s, revenge or self - pity, then their voi ces will be adde d to thos e of the other free peoples and to thos e of the aspirants and disciples in all other nations . When the Avatar com es He will conve y to hum anity som ething for which we have as y et no true name. It is neither love nor will as we unde rstand them. Only a phr ase of several words can conve y som ething of the signi ficance and then onl y feebly. This phrase is \"the principle of directed pur pos e.\" This principle invol ves three factors: a. Unde rstandi ng (intuitive and instinctual, but intelligently interpreted) of the plan as it can be worked out in the immediate future. b. Focussed intention, based on the above and emphasising an aspect of the will, hitherto unde velope d in man. c. Capacity to direct energy (through unde rstandi ng and intent) tow ards a recogni sed and desired end, ove rcom ing all obs tacles and destroyi ng all that stands in the way. This is not destruction of forms by force such as is now being impos ed on the world, but a destruction brought about by the greatly strengt hened life within the form. Only the next one hundr ed years will reveal the signi ficance of this"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST statement and then onl y if the massed intent of the peopl e evoke s this Avatar of Synthesis dur ing the ne xt twelve mont hs. I have called this Being by this name because it expr esses the qua lity and the obj ective of the force He brings and wields. Anot her and lesser Avatar is also awaiting a call from hum anity. He is esoterically related to the Avatar of Synt h esis, being ove rshadow ed by Him. This Avatar can descend on to the phys ical plane into out er expr ession and can thus step dow n and transmit the stimulation and qua lity of the force of the greater Avatar Who can com e no nearer than the mental plane. Who thi s Com ing One may be is not yet revealed. It may be the Christ, if His other work permits; it may be One chos en by Him to issue forth, ove rshadow ed by the Avatar of Synt hesis and directed in His activities by the Christ, the Lord of Love. In this way, the e nergies of bot h Shamballa and the Hierarchy will be focussed through the chos en Com ing One. Thus a triangl e of lovi ng, pur pos eful energy will be created which may prove a more effective way of releasing energy and a safer way, than the focussed impact of o ne selected force might be. I realise the difficulty of this subj ect and perhaps may simplify the matter by a brief sum mation: 1. A great cosmic Avatar can com e if the Hierarchy and hum anity can stand toge ther with massed intent. a. He will d escend into the three worlds of hum an ende avour , but no nearer than the mental plane. b. He will transmit a cosmic energy whos e qua lity is Synthesis . This will express itself through harmony and uni ty, produc ing necessarily unde rstandi ng, promoting goodw i ll, and eventually endi ng the separative, isolating tende ncies of manki nd. c. His not e and vibration can onl y be sensed by those whos e indi vidua l not e is also synt hesis and whos e life obj ective is the will - to - good. These are cons equently the Members of th e Hierarchy, the disciples and aspirants of the world and a few of the men of goodw ill. 2. A Messenge r or Avatar of equa l rank to the Christ in the Hierarchy (or pos sibly Christ Himself) may com e forth as the Representative of the Avatar of Synt hesis and as His transmitting Agent. a. This lesser Avatar works toda y as one of the senior Members of the Great White Lodge and is in close touc h with the Christ, with the Manu and with the Lord of Civilisation, the Master R.; He will act as the Coor dinator betwee n the Hierarchy and Shamballa. He will fuse and blend in Himself, through the qua lity of His Own life, the three great energies: The will - to - spiritual pow er. The will - to - love in its spiritual connot ation. The will - to - manifest spiritually. b. The antiqui t y of the achievement of this Com ing One is to be found in the name appl ied to Him, which is found in so many of the world Scriptures: The Rider on the White Horse. This refers to the time prior to the phr ase so well - know n in the Christian fields: \"The Lamb slain from the founda tion of the world.\" In the earlier cycle, the then initiates spoke of the \"sacrificial hor se, slain to all eternity.\" It conve ys the same basic idea. c. This Avatar can descend to the phys ical plane and there appe ar, to lead His peop le — as the Prince"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Who leads through war to peace. d. The whol e problem before the Hierarchy and humanity toda y, in conne ction with the com ing Avatar, can be sum med up in the follow ing four que stions : Can He bring the energy of synt hesis with Hi m, thereby bringi ng about rapid change s? This depends upon His being ove rshadow ed by the Avatar of Synt hesis and upon that Avatar being evoke d through the demand and the massed intent of hum anity, aided by the Hierarchy. Will the demand of the peopl e be strong enough to evoke the highe r pot ency, or will it be too feeble because of the failure of the world disciples and aspirants to focus this massed intent throughout the planet? Will the highe r ove rshadow ing not take place and onl y the lesser Avatar com e to institute a slow er method of gradua l reform? This slow er method will be necessitated onl y if and because hum anity will have demons trated its inability to call forth and receive the highe r measure and more pot ent vibration of divine energy. It is entir ely for the decision of the world disciples and aspirants; not the decision of poor bewildered, delude d hum anity. Will the world disciples and aspirants appr eciate the crisis and oppo rtuni ty? They have not yet, as a whol e, done so. 3. The Hierarchy toda y stands with massed intent. The cry of the masses is rising up to the very gates of Shamballa. It is stronge r by far than the demand of the spiritually oriented peopl e — the disciples, the aspirants, the men of goodw ill. They seem — from the viewpoi nt of the Hi erarchy — to be ove rcom e by inertia, to be engr ossed by their theories and idealisms, and to be blind to the issues at stake. Can they be arous ed? Can they stand with focussed intent, strenuous phys ical service and activity, and determined effort to struggl e, even unt o death, for the defeat of evil? Can they preserve the inne r attitude of love and non - separateness? Can they relinqui sh all for love of hum anity? Can they sacrifice every thing for the cause of freedom and of right eousness? This is the probl em conf ronting Thos e Who are working for the appe arance of the Greater and the Lesser Avatars Who can at this time save hum anity if hum anity desires salvation and will take the needed steps. The Needed Steps These steps are various in kind though one in intent. The first step is to realise clearly what are the methods whereby the Avatar can com e and so reach hum anity. These are the same methods , whether it is the Avatar of Synt hesis, working through the Hierarchy, or the Avatar of Coor dination (as I might call Him), working through hum anity and representing the greater Avatar upon the phys ical plane. The methods whereby Avatars reach and influence Their agents or thos e who respond to Their not e, vibration and message are three in num ber. 1. Oversh adow ing . Where there is kinship in qua lity, in obj ective and in nature, it is pos sible for the Avatar to ove rshadow som e Member of the Hierarchy (as in the case of the Avatar of Synt hesis) or som e disciple or aspirant where humanity is conc erned (in the ca se of a lesser Avatar). This is done"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST through meditation, through a directed stream of thought energy, the presentation of a thoug htform and the evoc ation of the focussed will of the one who is ove rshadow ed. All this proceeds rapidly where there is close co ope ration between the latter (the sensitive respondi ng disciple) and the Avatar. The Christ is toda y in very close rappor t with the Avatar of Synt hesis, and this rappor t will cont inue , becom ing closer and closer unt il the Full Moon of June ; He is giving al l pos sible aid, as is His Brother, the Buddha . It is this which makes the com ing Full Moon of May of such supr eme importance. A group of Masters and initiates Who are specially related to the Christ's department, as well as a group working unde r the Master M., are ende avour ing to respond to this ove rshadow ing which is onl y pos sible — even to Them — when transmitted to Them by the Christ. (I talk here of mysteries.) It will therefore be appa rent to you that, as They succeed and becom e increasingl y se nsitive to and aware of this ove rshadow ing energy of the great Avatar, Their disciples on earth can also — in a dim and faint way — becom e respons ive to the ideas that are formulated in the mind of their particular Master in respons e to avataric impression. Po nde r on this. 2. Inspiration . This is more direct than ove rshadow ing and more pot ent in results. Certain Members of the Hierarchy and, above all, the lesser Avatars, are inspired from \"on high\" by the cosmic Avatar and becom e at times direct expressions o f His mind, His energy and His plans. This is the spiritual corresponde nce to obs ession. In the case of obs ession, a man is taken pos session of and inspired by som e evil entity; in inspiration, there is no pos session but onl y what is called \"identical resp ons e\" — a very different thing. In the one case, the free will and intelligent unde rstandi ng of the Master or the disciple is enlisted on the side of the spiritual Agent; the spiritual man, func tioni ng as a soul , becom es the channe l for forces, ideas and act ivities other than his ow n but to which he gives full intuitive assent. It is all carried forward with full unde rstandi ng and cons cious ness of method, process and results. It is an act of free spiritual coope ration, for the good of hum anity, in the work of a great spiritual Force or Being. The coope ration of the Master Jesus with the Christ is a case in poi nt. In conne ction with the com ing Avatar, it may invol ve the coope ration of the Christ or of a \"kindr ed, equa l soul \" with a cosmic Being or Presence, tak ing place on still highe r spiritual levels of cons cious ness and produc ing an incredibly focussed pot ency. In the case of obs ession, the evil force enslaves the persona lity which, in the majority of cases, is but a shell. Of this, Hitler is a case in poi nt . This produc es greater pot ency on the phys ical plane and on the astral plane; it is quicker and more immediate in results, but the lasting pow er is less and the effects are relatively tempor ary. In the processes of inspiration, the lesser Ava tar — through His life and cont acts in the three worlds — will necessarily influence sensitive, spiritually oriented disciples and aspirants, and thus the inspiration com ing from the cosmic Avatar becom es in time a group inspiration , and therefore can be more safely handl ed. This group inspiration can happe n toda y. If it doe s, there will then be a simultaneous appe aring of the cosmic Avatar, the World Saviour in the Person of the lesser Avatar, and — at the same time — a group saviour , com pos ed of respons ive discip les and world servers. Ponde r again on this. In this way, if you will not e carefully, there is established a direct linke d chain from hum anity, via the Hierarchy, to Shamballa. The Hierarchy is working at the establishing of this chain, aided by Their dis ciples. The demand for the coope ration of all aspirants is now goi ng forth, because the times are urgent. If this relations hip can be established (and it will be a sad day for hum anity if it cannot ), then the third method of avataric expr ession becom es pos sible. "},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST 3. Appe aranc e or Mani festation . Every pos sible step has been taken by the Hierarchy to enable the Avatar, the Com ing One, to appe ar. What these steps are cannot be declared here. Only som e que stions , sugge sting pos sibility, are permissible. Think you that His body of manifestation is already on Earth, waiting to be ove rshadow ed, inspired and used at the right time, as was the vehicle of the Master Jesus by the Christ? There are thos e who say that it is waiting and has been waiting for 22 years. Is it pos sible that there will be a sudde n descent of the Prince of Light and Peace to change present condi tions by the effectiveness of His radiance and His message? There are thos e who look for Him to sudde nly appe ar, and they num ber millions of expe ctant p eopl e. Som e say He is already on His way. Is it pos sible that this Wesak Festival will see Him appr oach nearer to the Hierarchy and make a cont act with Them? Som e say it will take place. Can the \"massed intent\" of hum anity evoke respons e and lea d to the appe arance on Earth of the lesser Avatar? Som e say not hing can stop it. Prophe cy, expe ctation and the present time cycle testify to the oppor tuni ty. This pos sible dua l event — the com ing of the Avatar of Synt hesis to the Hierarchy and of the lesser Avatar, His Representative, to hum anity — can be a proba ble happe ning if the world disciples and aspirants measure up to the oppor tuni ty. The Immediate Task I enter upon my conc ludi ng remarks wonde ring if anyt hing I can say will awaken disciples to the ne eded spiritual effort — a spiritual effort which must find expr ession in phys ical plane decisions and activity. A certain aspect of phys ical plane effort is already being unde rtaken by them through very force of circum stance: Red Cross activity in every land , respons e to urgent, surroundi ng, phys ical need, and the mobi lisation of their time and resour ces by leaders in all count ries are the keynot es of the time. But it is the inne r spiritual activity and orientation (paralleling the out er activity) which is re qui red. This is an activity which is preceded by clear factual thinki ng and decision. Can the world disciples and aspirants evidence this full life on all levels? Are they capable of an intensive inne r life as well as of unf laggi ng attention to out er dut y and demands ? This is the probl em. Are they capable of laying aside their ow n pet theories and trifling ideals (trifling in the face of the appa lling world situation) and focus every pos sible effort on fight ing evil upon the phy sical plane, as well as on ot her levels, with every pos sible agency? Can they at the same time live that dyna mic life of thought and inclusive com prehension which will find expr ession in the voiced appe al to the Avatar? It is feeling and fanatical adhe rence to a love d ideal which freq uently stand between a disciple and effective service on the phys ical plane. It is old habits of though t and the determined effort to interpos e som e mystical dream between condi tions as they are and condi tions as they coul d be, if disciples took right action, which have prevented effective service. But, my brother, all things have to becom e new and that means a new vision, a new idealism, and a new life techni que . Past ideals, past dreams and past efforts to tread the Path and expr ess brotherhoo d have produc ed most successfully a certain change d attitude in the race, a new orientation to the life of the spirit, and a focussed intention to move forward. That was the desired goa l and that goa l has now been reached. The right attitude is now presen t in many peopl e in every race, and it is the recogni tion of this which has called forth the activity of the Brothers of the Shadow at this time. They realise that the time of their pow er is shor tening. The hol d of the materialistic values ove r man is stea dily becom ing weaker. So far has man progressed that there are enough peopl e in the world toda y to turn the tide if they can be arous ed from their apathy. "},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST I tried to arous e them to speed and clear thinki ng between the years 1932 - 1938 but though som ething was accom plished, it was not enough. The blindne ss, illusion, separativeness and inertia of the aspirants of the world toda y cons titute one of the factors with which the Hierarchy has to cont end. Aspirants are preoccupi ed with their ow n little affairs and with their ow n small efforts, instead of relinqui shing everything in an ende avour to uni te on the needed appe al and activity. They are cont endi ng for their ow n interpretations of truth, and for their pet ideals of peace, living or work and — like Nero — they \" fiddl e whilst Rom e bur ns.\" All their lives they have fought for an ideal and a dream, and they love that more than they love hum anity. Yet — all that is needed is such a deep love of hum anity that it works out on all levels of activity and all life effort. I f the idealists of the world woul d realise the situation as it is , they woul d relinqui sh all that they hol d dear and com e to the rescue of hum anity, and thus snatch the helpless masses back from slavery and death. They woul d battle for the freed om of the hum an soul with every weapon in the armory of manki nd. They woul d hol d back the forces of aggr ession by force itself if need be. They woul d aim at clear thinki ng, and thus clear the channe l for the inflow of spiritual force. The major prerequi sit es toda y for true world service are an ove rwhelming love of hum anity and a sense of propor tion. The onl y requi rements toda y for disciples and aspirants may be sum med up as follow s: 1. The doi ng of everything pos sible to bring the war to an end. Every phys ical plane method must be used to drive the forces of evil and of cruelty back to their dark place. Phys ical plane methods , when motivated by unc hangi ng love of hum anity and under the direction of an enlight ened soul , becom e agents of right eous ness. There are worse things than the death of the phys ical body; there is the enslaving of the hum an soul . 2. The focussing of the inne r life tow ards the Hierarchy in radiant faith. The way of the Com ing One must be made clear, and the life force must be dedicated t o the out er life of com passion. 3. The clarifying of the mental life in the pur e light of the soul . Disciples live too much in the world of feeling; hence the cloudi ng of their vision. When they have clarified their minds and see the situation whol e, they can then appe al to the Avatar to make His appe arance. This appe al must be made via the Christ. 4. Disciples must ende avour to unde rstand what are the obj ectives of the Avatar, and thus fit themselves to coope rate. The second step is to unde rstand clearl y what is the task which must be unde rtaken in preparation for the Com ing One. This entails four things : 1. The effort to stand with all other disciples and aspirants in an attempt to call forth the Avatar, to reach Him by focussed intensive thought and t o evoke His respons e. This is the pur pos e of the new Invoc ation. It voi ces intent, makes demand and pledge s coope ration. 2. The provi ding of a nuc leus or group through which the Avatar of Synt hesis can work when the lesser Avatar has com e forth upon the phys ical plane. This invol ves indi vidua l activity, the soundi ng out of a clear not e, based on clear mental perception, the recogni tion of thos e allied in the work and the developm ent of cons cious group work. In this group work the persona lity is subor dinated and onl y the follow ing determinations are dom inant: a. The determination to offer group service — as a group — to the world group."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST b. The determination to establish right hum an relations upon the planet. c. The determination to develop everyw he re the spirit of goodw ill. d. The determination to withstand evil through planne d group activity. 3. To cons truct a network of light and service in every land. This is begun in the indi vidua l envi ronm ent of the server, and gradua lly extende d throughout t he world. It was with this idea in view that I sugge sted the forming of triangl es of peopl e, pledge d to use the Invoc ation and to extend its use through the world. It is my specific plan to help mass world thought and thus evoke the Avatar, and likewise to provi de a world group through which the new forces and energies can func tion, the new ideas can spread. and the com ing world order find adhe rents. 4. To prepare the general pub lic for the Com ing One by poi nting out the testimony of the past, the recogni t ion of the uni versal need for divine intervention and the holding out of hope to the distressed, the doubt ing and the tortured. In His appe arance lies hope , and history testifies that it has freque ntly happe ned at times of world crisis. Such are the pos si bilities which I present to your unde rstandi ng. I have told and taught you much in past years. I have often asked for your coope ration and your help in world service. Som e have responde d and given help. Many have longe d to aid. The majority have done little or not hing. In this mom ent of crisis (within the world crisis) I again ask for you r coope ration and leave you to make you r decision. May the love of God and of your fellow men inspire you; the light of your soul s direct you and the strengt h of the group enable you to aid in bringi ng good out of the present evil by right action and clear thinki ng. THE WO RK OF RECONSTRUCTION Augus t 1941 As I have studi ed the world disciples dur ing the present world crisis, I see them borne dow n by inertia — n ot the inertia that com es from selfishne ss and self - centredne ss, or the inertia due to lack of unde rstandi ng of the nature of the crisis, or the inertia due to sheer laziness, but an inertia based upon a deep, inne r depression, to a sense of hum an failure and to an introspectiveness which is natural but useless at this time. Som e disciples (bot h on the proba tiona ry path and on the path of discipleship) take refuge in the perpetuation of the activities with which they were enga ged when the war started; som e take refuge in a determination to wait unt il the crisis is ove r, and appe ar to think that any work along the old lines of spiritual ende avour is of no real use; still others take refuge in a feverish out er occupa tion with things which the average man who i s not spiritually oriented can do as well, if not better. Some disciples and aspirants are spendi ng their time fight ing a psychic sensitivity, evoke d by world condi tions ; many are simply ove rwhelmed and stunne d by hum anity's pain and agony, by the"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST hor ror o f the mom ent, by anxi ety ove r the future, and by anticipation of still worse happe nings . Their imaginations are working ove rtime and qui te uselessly. To som e of these attitude s, all of you are susceptible. I write toda y to call all world disciples and asp irants to an intensive period of preparation for future activity and work. From now unt il the Sun move s nor thw ard, I woul d ask each of you to do three things : First, strengt hen — through meditation, prayer and clear thinki ng — your faith, conf idenc e and joy, and above all else, deepen your love of hum anity, carrying the love of the soul through on to the phys ical plane and into all your hum an relations . Secondl y, eliminate out of your persona lity life, as far as you can or shoul d, anyt hing (mental, psychic, emotiona l or phys ical) which might hinde r your future usefulness. Thirdly, plan toge ther for the work of the future. This work can be inaugu rated shor tly and must be started slow ly, carefully, and with unreserved coope ration with me and with eac h other. It must be carried out steadily and unde viatingl y, with no lost motion, onc e its out lines are determined, and it shoul d be carried out toge ther . The major need toda y for each and all who must spons or the work of the future that I am seeking to do with your coope ration and unde rstandi ng, is to foster the grow th of the will to love and work. This effort on your part will expr ess itself in a steadily deepening love for hum anity — for all men and for each other. It will demons trate in a cons tant effort to invoke the spiritual will in self - discipline and persistence; it will show itself in the intelligent carrying forward of the plan as I shall seek progr essively to out line it. This work can onl y be carried forward by peopl e who love their fellow men enou gh and have sufficient illum ination to enable them to work with me dependa bly for a period of five years in the face of anyt hing which may happe n; they must be peopl e who will ende avour to permit no persona lity misunde rstandi ng to hinde r their usefulness a nd their group interrelation, and who — because they love enough — will ceaselessly subor dinate everything to the task which must be done . The second thing I ask you to do is to gather out of all the past pamphlets and my later writings thos e plans and instruc tions on service which will be appl icable to the change d condi tions and in the immediate future. Study this carefully along with the reque sts and sugge stions in this letter, so that you may know what I, your Tibetan teacher, feel coul d and shoul d be don e by you in the service of the immediate future. I woul d ask thos e of you who care to do so to meet toge ther at the time of the Full Moon in Octobe r for fellow ship, uni ted meditation, cons ecration and consultation. I woul d ask thos e of you who live and work at more distant poi nts to write briefly your reactions to the sugge sted ende avour , indi cating how you feel you can best aid in the task. I would ask all of you who associate your selves with me in the work of the future, each day to use the very b rief meditation which I out line below . It is dyna mic, affirmative and — if right ly used — shoul d link head and heart, leading thus to intelligent lovi ng service, and it shoul d also serve to bind you all toge ther in the closest spiritual uni ty. This will aid in the vitalising of the etheric bodi es of all workers, and therefore in a group vitality which will be irresistible. Sugge sted Meditation "},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Each morning, prior to starting the day's activities, achieve an inne r qui et, see the Self as the soul , place your s elf at the dispos ition of the soul , of hum anity and of your group. 1. Then say silently and with full dyna mic intent: At the centre of all love I stand; from that centre, I the soul will out ward move ; from that centre, I the one who serves will work. May the love of the divine Self be shed abroad in my heart, through my group and throughout the world. 2. Then, focussing your attention and dedication, see the group to which you belong as a great centre of love and light , irradiating the world of men, brin ging relief, light , love and healing in increasing measure. 3. Brood then upon the plan to be carried out and upon the indi cated service for the com ing day. Do this as the soul , keeping the persona l low er self in a waiting attitude , like a serv ant attentive for instruction. 4. Then say: The joy of the divine Self is my strengt h. The pow er of the spirit of man shall trium ph. The Forces of Light do cont rol the forces of evil. The work of the Great Ones must go on. The Com ing One is on the way. T he Avatar approaches. For this we must prepare. 5. Close with a minut e of dyna mic quiet. I will ask you to do this meditation every day unt il Janua ry 1st, 1942, when I will give you anot her step in this Meditation of Preparation for the Com ing One. Its a im is to prepare all of you interiorly. I would ask you also to read and re - read the instruction I gave you on Avatars. (pp. 285 - 313 .) You will cons titute the initial group which I am asking to collabor ate with me in the recons truction work of the New Age . As time goe s on, subs idiary groups will be indi cated who can work in the various count ries as focal poi nts in the great network of light which is forming everyw here unde r the inspiration of the world disciples and aspirants in every land, as they work un der instruction of the Hierarchy. Som e of them are know n to you. Many of them are not know n to any of you. But they represent the working groups of all the Masters, and upon their shoul ders rests the work of recons truction, aided by the thous ands and thous ands of men and wom en of goodw ill in every land. The meeting upon the ocean of the two world disciples and leaders marked a crisis in world affairs. The Eight Points (see page 318) formulated by them constitute the basis of the com ing world order. They we re necessarily large in out line and without details as to appl ication. It will be for a liberated hum anity to work out these details, to make the necessary adjustments, and to so rearrange hum an life that the highe r spiritual values may prevail, a simpler mode of life may be instituted, a greater freedom be established, and a wider respons ibility be shoul dered by every man. This will take time. Som e of you may not live to see the full clarification of the way that hum anity must go (the \"Light ed W ay\" of the future), but you can, all of you, aid materially in the important task of preparation, in indi cating the"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST needed world principles, in spreading the gos pel of goodw ill, and in establishing right human relations. The work done in thought , in love a nd in dedicated activity dur ing the next three years is of paramoun t impor tance and will produc e the stabilisation to take place in the last two years of the five mentione d by me above as your immediate time of coope ration. You who are working in the mids t of the chaos and conf lict cannot and will not be able to judge accurately the measure of accom plishm ent. Only the Members of the Hierarchy (Masters, initiates and the disciples who are out of incarnation at this time) can get a true perspective. The work ing disciples in the forefront of the battle have to carry on their work in the midst of chaos, turmoil, que stioni ng, pain, and distress. They cannot , therefore, see the picture whol e. A few of the more adva nced who can \"live on the height s and in the vall ey and the depths\" simultaneous ly can see truly, but their num bers are not large, and the Christ spoke a true word to His bewildered disciple when He said, \"Blessed are they who have not seen and yet have believed.\" The follow ing of the meditation, adhe ren ce to the instructions given, persistence in the face of difficulty, and a staunc h belief in the beauty of the hum an spirit, in the love of God, in the victory of the Forces of Light and in the appr oach of the Com ing One — these are the attitude s which we, t he workers on the inne r side, ask of thos e we choos e to carry on our work upon the out er plane. This letter deals with the forming of the group to carry out the plans for 1942 - 1945. It is being formed in the dark of the year, at the nadir poi nt of hum an d istress, at the most difficult mom ent in hum an history, at a poi nt of crisis and — in the case of many of you as indi vidua ls — at the time of your deepest persona l difficulty. I tell you that all of you , toge ther, are equa l to the task. I will agai n write to you and will indi cate the practical aspects of the work. In the meantime, ponde r and reflect upon what I have written here; begin the meditation and ende avour to strengt hen your link with your soul and with each other. Let love — not emotion and s entiment — cont rol your thou ght s, words and deeds. I woul d ask you also to study carefully the indications I have given in the past as to the work which must be done , and I woul d ask you also to study carefully the Eight Points out lined on the high seas, and the Four Freedom s so oft discussed throughout the world. Let qui etness and depth characterise your inne r life. THE EIGHT POINTS OF THE ATLANTIC CHARTER Augus t 14, 1941 The President of the United States of America, Frankl in D. Roos evelt, and the P rime Minister, Mr. Chur chill, representing his Majesty's Gove rnm ent in the United Kingdo m, being met toge ther, deem it right to make know n certain com mon principles in the nationa l policies of their respective count ries on which they base their hope s for a better future for the world. First, their count ries seek no aggr andi zement, territorial or other; Second, they desire to see no territorial change s that do not accord with the freely expr essed wishes of the peopl es conc erned; "},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Third, they respect the ri ght of all peopl es to choos e the form of gove rnm ent unde r which they will live; and they wish to see sove reign right s and self - gove rnm ent restored to thos e who have been forcibly deprived of them; Four th, they will ende avour , with due respect for their ex isting obl igations , to further the enjoym ent by all States, great or small, victor or vanqui shed, of access, on equa l terms, to the trade and to the raw materials of the world which are needed for their econom ic prosperity; Fifth, they desire to bring abo ut the fullest collaboration between all nations in the econom ic field with the obj ect of securing, for all, improve d labou r standa rds, econom ic adva ncement and social security. Sixth, after the final destruction of the Nazi tyranny, they hope to see established a peace which will afford to all nations the means of dw elling in safety within their ow n bounda ries, and which will afford assurance that all the men in all the lands may live out their lives in freedom from fear and want; Seventh, suc h a peace shoul d enable all men to traverse the high seas and oceans without hindr ance; Eight h, they believe that all the nations of the world, for realistic as well as spiritual reasons , must com e to the abandonm ent of the use of force. Since no future p eace can be maintained if land, sea or air armaments cont inue to be employe d by nations which threaten, or may threaten, aggr ession out side of their front iers, they believe, pendi ng the establishment of a wider and permanent system of general security, tha t the disarmament of such nations is essential. They will likewise aid and encour age all other practicable measures which will light en for peace - lovi ng peopl es the crushing bur den of armaments. THE FOUR FREEDOMS Janua ry 6, 1941 In the future days, w hich we seek to make secure, we look forward to a world founde d upon four essential hum an freedom s. The first is freedom of speech and expr ession — everyw here in the world. The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his ow n way — everyw here in t he world. The third is freedom from want — which, translated into world terms, means econom ic unde rstandi ngs which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inha bitants — everyw here in the world. The four th is freedom from fear — which, tran slated into world terms, means a worldw ide reduc tion of armaments to such a poi nt and in such a thor ough fashion that no nation will be in a pos ition to com mit an act of phys ical aggr ession against any neighbou r — anyw here in the world. Frankl in D. Roos evel t "},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST PRACTICAL STEPS IN THE RECONSTRUCTION WO RK September 1941 It will be obvi ous to you that there is little that I can say as to exact procedur e unt il such time as hum anity itself has decided the future condi tions of hum an living. I mean ex actly that, my brother. The war is not yet decided. There is a widespread feeling that God (as we call the Central Pow er of Life itself) will or shoul d intervene; there is a vague demand that right shoul d trium ph and a desperate hope that som ething une xpe c ted will happe n that will give victory to the arms of the Forces of Light. This attitude of painful expe ctancy is uni versal among the masses — bot h thos e in the fight ing count ries and the neutrals also. In the neutral count ries (of which the United States is the largest and the most impor tant) there are two factors condi tioni ng the thinki ng of the peopl e: First, a deep - seated though not unna tural selfishne ss, which prom pts the determination to take no real part in the war, except what can be done safely and at the least pos sible cost, and secondl y, a steadily emerging cleavage between the relatively few who have vision and want actively to help the embattled Allies (the agents of the Forces of Light ), and the selfish many who — for pol itical, religious or perso nal reasons — will fight every effort to com mit their count ry further than it is at this time com mitted, and who hope nevertheless to share in the benefits of victory. In the last analysis, how ever, the world situation must be settled by hum anity itself. The Hierarchy cannot interfere. Hum anity has the privilege and the oppor tuni ty to take right action now . The Com ing One Who is being so fervently invoke d throughout the world, either by prayer, invoc ation or unvoi ced demand, is conc erned with readjustment, wi th the right fusion of forces and with the healing of the peopl es. This worldw ide invoc ative demand is largely prom pted by a defeatist pos ition or by a com passiona te longi ng to see the long agony of man ende d; it is seldom prom pted by convi ction, by the re cogni tion of pos sibility or a paralleling decision to right the wrongs which lie back of the world situation and which cons titute the alibi of the enemy of hum anity — Hitler and his associates. The Com ing One will make His appe arance when the tid e of battle has definitely turned and the forces of evil are being driven back to their ow n place. I have made no pronounc ement as to time, person or place. I have simply indi cated that there is a pos sibility (subs eque nt to right action) of the appe aring o f the One for Whom the centuries have long waited, to Whom prophe cy in all lands , the rapidly developi ng intuition of the peopl e, and established precedent, all bear cons tant witness. His hour is near, provi ded the needed steps in preparation are taken, an d it is for that that I have appr oached you . I have not indi cated the place of His appe aring, the nature of His emergence, or the count ry of His choi ce. These are the details which conc ern Him and not you . Your task is to get ready for His com ing. This inv olves right unde rstandi ng and increasing labour for hum anity as a result of the experience of love within your ow n indi vidua l cons cious ness. This I empha sise. I have sugge sted three preparatory steps to the group of aspirants with whom I am in touc h: 1. The use of the great mantram or invoc ation — in two parts (see pp. 144, 249) . The first was used in 1936 and the second in 1940, and is still in use. The first was intende d to centralise hum an desire, and the second was intende d to utilise what mental power was available to invoke Thos e Who (on the inner spiritual side of life) are waiting to help. This They cannot do unl ess the way is made pos sible for"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Them by humanity itself. Such is the law. 2. A general process of educ ating the publ ic in the fact and u se of goodw ill. A great but unde velope d pot ency is still locked up in manki nd which, if evoke d by man himself, will prove adequa te to do two things : a. Lay the founda tion for a stable peace — active and pos itive because the result of active and pos itive act ion — after the Forces of Light have won the victory upon the phys ical plane. b. Provi de the subj ective synt hesis or network of light , embodyi ng the force of goodw ill as the expr ession of right hum an relations . This will gua rantee a workable worl d order and not an impos ed tyranny or a mystical and impos sible dream. 3. The realisation of a general out line of that com ing world order which will be in line with hum anity's need, basic in its implications , and which will provide that structure of livin g interrelation which will foster latent love , intuitiona l unde rstandi ng and the creative pow er in man. Thos e are the three major obj ectives with which I have dealt in past com muni cations . I have also made sugge stion as to mode s of activity which are prac tical — som e of them of an exot eric nature, such as the com piling of mailing lists, in every count ry, of those who think and expr ess goodw ill; others, such as the creation of the network of light , through the formation of triangl es. It is not for me to decid e the details of your out er activities. That is for you to do, and for that I have called you to assist me. Let me recapitulate a few of the things which have been unde rtaken in our joint work so that you can clearly see the backgr ound of our com ing effor t and grasp the work as a whol e. 1. The first activity was the writing and distribut ion of the occult teachings through the medium of the books which A.A.B. has assisted me to write. These will serve (when the war is ove r) to lead hum anity forward and nea rer to the time when present day occultism will be the theme of world educ ation in som e modi fied form. The books which have been publ ished can be stated — without any conc eit — to have no com petitors, and these, right ly distribut ed, will serve a useful part in carrying the cons cious ness of man to highe r levels and in making clear the divine Plan for manki nd. In them also the task immediately ahead at the close of the war is clearly indi cated. 2. The foundi ng and the work of the Arcane Schoo l. This was started by A.A.B. to train thos e ready for esoteric teaching and to prepare them for the stage and work of Accepted Discipleship. The world toda y is full of groups occupi ed with the task of helping one or other of the groups of aspirants and seekers to be found everyw here, or with the more general unde rtaking of raising the mass cons cious ness. The Arcane School was therefore formed for two purpos es: a. Primarily to aid the Hierarchy in its work during the world crisis — a crisis for which the Hierarchy ha s been long prepared. The Arcane School was not and is not the onl y group with this obj ective, but it is definitely among the most influential. b. To train proba tiona ry disciples to becom e accepted disciples, so that the Hierarchy coul d find thos e who cou ld safely carry spiritual pow er and be channe ls of love and unde rstandi ng to the world. You can see, therefore, that the Arcane School is not so much enga ged in helping the indi vidua l as in"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST aiding the Hierarchy to salvage hum anity. For this work, training is requi red, and the Arcane School provi des this. 3. The fact of the existence of the New Group of World Servers was brough t to the attention of the general publ ic, and on qui te a large scale. This group is com pos ed of aspirants, disciples and initiates, and is intermediate between the spiritual Hierarchy and the intelligent publ ic. Its members are to be found in every count ry, are unor ganised except by their spiritual relation to the Hierarchy and to each other, and through their effort in every field of human cons cious ness to lead hum anity into a more spiritual way of living. They aim to foster the growth of right human relations through goodw ill, and this work is still goi ng on. 4. The organising of the men and wom en of good will in every land so that e ventually they can set the not e of world goodw ill for the new world order. Som e of this work was started in 1934. Much lies ahead, demandi ng attention, and will have to be accom plished in a period much more difficult than the pre - war period. The nuc leus of this group exists, and among them the livingne ss of goodw ill is still uni mpaired. 5. The effort to utilise the pow er of sound and of thought com bined was unde rtaken through the use of the two great invoc ations which you have — as a group — distrib uted throughout the world. Great world prayers have been used for ages; men have been driven by desire and spiritual aspiration to pray, and have recogni sed the pow er of the divine respons e. The art of invoc ation has been, how ever, relatively unknow n, espe cially in the West. It employs the dyna mic will and the focussed mind, and is intende d to evoke respons e from the Forces which will condi tion the new world, which can com e into being at the close of this war. A focussed will or intention, a convi nced mind, a dedicated desire and a planne d activity are essential to success. 6. The forming of triangl es of light and goodw ill, so that an inne r network of peopl e, pledge d to goodw ill, to the use of the pow er of invoc ation and to the grow th of unde rstandi ng throu ghout the world can be created; and a beginni ng has already been made. This is a pot ent and workable mode of procedur e, onc e it is given an oppor tunity to spread. 7. The inaugur ation of an effort tow ards definite group work. This must be group work of a n ew order, wherein indi vidua l activity is subor dinated to the group obj ective and the decisions of the group in conc lave; it is not work carried forward through the impos ition of som e one will upon a group of weaker wills. The indi vidua l and his mode of wor king are not regarded as of importance in the group cons cious ness, because it is the will of the group — uni tedly dedicated to a specific obj ective — which is the poi nt of major impor tance. This is a new procedur e and som ething to which you can appl y your selve s. In this group which I have now formed, oppor tunity will arise to demons trate the practicality of this new ideal in service methods . These are a few of the unde rtakings in which we have for som e years been enga ged, and it is sugge sted that all of them be cont inue d as a backgr ound to all future work and a funda mental platform. You, as indi vidua ls, in this group (or in you r relations with other groups ) all have your persona l probl ems. These problems are simply you r participation in world karma and cons titute your needed training ground and the field of you r spiritual expe rimentation. With them I shall not deal, for you are all adul t soul s and progress by defined service, not by being helped. Your task is to aid the work which the Hierarchy plans to do, to find the ways and means whereby that service can be wisely rende red, to"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST discove r the manne r in which world need (not you r group need) can be met, to finance that share in the work of the Brotherhood to which you have been assigne d by your soul , and to do your part in developi ng thos e hum an attitude s which are needed if true peace is to be found in the world by 1975 . If this work is soundl y done , then a world uni ty can be established which will produc e right hum an relations , a sound world pol itic, a uni ted spiritual effort and an econom ic \"sharing\" which will bring to an end all com petition and the present une ven distribut ion of the necessities of life. In the past I have out lined for you the general programme and the hope d - for obj ectives. I have given you much information and have indi cated need and its pos sible solution. I have given you practical sugge stions as to procedur es and methods . I have asked — as I ask toda y — for your coope ration, and I ask it on behalf of the Forces of Light , of the spiri tual Hierarchy and of distressed hum anity. The present world crisis coul d be shor tened if the spiritually minde d peopl e lived up to their inne r belief and know ledge . The task of uni fying the men and wom en of goodw ill is toda y infinitely more difficult tha n it was before the war. It can onl y be done if each servant of the Hierarchy thinks clearly, love s intelligently and serves to the utmost. I make no plea. I have pleaded much with all of you in the past, and the effort which resulted, though not a complet e failure, was not adequa tely strong enough to off - set the forces of evil, focussed in Germany, Japan and — to a much smaller extent — in Italy. This last statement (which I have made in other writings ) has evoke d resentment in the minds of thos e w ho believe that the Forces of Light must love so indi scriminately that their work on the side of evol ution is negated, and that effort to prom ote the developm ent of the hum an cons cious ness is rende red com pletely futile or shoul d be held in abeyance unt il t he fight is ove r. I woul d here point out that if the Forces of Light — aided by you — did not hing to influence the minds of men, the forces of materialism and of evil woul d trium ph. Hum anity woul d then be spiritually defeated and its evol ution woul d be set bac k for an inde finite period. I would here call you r attention to the words of my great Master and your s: \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\" I woul d remind you that there woul d be no world war toda y if Germany had not marched on Poland. The cause of the w idespread cruelty, terror, murder and agony rests squa rely on the shoul ders of the seven men in Germany. Had the aspirants and the disciples of the world realised the situation earlier, and had they worked more whol eheartedly, the present catastrophe coul d have been held within bounds ; it coul d have been retained and the probl em worked out upon the inne r planes of thought and desire, and coul d there have been transmuted and the needed readjustments made. But they failed to unde rstand, and the storm broke u pon the phys ical plane. The next twelve mont hs will be decisive in hum an affairs. By the end of 1942 , chaos and difficulty will still be present, but the sound of the victor's trum pets will be heard. Will the victors be the Forces of Light , unde r whos e ba nne rs fight the Allies, or will evil trium ph and greed reap the profits of aggr ession? Will men be led into a darkne ss which — though not interminable — will engul f the hum an soul for decades? The answers to these que stions lie in the decisions and the activit ies of humanity itself. The Hierarchy waits. I have referred to the increased difficulty which will conf ront the men and wom en of goodw ill (working unde r the New Group of World Servers). What cons titutes the difficulty, if we analyse the situat ion? Two major factors: First, the steadily mount ing feeling of intense resentment (amount ing to hate in the case of som e groups"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST and sections of suffering hum anity), accom panied by a deep fatigue , a shattered psychol ogi cal integration as the result of ner ve strain, an acute fear of what the future may hol d (scientifically develope d by the Axis pow ers), and a num bing of the soul which is the result of death on every hand, loss, separation and the sight of unt old pain and suffering. Secondl y, the widespread phys ical destruction, wrought by the inva ding and the defendi ng armies — the destruction of great cities with their accom paniments of civilised living, the whol esale wiping out of indus trial plants and the mechanics of daily life, the sinki ng of the ships wh ich distribut e the raw produc ts of civilised living and the com plete disorganisation of all human affairs in every count ry in the world — directly or indi rectly — and the breaking dow n of the structure of well - established financial relations , plus the disrupt i on of the ordinary means of com muni cation. Add to this the mone tary ruin of the masses of the peopl e, and you have a true and not a sensationa l picture of the world state. Out of this wreckage of all that man has cons tructed dur ing the centuries and out of the spol iation of all existing culture and civilisation, the new world order must be bui lt. And, my brother, it will be bui lt, and you can help prepare for this bui lding of a more stable and beautiful way of life. This creative process begins always in t he realm of intention, is impul sed by trained desire, and will be brought into obj ective expr ession by the right direction of thought , the inspiration of right ideals, and the educ ating of the usually unt hinki ng masses (who are, how ever, toda y thinki ng as never before), so that hum anity as a whol e will appr opr iate these ideals. They then can be trusted to take the needed action. In this manne r the desired condi tions will take form upon the phys ical levels of daily existence. There are many enlight ened think ers working at this time upon these problems; they are actively moul ding publ ic opinions ; free minds in all count ries, or their representatives in the occupi ed lands , are already laying the founda tions of freedom , more surely and soundl y than ev er before; groups everyw here are organising for the rebui lding (mentally, psychically and phys ically) of our world and for the recons truction of our civilisation on saner lines and safer founda tions . More intimate and unde rstandi ng relations are being esta blished between religion, pol itics and phi lanthropy, and the part which science, educ ation and econom ics must play in the future is being brought increasingl y into the forefront of hum an aspiration. There is therefore no need for discour agement. There is onl y need for determined right action and sacrificing effort. This must be based on faith in the hum an spirit, on a convi ction that good must ultimately trium ph because it always has, and a know ledge that the New Age is dawning and that not hing can frustra te its establishm ent. To the adve nt of this new era the destruction itself bears witness, because — again quot ing my Master, the Christ — you cannot put new wine in old bot tles. To your share in the preparatory work for the future new world I call you; to rene wed activity upon the out er plane of life I call you, and again I out line to you three years work, plus two years of activity which will grow out of the three years preparation. Until May 1943, I sugge st sound preparatory unde rtakings for future world act ivity. This must be accom panied by sound organisation, based on a long range vision of what must be done , and by expe rimental effort. This is the immediate work for this group and for thos e whom they may later choos e as collabor ators. Small groups must gro w out of this group later, when it is dul y established and func tioni ng. From May 1943 , unt il Nove mber 1944 , you shoul d move out ward into definite world expe rience and into a basic coope ration with any similar groups which are enga ged in world salvage, pri marily along the psychol ogi cal line, for the psychol ogi cal rehabilitation of hum anity will be the major out standi ng need, paralleling that of econom ic readjustment. These two must receive prior attention by all men and"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST wom en of goodw ill. This gr oup must inspire, promote and strengt hen wherever and whenever pos sible. Such a task can onl y be unde rtaken by peopl e who have no religious bias, no pol itical antagoni sms and no sense of exclusiveness. From then unt il the close of 194 5 or the beginni ng of 1946, the work shoul d cons olidate, the men and wom en of goodw ill will swing into increasing usefulness and the pot ency of their thought and attitude in moul ding pub lic opi nion shoul d make itself dyn amically felt — if you all work as desired. It will be appa rent, therefore, how impor tant is the work that you can start now and stabilise dur ing the next eight een mont hs. The major lines of action you already know , for the goodw ill work done in 1936 still remains basic and its processes shoul d be restudi ed and em ploye d. But I woul d make the follow ing practical sugge stions conc erning the group and its planni ng. 1. Learn to know and trust each other, leaving each other free to work and plan within the group plan; develop the experience of love in you r indi vidua l li ves and in your group relation. Meet regul arly for discussion, planni ng and uni ted meditation — using the same meditation in this group as I have asked you to follow indi vidua lly. Subor dinate you r ow n wishes and ideas to the group decision. Let this be uni qu ely a group effort . 2. Press forward with the Triangl e work in every possible way and in every count ry ope n safely to cont act. Plan this work along sound bus iness lines, making a small group of you respons ible for its func tioni ng and success. 3. Discove r , and where pos sible cont act, all groups which are motivated by a true love for hum anity, plus a gropi ng after and unde rstandi ng of the New Age ideals of freedom , coope ration and inclusiveness. I sugge st a gradua l com pilation of a mailing list of such grou ps, accom panied with samples of their literature and an analysis of their ideas. 4. Gather toge ther all the many propos als that have been formulated by individua ls, groups of world thinke rs and specialists in the different fields of world ende a vour as to the New Order. Find out what is being sugge sted in the many different nations as to the New World Order — bot h good and bad. This will invol ve the reading of books , their digesting and analysis, the forming of a small available library, and the st udy and accum ulation of pamphl ets on the subj ect. By doi ng this, a thought form of great pot ency can be bui lt which will influence the minds of men. 5. Keep in touc h with peopl e in all count ries — occupi ed and unoc cupi ed — who can later be swept into cons truct ive activity. Thus this group will be ready to vitalise peopl e and groups everyw here with whom they are in touc h — som e of which were formed prior to the war and are perforce inactive. The Units of Service in the occupi ed count ries are a case in poi nt. There fore keep in touc h obj ectively and subj ectively with as many peopl e as pos sible, all over the world. 6. The organising of the needed financial equi pm ent to carry forward this work must be the task of anot her group within this larger group of mine. 7. Lea ders of spiritual, religious and esoteric group s, as well as educ ationa l groups , shoul d be appr oached in the interests of world uni ty. A letter shoul d be prepared invi ting such leaders into a com radeship of mutual friends hip and coope ration — not of coordina tion or fusion. A \"com ing toge ther\" can thus be planne d for uni ted strengt hening and advi ce. Such letters shoul d always be the produc t of group effort and sugge stion, after being formulated by the smaller group assigne d to its produc tion."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST 8. A clear formu lation of the obj ectives for which this group has been formed shoul d be drawn up for general circulation; wise bus iness organisation shoul d be appl ied from the very start; right vol untary help shoul d be enlisted; sound financial pol icies shoul d be laid dow n. 9. Definite work, preparatory to any work which future necessity may indi cate in Europe or elsewhere, must be unde rtaken. It is not pos sible for you to undertake the rehabilitation of the entire planet! There is, how ever, much that you can d o along the line of interpretation of ideals, of uni fying and of strengt hening other groups . There are also three things pos sible to this group: a. The discove ry and aiding of the members of the New Group of World Servers in the occupi ed count ries and els ewhere, giving spiritual and practical material aid. b. Work for the rehabilitation and correct handl ing of the children in the devastated lands . This is an urgent need and has wide prom ise and great implications for the future world order. Conc entration on this is desirable. c. Cont inue with the work of findi ng and organising the men and wom en of goodw ill throughout the world. It is they who will cons titute the agents of this group and other New Age groups in the future. Work done by you prior to the war is thus to be continue d, and along similar lines. 10. Make a close indi vidua l study of the Four Freedom s and the Eight Points of the Atlantic Pact, so that the members of this group can soundl y envi sage the freedom s of the New Age and can therefore think clearly, teach the new ideals correctly, and aid in this main world obj ective. This unde rstandi ng is more impor tant than you realise. Out of these sugge stions your group plan can take shape. Having made them and having indi cated to you the lines of hierar chical desire, I shall say no more. The respons ibility is your s, and to you I leave the working out of these ideas. Move rapidly and as a united group with the Triangl e work. It is basic in its usefulness and must be widely spread. Move with sureness, and more gradua lly, with the other aspects of the indicated work. The strengt h and usefulness of this group will depend upon the inne r uni on and love with which you work toge ther, offsetting all persona lity reactions . You will help each other on all levels wh ere help is needed. Let this group work silently and as the Hierarchy works — impersona lly behind the scenes. Let them draw upon all available spiritual resour ces, dedicating all their mental, emotiona l and material reserves to the work of helping hum anity, and let them know (past all que stioni ng) that the Hierarchy stands . PREPARATION FOR FUTURE ACTIVITY AND WO RK Octobe r 1941 Certain que stions arise in the minds of all disciples anent the general pos ition of the hierarchical effort, about th e pos sibility of materialising the Plan, and particularly conc erning the share in these plans which spiritual groups can unde rtake. I woul d have you remember that disciples learn to work with the"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST plan by working ; they learn to discove r the inne r expa ndi ng cons cious ness of hum anity by the developm ent of an increasing sensitivity to it; and they find their cow orkers in the Plan by the old and tried method of trial and error. The less evol ved the disciple and worker, the larger the num ber of trials and the gre ater the num ber of errors. But the system works, for it is an eliminating as well as a perfecting process, and the residue which remains after due effort, can be trusted. You have thos e, finally, who remain and who are worthy of trust. Why doe s this syste m work? Because by its means the graces of hum ility, prom pt obe dience to soul injunc tion, and inne r integrity are unf olded and develope d. Where these are present, there will be found sureness of touc h when humanity is cont acted; sensitivity to the impressi on of the Hierarchy when that Hierarchy is seeking cont act; and a right sense of propor tion. One of the difficulties which com es to the server immersed in the thick of the unde rtaking is that of preserving cont act with the vision. I refer to the vision it self and not to its materialisation. Perhaps I can make my meaning clear if I point out that, just as long as the cont act is a vertical one , the work is fairly simple, the next step is appa rent and plain, the line of activity to be follow ed is clear and th e inspiration is fresh and vital. But the mom ent that the cons ciousness of the disciple becom es inclusive hor izont ally (and that must take place), then the difficulty becom es great, and the disciple begins to unde rstand — for the first time — the tr ue signi ficance of the words, \"the Cross of the Saviour.\" Yet if he can train himself to stand where the four arms meet (I am here speaking sym bol ically) he will discove r that he stands in the place of pow er, and at the \"midw ay poi nt.\" Then he can truly be gin (again speaking sym bol ically) to look off to the four corners of the earth, bot h subjectively and obj ectively, and with reality; immediately the strain is terrific. This is one of the difficulties conf ront ing the New Group of World Servers at this tim e. You will remember that som e little time back I spoke of the crisis with which the group is faced. How can I expr ess in words the nature of this crisis? It is that of the invoc ation or the precipitation of the Plan, for thos e two words are synonym ous . Th is necessarily invol ves a strain — the strain of prolonge d inne r cont act and realisation, plus the effort to use skill in action and due phys ical plane executive ability. The New Group of World Servers is therefore toda y pul led two ways. Its effort must be t o stand ready at the centre. The new group toda y stands at the very centre and must preserve and hol d its pos ition at all costs. That which signi fies the most at this time is the spiritual poi se and the spiritual sensitivity of the workers. It is to this important condi tion that the group members must pay due attention. Disciples and spiritual workers must not be so occupi ed with the details of the Plan, with the produc tion of that which will produc e the externalisation of the ideas, that the spiritual tra ining and strengt hening of the workers is neglected. In the dus t and turmoil and noi se of the fight , grow not insensitive and hard, or so preoccupi ed that the needs of thos e with whom you work are forgotten or pass unnot iced. Let love be the keynot e in all relations hips, for the pow er which must salvage the world is the precipitation of love, and how shall that find its way ont o the phys ical plane save through a group whos e ears are attune d to its imminent emergence, and through the lives of thos e in the group who are irradiated by love itself? It is here that there is lack — not intentiona lly or because of the existence of its oppos ing qua lity — but simply through world pressure and strain. In the unfoldm ent of goodw ill in the world at the close of t he war — which will be one of the major tasks of the New Group of World Servers — let love be the active force among the senior members of the group. I woul d like to see more of it among all of you. As the executive side of the group work grow s, and the will aspect of hum anity is cont acted and its"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST pow er used to evoke the emerging crisis of love , an increasing num ber of workers with first ray qua lities will be drawn into the ranks of the New Group of World Servers. This cons titutes the second difficulty, and it is here that I feel the need to utter a word of warning. This com ing in will greatly strengt hen the work but brings with it also great probl ems. Much of the work done hitherto has been second ray work; its qua lity is gentler, its techni que is that of bui l ding and teaching, and its workers are magne tic and they present, when brought toge ther, no great probl ems of cohe sion and of group integration. Of this aspect of work, the Arcane School is an example. When, how ever, first ray workers appe ar to aid in the expa nsion of the work and to carry it to the four qua rters of the earth, then certain difficulties inevitably appe ar. It is the dyna mic qua lity of the pow er aspect which must be gua rded against, not in the sense that it must not be permitted expr ession, b ut in the sense that it must be motivated by love , harnessed to gentleness, and qua lified by unde rstandi ng. The probl em, therefore, will be to integrate first ray workers into the New Group of World Servers in such a manne r that the destructive aspect of the ray will not cause difficulty, produc e disrupt ion or any obl iteration of the dom inant love note which shoul d be the out standi ng characteristic of all workers with the Plan at this time. Otherwise, the precipitation of the crisis of love will be hinde re d. I woul d ask for an intensification of love between all of you , and a grow th of real unde rstandi ng. Forget not , at the same time, that love is the great attractive magne tic force, and will cons eque ntly draw to itself all that is needed at the present crisis and for the materialisation of the vision in due form on earth. This will requi re spiritual energy, sound bus iness sense, skill in action and financial suppor t. Remember that mone y is the cons olidation of the lovi ng, living energy of divini ty, and that the greater the realisation and expr ession of love , the freer will be the inflow of that which is needed to carry forward the work. You are working with the energy of love and not with the energy of desire, the reflection or distortion of love . I think that if you will ponde r on this, you will see the way more clearly. There are many first ray workers wielding the pow er of desire and thus materialising mone y. There are many first ray workers findi ng their way into the ranks of the workers among the New Group of World Servers. Unless these workers are swept by love , their first ray energy will wreck the work of the group. Yet they are needed at this time, for they have the strengt h to stand unm ove d at the centre. It is the conj unc tion of the firs t and second ray workers which can carry the world through the com ing crisis of Recons truction, and it will be of value if this is bor ne in mind by all of you in all work conne cted with the new group. It is impor tant integrating work. You might ask me at this poi nt to be specific and state if there is any signi ficant hindr ance which needs to be offset or change d, onc e realised. An unde rstandi ng of all I have stated above will greatly help, for I have poi nted out three difficulties. Add to this the realisat ion that a right handl ing of the broad issues will autom atically tend to take care of the details. By this I mean that the establishing of sound inne r group relations between all of the workers will produc e that inne r cohe sion and one - poi nted effort which must inevitably and surely produc e the out er results and attract bot h the needed workers and the essential mone y. See to it also that one department of the work is not ove r - empha sised in your minds to the exclusion of others, for that will produc e strain, lack of balance and som etimes a sense of separation, leading if cont inue d, to disrupt ion. Let the cons cious ness be develope d that there is one work being done by all, and that the whol e group is conc erned in the entire activity. This inclusive attitude shoul d permeate the entire organisation, and thus the departmental spirit need not enter in. "},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST One poi nt I will touc h upon for the clarification of your minds . The daily meditation, bot h persona l and in relation to the group, woul d produc e better r esults if the focus of attention were given to the attaining of the needed inne r attitude s, the intensification of the inne r spiritual life of unde rstandi ng and the welding of all workers into one uni ty of service. A uni ted attitude of love , of hope ful exp ectancy, of cour age, of spiritual demand and of directed will is pot ent in results and will bring all that is requi red. Has there not been too much attention in the past to aspects of phys ical plane effort, and to techni que s of working? Has there not been too much cons ideration of how to do the work and too little cons ideration of the spiritual dynam ics of the work itself? The need has been great and the problems many. The expa nsion of the work may seem necessarily to foster a departmental spirit. When suc h situations arise, it is necessary then to intensify the inne r sense of uni ty. Differentiations are easy, for they follow the line of least resistance upon the physical plane. But the work is one work, and the workers cons titute one group . The need now is fusion and group unde rstandi ng. Is it not true that a poi nt of fusion achieved in the daily meditation by an indi vidua l brings about right expr ession in the daily life and a right handl ing of life condi tions ? A poi nt of fusion achieved in group meditatio n will evoke the right results and produc e an instrum ent of service of such pow er that its progr ess will be irresistible. The strain of the past three years has been long and great. Many of the workers are feeling it, and the need for love and strengt h is great. The strain ahead will be no light er, though it will register differently and bring different probl ems, but you are equa l to it and to the task ahead. Success can crow n the efforts being made, and the New Group of World Servers can measur e up to the need, if there is a more cons cious and definite attempt to stand in the centre — the place of lovi ng pow er — and an increased ability to think in terms of group synt hesis and fusion, and to choos e with wisdom thos e who (from inne r developm ent and o uter ability, for these must go toge ther) belong to the group. AN IMPENDING CRUCIAL DECISION December 1941 As the last mont h of the present sad year is upon us, I com e to you with a message. The determination and the inne r pur pos e of hum anity will be so definite dur ing the period when the Sun will begin to move nor thw ard — from December 25th unt il June 22nd, 1942 — that the future of hum anity for many hundr eds of years will be decided. From that decision will date the com ing New Age; on that decision, the Hierarchy will be able to make prediction and determine action; in that decision will be discove red the poi nt in evol ution of the mass of men. I urge you to face the future with strengt h, to free your minds from all vestiges of doubt , and to know (in your own life and for the race) that the forces of materialism and cruelty will not trium ph. Again I say to you, the Hierarchy stands . Go forward with assurance. A deeply root ed subj ective process is taking place in the hum an cons cious ness which is evoc ative a nd produc ing definite effects. This needs to be recogn ised and the nature of invoc ation unde rstood by all who seek to aid their fellow men. As I expl ained elsewhere in detail ( Esoteric Astrology , pages 570 - 575) , this process of invoc ation falls into two sta ges in the life of the indi vidua l and also toda y in the life of hum anity as a whol e. The stage of aspiration , irregul ar and vague but gradua lly becom ing"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST focussed and assum ing pow er; and the stage of mysticism with its unc om fortably recogni sed dua lism; this merges into occultism which is the intelligent study of that which is hidde n. It is because all these stages are actively present toda y that we have the dire and widespread crisis. It was the need to give a cons tructive trend and to focus the invoke d energies which led me, unde r instruction from the Hierarchy, to give out — at widely separated poi nts of time — two Stanzas or parts of a great occult mantram, the first one to help focus the aspirants from whom it met with full respons e; the second w as also offered to the masses, but was intende d to be a test and a \"decision in a time of crisis,\" hence made its appe al to the mentally focussed aspirants and disciples. I am expl aining this because world condi tions toda y warrant the use of both Stanzas now . The Great Invoc ation, as earlier used, shoul d again be made available to the masses. The second Stanza shoul d be used by thinke rs, occultists and disciples, and by all who respond to its not e. In doi ng this there will be need on your part of great \"sk ill in action,\" so that you may rightly and wisely distribut e the two Invoc ations . The one will invoke the Rider from the secret place and aid in His evoc ation, for it is the Rider from the secret place Who is referred to and invoke d in the first Invoc atio n; the other will invo ke the Lords of Liberation. The blende d invoc ation and the uni ted call from the different levels of the hum an cons cious ness will bring a might y appe al to bear upon the hidde n Centres of the \"Saving Force.\" It is this uni ted appe al wh ich must now be organised. Thus the mass of hum anity will be stimulated to move forward into light , and the new world cycle, beginni ng in Aqua rius, will be definitely inaugur ated by hum anity itself. THE ONLY WA Y TO VICTORY April 1942 I have been worki ng with A.A.B. as my amanue nsis since Nove mber 1919. During that period the world has seen great and signi ficant change s, and one of the most signi ficant has been the grow th — the phe nom enal grow th — of spiritual perception. This show s itself in the fact that, in spite of the world catastrophe , in spite of the rampant hor ror and evil which is stalking our planet, and in spite of hum an pain, terror, suspense and unc ertainty, there are today two factors present in the human cons cious ness: the vision of a better future and a fixed, una lterable determination to make that vision fact in hum an expe rience. This better world is to be a world in which the spiritual values will cont rol, viewing thos e values as that which is good and right for the whol e of hum an ity and not simply as religious and theologi cal interpretations . Spiritual perception has becom e inclusive and now conc erns the phys ical plane as well as the metaphys ical. It is not perhaps easy for you to realise the importance of this developm ent which — again in the face of all cont endi ng forces — has enabled men to recogni se that the Kingdom of God must func tion on Earth; that it must be externalised and that it need not be som e distant poi nt of wishful thinking but shoul d condi tion man's daily life and co ntrol all his planni ng for the future. For this, men are toda y working and fight ing. They call the vision by many names: better world condi tions , the new world order, world recons truction, the new civilisation, brotherhood , fellow ship, world federation, in ternationa l"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST unde rstandi ng — it matters not . It is the theme of betterment, of uni versal welfare, of general security, of widespread oppor tuni ty, irrespective of race, colour or creed. This is the factor of impor tance. The unde rlying pur pos es of God are worki ng out , and with this not e I seek to begin my Wesak com muni cation to you . This is the hope ful and most impor tant side from the angl e of the Hierarchy Who view all world events from the angl e of the future. There is, how ever, the other side. It is not nece ssary for me to empha sise the serious ness of the present situation. The war is not yet won. At the time of writing, in spite of spor adic successes and the staying pow er of the Allied Nations , and in spite of a basic trend tow ards ultimate victory, the pow e rs of evil have had things very much their ow n way. They have trium pha ntly move d forward, except in Russia. This was to be expe cted at first, because if evil is simply the dom inance of matter and the negation of the spiritual values, it is obvi o us that on the material plane the line of least resistance is to be found for them. Their initial triumphi ng is, therefore, to be expe cted. The cour se of the war hitherto has demons trated this. When the spiritually - minde d peopl e of the world, the men and w om en of goodw ill, the idealists and the kindl y, decent folk in every land can bring to bear upon the phys ical plane the same uni fied determination and the same uni ted will - to - victory that the forces of evil have show n, then the Forces of Light will assum e the uppe r hand and cont rol hum an affairs. The difficulty with which the Hierarchy was conf ront ed in the effort to bring this about was due to the fact that the condi tion of uni ty of obj ective, of method and of interrelation had to be brough t about without any infringe ment of the free will of the individua l, group or nation. The occult law of spiritual freedom had to be recogni sed and protected. No such recogni tion or safegua rding hinde rs the activities of the forces of evil. The will - to - pow er and an organi sed, evil minor ity took cont rol. Freedom of cons cience and of action was remove d, and the enforced subm ission of the majority to the will of a ruthless minor ity brought about a spur ious but tempor arily most effective uni ty. This has been lacking in the cas e of the United Nations , fight ing for the Forces of Light and on behalf of hum an freedom . Freedom , my brothers, can itself prove a limitation when it delays right action, when it centres attention upon the petty differences and the persona lity inclination s of peopl e and when it serves to prevent that uni ty of action which can win the war. It has been necessary for the leaders of the peopl es to take valuable time to bring them to a prope r sense of values and to the realisation that indi vidua l and nationa l d ifferences and poi nts of pol itical and religious disagreement must all give place to the one supr eme requi rement — the winni ng of the war and the releasing of hum anity from the threatened slavery, the steadily mount ing fear, and the world dom ination of the B lack Lodge . As I have earlier told you, an ancient conf lict is again in full swing and humanity has now the oppor tuni ty to settle it onc e and for all, and — for ever after — be free in a sense not hitherto know n. This conf lict falls into three stag es: 1. The stage of phys ical warfare in which we are now enga ged and from which there is no escape. This requi res the Will - to - victory. 2. The stage of reorganising world affairs when the war is ove r. This shoul d prope rly fall into two pha ses: a. The es tablishing of right hum an relations dur ing a prolonge d armistice, if pos sible. This pha se will"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST prove in many ways as difficult as the war itself, but will work out on mental and emotiona l levels of warfare, instead of phys ical. b. The task of rehabilitati on. This will be bot h phy sical and spiritual in scope and will embrace thos e activities which stretch all the way from the rebui lding of blasted cities, the restoration of the scorched earth, the psychol ogi cal care of the yout h, the sick in mind and the be wildered, and the re - enunc iation of the essential spiritual values which must guide hum anity in the future. This will invo lve the Will - to - good . 3. The stage wherein will com e the recogni tion of the oppor tuni ties of peace, the right use of security, and t he planne d educ ation of the you th of all lands in the principles of the new age. This will invo lve the Will - to - organise. Thus on all three levels of hum an living, manki nd will be condi tione d by a tende ncy tow ards the goo d, the beautiful and the true. Spe aking esoterically, the persona lity of hum anity will be integrated and reoriented tow ards the good life, a new and better way. For the attainm ent of these obj ectives, I sum mon you toda y and all whom you can reach. I shoul d like to incorporate a t this poi nt part of what I said elsewhere. One thing you must cons tantly bear in mind. When the war is ove r, when this time of acute trial and tribul ation have com e to an end, a great spiritual awakening (of a qua lity and a nature qui te unpr edictable now ) will arrive. The war will have taught hum anity many lessons and will have torn the veil of self away from many eyes. Values which have been hitherto expr essed and unde rstood onl y by thos e whos e \"eyes are on God, \" will be the goa l and the desire of unt old thous ands ; true unde rstandi ng between men and between nations will be a longe d - for obj ective, and what hum anity determines to have it ever succeeds in achieving. This is an occult law, for desire is, as yet, the stronge st force in the world; organi sed , un ified desire has been the basic reason for the appa lling Axis successes. The onl y factor which can successfully oppos e desire is Will, using the word in its spiritual connot ation and as an expr ession of the first great divine aspect. There has been but li ttle of that organised, spiritual will show n by the United Nations ; the Allies are animated naturally by desire for victory, desire for the arrival of the end of this all - engul fing world cataclysm, by desire for peace and the return of stability, the desir e to end war onc e and for all and to break its cons tantly recurring cycle, and a steadily mount ing desire to bring to a finish the terrible toll of suffering, of cruelty, of death, of starvation and of fear which is grippi ng hum anity by the throat in the a ttempt to strangl e out its life. But all this determination is in most cases simply the expr ession of a fixed and uni ted desire. It is not the organised use of the will. The secret of the will lies in the recogni tion of the divine nat ure of man . Only this can evoke the true expr ession of the will. It has in fact to be evoke d by the soul , as it dom inates the hum an mind and cont rols the personality. The secret of the will is also closely tied in with the recogni tion of the unc onque rable nature of goodne ss and the inevitability of the ultimate trium ph of good . This is not determination; it is not whippi ng up and stimulating desire so that it can be transmuted into will; it is not an implacable, uns hakable, immova ble focussing of all energies in the need to trium ph (the enemies of the Forces of Light are adept at that). Victory for the United Nations doe s not lie in the effort to produc e this focussing with better effect than the enemy. The use of the will"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST is not expr essed by an iron fixation to stand steady and not yield to evil forces. Determination, the focussing of energy and the demons tration of an all - out effort tow ards victory are onl y (where the United Nations are conc erned) the expr ession of a one - poi nted desire for peace and for an endi ng of the troubl e. This type of effort is som ething which the masses can give, and which they do give on both sides in this conf lict. There is, how ever, a plus, a som ething else, which will swing the tide of victory on to the side of the United Nations . This wi ll com e through the effort to unde rstand and expr ess the qua lity of spiritual Will; it will be the manifestation of that energy which makes the first divine aspect of Will or Pow er what it is; it is that which is the distinctive feature of the Shamballa fo rce; it is that peculiar and distinctive qua lity of divinity which is so different that even Christ Himself was una ble to expr ess it with facility and unde rstandi ng. Hence we have the episode in Gethsemane. It is not easy for me to expr ess its signi ficance in words. Two thous and years have gone since Gethsemane and since Christ made His initial cont act with the Shamballa force, and by this means and on behalf of hum anity established a relations hip which even after two thousand years is but a thin, frail lin e of conne cting energy. This Will force is nevertheless available for right usage, but the pow er to express it lies in its unde rstandi ng (as far as may be pos sible at this midw ay poi nt in hum an evol ution), and in its group use. It is a uni fying, synt hetic force, but can be used as a regimenting, standa rdising force. May I repeat thos e two key words to the use of this Shamballa energy: Group Use and Unde rstandi ng. Manki nd has had much difficulty in com prehendi ng the signi ficance of Love . If that is so, the probl em in relation to the Will will naturally be still more difficult. For the vast majority of men, true love is still onl y a theory. Love (as we usually interpret it) works out as kindne ss, but it is kindne ss to the form side of life, to the persona lities of thos e around us, and fulfils itself usually in a desire to carry out our obl igations and not to obs truct in any way thos e activities and relations hips which tend to the well - being of our fellow men. It expr esses itself in a desire to end ab uses and to bring about happi er, material world condi tions ; it show s itself in mother love , in love among friends , but seldom as yet in love among groups and nations . It is the theme of the Christian teaching, just as Will, divinely expr essed, will be the theme of the com ing world religion, and has been the impul se lying behind much of the good work done in the fields of phi lanthropy and hum an welfare, but factually, true love has never yet been expr essed — except by the Christ. You might ask why, if this is so, do you empha sise this highe st aspect? Why not wait unt il we know more about Love and how to manifest it in our environm ent? Because, in its true expr ession, the Will toda y is needed as a prope lling, expul sive force, and also as a clarifying, purifying agent. The Shamballa energy is therefore that which is related to the livingne ss (through cons cious ness and form) of humanity; we need not cons ider its relation to the rest of the manifested world; it conc erns the establishing of right hum an relations an d is that condi tion of being which eventually negates the pow er of death. It is therefore incentive and not impul se; it is realised pur pos e and not the expr ession of desire. Desire works from and through the material form upw ards ; Will works dow nw ards into form, bendi ng form cons cious ly to divine purpos e. The one is invoc ative and the other is evoc ative. Desire, when massed and focussed, can invoke will; will, when evoke d, ends desire and becom es an immanent, propul sive, driving force, stabilisin g, clarifying, and finally destroyi ng. It is much more than this, but this is all that man can grasp at this time and all for which he has, as yet, the mechanism of com prehension. It is this Will — arous ed by invoc ation — which must be focussed in the light of the soul and dedicated to the purpos es of light , and for the pur pos e of establishing right hum an relations ; it must"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST be used (in love ) to destroy all that is hinde ring the free flow of hum an life and which is bringi ng death (spiritual and real) to hum anity . This Will must be invoke d and evoke d. There are two great handi caps to the free expr ession of the Will force in its true nature. One is the sensitivity of the low er nature to its impact, and its cons eque nt prostitution to selfish ends , as in the case of the sensitive, negative German peopl e and its use by the Axis nations for material obj ectives. The second is the blocking, hinde ring, muddl ed but massed oppos ition of the well - meaning peopl e of the world who talk vague ly and beautifully about love but ref use to cons ider the techni que s of the Will of God in ope ration . According to them, that Will is som ething with which they will persona lly have naught to do; they refuse to recogni se that God works out His Will through men, just as He is ever seeking to exp ress His Love through men; they will not believe that that Will coul d pos sibly expr ess itself through the destruction of evil with all the material cons eque nces of that evil. They cannot believe that a God of Love coul d pos sibly employ the first divine asp ect to destroy the forms which are obs tructing the free play of the divine Spirit; that Will must not infringe upon their interpretation of Love . Such peopl e are indi vidua lly of small mom ent and of no impor tance, but their massed negativity is a real detri ment to the endi ng of this war, just as the massed negativity of the German peopl e, and their inability to take right action when Hitler's pur pos es were disclosed, made pos sible the great inflow of ancient and focussed evil which has brought the present ca tastrophe to man. Such peopl e are like a millstone around the neck of hum anity, crippl ing true effort, murmuring, \"Let us love God and each other,\" but doi ng not hing but murmur prayers and platitude s whilst hum anity is dyi ng. You can easily app reciate the fact that the evoc ation of the energy of the Will and its effect upon the unpr epared, materialistically minde d person might and woul d prove a disaster. It woul d simply serve to focus and strengt hen the low er self - will, which is the name we give to realised and determined desire. It coul d then create such a driving force, directed to selfish ends , that the person might becom e a mons ter of wickedne ss. In the history of the race, one or two adva nced persona lities have done this with dire results, b oth to themselves and to the people of their time. One such figur e in ancient times was Nero; the mode rn example is Hitler. What, however, has made the latter so dange rous ly an enemy of the hum an family is that during the last two thousand years manki nd ha s adva nced to a poi nt where it can also be respons ive to certain aspects of this first ray force. Hitler therefore found associates and coope rators who adde d their receptivity to his so that an entire group became the respons ive agents of the destructive e nergy, expr essing itself in its low est aspect. This is what has enabled them to work ruthlessly, pow erfully, selfishly, cruelly, and successfully, at the destruction of all that attempted to impede their projects and desires. There is onl y one way in whic h this focussed evil will which is respons ive to the Shamballa force can be ove rcom e, and that is by the oppos ition of an equally focussed spiritual Will, displayed by respons ive men and wom en of goodw ill who can train themselves to be sensitive to this ty pe of new incom ing energy and can learn how to invoke and evoke it. You can cons eque ntly see why there was more than the casual use of a current word in my mind when I talked to all of you in terms of goodw ill and of the will - to - good . All the time I had i n my thought s not just kindne ss and good intention, but the focussed will - to - good which can and must evoke the Shamballa energy, and use it for the arresting of the forces of evil. "},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE WE SAK FESTIVAL May 1942 We have no w reached the most impor tant mom ent of the year. This year two such mom ents are broug ht toge ther, reinforcing each other, the Full Moon of May and the Full Moon of June . I woul d have you bear in mind that time and energy are interchange able terms upon the inne r planes. Time is an event, and an event is a focussed expr ession of force of som e type or kind. Two great streams of energy — one focussed through the Buddha and the other focussed through the Christ — are to be fused and blende d and it is the task of the world disciples, the initiates and the accepted disciples to precipitate this com bined energy on to the waiting world where its effective use will be largely depende nt upon the sensitive respons e of the world aspirants. These are to be found in every coun try and their task is to react to the stream of directed energy. These are the poi nts I woul d have you bear in mind as you ende avour to work through and in the ashram; in that ashram are to be found all type s of disciples with all type s and degrees of resp ons iveness. There is an increasing empha sis being given in the West by esotericists to the Full Moon of May, which is the Festival of the Buddha and is held at the time when He makes His annua l cont act with hum anity. This empha sis, which will cont inue to increase for years to com e, has not been brought about in order to impos e recogni tion of the Buddh a upon the Occident. There have been two main reasons why, since 1900, this effort has been made. One was the desire on the part of the Hierarchy to bring to the attention of the publ ic the fact of the two Avatars, the Buddha and the Christ, bot h upon the second Ray of Love - Wisdom , Who were the first of our hum anity to com e forth as hum an - divine Avatars and to embody in Themselves certain cosmic Principles and give them form. The Buddha embodi ed the Principle of Light , and because of this illum ination, hum anity was enabled to recogni se Christ, Who embodi ed the still greater Principle of Love . The poi nt to be borne in mind is that light is subs tance, a nd the Buddha demons trated the cons um mation of subs tance - matter as the medium of Light , hence His title of the \"Illum ined One.\" Christ embodi ed the unde rlying energy of Cons cious ness. The one demons trated the height of the attainm ent of the third divine as pect; the other that of the second aspect, and these two toge ther present one perfect Whol e. The second reason was to initiate, as I have earlier said, the theme of the new world religion. This theme will eventually unde rlie all religious obs ervances, colo ur all appr oaches to the divine centre of spiritual life, give the clue to all healing processes, and — using light scientifically — gove rn all techni que s for bringi ng about cons cious uni ty and relations hip between a man and his soul , and between hum anity and the Hierarchy. The first obj ective has been definitely reached. Today, at the Full Moon of May, many millions everyw here will be turning their thought s tow ards the Buddha , seeking to com e unde r His influence and blessing and that of the Hierarchy at His a nnua l, though brief, return to bless hum anity. This recogni tion will grow unt il the time in the not too distant future when His term of service will be ove r and He will return no more, because the com ing Avatar will take His place in the minds and though ts of the peopl es of the world. His task of remindi ng aspirants cont inuous ly of the pos sibility of illum ination, and His work of keeping a channe l open for the light to irradiate men's minds by piercing annua lly through light subs tance to the Earth is nearly com pleted; the time has nearly com e when \"in that light we shall see Light .\" I woul d ask you to ponde r on these two func tions which the Buddha has performed. There is a third"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST which, in collaboration with the Christ, He has made pos sible; this is the esta blishm ent of a more easily achieved relation between the Hierarchy and Shamballa, thus facilitating the impress of the Will of God upon the minds of men, through the medium of the Hierarchy. This impress we interpret as yet in terms of the divine Plan. Thi s is expr essing itself at present in the keen recogni tion by men everyw here of the need to establish right human relations , culminating in the obj ectives for which the United Nations are fight ing. These have been voi ced for hum anity by two great world disciples in terms of The Four Freedom s and The Atlant ic Pact . These Four Freedom s relate basically to the four aspects of the low er self, the qua ternary. Enough light has been permitted to penetrate by the efforts of the Buddha , to lead to a world - wide recogni tion of the desirability of these formulas; and there is enough love already in the world, released by the Christ, to make pos sible the working out of the formulas. Rest back on that assurance and — in full practice upon the phys ical plane — demons trate its truth. I said \"to make pos sible,\" for the working out lies in the hands of the New Group of World Servers and the men and wom en of goodw ill. Will they prove adequa te for the task? Will they brace themselves for the needed strenuous effort? What now is the task which the Buddha has set Himself this com ing Full Moon? As far as your com prehension is conc erned, it is to evoke in hum anity the spirit of demand , whilst hol ding ope n for them the channe l whereby that demand can reach straight through to S hamballa. This is the poi nt to have in mind as you prepare for the Wesak Festival and attempt to participate in the Full Moon blessing — blessing for the world and not for you rself. The Buddha com es this year, embodyi ng the force which can stimulate men ever yw here to focus their \"massed intent\" and thus reach sym bol ically \"the ear and the heart\" of the Avatar, wresting thus from the secret place of the Most High the aid, help, and directed recogni tion which will bring about a phe nom enal event in due and prope r time. Whilst He is attempting to do this, the Christ will join in the effort by focussing in Himself the spirit of appe al as it is evoke d by the stimulation being appl ied by the Buddha . He will embody that appe al in a great Invoc ation, one which cannot b e given to you , but which He is prepared to use if the appe al com es forth in sufficient strengt h from the peopl e of the world. Will hum anity respond to the evoc ation of the Buddha ? Will their massed intent be vital enough to enable the Christ to becom e Himself, in a mysterious way, the very Spirit of Invocation on their behalf? These are the pos sibilities with which we are conf ront ed this Full Moon of May. It is these which I woul d ask you to have in mind from now unt il the Wesak Moon and on unt il after the June Full Moon. It is at that Full Moon that the Christ can and will use this Invoc ation, provi ded the will of the peopl e permits. At that time He will attempt to reach the Lords of Liberation and evoke Their respons e to the focussed will of t he spiritually minde d peopl e of the world, the aspirants, disciples and initiates; They, if evoke d, can give the impetus which will enable the Christ (as the Rider from the Secret Place) to com e forth in respons e to the \"massed intent\" of the general publ i c. Do you see, therefore, the imminent and vital pos sibilities? Do you recogni se the urgency of the oppor tuni ty? The two Full Moons form one com plete cycle of work and shoul d be prepared for in line with these statements of mine, bot h now and in the years which will follow . As you prepare you r ow n hearts, remember that the Full Moon of May is the time in which the New Group of World Servers and all the esotericists and spiritually oriented peopl e of the world must work in full coope ration with the Buddha , and that the Full Moon of June is the opp ortuni ty for the men and wom en of goodw ill — aided by the New Group of World Servers — to arous e peopl e everyw here to make a great appe al, and by this appe al enable the Christ to invoke for them the needed aid.

If the work is right ly done , He will com e at the set and appoi nted time and the needed aid will be forthcom ing. Mode s and methods are none of you r conc ern. Regard the ancient prophe cies as intrinsically right , true and correct, but recogni se that their phr aseology is sym bol ic and not to be taken literally. How the Lords of Liberation will work can onl y be know n to the Hierarchy. Their aid will be fo cussed upon evoki ng in the Hierarchy those attitude s and capacities which will make pos sible the inflow of energy from Shamballa. Their work is with the Hierarchy, and the reaction of hum anity to Their activity will com e onl y from the New Group of World Servers, and may even then onl y be registered cons cious ly by the senior disciples and initiates. The work of the Avatar, the Rider from the Secret Place, will be primarily with hum anity and will be for their relief and salvation. The first half of this work, focussed through the Buddha , will begin in May 1942. The second half will be started by the Christ in June 1942 , but onl y if the invoc ation of the New Group of World Servers and the massed intent of the men and wom en of goodw ill is adequa tely strong and adequa tely focussed. It will cons eque ntly be a reciprocal process of invoc ation and evoc ation, facilitated by the extreme readiness to act and to respond on the part of Thos e invoke d by hum anity, but handi cappe d by the lack of sensitivity and t he weakne ss of the will of thos e seeking aid. It is this inadequa cy which the Buddh a hope s to remove when He com es to His peopl e in May. It is the strengt hening and focussing of the will which the Christ is ende avour ing to foster with a special effort in J une . These two Full Moons are therefore of paramount impor tance and shoul d have a definite effect subc ons ciou sly upon the minds of the New Group of World Servers and upon the hearts of the men and wom en of goodw ill in every land, nation and group. Let you r meetings , you r meditation and you r indi vidua l thinki ng be steadily focussed upon these poi nts, and ende avour to enter into the Full Moon exercises — bot h of May and June — with as clear an unde rstandi ng of what is taking place as you can and a clear picture of the pos sibilities which can come as the result of right action. Both the Full Moons shoul d be times of effective service. The Buddha does not requi re invoki ng. He will com e. But the spirit of invoc ation needs evoki ng from the masses and it is this work that aspirants everyw here can aid the Buddha in bringing out , standi ng thus with Him and with the Hierarchy. At the time of the Full Moon of June , and in preparation for the oppor tuni ty dur ing the entire mont h of May, the poi nt of focus for all servers must be the Christ and every effort must be directed to aiding His work as Representative for the peopl e. He will ende avour to gather into Himself all that they have of appe al, prayer and demand — voi ced or unvoi ced — transmitting it in an act of spiri tual intent to Shamballa. A mobi lising of the Forces of Light is goi ng on upon the inne r side of life. These Forces stand ready, but the word for action must com e from the Christ, and He will give that word when the peopl e give it to Him. We are the condi tione rs of our ow n destiny. Neither the Christ nor the Hierarchy may, at this stage in hum an evol ution, take any step vitally affecting hum anity unl ess released into this activity by hum anity itself. From April 15t h till June 15t h are critical weeks, spir itually and materially, and this is one of the impor tant facts I want at this time to bring to your attention. I cannot detail to you what you shoul d do or what shoul d be your line of ende avour . I can give you a general idea of the hierarchical Appr oach an d the nature of the hum an problem. The rest lies in your hands . Even if the work done is entirely successful, the time of the Appe aring and of divine intervention by the Forces of Light , through the medium of Their Agents, the Lords of Liberation and the Christ is"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST depende nt upon many factors beside that of right invoc ation. Of these you can know little, if anyt hing. The que stion of right timing is one of deep esoteric signi ficance and is basically invol ved here. The next three years are years of fulfilment and for that period the aspirants of the world are asked to stand steady in patient, yet convi nced, expe ctancy. The task to be done by the Hierarchy invol ves not only the phys ical plane but also the inne r planes of causes and impul ses, of though t and desi re. This all disciples know but are apt to forget. The critical situation upon the outer plane is onl y a reflection of still more critical inne r condi tions , and you can give acceptable help if you evoke your ow n will and cont rol your emotions , d isciplining your persona lity. Thus you will be able to present a tiny focal poi nt through which the spiritual Forces can work. Through the agency of the many tiny poi nts of light and will, much pot ency can be transmitted. It is the will - to - victory that is demande d at this time; it is the will - to - invoke that which is needed; it is the will - to - focus and through this focussing to aid in the great act of invoc ation for which the Christ is at this time preparing Himself; it is the will - to - goo dne ss, to self - cont rol and to the evoc ation of right action for which the Hierarchy asks toda y. If humanity doe s its part, it will find that Hierarchy more than ready to respond and do its share in bringi ng about world release from the Forces of Evil. Will you ponde r on thi s and will you coope rate in every pos sible way? The plans may be laid, the vision may be seen but unl ess everyone recogni ses his essential cont ribut ion and his real usefulness, not hing can be done . There are no limitations when true esoteric work is unde rt aken. To this end, I seek to empha sise renewed appl ication to meditation and a cons tant steady use of the Invoc ation, particularly the one which begins by invoki ng the Lords of Liberation. \"This work,\" Christ said, \"goe th not forth save by prayer and fast ing.\" I call you to prayer and to meditation for bot h are needed toda y, fusing as they do the emotiona l and mental bodi es into one aspiring whol e. I call you to discipline, for that is the meaning of fasting and to the cons tant effort to live at the highe s t pos sible poi nt all the time; this is so often a dream but not often a fact. Toda y, in the hour of the world's need, aspirants and disciples who are willing to make at least cons istent, persistent effort are needed by hum anity and the Hierarchy. My broth ers, I have presented the picture; I have held before you for years the vision of oppor tuni ty, service and discipleship. I have outlined to you the mechanism of service which already is in existence and which can be galvanised into activity and world usefu lness. I leave the matter in your hands , asking you to remember that the uni ted interest, love , service and mone y of the many is far more pot ent than even the cons ecrated effort of the two or three. No one is futile or useless, unl ess he choos es so to be. And in the meantime, paralleling your subj ective work and externalising you r inne r ende avour must be your work for your count ry and for your fellow men in hum anity's hou r of need. There must be steadiness, selflessness and silence, plus cour age and conf idence — conf idence in the strengt h of your ow n soul s, conf idence in the watching Hierarchy and conf idence in the Plan. The end of tribulation is not yet, but it is in sight . With this thought I leave you. May the blessing of the Masters rest upon yo u as a group and as indi vidua ls, and may the Holy Ones Whos e pupi ls you seek to becom e show you the light you seek, give you the strong aid of Their compassion and Their wisdom unt il you stand where the One Initiator is invoke d, unt il you see His star shin e forth.

This pos sibility exists and is centred in the two great Avatars, the Buddha and the Christ. It is difficult to write clearly about this matter of world glamour 7 Glam our : A World Probl em . It is include d here to preserve the historical seque nce of the teaching in relation to world events.* because we are in the midst of its most conc entrated expr ession — the worst the world has ever seen because glamour , incident to centuries of greed and selfishness, of aggr ession and materialism, has been focussed in a triplicity of nations . It is, therefore, easily to be seen and most effective in manifestation. Three nations expr ess the three aspects of world glamour (illusion, glamour and maya) in an amazing manne r, and their pow erful assault upon the cons cious ness of hum anity is depen dent not onl y upon the respons e of Germany, Japan and Italy to this ancient miasma but also upon the fact that every nation — the United Nations as well as the Totalitarian Nations — are tainted with this universal condi tion. The freedom of the world is cons eq uently largely depende nt upon thos e peopl e in every nation who (within themselves) have move d forward out of one or other of these \"glamorous illusions of mayavic impressions \" of the hum an soul into a state of awareness wherein they can see the conf lict in its wider terms, i.e., as that existing for them between the Dweller on the Threshol d and the Ange l of the Presence. These peopl e are the aspirants, the disciples and the initiates of the world. They are aware of the dua lism, the essential dua lism, of th e conflict and are not so pre - eminently cons cious of the threefold nature and the differentiated condi tion of the situation which unde rlies the realised dua lism. Their appr oach to the probl em is therefore simpler and, because of this, world direction lies largely in their hands at this time. It is right here that religion has, as a whol e, gone astray. I refer to orthodox religion. It has been preoccupi ed with the Dweller on the Threshol d and the eyes of the theologi an have been held upon the material, phe n om enal aspect of life through fear and its immediacy, and the fact of the Ange l has been a theory and a poi nt of wishful thinki ng. The balance is being adjusted by the hum anitarian attitude s which are so largely com ing into cont rol, irrespective of any the ologi cal trend. These attitude s take their stand upon belief in the inna te right ness of the hum an spirit, in the divinity of man and upon the inde structible nature of the soul of manki nd. This inevitably brings in the conc ept of the PRESENCE, or of God Imm anent and is the result of the needed revol t against the one - sidedne ss of the belief in God Transcende nt. This spiritual revol ution was entirely a balancing process and need cause no basic conc ern, for God Transcende nt eternally exists, but can onl y be see n and know n and correctly appr oached by God Immanent — immanent in indi vidua l man, in groups and nations , in organised forms and in religion, in hum anity as a whol e and in the planetary Life Itself. Hum anity is toda y (and has been for ages) battli ng illusion, glamour and maya. Adva nced thinke rs, thos e upon the Proba tiona ry Path, upon the Path of Discipleship, and the Path of Initiation have reached the poi nt where materialism and spirituality, the Dweller on the Threshol d and the Ange l of the Prese nce, and the basic dua lism of manifestation can be seen clearly defined.

All generalisations adm it of error. It might , how ever, be said that Germany has focussed in herself world glamour — the most pot ent and expr essive of the three aspects of glamour . Japan is manifesting the force of maya — the crude st form of material force. Italy, indi vidua listic and mentally pol arised, is the expr e ssion of world illusion. The United Nations, with all their faults, limitations , weakne sses and nationa lisms, are focussing the conf lict between the Dweller and the Ange l, and thus the three forms of glamour and the final form of the conf lict between the s piritual ideal and its material oppone nt are appe aring simultaneous ly. The United Nations are, how ever, gradua lly and most decisively throw ing the weight of their effort and aspiration on to the side of the Ange l, thus restoring the lost balance and slow ly produc ing on a planetary scale thos e attitudes and condi tions which will eventually dispel illusion, dissipate glamour and devitalise the prevalent maya. This they are doi ng by the increased clear thinki ng of the general publ ic of all the nations , bound t oge ther to conque r the three Axis Pow ers, by their grow ing ability to conc eive ideas in terms of the whol e, in terms of a desirable world order or federation, and their capacity to discriminate between the Forces of Light and the pot ency of evil or materialism. The work being done by thos e who see the world stage as the arena for the conflict between the Dweller on the Threshol d and the Ange l of the PRESENCE might be itemised as follow s: 1. The produc ing of thos e world condi tions in which the F orces of Light can ove rcom e the Forces of Evil. This they do by the weight of their armed forces, plus their clear insight . 2. The educ ating of hum anity in the distinction between a. Spirituality and materialism, poi nting to the differing goa ls of the co mbatant forces. b. Sharing and greed, out lining a future world wherein The Four Freedom s will be dominant and all will have that which is needed for right living - processes. c.

The dark aspect has been brought about by ages of glamour . The light is being empha sised and made clear by the world aspirants and disciples who by their attitude s, their actions , their writings and their uttera nces are bringi ng the light into dark places. 3. Preparing the way for the three spiritual energies which will sweep hum anity into an era of com prehension, leading to a focussed mental clarification of men's minds throughout the world. These thr ee imminent energies are "},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST a. The energy of the intuition which will gradua lly dispel world illusion, and produc e autom atically a great augm entation of the ranks of initiates. b. The activity of light which will dissipate, by the energy of illum inat ion , th e world of glamour and bring many thous ands on to the Path of Discipleship. c. The energy of inspiration which will bring about , through the medium of its sweeping pot ency, the devitalisation or the remova l, as by a wind, of the attractive pow er of maya o r subs tance. This will release unt old thous ands on to the Path of Proba tion. 4. Releasing new life into the planet through the medium of every pos sible agency. The first step tow ards this release is the provi ng that the pow er of materialism is broke n by t he com plete defeat of the Axis pow ers and, secondl y, by the ability of the United Nations to demons trate (when this has been done ) the pot ency of the spiritual values by their cons tructive unde rtakings to restore world order and to lay thos e founda tions wh ich will gua rantee a better and more spiritual way of life. These cons tructive attitude s and unde rtakings must be assum ed indi vidua lly by every person, and by nations as collective whol es. The first is being unde rtaken at this time. The second remains as y et to be done . 5. Bringi ng hom e to the nations of the world the truths taught by the Buddha , the Lord of Light , and the Christ, the Lord of Love . In this conne ction it might be poi nted out that basically: a. The Axis nations need to grasp the teaching of the Buddha as He enunc iated it in the Four Nobl e Truths; they need to realise that the cause of all sorrow and woe is desire — desire for that which is material. b. The United Nations need to learn to appl y the Law of Love as enunc iated in the life of Chri st and to expr ess the truth that \"no man liveth unt o himself\" and no nation either, and that the goa l of all hum an effort is loving unde rstandi ng , prom pted by a programme of love for the whol e. If the lives and teachings of these two great Avat ars can be com prehende d and wrought out anew in the lives of men toda y, in the world of hum an affairs, in the realm of human thinki ng and in the arena of daily living, the present world order (which is toda y largely disorder) can be so modi fied and change d that a new world and a new race of men can gradually com e into being. Renunc iation and the use of the sacrificial will shoul d be the keynot e for the interim period after the war, prior to the inaugur ation of the New Age. Stude nts need to remember that al l manifestations and every poi nt of crisis are sym bol ised by the ancient sym bol of the poi nt within the circle, the focus of pow er within a sphe re of influence or aura. So it is toda y with the entire probl em of endi ng the world glamour and illusion which f unda mentally lie behind the present acute situation and world catastrophe . The pos sibility of such a dispelling and dissipation is definitely centred in the two Avatars, the Buddha and the Christ. Within the world of glamour — the world of the astral plane a nd of emotions — appe ared a poi nt of light. The Lord of Light , the Buddha , unde rtook to focus in Himself the illum ination which woul d eventually make pos sible the dissipation of glamour . Within the world of illusion — the world of the mental plane — appe ared the Christ, the Lord of Love Himself, Who embodi ed in Himself the pow er of the attractive will of God. He unde rtook to dispel illusion by drawing to Himself (by the pot ency of love ) the hearts of all men, and stated this determination in the words, \"And I, if I be lifted from the earth, will draw all men unt o me.\" (John 12: 32) . From the poi nt they then will have reached, the world of"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST spiritual perception, of truth and of divine ideas will stand revealed. The result will be the disappe aring of illusion. The com bined work of these two great Sons of God, conc entrated through the world disciples and through Their initiates must and will inevitably shatter illusion and dispel glamour — the one by the intuitive recogni tion of reality by minds attune d to it, and the other by the pour ing in of the light of reason. The Buddha made the first planetary effort to dissipate world glamour ; the Christ made the first planetary effort tow ards the dispelling of illusion. Their work must now be intelligently carried forw ard by a hum anity wise enough to recogni se its dha rma. Men are being rapidly disillusione d and will cons eque ntly see more clearly. The world glamour is being steadily remove d from the ways of men. These two developm ents have been brought about by the incom ing new ideas, focussed through the world intuitives and released to the general publ ic by the world thinke rs. It has been also largely aided by the well - nigh unc ons cious , but none the less real, recogni tion of the true meaning of these Four Nobl e Truths b y the masses. Disillusione d and de - glamour ed (if I may use such a term), hum anity awaits the com ing revelation. This revelation will be brought about by the com bined efforts of the Buddha and the Christ. All that we can foresee or foretell anent that revel ation is that som e pot ent and far - reaching results will be achieved by the merging of light and love , and by the reaction of \"light ed subs tance to the attractive pow er of love .\" In this sentence I have given thos e who can unde rstand a profound and useful h int as to the method and purpose of the unde rtaking staged for the June Full Moon, 1942. I have also given a clue to the true understandi ng of the work of these Avatars — a thing hitherto qui te unr ealised. It might be adde d that when an appr eciation of the m eaning of the words \"transfigur ation of a hum an being\" is gained, the realisation will com e that when \"the body is full of light \" then \"in that light shall we see Light .\" This means that when the persona lity has reached a poi nt of pur ification, of dedicati on and of illum ination, then the attractive pow er of the soul (whos e nature is love and unde rstandi ng) can func tion, and fusion of these two will take place. This is what the Christ prove d and demons trated. When the work of the Buddha (or of th e embodi ed buddhi c principle) is cons um mated in the aspiring disciple and in his integrated persona lity, then the full expr ession of the work of the Christ (the embodi ed principle of love ) can also be cons um mated and bot h these pot encies — light and love — wil l find radiant expr ession in the transfigur ed disciple. What is true, therefore, of the indi vidua l is true also of hum anity as a whol e, and toda y hum anity (having reached maturity) can \"enter into realisation\" and cons cious ly take part in the work of enlig htenm ent and of spiritual, lovi ng activity. The practical effects of this process will be the dissipation of glamour and the release of the hum an spirit from the thraldom of matter; it will produc e, also, the dispelling of illusion and the recogni tion of t ruth as it exists in the cons cious ness of thos e who are pol arised in the \"awareness of the Christ.\" This is necessarily no rapid process but is an ordered and regul ated procedur e, sure in its eventual success but relatively slow also in its establishm ent and seque ntial process. This process was initiated upon the astral plane by the Buddha , and on the mental plane when Christ manifested on Earth. It indi cated the appr oaching maturity of hum anity. The process has been slow ly gathering mom entum as these two great Beings have gathered around Them Their disciples and initiates dur ing the past two thous and years. It has reached a poi nt of intensive usefulness as the channe l of com muni cation between Shamballa and the Hierarchy has been ope ned and enlarged, and as the cont act between these two great Centres and Hum anity has been more firmly established. At the June Full Moon, 1942 , will com e the first test as to the directness of the com muni cation between the Centre where the Will of God hol ds sway, the Centre whe re the Love of God rules and the Centre"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST where there is intelligent expe ctancy. The medium of the test will be the uni ted effort of the Christ, of the Buddha and of thos e who respond to Their blende d influence. This test has to be carried out in the midst of the terrific ons laught of the pow ers of evil and will be extende d ove r the two weeks beginni ng on the day of the Full Moon (May 30t h, 1942) and endi ng on June 15t h, 1942. There is a great conc entration of the Spiritual Forces at this time and the use of a special Invoc ation (one which hum anity itself may not use), but the success or failure of the test, in the last analysis, will be determined by manki nd itself. You may feel, though wrongl y, that not enough peopl e know about or unde rstand the nature of the oppor tuni ty or what is transpiring. But the success of such a test is not depende nt upon the esoteric know ledge of the few, the relatively very few, to whom the facts and the information have been partially imparted. It is depende nt also upon the tende ncy of the many who unc ons cious ly aspire tow ards the spiritual realities, who seek for a new and better way of life for all, who desire the good of the whol e and whos e longi ng and desire is for a true expe rience of goodne ss, of right hum an relati ons and of spiritual enterprise among men. Their name is legion and they are to be found in every nation. When the Will of God, expr essed in Shamballa and focussed in the Buddha , the Love of God, expr essed in the Hierarchy and focussed through the Christ, and the intelligent desire of hum anity, focussed through the world disciples, the world aspirants and the men of goodw ill are all brought into line — either cons cious ly or unc ons cious ly — then a great reorientation can and will take place. This event is som et hing that can happe n. The first result will be the illum ination of the astral plane and the beginning of the process which will dissipate glamour ; the second result will be the irradiation of the mental plane and the dispelling of all past illusions and t he gradua l revelation of the new truths of which all past ideals and so - called formulations of truth have onl y been the sign - pos ts. Ponde r on that statement. The sign - pos t indicates the way to go; it doe s not reveal the goa l. It is indi cative bu t not conc lusive. So with all truth up to the present time. The demand is, therefore, for know ers and for thos e whos e minds and hearts are ope n; who are free from preconc eived ideas fanatically held, and from ancient idealisms which must be recogni sed as onl y partial indi cations of great unrealised truths — truths which can be realised in great measure and for the first time if the lessons of the present world situation and the catastrophe of the war are duly learned and the sacrificial will is called into p lay. I have made this practical appl ication and this immediate illustration of teaching anent glamour, illusion and maya because the whol e world probl em has reached a crisis toda y and because its clarification will be the outstandi ng theme of all progr ess — educ ationa l, religious and econom ic — unt il 2025 A.D. Toda y, as hum anity awaits the revelation which will embody the thought s and dreams and cons tructive goa l of the New Age, the demand com es for the first time from a large group of intuitively inclined pe opl e. I said not intuitives, my brothers. This group is now so large and its focus is now so real and its demand so loud that it is succeeding in focussing the massed intent of the peopl e. Therefore, whatever revelation may emerge in the immediate future w ill be better \"protected by the spirit of unde rstandi ng\" than any previous one . This is the signi ficance of the words in the New Testam ent , \"Every eye shall see him\"; hum anity as a whol e will recogni se the Revealing One . In past ages the Messenge r from on High was onl y recogni sed by and know n to a mere handful of men, and it took decades and som etimes"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST centuries for His message to penetrate into the hearts of hum anity. The stress of the times also and the developm ent of the sense of propor tion, plus an enfo rced return to simplicity of living and requi rements may save the com ing revelation from too swift and quick a subm ergence in the fire of the Great Illusion. THE INTERLUDE BETWE EN WA R AND PEACE Augus t 1942 There is an insistent demand from the many thous ands who in the past have read the pamphl ets and articles which I have written, that I say som ething about the com ing period of rehabilitation, and of what can be done (whilst the war is still in progress) to prepare for usefulness at that t ime. When the war broke out , I publ ished an article entitled The Present World Crisis , and in it tried to trace the origins of the conf lict and the factors which made this catastrophe pos sible. Later, anot her article appe ared, called The Com ing World Order , which sought to hol d out to a suffering world a vision of a material and spiritual future which the hearts of men have long demande d. Thus an attempt was made to deal with both the past and the future. More at that time was not pos sible, ow ing to the di suni ty existing among thos e nations which toda y form the United Nations . There was also a lack of unde rstandi ng and a selfish perspective among those nations at that time neutral. Above everything else was the fact that the issues invol ved had to be settle d by hum anity itself and it was not then pos sible to foretell with any accuracy what hum anity woul d do. Even the most enlight ened of men and the spiritual leaders of the race coul d not judge what line manki nd woul d take or whether there were enough clear - s ight ed peopl e in the world who coul d and woul d sweep the mass of men into effective oppos ition to the Axis Pow ers. The que stion was: Woul d world fear and universal selfishne ss dom inate, or woul d the spirit of freedom and the love of liberty be strong enoug h to weld the free nations into one uni ted and steadfast whol e? Toda y the issue is clear and the end inevitable. The free nations and the defeated and enslaved little nations are subj ectively and practically uni fied into one intense spiritual determinatio n to win the war; the fate of the Axis Nations is therefore una lterably settled, even though , at this time of writing, they seem to be victorious all along the line. It is onl y the time of the final victory of right against might which remains a s yet the factor of unc ertainty, and this is ow ing to the enormous prepared strengt h of the aggr essor nations and the unp reparedne ss of the democracies. This unpr eparedne ss is being rapidly remedied. This article is an attempt to indi cate the probl ems, an d perhaps som e of the solutions , which must inevitably fill the interlude between the endi ng of the war and the com ing world order. It will be necessary to deal with this subj ect in a broad and general way, for the subj ect is too vast for us to be intellig ently specific. We can, how ever, cons ider the immediate work to be done in preparation for the cessation of war and indi cate the first steps which can and shoul d be taken to initiate sound recons truction processes. The period of rehabilitation and of recon struction shoul d be the deep conc ern toda y of all who love their fellow men."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST There are thos e who will cons ider the study of the com ing recons truction period as premature. They believe (and right ly) that our first immediate conc ern is to win the war, and wi th this I am fully in agreement. The will - to - victory is the first and basic essential, for there will be no true recons truction activity if the Axis nations trium ph. But there are many toda y whos e task is not that of fight ing and whos e place and func tion i s perforce in the civilian aspects of the life of the nations . These can think, and talk, and work in preparation for the future. There are others who feel that onl y the trained expe rt in the fields of econom ic and pol itical readjustment can appr oach this difficult probl em with any hop e of making a useful cont ribution. Still others feel that peace is the onl y thing that matters and that it shoul d be follow ed by a long period of mental qui et in every count ry; they believe that peopl e everyw here are too exha u sted and unha ppy to be ready as yet to unde rtake any work of rebui lding. Others again are so com pletely pessimistic that they despair of ever reclaiming the world, and they look sadly for a breakdow n of all the civilised processes of living. There is som e truth in all these poi nts of view. The work of the expe rts will be sorely needed, but the unde rstandi ng interest and the sustaining pow er of thos e whos e hearts are aflame with love can alone make their work pos sible. It will not be the instituti ona lised activities and the financial enterprise of econom ic and social workers and gove rnm ent agents which will alone be needed, but above all else, the solution must be found in the upr ising of goodw ill in the hearts of men. This will provide the right c om passiona te incentive. Most certainly the world coul d be rehabilitated for purely com mercial and selfish reasons , and because trade interchange , buyi ng and selling capacity and the restoration of financial stability are important factors in world restorat ion. But these are not the basic motives which woul d restore hum anity to self - respecting and secure living. They will provi de the motive pow er for many men and groups , but not the motive which can produc e true cons tructive rebui lding of the fabric of hum an life. The work of recons truction will be the work of the intelligent men and wom en of goodw ill, and theirs will be the task to restore new life and happi ness to hum anity, and it is for them I write. Please bear this in mind. I am not writing for techni ca l expe rts and trained advi sors to the gove rnm ent, but to thos e who have goodw ill in their hearts to all men, and who, because of it, want to do their share in bringi ng tranqui llity and peace to the world — a peace based on surer values than in the past and u pon sounde r planni ng. In the last analysis, it is not peace for which the men of goodw ill are working, but for the grow th of the spirit of unde rstandi ng and coope ration; this alone will be strong enough to break dow n racial barriers, heal the wounds of war , and bui ld a new world structure adequa te to the intelligent demands of the masses. In the earlier pamphl ets, I sought (along with many other thinki ng peopl e) to indicate the steps which might be taken to avert the impendi ng cataclysm. Among the most imp ortant upon which empha sis was laid was the grow th of world goodw ill, for goodw ill is the active principle of peace . I sought also to stress internationa l unde rstandi ng, a future of shared planetary resour ces, and a recogni tion of a general hist orically - prove d gui lt in relation to the war, plus thos e ideas which coul d — if develope d — end the era of separativeness. In spite of all the efforts of the men of goodw ill, of all the peace organisations , and the enlightened work of the world thinke rs, educ ators and leaders, two things happe ned which it had been hope d might be averted. The first was a definite and focussed precipitation of the spirit of evil and of materialism through the medium of the Axis nations , using the aggr ession of Japan as the initi al focal poi nt and expr essing itself later in full force through Germany. The second was the failure of the neutral nations , in the early stages of the war, to take the needed steps to ally themselves actively with the nations fight ing totalitarianism, and their inability to realise the full hor ror of what lay ahead for manki nd. The"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST selfishne ss of hum anity was even more deep - seated than was grasped, and the United Nations came into coope rative activity onl y after two years of war and the planne d rape of man y of the neutral nations . The blindne ss of the neutral nations definitely ups et the calculations of far - sight ed workers for world good and serious ly delayed the endi ng of the war. The critical poi nt is now passed, and the hum anitarian grasp of the issues invol ved, and the uni ty existing among the Allied Nations , gua rantee the inevitable defeat of the Axis Pow ers. Other factors also ensure the ultimate victory of the forces of right and the freedom of the world. There is not time to enlarge upon them, but t hey can be listed and people can then see how assuredly they gua rantee the trium ph of the free peopl es of the world. These factors are: 1. The will - to - victory is steadily grow ing. Appe asement, pacifism and unc ertainty are as steadily dyi ng out . 2. The pl ight of humanity everyw here, as the result of Axis aggression, is definitely steadyi ng publ ic opi nion and evoki ng an una lterable determination to end the evil initiated and carried forward by Germany and Japan, aided som ewhat unw illingly by Italy. 3. The resour ces of the United Nations are vast and are now in process of mobi lisation. Their massed use and their manuf acturing pot ential are practically inexha ustible and are rapidly being organised. The man pow er and the resour ces of Germany and of her allies have reached their peak, bringi ng enor mous present pot ency, but a steady decline is indi cated for the future. 4. The issues in this war are being increasingl y clearly realised; even the ignor ant and the prejudi ced recogni se toda y that these iss ues can be groupe d unde r three major pos itions , and this enables them to make a persona l choi ce as to loya lties. a. The democratic pos ition, with its empha sis upon the Four Freedom s and the Atlantic Charter, ensuring right human relations and the endi ng of aggr ession. b. The totalitarian pos ition, with its empha sis upon world dictatorship, the slavery of the many conque red nations , its anti - racial bias and its blatant cruelty and terrorism. c. The appe asement and the pacifist attitude s — idealistic and impr actical and findi ng their focus toda y in the attitude of Gandhi . He brings into clear perspective the unc om prom ising, fanatical attitude which is non - realistic and which will willingl y sacrifice lives, nations and the future of hum anity in order to attain its obj ect. If Gandhi were to succeed in his objective now , it woul d precipitate civil war in Indi a, sacrifice all immediate hope of freedom for that count ry, permit the Japanese to realise an easy conque st of Indi a, bring about a slaught ering of count less thous ands , and permit Germany to join hands with Japan across Asia, with the appa lling proba bility of a totalitarian victory. These three poi nts of view are toda y being clearly realised by men everyw here, and their decisions as to loya lties and adhe rence s are clarified. 5. The spirit of freedom is trium phi ng in every land (even in the conque red count ries, much to the bewilderment of Germany) , and the beauty of the hum an spirit is emerging everyw here, bot h in the conque red lands and in the nati ons fight ing, with their backs to the wall, for hum an liberty. 6. An intense interest in after - war condi tions is evidenced by the utterances of leaders, pol iticians,"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST lecturers and the spiritually minde d men everyw here; this is testified to by the articles , pamphl ets, books , speeches and plans dealing with the new world order. The forces of rehabilitation and of goodw ill are rapidly mobi lising; they cons titute a great army within all nations , and they are an invi sible army, but one which is as yet inchoa te, uncertain as to method and process, though clear as to goa ls and principles. The above six factors ensure the defeat of the Forces of Evil and the trium ph of the Forces of Light , and with these as the basis of opt imism we can look ahead with sure hope to the endi ng of the war, to the demobi lisation of the armies, to the tranqui l passage of the seven seas and to the time when fear begins to die out . What then will be the dange rs to be offset? For what must we be prepared when the task of recons truction co nfront s us? It might be useful to enum erate som e of the dange rs for which we must be prepared. Let us cons ider them in the order of their impor tance: 1. The dange r of too prom pt a peace settlement . Let us work hard for a prolonge d armistice, during which the heat of battle and the fires of revenge can have time to die dow n, the agony of manki nd can be assuaged, and time be gained for calm, unhu rried planni ng. 2. The dange r of a return to so - called nor mality . The out standi ng disaster which faces hum anity a t this time is a return to the state of affairs prior to the outbreak of war, and the rehabilitation of the old familiar world, with its imperialism (whether of empire or finance), its nationa lisms and its distressed, expl oited minor ities, its vile distinc tions and separative barriers between rich and poo r, between the oriental and the occidental, and between the castes and classes which are found in every land — withou t any exception. 3. The dange rs incident to the necessary adj ustments between t he nat ions . Any adjustment made upo n the basis of historical tradition or ancient bounda ries will onl y serve to plunge the world again into war. These adjustments must be carried out on the basis of hum anity itself; the will of free peopl es must be the det ermining factor and not the will of techni cal, pol itical expe rts, or of som e ruling class or group. In the world which is com ing, the hum an equa tion will take a predom inant pos ition; hum an beings will determine, as far as in them lies, their ow n destiny an d men will exercise their free will in establishing the kind of world in which they choos e to live. They will decide in which count ry they prefer to claim citizenship and the type of gove rnm ent to which they choos e to give allegiance. This will necessarily all take time and must be an unhur ried process. It will call for a planne d educ ation of the masses in every count ry; and the principles of freedom , and the distinction between freedom and license, will have to be carefully taught . A new world based upon t he restoration of territorial limits, historically determined, will fail to end strife, aggr ession and fear. A new world based on hum an values and right hum an relations can institute (slow ly to be sure, but inevitably) that new civilisation which men of go odw ill demand for hum anity as a whol e. 4. The dange rs grow ing out of hat e, revenge and pain. These dange rs will be the most difficult to avoi d. A deep - seated hatred of the Nazi regime (and of the German nation as endor sing that regime) is steadily rising. This is almost inevitable, being based on the facts of Nazi activity. The task of the United Nations after the war will of necessity be — among other things — to protect the German peopl e from the hate of thos e whom they have so appa llingly abus ed. This will be no easy thing to do. Retribut ion and revenge must not be permitted, and yet at the same time a just pay ment for evil action cannot , and shoul d not , be avoided . The law ever works, and that law states that whatsoever a man or"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST nation sow s, that shall it also reap. Germany has sown evil broadcast throughout the civilised world, and for som e time to com e her lot must be hard and she will have to pay in sweat and toil and tears for her evil deeds. But this paym ent shoul d be part of the great work o f rehabilitation and not a venge ful exaction, and if this is borne in mind, no serious mistakes will be made. The German peopl e must work strenuous ly to put right the evil they have done , as far as in them lies, but the next generation — at present in the cr adle or at school — must not be penalised. The little children and the babies of the German race — innoc ent of the wrong actions of their fathers and brothers — shoul d not be implicated in the penalties exacted. The young men of toda y in Germany must, by the lab our of their hands and the sweat of their brow s, rebui ld that which they have so ruthlessly destroye d, but the unof fendi ng, thoug h weak, elderly peopl e, the little children and the adolescent boys and girls must be exempt and must be trained to be citizens of a better and a finer Germany than has ever yet existed — a Germany that is a cons tructive part of the whol e and not a menace and a terror to all right - thinki ng men. The arous ing of the men of goodw ill in every nat ion — men who see hum ani ty as a whol e and a ll men as brothers — is the onl y way in which this rising tide of hat e can be stemmed. It will not be stemmed by telling thos e who have suffered at the hands of the Axis nations that they must not hate, or by exho rting peopl e who have been the victims of tra itors that they must not bear ill - will to such men as Quisling and Laval. It will be offset by a great demons tration of practical love and unde rstandi ng on the part of the United Nations — a love which will work out in the form of food for the hungr y, nur sin g for the sick, the rebui lding of the ruined cities, and the restoration of the \"scorched earth.\" The probl ems of hate and revenge will requi re the utmost skill in handl ing and will necessitate exceedingl y wise action on the part of the free nations. 5. The dange r to hum ani ty of the effects of war upo n the children and the adol escents of the nat ions . The children of toda y are the parents of the com ing generations , and they have been through a shattering psychol ogi cal expe rience. They can scarcel y ever be truly nor mal again. They have seen the very depths of cruelty, wickedne ss, pain, horror, terror and unc ertainty. They have been bom bed, shell - shoc ked and machine - gunne d. They have know n no security and look forward toda y to no sure future. Millio ns have know n no parental cont rol; they have been separated by war from their families and freque ntly do not even know their ow n names. Even when the family uni t has been preserved intact, their fathers are usually enga ged in war work, either at hom e or ab road, and their mothers are working in factories or on the land; the children have therefore no hom e life or cont rol. Malnut rition has weakened their stamina and rampant evil has unde rmined their morale and their standa rds of value. From the hum anitarian a nd spiritual standpoi nt, the vital probl em after the war will be the restoration of the children of the world to happi ness, security, prope r standa rds of life and conduc t and som e measure of unde rstandi ng cont rol. This is essentially a problem of educ ation . Educ ators and psychol ogi sts of vision in every count ry must be mobi lised and the \"pattern of things to com e\" for the children must be intelligently determined. This will have to be done on an internationa l scale and with the wisdom which com es from a gra sp of immediate need and a far - sight ed vision. 6. The dange rs of re - emergence of the nat ional ist spirit . Intense nationa lism was one of the prime move rs in bringing about this war and no nation has been exempt from this spirit of nationa l pride and from a nationa listic, separative out look . Selfish interests have cont rolled the reasons for which every nation has entered this war; indi vidua l security has prom pted the entry of even the most enlight ened democratic nations . That to these selfish incentives they have adde d world need and the love of freedom is true and serves to balance, though not offset, the selfish motives; that the instinct of self - preservation gave them no alternative is likewise true, but the fact remains that there woul d hav e be en no war if the democratic nat ions had been the determining factor . That in itself gives rise to que stions . Why did the pow erful democracies, in the last analysis, permit this war when, uni ted and bande d toge ther from the start, they might have arrested i t in the initial stages? Also, given the existent"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST aggr essor nations , collective self - interest forced the democracies into com bat, and yet this same self - interest shoul d have made them take the steps which woul d have gua ranteed the peace. Nationa l type s, in dividua l nationa l interests, nationa l cultures and nationa l civilisations exist side by side, but instead of being regarded as cont ribut ory to one integrated whol e, they have been zealous ly com petitive and have been regarded as the peculiar and distinctive prerogatives of som e one nation and as existing for the sole good of that nation. In the future, the cont ribut ory factor in life must be empha sised and develope d, and the good of the entire family of nations must be subs tituted for the good of one nation or a group of nations . The educ ation of the publ ic in this ideal necessitates no loss of nationa l identity or indi vidua l culture. That must remain and be develope d to its highe st spiritual goa l for the enriching and the collective good of all. It is only t he motive for the empha sis of any specific racial and nationa l culture which must be change d. The family of nations , viewed as a uni t, its correct and prope r interrelation, and the shoul dering of respons ibility for the one , or for the weak, must be the re alised goa l of all nationa l enterprise; the resour ces of the entire planet must be shared collectively and it must be increasingl y realised that the produc ts of the earth, the gifts of the soil, the intellectual heritage of the nations , belong to the whol e of manki nd and to no one nation exclusively. No nation liveth unt o itself, any more than any indi vidua l can happi ly so live; the nation or indi vidua l who attempts so to do must inevitably perish off the face of the earth. All nations have made this selfish attempt, as history, ancient and mode rn, goe s to prove . Their tradition, their resour ces, their nationa l genius, their past history, their mineral and agricultural produc ts, their strategic pos ition on the planet, have been used in past centur ies for the benefit of the nation claiming them; they have been expl oited for the increase of the pow er of that nation at the expe nse of the suffering of others. This is the sin which Germany is toda y com mitting, aided by Japan and feebly follow ed by Italy . Pow er pol itics, the expl oitation of the weak, aggr ession, econom ic selfishne ss, ideals based on pur e com mercialism and materialistic and territorial goa ls colour all the past history of manki nd in bot h hemisphe res, and have laid the founda tion for the pr esent war. Som e nations , particularly the great democracies, like the British Com monw ealth of Nations and the United States of America, now realise that these attitude s and activities must end and that the hope of the world lies in the spread of right hum an relations, in econom ic interchange , broad uns elfish internationa l pol itics and the grow th of the spirit of coope ration. They believe una lterably, and as a basic nationa l pol icy, in the right s of the indi vidua l and that the State exists for the benefit o f that indi vidua l; to that they add the belief that the State also exists for the benefit of all other states and for hum anity as a whol e. Other nations , such as the Axis Pow ers, are violently crystallising the ancient viewpoi nts, empha sising the worst asp ects of the old and evil order, and are aggr essively grasping all that they can for themselves. They regard the indi vidua l as of no value and hol d that he exists onl y for the benefit of the State; they believe that the State is the sole uni t of importance, and that onl y their particular state count s. They divide the family of nations into a supe rstate for the cont rol of Europe and anot her for Asia, and regard all other states as slave states; they woul d perpetuate the ancient evil of force and war and woul d and do resort to unhe ard - of cruelties in the effort to raise their state to supr eme eminence. This is the old order which must pass, but its dangers must be recogni sed. For its abol ishing, the United Nations are fight ing, but the difficulties are many, even though the spiritual strengt h of all good men is on their side and the Forces of Light are fight ing to aid them. The nationa listic spirit is not dead as yet in any count ry. It must be helped to die. Minor ities with historical backgr ounds but no territorial right s are clamour ing for a place to call their ow n and in which to bui ld up a nation. The small nations are full of fear, wonde ring what place in the family of nations they will be permitted to hol d, and whether the"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST evil plans of the Germa ns will spare any of their citizens eventually to form a nation. The demand for nationa l recogni tion is widespread; the empha sis upon hum ani ty as the important uni t is little heard. Thos e nations impede the path of progr ess who live in the memory of their past history and bounda ries and who look back upon what they call \"a glorious past,\" resting upon the recollection of nationa l or empire rule ove r the weak. This is a hard saying, but the nationa listic spirit cons titutes a grave peril to the world; if per petuated in any form, except as contribut ory to the good of hum anity as a whol e, it will throw the world (after the war) back into the dark ages and leave men no better off than they were, even though there have been twenty years of travail and agony. We coul d take the nations , one by one , and obs erve how this nationa listic, separative or isolationi st spirit, emerging out of an historical past, out of racial com plexes, out of territorial pos ition, out of revol t and out of pos session of material resour ces, has brought about the present world crisis and cleavage and this globa l clash of interests and ideals. But it woul d profit not . The intelligent stude nt of history (who has no nationa listic bias) know s well the facts and is deeply conc erned toda y with the p rocesses which must be brought to bear to end the world strife. He know s that the efforts to attain nationa l aggr andi sement, a place in the sun, Lebensraum , financial supr emacy, econom ic cont rol and pow er must end. At the same time he realises t hat if hum anity is to get rid of these evil produc ts of selfishne ss, certain basic values must be preserved. Past and present cultures and civilisations are of great value; the peculiar genius of each nation must be evoke d for the enriching of the entire h um an family; the new civilisation must have its root s in and emerge out of the past; new ideals must com e forth and be recogni sed, and for that the events and educ ation of the past will have prepared the people. Hum ani ty itself must be the goa l of interest and effort, and not any par ticular nat ion or empire . All this has to be wrought out in a practical, realistic manne r, divorced from visiona ry, mystical and impractical dreams, and all that is done must be founde d on one basic recogni tion — hum an brotherhood , expr essing itself in right hum an relations . The revol t so widely prevalent against the \"vague visioni ngs \" of hum anitarian dreamers is based upon the fact that out of the welter of words and the plethor a of plans, little of practical value has emerged an d not hing sufficiently pot ent to end the old and horrid ways of life. Nothing really effective had been done , prior to the war, to offset the visible and shrieking evils. Palliative measures have been tried and com prom ises made for the sake of peace, but t he basic evils of nationa l ambition, econom ic disparity, and virulent class distinctions (hereditary or financial) still remained. Religious differences were rampant, racial hatreds widespread, and the econo mic and pol itical orders remained corrupt , foster ing party, social and nationa l strife. Toda y the war has cleared the air. The issues are clear and at least we know what has been wrong . In their demons tration of supr eme selfishne ss, national ambition, racial hatred and utter barbarity and cruelty, plus their com plete lack of all hum anitarian feeling, the Axis Pow ers have served the race by show ing us what must not , and shall not , be permitted. The democracies have awakened also to their weakne sses and to the realisation that true democracy doe s not as ye t exist, ow ing to widespread pol itical corrupt ion, and to the ignor ance and unpr eparedne ss of the masses for true self - gove rnm ent. Imperialistic pow ers, such as Great Britain, are publicly repudi ating the old poi nts of view and are forging ahead in the task of world recons truction. The cons ervative reactiona ry is no longe r popul ar. The small nations are realising their helplessness and their com plete depende nce upon their larger neighbour s, and these in their turn, are recogni sing their respons ib ilities to the weak and small. Peopl e everyw here are waking up and beginni ng to think, and never again can they sink back into the negative condi tion of the past. There is faith on every hand that a new and better world order is pos sible and that"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST it is eve n proba ble. How can we simply and clearly expr ess the goa l of this hope d - for new world order and word briefly the obj ective which each person and nation shoul d hol d before itself when the war ends and oppo rtuni ty faces each and all? It is surely that ever y nation, great and small (with the minorities given equa l and propor tiona te right s) shoul d pursue its ow n indi vidual culture and work out its ow n salvation as seems best to it, but that each and all shoul d develop the realisation that they are organic par ts of one corpor ate whol e and that they must cont ribut e to that whol e all they have and are. This conc ept is already present in the hearts of count less thous and s and carries with it great respons ibility. These realisations , when intelligently develope d and wisely handl ed, will lead to right hum an relations , econom ic stability (based on the spirit of sharing) and to a fresh orientation of man to man, of nation to nation, and of all to that supr eme pow er to which we give the name \"God. \" This is the vision an d it is hol ding count less thous ands steady in the path of dut y, and for it many in every nation are prepared to work. In spite of the backgr ound of an evil past, in spite of the present world carnage, in spite of the almost ove rwhelming psychol ogi cal probl ems conf ront ing hum anity, in spite of pol itical machinations and old - time diplomacy, in spite of the improba bility of any qui ck successes, there are thous ands ready to start with the preparatory work. The number of men and wom en of vision and of goodw ill is now so large (especially among the United Nations ) that there is a chance of eventual success and it is pos sible toda y to make a start. The out line of the future world structure can already be dimly seen; the failure — com plete, obvi ous and irre mediable — of the old order and the old world is everyw here recogni sed. The will - to - good is grow ing. One of the interesting things which it is helpful to recogni se is that this vision is more clearly seen by the man in the street and by the intelligentsia th an it is by the exclusive classes. Through the material difficulties of life, and by resultant processes of thought , men know change d condi tions are necessary and that there is no alternative. The task ahead falls into two categor ies: First, directing mas s thought and energy into right lines so that good motive and wise action can bring in the desired era of right hum an relations and eventual peace; secondl y, educ ating thos e whos e apathy and lack of vision impede progr ess. This latter pha se of the work is well unde r way and a pow erful, though small, group among the world leaders is voi cing certain general propos itions which must be regarded as imperative when world readjustment starts. Their demand is for a new gove rning principle in pol itics and in educ ati on, founde d on uni versally recogni sed hum an right s, on the need for spiritual uni ty and the need to throw ove rboa rd all separative theologi cal attitude s and dogm as in every field of thought . There is a mount ing appe al not onl y for internationa l unde rstandi ng and coope ration, but also for class unde rstandi ng. These demands are being expr essed from every platform and pul pit and through the pen in every land, except in thos e sad lands where freedom of speech is not permitted. The average man looks on at all o f this and is frequently ove rwhelmed by the magni tude of the unf olding task, by the diversity of opi nions expr essed, by the many sugge stions , plans and schemes for world betterment, and by a sense of his ow n utter unimpor tance and futility in the face of t his gigantic hum an unde rtaking. He asks himself many que stions. Of what use am I? What can I do? How can my little voi ce be heard, and of what use is it when heard? What part can I play in the vast arena of world affairs? How can I prove myself useful and cons tructive? How can I offset my ignor ance of history, of society, of pol itical and econom ic condi tions in my ow n count ry, not to speak of other lands ? Hum anity is so immense, its num bers so vast and its races so many that he feels himself a he lpless, insigni ficant uni t. He has no academic or general training which woul d enable him really to grasp the probl ems or"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST cont ribut e to their solution. What, therefore, can the man in the street, the bus iness man in his office, the wom an in her hom e, and t he average citizen everyw here cont ribut e at this time and in the future to the helping of the world? It is for this type of person I write. I woul d start by remindi ng the general publ ic of one impor tant fact. This is that focussed, determined, enlight ened publ ic opi nion is the most pot ent force in the world . It has no equa l but has been little used. The gul libility of the average citizen, his willingne ss to accept what is told him if it is said loudl y enough and with sufficient plausible force, is well kno wn. The well - turned phr ases of the trained pol itician, intent on his selfish pur pos es, the argum ents of the silver - tongue d demagogue as he expl oits som e pet theory at the expe nse of the publ ic, and the rantings of the man with a cause, a theory or an axe t o grind, all find an easy audi ence. Mass psychology and mob determinations have been expl oited dow n the ages, for the unt hinki ng and the emotional are easily swayed in any direction, and hitherto this has been turned to their ow n adva ntage by those who do not have the best interests of hum anity at heart. It has been used for selfish and evil ends far more often than for good . Of this tende ncy the negative and helpless attitude of the German peopl e unde r the Nazi rulers is the out standi ng example. But this negative receptivity (which doe s not deserve the name of publ ic opi nion) can be as easily turned to good ends as bad, and to cons tructive measures as to destructive. A little planne d direction and a wisely out lined progr amme with this in view can and will bring about the needed change and make a sound and intelligent publ ic opi nion one of the major factors in world recons truction. One of the most interesting features of this war period has been the direct cont act which has been set up by som e of the world leaders with the man in the street and the wom an in the hom e, as witness the talks given by Roos evelt and Chur chill. Thos e given by the Axis leaders are in a totally different categor y, for they have been directed to the male yout h of their count ries and to the man in uniform. Only the lesser leaders in Germany, for instance, talk to the peopl e in their hom es, and then onl y to give them orders, to foster hate and to misrepresent the truth. In all these cases, how ever, the value of mass opi nion is recogni sed and the need to sway the mass mind, either bendi ng it to the will of som e leader, such as Hitler, or educ ating it in thos e principles which are of benefit to the whol e. The second poi nt which needs to be grasped by the average citizen is that t he mass is made up of indi vidua ls; that each of us, as an indi vidua l, is a definite and integral part of the whol e. This is a basic and impor tant fact and has a bearing on our subj ect. The first step in the rebui lding process which lies ahead of us is to r each the individua l, show him his impor tance, indi cate to him his very real sphe re of influence, and then set him to work in that sphe re and with what he has. In this way, his normal and natural sense of futility will disappe ar, and he will gradua lly reali se that he is needed and can do much. Having grasped this for himself, he can then try to bring the same cons tructive attitude to thos e aroun d him, and they will then do likewise. May I poi nt out here that the value of the indi vidua l is surely based on th e inhe rent divinity of the hum an spirit and on the integrity of the whol e. It is founde d also on the know ledge , which must unde rlie all future recons truction work, that at the very heart of the uni verse is a divine Pow er, call it what you will, and on the faith that love is the very law of life itself, in spite of all appe arances and the record of the past. It is essential that we be practical in our approach to the subj ect and that the recons truction plans invol ve steps which are pos sible and w hich the average man can take. The first practical attitude to be taken is to crush out hate because it is non - cons tructive and hinde ring. It blinds the vision and warps the judgm ent, and simply feeds the grow th of fear and hor ror. But the love demande d of us is neither"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST emotiona l nor sentimental. It is intensely practical, and expr esses itself in service and coope rative activity. It seeks to aid all move ments that benefit hum anity and are in line with the new incom ing era. Many peopl e think that an emotiona l reaction and clamour ing out cry of horror at what has ove rtaken the world indicates love and spiritual sensitivity. It is far more likely to indi cate self - centredne ss and persona l discom fort. True love has no time for these reactions , because the work of alleviation is entirely engr ossing. The man who love s his fellow men is mentally poi sed and intelligently working; he is mobi lising all his forces for the service of the hour. A truly com passiona te heart is not emotiona l. Our second step, therefore, after the recogni tion of indi vidua l respons ibility, is to replace emotion by practical love , expressed in selfless service. The third step is to reorganise our lives so that we have time for this needed service. Most peopl e are not getting the maximum of results out of their daily lives, and this for several reasons . Freque ntly they do not really desire to make the sacrifices which such service demands ; often they are unde r the delusion that their present out put of service represents their utmost pos sibility; aga in, they fancy that their health coul d stand no more active work, or that they requi re time for themselves, or they waste many valuable hour s doi ng thos e things which yield no real results. If, how ever, the need toda y is as great as we are led to believe, if this is the hou r of man's extremity, if the issues are so great that the entire future of the race depends upon the out com e of the war, then the one thing that really matters is for man to play his part, to mobi lise his time and all that he has and make that supr eme effort which will release life and energy and make the winni ng of the war som ething immediately pos sible and the rebui lding era a success. This he must do at any cost, even that of life itself. A spiritual paradox becom es appa rent. The indi vidua l is of supr eme impor tance, and yet at the same time what happe ns to him as he serves and fight s for hum an freedom is of no indi vidua l impor tance at all. A brief period of organised effort and, at the end, death, is of more vital usefulness t oda y than a futile doi ng of the things a man feels like doi ng in a leisurely way, and then meande ring feebly dow n the years. Therefore, the developm ent of a sense of indi vidua l respons ibility, the expr ession of real love in service and the reorganising th e life so as to get the utmost out of each day cons titutes the preparatory stage for the man who seeks to participate in the recons truction period. Having then done this to the best of his ability (and many have already made a good beginni ng) he must deve lop in himself and evoke in others the spirit of goodw ill . This will - to - good is of immediate effectiveness, because it gove rns a man's relation to his family and his hous ehol d, his bus iness or social associates, his casual acqua intances and all with whom h e may com e in cont act. It enables him to begin the work of recons truction right where he is and trains him in a familiar envi ronm ent to practise right hum an relations . It is the major and pot ent factor which can enable the otherwise futile indi vidua l to be com e a focal poi nt of cons tructive influence. He will then discove r that, as a result of this, his sphe re of cons tructive influence is cont inua lly enlarging. These are the first four steps, and they are perhaps the most difficult, for they are non - spectac ular and almost cons titute spiritual platitude s. But they are the essential and una voi dable preliminaries for the man who wants to work wisely, usefully and intuitively in the future. To the above he can then add the follow ing efforts and attempt to impos e upon himself this sugge sted progr amme: 1. Study and reflect upon the many propos als which are being made by world leaders and thinke rs as to the com ing world rehabilitation. It will be necessary to plan your reading and to know what is being"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST discussed. Cultivate an intelligent opi nion, based on goodw ill and on what you , as a result of study, feel shoul d be done . Then discuss the ideas in your home, among you r friends and in your envi ronm ent without fear or favour . It will help you to do so if you regard such discussions as a service and believe that your interests and enthus iasm cannot fail to have an effect. 2. If pos sible, gather peopl e toge ther to discuss and study the com ing world order, or coope rate with thos e who are already doi ng so. Lo ok upon this meeting toge ther as a definite cont ribut ion to the moul ding of publ ic opi nion and as a method of bui lding up that reservoi r of thought pow er which can be of use to thos e whos e task it is to rebui ld. If only two peopl e coope rate with you in thi s matter, the effort will not be lost or futile, for you will be helping to change the cont ent of world thought and impressing other minds , even if you do not know it. 3. Extend your interest to many count ries and try to unde rstand the diverse probl ems of thos e count ries. Many know peopl e in these foreign lands , and lists can be made of their names and addr esses. As soon as the war is ove r and the lines of com munication are again ope n, you can seek to reach these peopl e, attempt to locate them through any available agencies, and then, when found , strengt hen them with the know ledge of your goodw ill or interest and by coope rating with them dur ing the period of recons truction. No matter how slight has been you r cont act with them in the past, foster it by thoug ht and prayer, and later by direct com muni cation. Thus a great network of relations hip will be set up which will serve to weld a new world into one harmoni ous and unde rstandi ng whol e. 4. Pray cons tantly, and to you r prayers add meditation and reflection. Behind the world pattern and structure stands its Originator, its Planne r, its motivating Energy, its central Will, its living Creator, its God. Seek by prayer to reach that central Will and poi nt of Life, thus blendi ng your self with the sensed divine obj ective and identifying you r will with the Divine Will. This central Will - to - Good can be reached by the man whos e ow n will - to - good is a living, practical expe rience, and the more that goodw ill is expr essed, the more easily will you discove r and co ope rate with the divine Plan and follow the gui ding hand of God in world affairs. The real work of recons truction will be done by thos e who, in the silence of their ow n hearts, have walked with God and learnt His ways. 5. Find two other peopl e to work wit h you . There is a uni que pot ency in this triple relations hip. God Himself, so say all the world Scriptures, works as a Trinity of goodne ss, and you can, in your tiny sphe re, do the same, findi ng two other peopl e of like mind with you to form a goodw ill tri angl e of light and spiritual interplay. Each of the two who coope rate with you can, in their turn, do the same, and thus a great network of goodw ill can spread throughout the world. Through it the Forces of Light will be able to work and you, in your place and sphe re, will have aided and helped. 6. Find out and study the methods , techni que s and obj ectives of the various groups and organisations which are interested in world recons truction. You may not agree with all of them or with their plans and mode s of working, but all are needed. The types of men are many, the races and condi tions are varied, and the probl ems to be solved will call for innum erable ways of working. All can play their part if based on real goodw ill and if fanaticism is absent. The fanatic is a dange r wherever he is found, for he sees onl y one side of a que stion and is una ble to appr eciate the various points of view. He will not adm it that all are needed. Coope ration is the key to expr essed goodw ill, and in the future period of rehabilitati on coope ration will be the out standi ng need. Keep a record of all such groups , their leaders, obj ectives and progr ammes. It will prove useful when the war is ove r. Establish helpful and friendl y relations with them to the best of you r ability. 7. Find and keep a record also of the men and women of goodw ill in your envi ronm ent. Be spiritually"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST aggr essive in this matter and go out to discove r them. When you have found them, then be interested in what they are doi ng, and also ende avour to have them coope rate with you in you r lines of activity. Keep a register of the names and addr esses of these peopl e, addi ng also their capacities and func tions if any, and thus bui ld up a mailing list. You will then be aware of a group which can be depende d upon to w ork in a spirit of goodw ill and for world recons truction. Later, these lists can be amalgamated, if deemed desirable, and form a vast mailing list of peopl e in every count ry who will work along these indi cated lines and who coul d be reached simultaneous ly. They will form a body of sync hroni sed publ ic opi nion, sufficiently strong to moul d ideas, influence the masses, and aid the world leaders to right and appropr iate action. 8. Above everything else and grow ing out of all the above sugge stions , plan definit ely for the rehabilitation — phys ical, psychol ogi cal and spiritual — of the children of every count ry. They have been the victims of wickedne ss. Let them be the recipients of lovi ng goodw ill instead. The probl ems of econom ic rehabilitation, of territorial boun daries, of the demobi lisation of armies and the subs eque nt re - employm ent of the demobi lised, and of world rebui lding are profoundl y impor tant and will call for expe rt aid. But the probl em of the children, as earlier poi nted out , unde rlies the whol e necessi ty for world rebui lding, is greater than all other problems, is above all racial and nationa l barriers, and evok es the best in every hum an heart. The children have prior claim upon all men. I woul d therefore appe al to all whom I can reach through this art icle to conc entrate their major effort — mental, spiritual and practical — on preparing themselves to aid the children of Europe and the other count ries which have suffered so much at the hands of the Axis Pow ers. This will take much time and careful planni ng; it will necessitate enlisting the coope ration of trained expe rts in the field of child welfare, doc tors, surgeons , nurses, psychol ogi sts and educ ators; it will requi re much mone y to make the preparation effective, to send a trained personn el in to the destitute and ruined count ries and to carry forward the work whilst there; it will take also lovi ng, com passiona te action and long patience. It nevertheless cons titutes the most impor tant oppor tuni ty conf ront ing the men and wom en of goodw ill; it is the founda tiona l activity of the new world order, for that order must be brought into being for the sake of the children of toda y. They will inha bit this new world, expr ess the new ideals, and hand on to their children that for which we have fought and die d, the best that we have inhe rited, and all that we have succeeded in salvaging for them. The thought of the children in the subj uga ted lands did not arrest the onw ard march of Hitler's soldiers; the sanctity of the hom e and the phys ical and moral needs of small children arous ed no flicker of com passion in the young men trained unde r the Nazi system of educ ation; the relations hip of mother and child did not enter into the calculation of the German agents as they separated children from parents and set the c hild adrift in a world of carnage or in an institutiona lised establishm ent. The planne d cruelty must be remedied, and it must be remedied by the men and wom en of goodw ill and lovi ng hearts. 9. Begin now to lay aside, no matter what the persona lity may dem and, such small sum s as can be spared and which can accum ulate in preparation for the work of recons truction. If we can all do this, it will enable us to take our share in the work withou t placing an undue load on others. Will you see to it that this sacri fice and its resulting fund be preserved invi olate in your ow n hands unt il such time in the future as you may choos e to use it? These are the practical sugge stions which it woul d seem pos sible to make at this particular time. They are of a general nature and basically indi vidua l. The whol e scheme of rebui lding is as yet in the formative thought stage. The process to be follow ed toda y is one of self - educ ation and the awakening of all whom we can reach.

To this task we are all called, and to it there are many voi ces calling toda y; there are thous ands who have dreamed the same dream, seen the same vision, believed in the divine pos sibilities which are latent in all hum an hearts and who know , past all cont rove rsy, that selfishne ss and uni versal greed have brought the world to its present desperate plight .

The best is yet to be. We can rest back upon the realisation that the history of the hum an race has been one of a steady movi ng forward dow n the ages and tow ards the light . AN IMMINE NT SPIRITUAL EVENT March 1943 We are nearing the climax of the spiritual year. The greatest Appr oach of all time is imminent and pos sible. Much depends now upon the aspirants and disciples of the world, particularly thos e in phys ical incarnation toda y. A major cont act between Shamballa and the Hierarchy, for which initiates and Masters have, for centuries, been preparing is in process of cons um mation. I shall very shor tly be giving you som e further information on the subj ect in an attempt to anchor on th e earth that seed of the new world religion which an earlier instruction upon the Great Approaches 8 A Treatise on the Seven Rays , Vol. II ( Esoteric Psychol ogy ), Pages 701 - 751.* indi cated might be founde d, and lead to a true start of a uni versal faith which will serve the need of hum anity for a long time to com e. All I ask of you toda y is to begin now a most careful preparation for the event which is impendi ng at the time of the Full Moon of May, so that the energies then set in motion may be aide d by you r directed thought and you your selves may com e more fully into the current of the dow npour ing life. At the com ing Wesak Festival and unt il the Full Moon of June includi ng the five days after that Full Moon I ask you to use bot h of the Invoc ations (pp. 144, 249) , thus testifying greatly to the fusion of hum anity into one great group of invoc ative appe al. Make a real effort to be present and in group formation at the exact time of the Full Moon of May, as far as you know it, using bot h Invoc ations an d believing that you are voi cing the uni fied will and desire of hum anity itself. I will enlarge upon this in my Wesak message, but I seek to get this to you as early as pos sible so that my ow n group, in process of training, can lay the needed founda tions o f the work to be done . Let me extend this conc ept a little further by poi nting out that the invoc ative cry of hum anity and of the Hierarchy, jointly sounde d at the time of the Full Moons of May and June and particularly at the Wesak Festival, will be effe ctive if the \"cold light \" of the aspirants and disciples of the world and of all selfless servers, no matter who or where they may be foun d, is uni ted with the \"clear light \" of the initiates and of thos e who can func tion freely as soul s — the Members of the Hierarchy and, to a lesser degree, all accepted disciples. This com bination is the one that is desired and requi red. These peopl e are relatively few in num ber, when com pared with the world's popul ation, but because they are to be found focussed"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST at \"the dee p centre\" and are distingui shed by the quality of fusion and at - one - ment, they can be enor mous ly pot ent. I woul d, therefore, ask all of you (dur ing the weeks prior to the Full Moon of May and that of June and for five days thereafter) to seek to \"dw ell eve r at the centre,\" to ende avour to blend the cold light of your persona lities with the clear light of you r soul , so as to work effectively for the five weeks of the desired period. A SPECIAL WE SAK MESSAGE April 1943 This com muni cation is ad dressed to the members of the New Group of World Servers who can be reached (there are count less num bers of whom you have no know ledge ) and to the men and wom en of goodw ill everyw here. I woul d ask you to see that as many receive this as pos sible. We are ne aring the climax of the spiritual year and the time that the Sun move s nor thw ard. The greatest Appr oach of all time is close and pos sible. Much how ever depends upon the aspirants and the disciples in the world at this time. The past year has been one of th e world's worst expe riences from the standpoi nt of agony and distress; the poi nt of acutest suffering has been reached. It has, how ever, been the year in which the greatest spiritual Appr oach of all time has show n itself to be pos sible — an Appr oach for whic h the initiates and Masters have for centuries been preparing, and for which all the Wesak Festivals since the meeting of the Great Counc il in 1925 have been preparatory. I have, in past instructions , referred to the great meetings held at intervals by Tho se to Whom is entrusted the spiritual gui dance of the planet and particularly of man. Certain facts must be assum ed, such as the acceptance in the Western hemisphe re of the existence of the Christ and in the Eastern, of the Buddha . It is, therefore, surely pos sible (given this acceptance) to assum e that They and Their disciples must and do conf er toge ther upon the steps needed to gui de manki nd along the path of light , the path to God. To this all the world Scriptures bear witness and to this all spiritual k now ers testify. I have not time toda y to enlarge upon this theme. I simply ask for you r acceptance of the hypot hesis (an hypot hesis which is a fact to many millions and a prove d event to many thous ands ) that spiritual gui dance is accorded to manki nd and th at behind the veil which separates the visible from the invi sible there stand Thos e Who are working strenuous ly — and, I might add, scientifically — to meet the present dire need. Two things are occupyi ng Their attention: 1. The need to bring the present strife and warfare to an end and so release manki nd from an evil past and ope n the door to a better future. 2. The oppor tuni ty to lay the founda tions for that new world religion which will suffice to meet man's need for many centuries ahead and fo r which all past world religions have prepared him. Such, brother of mine, are two of the obj ectives lying before the Hierarchy at this time as it prepares for the Full Moons of May and June . Can the forces be so organised and the energies, pendi ng distri bution, so dispersed that the full measure of good can be evoke d? Can the evoc ation of a new cycle of spiritual cont act and of liberation be brought about by the action of the men and wom en of goodw ill? Can the will - to - good of the spiritual Energies and th e good will of hum anity itself be brough t toge ther and"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST produc e thos e condi tions in which the new world order — visione d by all who truly love their fellow men — be enabled to func tion? Can the situation be so staged that the new world religion and the new appr oa ch of hum anity to God are brought into being? These are the impor tant que stions which the Hierarchy is toda y attempting to answer. The group of spiritual workers of whom I happe n to be one is faced with two major probl ems: the probl em of the war itself wi th its stupe fying and stunni ng effect upon the masses everyw here, and the probl em offered by the aspirants and disciples throughout the world. Can the suffering masses of men \"stand with massed intent\" and with eyes directed tow ards God so that their cry c an mount to His ears? And will the spiritually minde d peopl e and the workers for humanity make that supr eme effort (rende red from an adequa te \"poi nt of tension\" ) so that hum anity may be focussed in its appe al and bring about a respons e from the highe st ava ilable sour ces. Can the uni ted effort of these two groups — one cons cious of what is happe ning and the other uncons cious — evok e reply? In mom ents of extreme urgency or crisis, the story of the Christ brings to our attention the fact that He then c ame in touc h with His Father in Heaven. God spoke to Him in terms of recogni tion; God testified to the fact that He kne w Him for His belove d Son. To these basic facts of the historical record, we must add the realisation that \"as He is, so are we in this w orld\" and the assurance of Christ Himself that God is also our Father. Then the door of pos sibility ope ns. We can com e then to the realisation that in times of intense hum an urgency, stress and crisis and when the soul of man is adequa tely arous ed to the n eeded poi nt of spiritual receptivity (as was ever the case with Christ) then there can likewise com e a divine recogni tion from the highe st pos sible sour ce which will suffice to bring release and liberation and to give pow er — pow er to do the right , to take t hos e steps which are demande d by the spiritual pur pos e and to proceed, cons eque ntly, along the path of evol ution. Let me here poi nt out that where this is a group activity upon the phys ical plane there is — unde r the Law of Balance and of Action and Reactio n — a paralleling spiritual activity. The entire world of men is toda y enga ged in an intense activity in the material world — marching armies, factories working in shifts twenty - four hour s a day, seething migrations and depor tations of peopl e, intense air acti vity and the organising and planne d work of the hund reds of relief agencies in every count ry — to mention onl y a few of the myriad activities. The persona lities of men everyw here are enga ged and mentally, emotiona lly and phys ically they are all working at hi gh pressure. The impact of circum stance and events has never been so pot ent. Alongs ide of this material activity of hum anity is to be found the strenuous ende avour , the effort to think cons tructively, the focussed idealism, the registration of vision and t he spiritual aspiration of the peopl e of goodw ill, of the disciples everyw here, plus the trained spiritual activity of the Hierarchy and of the spiritual leaders of the race upon the out er and the inne r side of life. To this must be adde d the activity (the waiting activity, if I might use so paradoxi cal a phr ase) of that centre of life where the will of God is focussed. There are therefore, (speaking in terms of spiritual ende avour ) the follow ing groups whos e massed intent is to bring about the liberation of hum anity and who are to be found everyw here in the world: 1. The men and wom en of goodw ill. 2. The idealists and the dreamers of dreams, the visione rs of a future world. 3. The spiritually minde d peopl e whom we call the world aspirants. "},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST 4. Disciples throughout the planet. 5. The Members of the spiritual Hierarchy of the planet, either in or out of incarnation. 6. The Custodi ans of the Will or Purpos e of God, holding Themselves in readiness at Shamballa and listening for the demand for s uccour as it rises from manki nd. 7. Certain great Energies of extra - planetary signi ficance Who stand ready to intervene shoul d the spiritual invoc ation or the distress of hum anity reach the pitch of evoc ation. The probl em is how to fuse and blend the fir st five groups so that the spiritual appe al can expr ess a group integrated and uni ted demand. Only such a united demand, focussing the \"massed intent\" of manki nd will suffice to evoke an extra - planetary respons e. Much of this task of uni fication lies in t he hands of two groups : the planetary Hierarchy and the New Group of World Servers. With the work of the first group, manki nd has little to do, for They can be depende d upon to fulfil Their task and to shoul der Their respons ibility to the full. With the wo rk of the New Group of World Servers all of you have much to do and it is about this work that I write at this time. I shall not waste time in defining the personne l of this group. Suffice it to say that all who truly love their fellow men and wh o serve them with sacrifice and selfless unde rstandi ng cons titute this group . Along with the affiliated body of men of goodw ill, the members of the New Group of World Servers must now prepare themselves for a great act of service at the time of the May and June Full Moons and throughout the weeks preceding thos e times. The statements which I am now goi ng to make, I will put as briefly as pos sible, leaving you to pond er upon them and trusting you to unde rstand them. What I have now to say will fall into thr ee parts: 1. The work of the Hierarchy in the immediate future at these Full Moon Periods 2. The task of the New Group of World Servers today 3. The New World Religion and its spiritual future. It is necessary for you to unde rstand the immediate spiritua l pos sibilities which conf ront hum anity if thos e of you who have vision and love hum anity are to measure up to the immediate oppor tunity. It is necessary that you shoul d grasp the immediate preparatory steps which you can take in relation to those pos sibil ities and shoul d also have a vision of the principles which must gove rn the new world religion, with its out standi ng poi nts of focus. I do not intend to plead with you, as in the past, or ask you for coope ration either to serve or sacrifice. I onl y seek to give you information, leaving you to make due appl ication unde r the urge of your ow n soul s. The Work of the Hierarchy in the Immediate Future The past history of the relations existing between the Hierarchy as a whol e and hum anity as a whol e can be sum marised in the idea of the carrying out of certain Great Appr oaches between Thos e who expr ess the spiritual attitude and thos e who are frankl y material in their attitude . By means of these Appr oaches, hum anity has been brought (in cons cious ness) increasing ly nearer to the spiritual centres of love and life and has been stimulated to make spiritual progress, to awaken to the light within, to"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST unf old the Christ cons cious ness and to find the Path of Light which leads to divinity. This steady trend to wards increasing relations hip has focussed itself throughout the historical record by means of certain great registered revelations — the result of these Approaches. Always in mom ents of crisis and tension, the cry of hum anity has evoke d respons e from the Hi erarchy which has com e, som etimes rapidly, som etimes more slow ly, but always inevitably. In mode rn history, two such Approaches are recogni sed as existing on a broad hum an scale, i.e., the one which focussed through the com ing of the Buddha to the Eastern civilisation and that which focussed through the Christ, com ing to the West. Anot her Great Appr oach is now at hand but its date is depende nt upon the activity of the New Group of World Servers and the spiritual tension which they can achieve. A major prep aratory period to this Appr oach took place in 1936 and in this preparation many of you participated; it culminated at the time of the Full Moon of May that year in a worldw ide use of the first Invoc ation which I gave you . Now , seven years later, com es the oppo rtuni ty to carry forward the work then started and to achieve results which may release spiritual tides of forces and these may turn the tide of battle. I refer not here to the battle in the physical sense. The war, from the phys ical angl e, is already won though many mont hs may elapse before the victory in the East and in the West is com pletely achieved. This you realise. But — again paralleling this phys ical achievement — must com e a spiritual victory and this coul d be described as the gaining of a new spi ritual orientation and a new attitude tow ards God, to expr ess it very simply. In reverse, I might poi nt out that the reasons for a measure of failure in 1936 can be traced to two sour ces. The work was relatively so successful that it called forth a pow erf ul paralleling activity upon the part of the Forces of Evil; these were pot ent enough to ove rwhelm tempor arily the Forces of Light and to bring on the war with all its attenda nt hor rors. Secondl y, the New Group of World Servers, the men and wom e n of goodw ill and the aspirants everyw here relaxed their efforts; they did not hold the tension gained but slippe d back into negligence; the work did not go on and this in spite of the cons tant effort of a few. But they were too few. Now again com es oppor tuni ty and the pos sibility of a Great Appr oach which can be the cons um mation of the work started in 1936. The battle is on between the Forces of Light and the Forces of Evil . To end this warfare rapidly, and with success, leaving a wide ope n door to a bett er world, the Forces of Life must be called in. It is this which is enga ging the attention of the Hierarchy at this time. For aiding in this ende avour the Buddha is preparing Himself and for this the Christ stands ready, focussing in Himself the desire of Hum anity for that \"life more abunda ntly\" which He prom ised when here before, and for liberation from evil and adm ission into goo d. One of the realisations emerging out of this war is the fact that hum anity has now , as a whol e, been able to see and grasp mo re clearly than ever before, the nature of evil. Men are recoiling in hor ror from this display of rampant evil and even the wicked man is shoc ked and arrested by the unl eashed wickedne ss which is toda y stalking the Earth. That realisation is good and will help the needed reorientation of manki nd tow ards God and good . Putting it very simply, the Hierarchy is toda y getting ready for a Great Appr oach which will have two results: 1. It will bring about a closer relation between thos e great Lives Who embody th e will of God and are the Custodi ans of the divine pur pos e, and Thos e Who embody the love of God and are the Custodi ans of the immediate Plan for hum anity. This relations hip can be established at the time of the May Full Moon at which time the Buddha will embody in Himself the pow erful dow npour ing of energy — the dyna mic energy of the divine will. The Christ, at the same time, will embody the out pour ing dom inant"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST demand of the spiritual aspiration of manki nd, plus the demand of the Hierarchy for the needed aid at this time of crisis. 2. It will also bring about a closer relation between manki nd and the Hierarchy. At the time of the June Full Moon, the Christ will focus in Himself the spiritual energies of the Hierarchy, plus the energy which the Bud dha distribut ed at the time of the Wesak Festival; the New Group of World Servers will focus the spiritual demand for life and liberation, voicing the \"massed intent\" of hum anity. If bot h aspects of this one work can be satisfactorily carried forward, the n a great release can be brought about . The Lords of Liberation coul d be successfully invoke d; the Spirit of Peace might appe ar as the \"Rider from the Secret Place\" and the new era of goodw ill (based upon the will - to - good ) might be inaugur ated. I say \"migh t be\" because, my brothers, the success of all that coul d happe n is depende nt upon the work done by you and all men of goodw ill, by the religious and spiritually minde d peopl e everyw here and by the world aspirants between the sacred season of May and June , 1943, and that of 1944 . Esoterically speaking, the work of the Hierarchy is to focus the divine will - to - good as it affects hum anity. The work of spiritually minde d men is to evoke that will - to - good on earth through as full an expr ession as pos sible of go odw ill. It is the goodw ill of the masses, focussed everyw here through the United Nations who are fight ing for the liberation of manki nd and through the New Group of World Servers, which is sufficient to invoke the will - to - good and onl y this is adequa te. Th is is an impor tant statement and one on which I woul d ask you to ponde r. During the past six years I have given you two Stanzas of a Great Invoc ation. The first one ran as follow s: Let the Forces of Light bring illum ination to mankind. Let the Spirit of Peace be spread abroad. May men of goodw ill everyw here meet in a spirit of coope ration. May forgiveness on the part of all men be the keynote at this time. Let pow er attend the efforts of the Great Ones. So let it be and help us to do our part. This expr essed the nor mal, largely unc ons cious , invoc ative cry of hum anity. It sum med up in itself the desire of all men everyw here for peace, for goodw ill and coope ration. It was generally popul ar and was and still is very widely used. It was fairly easi ly understood and its out standi ng not e was peace. It was used as a prayer by the majority and not as a challengi ng demand as had been intende d; it did not , therefore, prove adequa tely effective in arresting the onw ard march of evil. It doe s, how ever, prese rve the form which can and will evoke eventually the Spirit of Peace. This evoc ation will bring to hum anity that stimulation and active desire to participate in the expr ession of goodw ill which will rende r world peace an effective out com e of wise action an d the establishm ent of right hum an relations . Just as the Great Lord of Love and Son of God, the Christ, used as His vehicle of expr ession on earth, the form of the Master Jesus, so this great extra - planetary Life, the Spirit of Peace, can be enabled, on a highe r turn of the spiral, to use as His vehicle of expr ession, the form of the Christ, the Prince of Peace; thus His stupe ndous energies will be steppe d dow n through the medium of the Lord of Love and becom e available to the mass of men. I gave you late r anot her Stanza of the Invoc ation, of great pow er which was suited to the condi tions of"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST war — a war which prove d inevitable and una voi dable. This last Invoc ation was not so popul ar and not nearly so easily unde rstood and for this there was very good reason. It was an invoc ation intende d to evoke the Forces of Life just as the previous one invoke d the Forces of Light and Love . It coul d onl y be successfully used by disciples, adva nced thinke rs and the Hierarchy itself. It was, how ever, given out to the publ ic so as to familiarise them as far as pos sible with the conc epts of liberation and life and in an effort to anchor upon Earth a new poi nt of focus through which life coul d be made to flow . This effort has not been totally uns uccessful. At the time of the Full Moon of May and of June , it will be advi sable to use bot h these Invoc ations and thus to fuse and blend into one uni ted invoc ation the massed intent of hum anity as a whol e and the enlight ened pur pos e of the disciples and the Hierarchy. This fus ion of the two groups — Hum anity and the Hierarchy — may then suffice to sound out such a pot ent call that life may be released on Earth instead of death and the love of God play its active part in the recons truction of world affairs. If this can be successful ly accom plished, two great revelations may then be speeded on their way: 1. A revelation of light and unde rstandi ng to hum anity as a whol e, leading them to know ledge and enabling men to see the cause of the present catastrophe , for \"in that light shall we see Light .\" In that light , hum anity will know what to do and how to rectify past errors. 2. A revelation of life and of \"life more abunda ntly\" as Christ prom ised when on earth. This revelation will give to the thinke rs, idealists, true leaders and discip les working in the world toda y, that spiritual energy which leads to right activity, sound leadership and inspired and inspiring living. Such is anot her of the goa ls conf ront ing the Hierarchy at this time. Such is the will of God for hum anity and such is the intent and purpos e of Shamballa. When the massed pur pos e of the Custodi ans of the Will of God and the massed intent of the souls of men can be sync hroni sed, then the Great Appr oach will becom e inevitable and the Great Release will autom atically follow . The Task of the New Group of World Servers Today The immediate task of the New Group of World Servers is to focus the massed longi ng, aspiration, desire and intent of hum anity so as to bring about the needed sync hroni sation at the time of th e Full Moon of May and of June this year, and throughou t the intervening weeks from the receipt of this com muni cation (as far as you are conc erned) unt il July first, appr oxi mately. This they must do through their ow n clear thinki ng on current matters, by the cultivation of a receptive spirit, based on a willingne ss to learn, a readiness to let old preconc eptions go and fixed ideas to disappe ar unde r the impact of new truths and new inspiration, and based also on a determination at all costs to recogni se tr uth and presented spiritual developm ents. I woul d ask all of you, therefore, to have an ope n mind, to redoubl e you r belief in the fact of the spiritual realities, to have faith in the will - to - good of the divine pur pos e and to love you r fellow men; and — upon the plane of practical affairs and living — to do two things : Carry forward your due share in this phys ical plane war, aiding the armed forces of the United Nations to wage war to a successful finish, know ing that there are spiritual realities for which it is worth dyi ng if need be, and that war on evil can be waged without hate and with right pur pose; secondl y, plan at the same time for thos e practical measures which, after the war is ove r, will aid the period of recons truction and help rehabilitate hum anit y, and lead to a saner, better, truer way of living."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST I woul d ask you also to take thos e measures in you r indi vidua l life and in you r envi ronm ent, wherever pos sible, which will help make the work to be don e at the time of the Full Moon in May and in June s uccessful; to use bot h the Invoc ations cons tantly; do not use them as prayers or employi ng the energy of desire but as great challengi ng demands , employing the pow er of the will as you can muster it and focus it at a poi nt of tension. At the time of the Fu ll Moon gather peopl e toge ther for an act of fusion and of coope ration, thus aiding hum anity and throwing your small indi vidua l effort behind that of the Hierarchy. I woul d ask you to recogni se that, as a part of the New Group of World Servers a nd as a person of goodw ill you can act as a mediating factor between hum anity and the Hierarchy, bridgi ng the gap between the mass of men (stunne d by suffering, blind to the highe r issues, and inert) and the spiritual Group which is seeking so earnestly to bring them help and life. I woul d have you use, with all the pow er which in you lies, the creative imagination as you ende avour to do this and to believe that the sincerity of you r pur pos e and the love of you r hearts can and will help make pos sible the Gr eat Appr oach and so hasten the Great Release. I woul d have you (from the time you receive this com muni cation) think deeply on what I have said, to walk silently in the light of your soul s, to radiate love , to seek clarity of vision and then, when needed, t o speak to others with pow er and unde rstandi ng. I woul d, finally, have you realise that in the work now being done and as a result of the Great Appr oach you can aid in the focussing or anchor ing of the new world religion, that uni versal religion which wil l be founde d on all the past, which will cons um mate the work of the Christ and which will ope n up a fresh stretch (if I may use such an expression) upon the Path of Light which leads to God. The New World Religion All past divine revelations have brough t humanity to the poi nt where (spiritually speaking) man's essential divinity is theologi cally recogni sed, where the brotherhood of man and the Fatherhood of God are recogni sed ideals and where science has demons trated the fact of an unfolding purpos e and the existence of a funda mental, intelligent Agent behind all phe nom ena. Step by step man has been led through prayer, the voi ce of desire, through worship, the recogni tion of deity, through affirmation of the fact of hum an identity of nature with the divin e, to a belief in the divinity of man. Orthodox religion empha sises the divinity of the Christ, and He Himself has told us (and the New Testam ent in many places empha sises it) that we also are divine, all of us are the Sons of God and that as He is so are we in this world and that we are able to do still greater things than Christ did because He has show n us how . Such is the religious backgr ound of the spiritual thinki ng in the world. Therefore, taking our stand on these truths, acknow ledgi ng the fact of our divinity and recogni sing the glory of all past revelations and the still more glorious prom ise of the future, we can begin to realise that the time has now com e for the presentation of the new step in this unf olding revelation. We can realise that to our past progr ammes of prayer, worship and affirmation, the new religion of Invoc ation and Evoc ation can be adde d, in which man will begin to use his divine pow er and com e into closer touc h with the spiritual sour ces of all life. This new form of the one religion will be in fact the Religion of the Great Approaches — appr oaches between manki nd and the great spiritual Centres which ope rate behind the scenes, between groups of workers on the phys ical plane and in the three worlds of hum an evol ution and spiritual groups upon the inne r planes, such as the Ashrams of the Masters and the egoi c groups with which all hum an beings are in subj ective — though usually unknow n — relation. The new religion will be one of Invoc ation and Evocation, of bringi ng toge ther great spiritual energies"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST and then steppi ng them dow n for the benefiting and the stimulation of the masses. The work of the new religion will be the distribut ion of spiritual energy and the protecting of humanity from energies and forces which they are not , at the particular time, fitted to receive. A little careful thought will show you how , at the com ing Full Moon Festivals, these thought s are present: the protection and liberation of hum anity and the stimulation of manki nd through the distribut ion and the transference of spiritual energy so that the right steps can be taken in any given period, leading manki nd out of darkne ss into light , from death to immortality and from the unr eal to the Real. I woul d have you, therefore, add to your mental and spiritua l activity the recogni tion that you are participating in the task of anchor ing the basic tenets of the new world religion — the flow er and fruition of the past and the hope of the future. More along this line, I may not write at this time. Later I will elabor ate for you the greater and the lesser festivals of the spiritual year as they will gradua lly supe rsede the festivals of the present world religions in the East and in the West. (See: The Reappe aranc e of the Christ , Chapter VI.) Much that you have learnt and gradua lly absorbed will then be seen fitting into the general spiritual plan. You will find that the spiritual year is divided into two periods (sym bol ic of spirit and matter); the period in which the Sun move s nor thw ard and the period when it travels on the sout hern way. You will find that the mont h divides itself into two periods likewise, that of the waxing and the waning moon and you will find the future empha sis laid throughout the world upon the Easter Festival, the Festival of the Ris en Christ; upon the Wesak Festival, the Festival of the Buddha or of Illum ination; and the June Full Moon, the Festival of Unification carried forward by the Christ, the Master of all the Masters and the Teacher alike of ange ls and of men. Toda y, how ever, I seek to focus your attention upo n the immediate task of coope ration with the Hierarchy and strengt hen you to play your part in world salvage. THE NEW WO RLD RELIGION May 1943 In the first part of my message unde r this title (see: The Reappe aranc e o f the Christ , Chapter VI) I had much to say about the form into which the great world religions in the East and in the West have crystallised and its cons eque nt deterioration. It will be essential, therefore, to look at and appr eciate the funda mental truth s which that form has preserved, even whilst hiding them. It will be valuable for us to realise that within the chur ches men of God and disciples of the Christ have ever worked, labour ed and suffered. They have seen and agoni sed ove r the distortions and the misrepresentations . They have been hinde red by the organisation, oft despised by the theologi ans, and have remained simple in the midst of learning. They have been lovi ng and uni versal in their indi vidua l cons cious ness, among the separative an d fanatical. They are the glory of the chur ch — oft hated when alive and oft canoni sed after death. Their glory lies in the fact that they testify to the progr ess of the spiritual man and express in fullness what is in every evol ving man; they are the flow er of evol ution and the tried representatives of God. In the indi ctment of the churches, given earlier, let us not forget the Christians found within thos e chur ches."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST I woul d remind you that I write as one who believes in the great spiritual realities and wh o regards the unf olding spirit of man as the uns hatterable evidence of the existence of \"the One in Whom we live and move and have our being. \" I speak as one who believes in and love s the Christ and who know s Him to be the Master of all the Masters and the Teacher alike of ange ls and of men. I am one who looks to the Christ as the supr eme expr ession of divinity upon Earth and who know s the extent of His sacrificial work for hum anity, the wonde r of the revelation which He brought , the imminence of His return and of His com ing Assum ption of spiritual rule in the hearts of men everyw here. I know that He has no pleasure in the great stone temples which man has bui lt whilst His peopl e are left without practical gui dance or reasona ble light upon their affairs; and I know too that He feels, with an aching heart, that the simplicity which He taught , and the simple Way to God which He empha sised have disappe ared in the fogs of theology and the discussions of chur chm en throughout the centuries. I know that He realises that the words He spoke have been lost in the labyr inths of the ecclesiastical minds which have sought to interpret them, and that the simple teaching of the Appr oach to God which He taught has been supe rseded by the pom p and ceremony of elabor ate rituals. To sum up: Because of the divergences of the many exot eric faiths, the multiplicity of the sects and cults in bot h the Orient and Occident, and the qua rrels of theologi ans ove r words, phr ases and interpretations , the sons of God — in process of developm ent — are left withou t the needed help to cont act the Christ and His great group of disciples, the spiritual leaders of hum anity; the way to Christ, the living, lovi ng Expr ession of God, is not made clear to the seeker. Toge ther, the two great Sons o f God present to manki nd — the One in the East and the Other in the West — a com plete and perfect representation of Deity; by Their lives and words They gua rantee to man the pos sibilities always latent in the hum an spirit. Toda y the Christ and the Buddha wait unt il the hour strikes. Then Their uni ted effort, plus the invoc ative appe al of all who truly know and truly love , will bring hum anity the new revelation for which they wait. The new world religion must be based upon thos e truths which have stood the tes t of the ages. This I said elsewhere and enum erated four of thos e truths: 1. The Fact of God 2. Man's Relations hip to God 3. The Fact of Immortality and Eternal Persistence 4. The Cont inui ty of Revelation and the Divine Approaches. These four facts are b asic realities and truths which have condi tione d the masses of men for aeons . Hum an unha ppi ness is founde d primarily upon man's inability to live fully in the cons cious ness of these four funda mental realisations . But they are steadily taking shape in hum an thinki ng, and for them the United Nations fight s. Two more great and founda tiona l facts are also part of the hum an state of awareness. 5. The fact of our relations hip with each other . This is as much a founda tiona l spiritual fact as is God Himself, beca use it is linke d with our know ledge of Him as Father. This relations hip we call \"brotherhood\" and it expr esses itself (or shoul d I say, it will eventually"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST expr ess itself?) through hum an fellow ship and right hum an relations . For this we work, an d hum anity is movi ng tow ards that relations hip — and that in spite of the fact of war. 6. The fact of the Path to God . Awareness of this has been preserved for us dow n the ages by thos e who kne w God and whom the world called mystics, occultists and saints. Opening out before aspiring men stretches the Way. The history of the hum an soul is the history of the search for that Way and its discove ry by the persistent. In every race and nation, in every climate and part of the world, and throughou t the endl ess re aches of time itself, back into the limitless past, men have found the Path to God; they have trodde n it and accepted its condi tions , endur ed its disciplines, rested back in conf idence upon its realities, received its rewards and found their goa l. Arrived there, they have \"entered into the joy of the Lord,\" participated in the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, dw elt in the glory of the divine Presence, and then returned to the ways of men, to serve. The testimony to the existence of this Path is the price less treasure of all the great religions and its witnesses are thos e who have transcende d all forms and all theologi es, and have penetrated into the world of meaning which all symbol s veil. These truths are part of all that the past gives to man. They are our eternal heritage, and conne cted with them there is no new revelation but onl y participation and unde rstandi ng. These are the facts which the World Teachers have brough t to us, suited to our need and capacity at any given time. They are the inne r struc ture of the One Truth upon which all the world theologies have been bui lt, includi ng the Christian doc trines and dogm as bui lt around the Person of Christ and His teaching. Dimly sensed by the evol ving human cons cious ness hove rs anot her emerging truth of a larger nature — larger because related to the Whol e and not just to indi vidua l man and his persona l salvation. It is an extension of the indi vidua l appr oach to truth. Let us call it the truth of the Great Cyclic Appr oac hes of the divine to the hu man of which all world Teachers and Saviour s were the sym bol and the gua rantee. At certain great mom ents, dow n the ages, God drew nearer to His peopl e and hum anity (blindl y and unc ons cious of their obj ective) at the same time made great efforts to draw nea r to God. On the part of God, this was intentiona l, cons cious and deliberate; on the part of man, it was largely unc ons cious , forced upon him by the tragedy of circum stance, by desperate need and by the driving urge of the collective soul . These Great Appr oaches can be traced dow n the centuries, and each time one took place it meant a clearer unde rstandi ng of divine purpos e, a new and fresh revelation, the institution of som e form of a new religion and the soundi ng of a not e which produc ed a new civilisatio n and culture, or a fresh recogni tion of relations hip between God and man or man and his brother. A new definition of God was given us when the Buddha taught that God was Light and show ed us the way of illum ination, and when Christ revealed to us that God was Love through His life and service on earth. Toda y the know ledge aspect of illum ination is being com prehende d, but the inne r meaning of love is onl y now dimly sensed. Yet light and love have been revealed to the world by two great Sons of God in two App roaches. A new Approach is on the Way, bringing us the next needed truth. We ask our selves: What will it be? For it, the know ers and love rs of God and of their fellow men are prepared; for it, the masses of men wait. Som e of these Appr oaches have been of a major nature, affecting hum anity as a whol e, and som e of them are of less impor tance affecting onl y a relatively small part of manki nd — a nation or a group. Thos e Who com e as the Revealers of the love of God com e from that spiritual centre to which the Chr ist gave the name \"the Kingdom of God. \" Here dw ell the \"spirits of just men made perfect\"; here the spiritual Guides of the race are to be found and here the spiritual Executives of God's plans live and"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST work and ove rsee hum an and planetary affai rs. It is called by many names by many peopl e. It is spoke n of as the Spiritual Hierarchy, as the Abode of Light, as the centre where the Masters of the Wisdom are to be found , as the Great White Lodge . From it com e thos e who act as Messenge rs of the Wisdo m of God, Custodi ans of the truth as it is in Christ, and Thos e Whos e task it is to save the world, to impart the next revelation and to demons trate divinity. All the world Scriptures bear witness to the existence of this centre of spiritual energy. This s piritual Hierarchy has been steadily drawing nearer to hum anity as men have becom e more cons cious of divinity and more fitted for cont act with the divine. Behind this spiritual centre of Love and Light anot her centre is to be found, for which the West has no name but which is called in the East by the name Shamballa. Perhaps the Western name is Shangr i - Lha — a name which is findi ng recogni tion everyw here and which stands for a centre of happi ness and pur pos e. Shamballa or Shangr i - Lha is the place where the W ill of God is focussed and from which His divine pur pos es are directed. From it the great pol itical move ments and the destiny of races and nations and their progr ess are determined, just as the religious move ments, the cultural unf oldm ents and spiritual id eas are sent forth from the hierarchical centre of Love and Light . Political and social ideologi es and world religions , the Will of God and the Love of God, the Purpos e of divinity and the plans whereby that pur pos e is brought into activity all focus throu gh that centre of which we are each cons cious ly a part, Hum anity itself. There are, therefore, three great spiritual centres on the planet: Shamballa, the spiritual Hierarchy, and Hum anity. There is definite Biblical testimony to this highe st of all centr es, Shamballa. At moments of crisis in the earthly life of Christ we read that a Voice spoke to Him, the Voice of the Father was heard by Him, affirming His Sons hip and setting the seal of appr oval upon His acts and work. At that mom ent a great fusion of the two spiritual centres — the Hierarchy and Shamballa, the Kingdom of God and the world of Spirit — was brought about , and thus spiritual energy was released on Earth. We need to remember that the work of all World Saviour s and Teachers is to act p rimarily as distributors of divine energy and as channe ls for spiritual force. This out pou ring manifests either as the impul se behind a world religion, the incentive behind som e new pol itical ideology , or the principle of som e scientific discove ry of impor tance to the grow th of the hum an spirit. Thus do religions , gove rnm ents and civilisations find their motivation. History has demons trated that again and again these developm ents are the results of the appe arance and the activity of som e great man at an adv anced stage of developm ent. Thos e who com e forth as Teachers, Saviour s or Founde rs of a new religion com e forth from the Hierarchy and are of the highe st order of spiritual perfection. Thos e who conve y to man the pur pos es of God through new ideologi cal con cepts are not as yet of so high an order, because man is not yet ready for the highe st presentation. Much has yet to be learnt and mastered by man, and spiritual unf oldm ent always out paces the out er expr ession of hum an relations hips and the social order; h ence the world religions com e first and produc e the condi tions which make the work of the rulers pos sible. Thos e who com e forth from the spiritual centre, Shamballa, are of great pow er, however, and the thread of Their influence can be traced throughout hi story in great declarations and pronounc ements such as the Magna Charta, the Declaration of Inde pende nce and the Atlantic Charter. Thos e who com e forth from Shamballa or the Hierarchy for the release and the gui dance of hum anity are evoke d by hum an desire and demand, for there is a spiritual interplay existing between Hum anity and the Hierarchy, and between bot h and Shamballa. Suc h Messenge rs embody divine intention . The respons e of manki nd to Their messages is depende nt upon the poi nt in evol ution which h as been attained by man. Back in the early history of the race these Appr oaches were rare inde ed. Count less ages passed between them. Toda y, ow ing to the greatly increased pow er of the hum an mind and the grow ing sensitivity of the hum an soul to the spiritual"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST values as they expr ess themselves through major world ideologi es, these Appr oaches of the divine to the hum an can becom e more freque nt and are taking on a new form. Man's inne r realisation of his own inna te spiritual pot ency and the unf oldmen t of his sense of relations hip are bringing about an effort on his part — cons cious ly unde rtaken — to make true progr ess tow ards the good, the true and the beautiful, and this in spite of the fact of the war and the misery and suffering present upon our Earth. It has therefore becom e pos sible to sync hroni se the Appr oach of the divine to the hum an and to instruct the masses of men in the techni que of thus invok ing the Appr oach. This attitude of hum anity will lead to a new revelation, to the new world religion an d to new attitude s in the relation of man to God (religion) and of man to man (gove rnm ent or social relations hips). Two major Appr oaches are to be found in the past history of the race, and bot h are of such signi ficance that it woul d be well to not e them here. They lie so far back in hum an history that we have onl y myth and monum ent to indi cate their happe ning. The first great Approach of the divine to man caused the appe arance of the hum an soul and the addi ng of anot her kingdom in nature to the three (mi neral, vegetable and animal) already existing. The kingdom of man appe ared on Earth. Aeons passed away whilst primitive man cont inue d to evol ve, and when the second great Appr oach took place and the Spiritual Hierarchy of our planet drew nearer to humanit y; the spiritual Way to God was ope ned for thos e who cons cious ly can move forward, who can definitely demons trate the Christ spirit, and who earnestly seek enlight enm ent and liberation. The true appe al of Christ's words: \"Ye shall know the truth and the tr uth shall make you free\" urges them to move forward into the light , through the gate of initiation and on to that path which \"shineth ever more and more until the perfect day.\" At the time of the second great Appr oach, the fact of the existence of the Spiritual Hierarchy, of the ope n door to initiation and of the Way of Sacrifice first dawned on the human cons cious ness; from that mom ent men have found the Way and have move d out of the hum an kingdom into the spiritual; they have transformed their human cons cious ness into divine awareness. The kingdom of man and the kingdom of God were brought into relations hip. Religion became a factor in the developm ent of the hum an spirit and God drew nearer to His Own. God Transcende nt first condi tione d man's co ncept of Deity. Then God as the nationa l cont roller took possession of man's mind, and the Jehova h conc ept (as depicted in the Jewish dispensation) appe ared; next God was seen as the perfected hum an being, and the divine God - man walked the Earth in the per son of the Christ. Toda y, we have a rapidly grow ing empha sis on God Immanent in every hum an being. Such have been the results of the second great Appr oach and such have been the results of the work of the world Saviour s and Teachers dow n the ages, culminat ing in the work of Christ, Who sum med up in Himself the unfoldm ents of the past and the hope of the future. A third great Appr oach is now pos sible and will take place onc e the world war is ove r and man — pur ified by fire and suffering — has set his hous e in o rder and is ready, therefore, for a new revelation. For this com ing revelation the work of the Buddha and of the Christ has been preparatory. They embodi ed in Themselves two lesser Appr oaches, and through Their uni ted effort, hum anity througho ut the world has been prepared to play its part in this third Appr oach. The Buddha came embodyi ng in Himself a great divine principle or qua lity. He was the Conve yor of Enlight enm ent to the world; He was the Lord of Light . As is always the case, He re - enacted in Himse lf, for the instruction of His disciples, the processes of illum ination and became the \"Illum ined One.\" We are told in the scriptures of Indi a that He achieved illum ination unde r the tree , just as Christ achieved"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST the liberation of the hum an spirit upon the tree set up on Golgot ha. Light , wisdom , reason, as divine yet hum an attribut es, were focussed in the Buddha . He prove d the pos sibility of all men achieving this illum ination and of walking in the light . He challenge d the peopl e to tread the Pat h of Illum ination, of which wisdom , mental perception and intuition are the aspects. Then came the next great Teacher, the Christ. He embodi ed in Himself a still greater divine principle or aspect, that of Love , whilst at the same time embracing within Hi mself all that the Buddha had of Light . Christ was the expr ession of bot h Light and Love . Through Their work, therefore, there is now pos sible a deeper reaction to, and a broader com prehension of the work and influence of thos e great Lives Who are waiting toda y to help hum anity. The work of these two Sons of God produc ed among many results the follow ing: 1. They embodi ed in Themselves certain cosmic principles, and by Their work and sacrifice certain divine pot encies pour ed through and upon the race, stim ulating intelligence into wisdom and emotion into love . The Buddha , when He achieved illum ination, \"let in\" a flood of light upon life and world probl ems. He formulated this revelation into the Four Truths. His group of disciples erected a structure of tru th which (by the pow er of collective thought ) has floode d manki nd with light . 2. Through the message of the Buddha , man has for the first time grasped the cause of His cons tant distaste and dissatisfaction and has learnt that the Way of Release is to be f ound in detachm ent, dispassion and discrimination. Where these are present, there is rapid release from the wheel of rebirth. 3. Through the message of the Christ, three conc epts emerge into the racial cons cious ness: a. The value of the indi vidua l and the necessity for tensity of effort on his part. b. The oppor tuni ty which was to be presented to hum anity to take a tremendous step forward and unde rgo the new birth or the first initiation. c. The method whereby this next step coul d be taken in the new age, voi ced for us in the words \"love your neighbour as your self.\" Indi vidua l effort, group oppor tuni ty and men's identification with each other — such is the message of the Christ. In the message of the Buddha we have the three methods whereby the persona lity can be change d and prepared to be a cons cious expr ession of divinity. Through detachm ent , the brain cons cious ness or state of awareness (embodyi ng phys ical recogni tion of inne r causes) is withdr awn or abstracted from the things of the senses an d from the calls of the low er nature. Detachm ent is in reality the impos ition of a new rhyt hm or habit reaction upon the cells of the brain which rende rs the brain una ware of the lure of the world of sensory perception. Through dispas sion , the emotiona l na ture is rende red immune from the appe al of the senses and desire fails to deter the soul from its right ful task. Through discriminat ion , the mind learns to select the good , the beautiful and the true, and to subs titute these for the sense of \"identificatio n with the persona lity,\" which is so characteristic of the majority of men. Persona lity hol ds so many in thrall. This has to go. These three attitude s, when correctly and sanely held, will organise the persona lity, bring in the rule of wisdom, and prepare the disciple for initiation. Then follow s the work of the Christ, resulting in an unde rstandi ng of the value of the indi vidua l and his self - initiated effort at release and illum ination, with the obj ective of group goodw ill. We learn to perfect our selves i n order to have som ewhat to sacrifice to the group , and thus enrich the group with"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST our indi vidua l cont ribut ion. This is the first result of the activity of the Christ Principle in the life of the indi vidua l. Persona lity fades out in the glory of the soul , which (like the rising sun) blots out the darkne ss and irradiates the low er nature. This is the second result, and is a group activity. The word goe s forth to the initiates of the future: Lose sight of self in group ende avour . Forget the self in group activity. Pass through the por tal to initiation in group formation and let the persona lity life be lost in the group life. The final result of the work of the Christ is to be found in our identification with the whol e: indi vidua lity, initiation, an d identification — these are the terms in which the message of the Christ can be sum marised. He said, when on Earth: \"I and my Father are One,\" and in these words epitom ised His entire message. I, the indi vidua l, through initiation, am identified with Deity. Therefore we have: 1. The Buddha . . . the method . . . Detachm ent, Dispassion, Discrimination. 2. The Christ . . . the result . . . Indi vidua lism, Initiation, Identification. It is interesting to not e that the work of the Buddha is expr essed in words a ll beginni ng with the fourth letter of the alpha bet, the letter D. The sense of persona lity is achieved; the qua ternary is transcende d, and the Buddha gave us the reason for this transmutation and the rules. The work of the Christ is expr essed for us in wo rds beginni ng with the ninth letter of the alpha bet, the letter I, and this number is the num ber of initiation. These things happe n not idly but all have their unde rlying pur pos e. I have here very briefly and inadequa tely out lined the nature of two great Appr oaches and two minor . These have prepared hum anity for the third great Appr oach which will bring the new revelation, with its realised cons eque nces, of a new heaven and a new earth. I woul d ask the orthodox theologi an how he interprets the words \"a new heaven\"? May it not signi fy an entirely new conc eption as to the world of spiritual realities and perhaps of the very nature of God Himself? May it not be pos sible that our present ideas of God as the Universal Mind, as Love and as Will, may be enriched b y a new idea and qua lity for which we have as yet no name or word and of which we have as yet no faintest unde rstandi ng? Each of the three present conc epts as to the divine nature — the Trinity — have been entirely new when first seque ntially presen ted to hum anity. What this third major Approach will bring to hum anity we do not and cannot know . It will bring abou t as definite results as did the two earlier Appr oaches. For som e years now the spiritual Hierarchy has been drawing nearer to manki nd, and this is respon sible for the great conc epts of freedom which are so close to the hearts of men everyw here toda y and for which hum anity is now fight ing. As the Members of the Hierarchy appr oach closer to us, the dream of brotherhood , of fellow ship, of world coope ration and of a peace (based upon right hum an relations ) becom es clearer in our minds . As They draw nearer we vision a new and vital world religion, a uni versal faith, at - one in its basic idealism with the past but different in its mode of expr ession . I have cited earlier the founda tiona l truths upon which the new world religion will rest. I woul d sugge st that the theme of the com ing religion will be that of the great Appr oaches themselves; that it will empha sise anew God's love for man as evidenced in these divine Appr oaches, and also man's respons e to God as the word goe s forth: \"Draw near to God and He will draw near to you\" ; that it will — in its rites and ceremoni es — be conc erned with the invo cative and evoc ative side of spiritual appe al. Man invok es the divine Appr oach in two ways: by means of the inchoa te, voi celess appe al or invoc ative cry of the masses, and also by the planned, defined invoc ation of the spiritually oriented"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST aspirants, the intelligently convi nced worker, disciple and initiate — by all, in fact, who form the New Group of World Servers. The science of invoc ation and evoc ation will take the place of what we now call prayer and worship. Be not disturbed by the use of the word \"science.\" It is not the cold and heartless intellectual thi ng so oft depicted. It is in reality the intelligent organisation of spiritual energy and of the forces of love , and when effective, will evoke the respons e of spiritual Beings Who can again walk ope nly among men and thus establish a close relat ion and a cons tant com muni cation between hum anity and the spiritual Hierarchy. It will be obvi ous to you that as hum anity, through its most adva nced uni ts, prepares for this next great Appr oach it must accept with faith and convi ction (faith for the mass es, and convi ction for the know ers and the New Group of World Servers) the premises stated above : 1. The fact of God (God Transcende nt) 2. Man's relations hip to the divine (God Immanent) 3. The fact of immortality 4. The Brotherhood of man (God in expr ess ion) 5. The existence of the Way to God 6. The historicity of the two great Appr oaches and the pos sibility of a third and imminent Appr oach. It is here that the chur ches, if regenerated, can concentrate their efforts, cease perpetuating the out er and visi ble form, and begin to deal with the reality unde rlying all dog mas and doc trines. Upon these inne r assurances man must take his stand, and a study of them will reveal that the majority of the unt hinki ng masses (an immense majority) do accept them hope fully and with desire, though without any definite unde rstandi ng, and that a steadily increasing minor ity also accept them with a full convi nced awareness — an awareness that is the result of the transformation of hope into self - prove n fact. In between these two extremes is a large group of que stioni ng peopl e; they are not part of the uni ntelligent mass, nor are they yet either occultists, mystics or even aspirants. They que stion and seek convi ction; they repudi ate faith as uni ntelligent, but long for a subs titute ; they are cons tantly emerging out of the mass of men and cons tantly movi ng forward in cons cious ness through the follow ing of spiritual techni que s, eventually taking their stand among thos e who can say with St. Paul: \"I know Whom I have believed.\" It is wi th these techni que s that the true religious teaching shoul d primarily conc ern itself. As we look ahead into the world of tom orrow and begin to que stion what structure the faith of hum anity shoul d assum e and what bui lding the skill of the know er s will erect to hous e the religious spirit of man, three more funda mental truths appe ar to be emerging as necessary adjunc ts to the revealed body of truth: 1. The demons trated existence of a Spiritual Hierarchy, the life - purpos e of which is the good of hu manity. The Members of the Hierarchy are seen to be the Custodi ans of the divine Plan and expr essions of the Love of God. 2. The developm ent of the Science of Invoc ation and Evoc ation as a means and method of appr oach to divinity. This will grow out of th e ancient habits of prayer as used by the masses, and the practice of meditation as develope d by the mystics and occultists. Prayer and meditation are the preliminary steps to this emerging science, and what is vague ly called \"worship\" is the group effort to establish som e"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST form of uni ted appr oach to the spiritual Hierarchy, func tioni ng unde r the gui dance and cont rol of the Christ and related to the highe st spiritual centre, Shamballa, through its most adva nced indi vidua ls, just as hum anity is related to the Hierarchy by its spiritually minde d peopl e. 3. The realisation that the starry heavens, the solar system and the planetary sphe res are all of them the manifestations of great spiritual Lives and that the interrelation between these embodi ed Lives is as r eal and effectual as is the relation between members of the hum an family. The spiritual Hierarchy of the planet, the ability of manki nd to cont act its Members and to work in coope ration with Them, and the existence of the greater Hierarchy of spiritual en ergies of which our tiny planetary sphe re is a part — these are the three truths upon which the com ing world religion may be based. Relations hip to God, through Christ, has ever been the teaching of the spiritual leaders of the world, no matter by what name they called Him. In the future we shall draw closer and more intelligently to the living subs tance of Reality and be more definite in our appr ehension of this hitherto vague ly sensed relations hip. We shall know and see and unde rstand. We shall n ot just believe, have hope and try to com prehend. We shall speak ope nly of the Hierarchy and of its Members and Their work. The hierarchical nature of all spiritual Lives, and the fact of the great \"chain of hierarchies\" stretching all the way up from the mineral kingdom through the hum an and the kingdom of God to appa rently remote spiritual groups , will be empha sised. Then there will ope n for the spiritual Lives what has been called \"the Way of the Highe r Evol ution. \" Much along these lines has been given o ut dur ing the past two centuries. The fact of the existence of the Hierarchy is cons cious ly recogni sed by hundr eds of thous ands toda y, though still denied by the orthod ox; the general pub lic are familiar with the idea of the existence of the Masters, and e ither gul libly accept the mass of futile and idiotic information hande d out by many toda y or fight furious ly against the spread of this teaching. Others are ope n - minde d enough to inve stigate whether the teaching is true and to follow the techni que s sugge st ed, in the hope that hypot hesis may turn to fact. This last group is steadily increasing in num ber and upon their accum ulating evidence belief can be translated into know ledge . So many know the truth toda y; so many peopl e of integrity and worth are coope ra ting cons cious ly with Members of this Hierarchy that the very founda tions of the ecclesiastical antagoni sms and the belittling com ments of the conc rete minde d are of no avail. What the orthodox theologi an and the narrow doc trinaire have to offer no longe r satisfies the intelligent seeker or suffices to answer his que stions; he is shifting his allegiances into wider and more spiritual areas. He is moving out from unde r doc trinal author ity into direct persona l, spiritual expe rience and com ing unde r the direct author ity which cont act with Christ and His disciples, the Masters, gives. In cons idering our second poi nt, the Science of Invocation and Evoc ation, we are also movi ng forward into the area of mental unde rstandi ng. The grasping nature of many of the prayers of men, based as they are upon desire for som ething, has long disturbed the intelligent; the vague ness of the meditation taught and practised in the East and in the West, and its empha tically selfish not e (persona l liberation and persona l kn ow ledge ) are likewise causing a revol t. The demand toda y is for group work, group good, group know ledge , group cont act with the divine, group salvation, group unde rstandi ng and group relations hip to God and the Spiritual Hierarchy. All this indi cates progr ess. At this poi nt it shoul d be useful to repeat part of what I said elsewhere conc erning future developm ents along this line. ( The Reappe aranc e of the Christ , pages 152 - 159. ) This new invoc ative work will be the keynot e of the com ing world religion and will fall into two parts."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST There will be the invoc ative work of the masses of the peopl e, trained by the spiritually minde d peopl e of the world (working in the churches, whenever possible, unde r an enlight ened clergy) to accept the fact of the appr oaching s piritual energies, focussed through the spiritual Hierarchy, and to voi ce their spiritual demand for light , liberation and unde rstandi ng. There will also be the trained, scientific work of appe al and invoc ation as practised by thos e who have trained their minds through right meditation, who know the uses of sound , of formulas and of invoc ation, and who can work cons cious ly, focussing the invoc ative cry of the masses and at the same time using certain great formulas of words which will later be given to the race, as The Lord's Prayer was given by the Christ and The Great Invocation has been given in this day and age. This new religious science (for which prayer, meditation and ritual have laid the founda tion) will train its stude nts to present, at certain sta ted periods throughout the year, the voiced demand of the peopl e of the world for relations hip with God and with each other. This work, when right ly carried forward, will evoke respons e from the waiting Hierarchy; throug h this respons e, the belief of the m asses will gradua lly be change d into the convi ction of the know ers. In this way hum anity will be transformed and spiritualised. Then will begin, as the ages pass away, the regeneration of material nature, with the two spiritual centres — the Hiera rchy and Hum anity — working toge ther in full cons cious ness and unde rstandi ng. The Kingdom of God will be func tioni ng on Earth. It will be appa rent to you that I can indi cate onl y the broad general outlines of the new world religion. The expa nsion of the hum an cons cious ness which will take place as a result of the com ing great Appr oach will enable man to grasp not onl y his relation to the spiritual Life of our planet, the \"One in Whom we live and move and have our being,\" but will also give him a glimpse of t he relation of our planet to the circle of planetary lives moving within the orbit of the Sun, and the still greater circle of spiritual Influences which cont act our solar system as it pur sues its orbit in the Heavens (the twelve cons tellations of the zodi ac). Astronom ical and astrologi cal inve stigation has demons trated this relations hip and the influences exerted, but there is still speculation and much fool ish claiming and interpretation. Yet the churches have ever recogni sed this relations hip, and the Bi ble has testified to it. \"The stars in their cour ses fought against Sisera\"; \"Who can withstand the sweet influences of the Pleiades?\"; and many other passages bear out this cont ention of the Know ers. Many chur ch festivals are fixed by reference to the moo n or a zodi acal constellation. Inve stigation will prove this to be increasingl y the case, and when the ritual of the new world religion is universally established this will be one of the impor tant factors cons idered. The establishing of certain major fest ivals in relation to the moon, and in a lesser degree to the zodi ac, will bring a strengt hening of the spirit of invoc ation and the resultant inflow of respons ive influences. The truth lying behind all invoc ation is based upon the pow er of though t, particu larly in its telepathic nature, rappo rt and aspect. The unified invoc ative thought of the masses and the focussed, directed thought of the New Group of World Servers cons titute an out goi ng stream of energy . This will reach telepathically thos e s piritual Beings Who are sensitive and respons ive to such impacts. Their evoke d respons e, sent out as spiritual energy, will in turn reach hum anity, after having been steppe d dow n into thought energy, and in that form will make its due impact upon the minds of men, convi ncing them and carrying inspiration and revelation. Thus has it ever been in the history of the spiritual unf oldm ent of the world and in the procedur e follow ed in writing the world Scriptures. Secondl y, the establishing of a certain uni formi ty in the world religious rituals will aid men everyw here to strengt hen each other's work and enha nce pow erfully the thought currents directed to the waiting Spiritual Lives. At present, the Christian religion has its great festivals, the Buddhi st keeps hi s different set of spiritual events, and the Hindu has still anot her list of hol y days. In the future world, when"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST organised, all men of spiritual inclination and intention everyw here will keep the same hol y days. This will bring about a poo ling of spiritua l resour ces and a uni ted spiritual effort, plus a simultaneous spiritual invoc ation. The potency of this will be apparent. Let me indicate the pos sibilities of such spiritual events, and prophe sy the nature of the com ing world - wide Festivals. There will b e three such major Festivals each year, conc entrated in three cons ecutive mont hs, and leading therefore to a prolonge d spiritual effort which will affect the remainde r of the year. These will be: 1. The Festival of Easter . This is the festival of the rise n, living Christ, the Teacher of all men and the Head of the Spiritual Hierarchy. He is the Expr ession of the Love of God. On this day the Spiritual Hierarchy which He gui des and directs will be recogni sed, and the nature of God's love will be empha sised. This festival is determined always by the date of the first Full Moon of spring, and is the great Western and Christian festival. 2. The Festival of Wesak . This is the festival of the Buddha , the spiritual Intermediary between the highe st spiri tual centre, Shamballa, and the Hierarchy. The Buddha is the Expr ession of the Wisdom of God, the Embodi ment of Light , and the Indi cator of the divine Purpos e. This will be fixed annua lly in relation to the Full Moon of May, as is at present the case. It i s the great Eastern festival. 3. The Festival of Goodw ill . This will be the festival of the spirit of hum anity — aspiring tow ards God, seeking conf ormity with the Will of God and dedicated to the expr ession of right hum an relation. This will be fixed annua l ly in relation to the Full Moon of June . It will be a day whereon the spiritual and divine nature of manki nd will be recogni sed. On this festival, for two thous and years, the Christ has represented hum anity and has stood before the Hierarchy and in the sig ht of Shamballa as the God - Man, the Leader of His peopl e and \"the Eldest in a great family of brothers\" (Rom ans VIII:29). Each year at that time He has preached the last sermon of the Buddha before the assembled Hierarchy. This will therefore be a festival of deep invoc ation and appe al, of a basic aspiration tow ards fellow ship, of hum an and spiritual unity, and will represent the effect in the hum an cons cious ness of the work of the Buddha and of the Christ. These three festivals are already being kept thro ughout the world, though they are not as yet related to each other, and as part of the unified spiritual Appr oach of hum anity. The time is com ing when all three festivals will be kept simultane ous ly through out the world, and by their means a great spiritua l uni ty will be achieved and the effects of the great Appr oach so close to us at this time will be stabilised by the uni ted invoc ation of hum anity throughout the planet. The remaining full moons will cons titute lesser festivals, but will be recogni sed to be also of vital impor tance. They will establish the divine attribut es in the cons cious ness of man, just as the major festivals establish the three divine aspects. These aspects and qua lities will be arrived at and determined by a close study of the nature of a particular cons tellation or cons tellations influencing thos e mont hs. For instance, Capricorn (December) will call attention to the first initiation, the birth of the Christ in the cave of the heart, and indi cate the training needed to brin g about that great spiritual event in the life of the indi vidua l man. I give this one instance to you in order to indi cate the pos sibilities for spiritual unf oldm ent that coul d be given through an unde rstandi ng of these influences, and in order to revivify the ancient faiths by expa ndi ng them into their larger undyi ng relations hips. We have, therefore, the follow ing:"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Shamballa ----- the Will aspect of God ---- Wesak -------- May Full Moon (Taurus) Hierarchy ----- the Love aspect of God --- Easter --------- April Full Moon (Aries) Hum anity ----- divine Intelligence -------- Goodw ill ----- June Full Moon (Gemini) The remaining nine Full Moons will be conc erned with the divine characteristics and their developm ent in manki nd. Thus the twelve festivals will cons titute a revelation of divinity. They will present a means of bringi ng about relations hip, first of all dur ing three months with the three great spiritual centres, the three expr essions of the divine Trinity. The minor festivals will empha sise the inter - relation of the Whol e, thus lifting the divine presentation out of the indi vidua l and the persona l into that of the uni versal divine Purpos e; the relations hip of the Whol e to the part and of the part to that Whol e will be thereby fully expr essed. Hum anity will therefore invo ke the spiritual pow er of the Kingdom of God, the Hierarchy; the Hierarchy will respond, and God's plans will then be worked out on Earth. The Hierarchy, on a highe r turn of the spiral, will invoke the centre of God's Will, Shamballa or Shangr i - Lha, thus invoki ng the Purpos e of God. Thus will th e Will of God be implemented by Love and manifested intelligently; for this manki nd is ready, and for this the Earth waits. FACTORS IN THE WO RLD SITUATION April 1944 I have written to the world aspirants for many Wesaks now . I have again a nd again brought to you r attention and theirs the close relation which is being established between the world of men and the world of soul s. I have again and again poi nted out that, unde r the Law of Evol ution, certain great fusions , at - one - ments or great A ppr oaches are taking place. I have indi cated that the present activity of our planetary Logos is bringi ng certain major adjustments within the planetary sphe re of influence and that these primarily affect the hum an kingdo m. I have called to your not ice the urgency of the incom ing life, produc ing tension, spiritual recogni tions of a far - reaching nature, the immediate ove rthrow of false Gods and standa rds, and the destruction of outworn and crystallised interpretations (called doc trines) of the spiritual real ities. By these means, the way is cleared for a new and simple recogni tion of divinity which will satisfy not onl y the heart of the simplest person, but which will meet the need of the most intelligent. I have talked in terms of the uni on of Eastern and We stern thought and of the need for the great civilisations — nur tured unde r the influence of Shri Krishna , the Buddha and the Christ — to be brought closer toge ther. I have said (and I here re - affirm) that He Who com es will make this uni on pos sible and effectiv e. This event will evoke world - wide recogni tion. I have stated also that we are reaching a climaxing period in human history; in this period the Lords of Karma are unus ually active; the Law of Cause and Effect is bringi ng the results of past activities, t he subj ective thinki ng and the secret impul ses to the surface, and exacting penalty and the planne d cleaning of the slate of hum an history. When He Whom all disciples serve was on Earth two thous and years ago, He said that secret things woul d be made plain ; by this emergence of the good and of the bad"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST into prom inence, men will arrive at know ledge , at unde rstandi ng, and will be forced to take thos e steps which will be needed to bui ld a new and better world, based on the Law of Love and not on the Law of Separateness and hate. This is what is happe ning toda y. I have said also that the Forces of Light are nearing the Earth and that the Hierarchy is com ing steadily closer to manki nd. These basic events, these subj ective happe nings and these spiritua l determinations — unde r the Law of Action and Reaction — have evoke d a more rapid respons e from the Forces of Evil (present in our planetary life) than from humanity. Certain great Forces or embodi ed Energies of darkne ss and of evil organised themselves and t ook the needed steps (so they believed) to prevent hum anity from steppi ng onw ard into light . They availed themselves of the weakne sses, the selfishne ss and the self - interest of man; just as good can stimulate the latent goodne ss in manki nd into expr ession, so evil can evoke greater evil from thos e susceptible from inna te weakne ss, and from the unt hinki ng and emotiona l: the Forces of Light work onl y with men's soul s. Lies, false teaching, evil propa ganda , a war of nerves, the culture of fear, the organisatio n of groups and of isolated workers in every nation pledge d to unde rmine right eous ness and distort the truth, went rapidly forward. Great and funda mental truths were twisted to meet the ends of the evil workers. The doc trine, for instance, of the supe r - ra ce was interpreted to mean the supe riority of the German nation and culture to all in the West, whilst the divinity of the Sons of Heaven (the Japanese race) was empha sised to all in the East. The bewildered peopl es of bot h nations were led to believe that they had a great and spiritual mission to dominate the world. This was the first result of the approach of the Kingdom of God to the earth, or rather to the phys ical plane. In that kingdom men of all races will demonstrate their divinity; the kingdom of soul s will be recogni sed as the uni versal hom e and race of all men. Separative nationa lities will, in that kingdom , have no place or recogni tion. The Forces of Evil sought for those leaders and groups who are the materialistic corresponde nce to the spiritual leaders and thos e who seek to gui de hum anity along right lines. They took pos session (and I use this word with deliberation) of the evil men who led the Axis Pow ers — Hitler, Tojo, Goebbe ls, Ribbe ntrop, Himmler and — to a much lesser degree — Muss olini, Hess, Goering and others. They com pletely ove rpow ered the minds of these men, already distorted with ambition and sadistic inclinations . Who, you ask, do I mean by \"they\"? I mean thos e intelligent evil, unl ovi ng, hateful Indi vidua lities who are to t he world of selfish and material focus what the Hierarchy of Masters, working unde r the Christ, are to struggl ing hum an aspirants. The pow er of these evil forces is enor mous , for they recogni se no restrictions or ordinary decent, hum an limitations ; they wo rk throug h violence, coercion, cruelty, hate, terror and lies; they aim to subj uga te the hum an cons cious ness through the com plete cont rol of men's minds , through the withhol ding of good and the prom ulgation of evil. They stimulate the brains of men through the extent of their evil and magical know ledge ; I mean this literally and phys ically. The Great White Lodg e, working unde r the inspiration of the Christ and of Shamballa, func tions necessarily unde r certain spiritual restrictions . Coercion is not permitte d; the minds of men must be and are left free; the stimulation of the soul s of men is permitted, because it results in the stimulation of the expr ession of love and of unde rstandi ng, leading to right hum an relations . These spiritual restrictions greatly sl ow dow n the progress of the Forces of Light ; it shoul d interest you to remember that the lengt h of the war was partly depende nt upon the inability of the Armies of the Lord to com mit the crimes for which the Axis Pow ers have been respons ible. The"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST phys ical activities of the Forces of Light do recogn ise certain limitations , and of this the Forces of Evil take cons tant adva ntage. The bom bing of massed popul ations was started by Hitler and coul d have been ende d by him immediately if he so chos e. The re is anot her aspect of this matter to which I woul d like to call your attention. These restrictions which the Forces of Light recogni se have also an unde sirable effect where the uni ntelligent and well - meaning are conc erned, and where thos e who are emotion ally pol arised interpret the Law of Love . The United Nations , working for hum an liberation and freedom (and therefore working unde r the Law of Love , right ly unde rstood) is prevented from follow ing the lines of indi scriminate cruelty which characterised the German and Japanese techni que s: torture, starvation, lying propa ganda , misuse of prisone rs, the dissemination of a terror campaign. These are not permitted by the rules of the Brothers of Hum anity. From a purely phys ical angl e, this can be interpreted as put ting the \"Armies of the Lord\" at a disadva ntage. It is this right attitude on the part of the Forces of Light which has an unde sirable effect upon the appe asers and pacifists of the world. These woul d, for hum anitarian reasons and from love of the forms through which hum anity func tions, bring the war to an immediate end. In their well - meaning blindne ss they woul d sacrifice the future of hum anity and the lives of millions of peopl e at a later date for a tempor ary cessation of hos tilities. I woul d empha si se to you that the Forces of Evil must be defeated now ; the evil leaders must be wrenched from their high place, and the com plete defeat and anni hilation of thos e respons ible for launc hing this horror on hum anity is an absolute necessity and bounde n dut y, if security, well - being and a new order of happi er living is to be the lot of com ing generations . A tempor ary endi ng of the war woul d onl y give time for the Forces of Evil to reorganise, and the future war woul d be infinitely worse than this one . This the intelligent hum anitarian is saying, and this is the opi nion of the Hierarchy. The Hierarchy stands firmly on the side of thos e who demand a war to a finish, and the reasons are the ultimate saving of millions of lives and the preservation of certain basic spiritual values. The issue is far more serious spiritually than you know ; the work of the Hierarchy is handi cappe d not onl y by the restrictions unde r which the Forces of Light must work, but also by the work and utterances of the silly little men with small vision who see not the future pos sibilities if the war came to an inconc lusive finish, and who (for the present com fort of the present generation) woul d sacrifice the children of tom orrow and later generations . The work of the Hierarchy is h andi cappe d by the attitude s of men with no perspective and much selfishne ss, of no cruelty but of stupi d thinki ng. These men — in the hous es of legislature in the various United Nations , in Parliament, in Congr ess, and in the chur ches — plead for the cessation of the war before victory is won and before the enemies of hum anity are beaten to their kne es in suppl ication for mercy and in a demand for peace. They see the end of bus iness as they have know n it; they see the familiar landm arks of their com fortable wor ld disappe aring; they dislike the results of the war as it affects them; or they cannot bear the general suffering and prom pted by pity they demand an immediate peace. Others are prom pted by isolationi sm and the desire to withdr aw from participation in the misery of war; others hate thos e whos e dut y it is to carry the war to a successful climax, or see their particular ambitions threatened by the condi tioni ngs of a changi ng world. They woul d sacrifice future generations , as I have said above , to their shor t - sight ed pol icy and feeble judgm ent. They spread disuni ty, therefore, and shackle the hands of thos e adm inistering in high places. Their efforts prolong the war, dishearten the fighting forces, break dow n nationa l and military morale, and lay a poo r found a tion for the work of the pos t - war world. There are many of these in every nation, there are too many in the United States of America; there are none in the U.S.S.R., and hence her triumpha nt march forward. "},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST You have, cons eque ntly, in the world toda y: 1. T he Forces of Evil , working through Germany and Japan. To date, they are hol ding their ow n and they are not yet defeated. They are terrorising the world. Within their ow n nationa l bor ders they do not pos sess enough peopl e with cour age, unde rstand ing, or with the ability to think clearly, who hate evil and who can hol d to a vision. There is little in either nation to bring assistance to the Forces of Light . The Germans were deceived from the beginni ng, and a widespread nationa l deception, backed by a terror campaign, argue s a general weakne ss, lack of cour age and a natural predilection for evil gui dance. The tende ncy to be led along aggr essive, selfish and evil lines has been characteristic of the German mentality for a great lengt h of time. This ne gative nation, with its arroga nt psychol ogy (one of the great paradoxe s of the ages), must be taught the ways of pos itive good , and a cour ageous championi ng of right eous ness must take the place of the present negative acceptance of evil. With hum ility and intelligence must the German nation be taught to take a prope r place in the com muni ty of nations . The Japanese nation, in spite of its great age, must go back into the nur sery state; it must be taught , as children are taught , to be social and not anti - soci al, and it will be long before it will be safe to trust this nation. The Italian nation presents no greater probl em than doe s any other nation in the world. It is nor mal, as are the United Nations ; the German nation and the Japanese race are not nor mal, an d must be brought back to normality by careful, kindly, but firm handl ing, and by appl ied educ ationa l processes. 2. The Forces of Light . I woul d here correct an impression which exists among esotericists. By this phr ase, (the Forces of Light ), they are ap t to mean that the Hierarchy is literally fight ing against the Axis nations . This is not so in the phys ical sense. The Hierarchy works — as you well know — with the soul s of men and with thos e minds which are so oriented and dispos ed that they react to soul im pression. When I use the expr ession \"the Forces of Light \" I mean thos e enlight ened nations upon whom the light of Freedom shines and who will refuse, at all costs, to relinqui sh that light . There is no freedom in Germany or in Japan. In a lesser sense and for a brief time, there was no freedom in Italy, but Italy must be count ed among the enlight ened nations , for it coul d not be held in dur ess. The Forces of Light com prise thos e nations (working through their armies and in the diplom atic arena) w ho are toda y fight ing for the freedom of hum anity, for the eternal rights of man, for liberty of cons cience, for the pos ition of the indi vidua l in any nation, and for freedom of religion or the right of man's self - chos en appr oach to the spiritual realities . Behind these nations stands the Hierarchy. Freedom is the birthright of manki nd, and free will is the highe st of the divine characteristics. Freedom is misinterpreted and misused by many, ow ing to the poi nt in evol ution of the mass of hum anity, but it is a funda mental, divine principle; and where principles are invol ved the Hierarchy know s no com prom ise. There is no spiritual principle behind any of the activities of the Axis Pow ers, behind German activity or Japanese aggr ession. Therefore, the Hierarchy doe s not stand with pow er or strengt h behind any of their efforts. 3. Hum ani ty as a whol e . The men, wom en and children of the world are all implicated in and affected by this uni versal war. The effects reach into the most isolated village, the most extens ive desert and the highe st mount ain top, as well as into the cities and conge sted areas of all the nations . No one is exempt from the cons eque nces of this present catastrophe . The bul k of hum anity are uni versal and innoc ent sufferers. The majority scarcely realise what it is all about ; they view this great historical climax from the pur ely self - centred angl e and from the poi nt of view of how it affects them as indi vidua ls and their nation as a whol e. An increasing num ber are com ing to realise that this war must be fough t to a successful finish because there is no peace or hope or right world relations hips as long as two nations — one in the Western hemisphe re and the other in the Eastern — can precipitate disaster upon count less millions . A minor ity are realisin g that the war has precipitated the conde nsed evil of the ages and that"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST hum anity is faced with the oppo rtuni ty of erasing past errors, ancient selfishne ss and ingr ained wickedne ss, and of inaugur ating a new and better world. In this new world th ere will be freedom of appr oach to God, oppor tuni ty for indi vidua l expr ession, freedom to live in right relations and scope for creative living. A few — a very few — know that this is a climaxing poi nt in an ancient conf lict between Christ with His Hierarchy o f Masters, and \"spiritual wickedne ss in high places.\" A mere handf ul of know ers and disciples know , past all cont rove rsy and discussion, that, heading up thos e unha ppy lands — Germany and Japan — are ancient leaders who have again sought to bring planetary dis aster and to deflect the ends and the aims of the Great White Lodge . Among all these are thous ands who stand bewildered, sensing the truth but feeling helpless in the face of the gigantic hor ror which the evil gang now ruling Germany has precipitated upon hum anity. They tend to right thinki ng but are still the prey of the unscrupul ous and the selfish. When their thinki ng has been gui ded into right lines through a process of right presentation of the situation, they will cons titute a pow erful asset to the F orces of Light . Such is the situation with which the Hierarchy and hum anity are toda y faced. The strengt h of the Forces of Light is grow ing; the pow er of the Forces of Darkne ss may be waning but is still vastly strong — upon the phys ical plane. Their main h old is upon the minds of men and that is exceedingl y pot ent and unw eakened, for it is aided by the mild, unt hinki ng person, by the bewildered, the pacifist, the appe aser and the isolationi st. The idealism of this group is turned to the aid of Germany by th e skilful evil workers. The German armies are still unbe aten; central Europe is a might y fortress, dom inated by the arch enemy of manki nd, sitting on his mount ain - top. There, sym bol ically, he is to be found, the initiator into evil condi tions , and into sla very. The armies of the Lord stand poi sed, and victory will be theirs when there is com plete uni ty of pur pos e, conc entrated attention upon right hum an relations , and a spread of idealistic aspiration to all who are fight ing this battle for freed om . For this uni ty of pur pos e all the enlight ened peopl e of the world must work. It is not yet adequa tely present. Let us now turn to the work of the Hierarchy and to the event for which all initiates and disciples are now preparing — the com ing Wesak Festi val. THE TASK OF IMPLEMENTING THE WI LL - TO - GOOD May 1944 How is the Hierarchy working at this time? In what manne r are the Masters aiding the work of the Forces of Light ? Can som ething of mom ent and of lasting signi ficance happe n at this com ing May Fu ll Moon? How do the Masters look at the world situation? What are Their plans? Can these plans be materialised? And what can the individua l disciple, initiate and world disciple accom plish in the face of hum anity's dilemma? These are all normal and intel ligent que stions and can be answered partially, though not fully, ow ing to three reasons : 1. The out com e of the com ing climaxing conf lict depends on hum anity itself. A greater effort is"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST requi red, particularly in America — an effort to see the issues clearly , to unde rstand the causes of this war, and a determination to take thos e steps — through propa ganda and discussion — which will clarify the minds of the masses. Into these age - long causes I cannot here go; there is not time to do more than enum erate certain o f them a. Universal and ancient selfishne ss, materialism, aggr ession, and nationa l prides. Of these faults all nations have been gui lty. b. A sense of separateness of which the bor der issue between such nations as Russia and Poland is sym bol ic. The need of humanity and its general well - being com es eternally first. Nations and their ephe meral disput es are of seconda ry interest. c. A tende ncy — centuries old — among the Germanic peopl es to dom inate, to take what is not their ow n, to regard themselve s as uni que , supe rior, and as embodyi ng a supe r - race; there is also a fixed determination, on behalf of their ow n interests, to plunge other nations and races into war. Toda y they have achieved a planetary war. 2. There are factors present in this battle between evil and good which are so deeply esoteric and hidde n from the unde rstandi ng of the most adva nced hum an being that it is useless for me to enlarge upon their existence. They are conc erned with the ability of the mind, or of the mind principle, to r eact to truth or to lies; the mystery of this reaction is hidde n in the evol utiona ry process itself. A poi nt can be reached in hum an developm ent where acceptance of deception is impos sible and clear thinki ng is nor mal. The pot ency of glamour (which hol ds s o many peopl e in prison) is related to this mystery. Glamour hol ds not thos e who are mentally and emotiona lly unde velope d; they are com plete realists and see life in its bare out lines and baldly. The highl y develope d are not subj ect to glamour ; they also t hink realistically but this time with true mental perception and not instinctively. The thinki ng man, in his process of training, but who is still largely gove rned by his emotions , is exceedingl y prone to glamour, and very often to the glamour of a sentime ntal so - called lovi ng attitude . These peopl e do not realise that love is a process of determining action on the basis of the ultimate good of the indi vidua l or the group, and that the immediate reactions of the persona lity are seconda ry. In this conf lict t he Hierarchy is conc erned with the final issue, with the future welfare and the ultimate well - being of hum anity. They are not so conc erned with the immediate suffering and pain of the persona lities invol ved. Is this a hard saying? A tiny replica of this co rrect attitude can be found in the influence, words and actions of thos e wise parents, thos e far - sight ed guides of yout h, who see the need of discipline if their children are in the future to be right ly oriented, and to live correctly. The tempo rary discom fort of the discipline and the rebellion of the children do not in any way condition such parents. They see ahead. 3. The conf lict at present invol ving hum anity has its sour ce not onl y in hum an weakne ss and selfishne ss, but in a situation which has existed for ages between the Great White Lodge of Masters and the Lodge of Black Adepts. This started in Atlantean times and must now be fought out to a finish. With the details of this struggl e (fought on mental levels) you have no conc ern, except in so far as you and the rest of manki nd react to lies or to truth. Two streams of mental energy or of thought - directed ideas impinge pow erfully at this time upon the human cons cious ness. One is embodi ed in the lying propa ganda emanating from the Axis Pow ers and affecting pot ently not onl y their ow n peopl es but the selfish pol iticians, the intolerant and the racially condi tione d peopl e, and the well - intentione d but shor t - sight ed appe asers and pacifists. The second stream is embodi ed in the idealism, the hum an itarianism, and the clear presentation of the factual situation which characterise the best minds in every nation and which condi tion the thinki ng of the leaders of the United Nations ; this stream has, for instance,"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST condi tione d the attitude and the change d orientation of the U.S.S.R., and has brought them to a pos ition of coope ration and to a relinqui shing of som e of their separative ideas. The leader of the conflict against evil in high places is the Christ, the Head of the Hierarchy. What is the attitude of the Christ at this time? In all reverence, and as one of His hum blest friends and persona l workers, I am permitted to tell you a little of His position as He nears the great event in May of this year. He know s Himself to be the inne r spiritual Com mande r of the Armies of the Lord. His is the respons ibility of awakening the soul s of men to their presented oppor tunity and to the need of bringi ng to an end this ancient conf lict between the Lords of Evil and the Messenge rs of Light . His has been t he probl em of teaching hum anity that, in order to demons trate true love and to provi de scope and oppor tuni ty for a civilisation in which love , brotherhood and right hum an relations are gove rning factors, thos e essential steps must be taken which will accom plish this. He said when He was on earth two thous and years ago, \"I came not to bring peace, but a sword.\" The sword of the spirit is wielded by the Hierarchy, and by its means cosmic evil is arrested; the sword of discrimination is wielded by the initiat es and the disciples of the world, and by its means the distinction between good and evil, with a cons eque nt presentation of free choi ce between the two, has been laid before hum anity, and the lines of demarcation have been made abunda ntly clear in this wo rld war. It had been the hope of the Christ and the longi ng of all the Masters that men woul d see clearly and make free and right choi ce, so that — without phys ical plane warfare — they woul d bring about the needed change s and the endi ng of wrong condi tions . B ut the conf lict descende d on to the phys ical plane and the sword of material war (sym bol ically speaking) was taken up by hum anity. Forget not (particularly thos e of you who are out raged by phys ical conf lict through your pacifist inclinations ) that, in the West, it was Germany which first of all took the sword in hand, marching into Poland and bringing misery, devastation and cruelty to a smaller and much weaker nation, thus forcing France and Great Britain to fulfil their pledge d obl igations to that little nation and to declare war upo n the aggr essor. It was Japan who brought war into the Eastern hemisphe re. The Forces of Light were left with no alternative but to fight in defense of freedom. Prior to the war, the Hierarchy did what it coul d to change the trend of hum an living and thinki ng, awakening the cons ciences of the intelligent, stimulating the activity of the hum anitarians and impressing the minds of Their disciples in order to arous e goodw ill, a driving desire for right hum an relations a nd peaceful condi tions . But the move ment was not strong enough; the sword appe ared on earth and manki nd was plunge d into war. Since then the work of impressing the minds of the world disciples and of thos e whom they can influence has been along the lines of clarifying the issues, making plain that for which we fight , and arous ing men and wom en to take such action as will, onc e and for all, end the pos sibility of a similar world cataclysm. The activities of our Master, the Christ, fall into three categor ie s: 1. Stiffening the will to fight on behalf of the spiritual issues and for the great hum anitarian aims of the Hierarchy. 2. Impressing the minds of diplom ats, thinke rs and love rs of manki nd to work out now certain pos t - war plans which will entirely cha nge our present civilisation and bring about the new."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST 3. Arous ing the minds of the masses and turning them — each in his ow n place and manne r — into a more religious channe l. The grow th of spiritual desire and aspiration is phe nom enal toda y, coul d you but see the indi cations as the workers on the inne r side do. Our Master, the Christ, is also at this time carrying forward three major activities. I can tell you briefly what they are, but onl y the disciples of the world will grasp the true implications . He is, first of all, occupi ed with the process of deflecting the will - energy, emanating from Shamballa, in such a way that it will not be seized upon and misused by the Axis Pow ers in order to stiffen their peopl es into increased oppos ition to the Forces of Ligh t. It must be rechanne lled and used to stiffen the pur pos e of the United Nations to carry the war to a finish of victory and of trium ph, to increase the will - to - uni ty of all the allied peopl es and to make firm the intention of the pos t - war planne rs that fr eedom , educ ationa l facilities, truth and right living shall be the lot of the incom ing generation. This necessitates on the part of the Christ a conc entration for which we have no equi valent word and a pur ely spiritual ende avour (a mona dic effor t) of which we have no faintest idea. Secondl y, He is working within the confines of the Hierarchy itself, preparing His disciples, the Masters, for certain great pos t - war events. For the war will end. The Restoration of the Mysteries, the initiation of t hos e disciples who have stood firm and una fraid during the war, the enlargement of Their ashrams, ow ing to the almost unf oreseen developm ent of the spiritual sense among the world aspirants who woul d not nor mally have becom e disciples dur ing this incarnati on, and also the externalisation of Their ashrams dur ing the next one hundr ed years, preparatory to the reappe arance of the Hierarchy upon earth, are som e of His present hierarchical respons ibilities. These invol ve a tremendous expe ndi ture of force, of sec ond ray energy, just as His first activity demands an unus ual expe ndi ture of first ray pow er — som ething which even He, in His high place, is onl y now learning to handl e, as a pledge d Disciple of Sanat Kum ara. His third activity is the effort to offset the grow ing hate in the world, to strengt hen the trend tow ards uni ty, and to show peopl e everyw here the dange r of separateness. A grow ing and (from the worldly poi nt of view) reasona ble hatred of the German peopl e and of the Japanese is steadily rising. This h ate they have brought upon themselves. Hate ever lacks discrimination. The great Law of Spiritual Retribut ion requi res that justice be meted out, but hatred will close the eyes of justice. The law must be adm inistered, and the world will see the expr ession of that same law, stated in the words, \"Whatsoever a man sow eth, that shall he also reap.\" But the materialistic law of hate and of separation must be negated and offset. The probl em with which the Christ is faced is wellnigh — from the hum an angl e — insolubl e. He will requi re the uni ted effort of all men of goodw ill to stem the rising tide of hate — the floodga tes of which were ope ned by Germany when she began her attacks upon the Jews; she is now in dange r of drow ning in the waters which she has set loos e. There is also a rising tende ncy to separation among certain of the Allied Nations , with which the Christ must deal. Several of them are as hous es divided against themselves. Such are Poland, France, Yugos lavia and Greece. How can their differences be reconc iled? The hate of thos e who have suffered at the hands of the Axis Pow ers, or as a result of war condi tions , must be offset. How can this be done ? Such are som e of the probl ems with which the Christ is wrestling. He must work through His disciple s, and They must be trained. He must work through the stimulation of the hearts of the intelligent peopl e and of the hum anitarians everyw here. He must pou r out the life - giving energy of the Christ - life on a wide scale throughout the entire world, and do so in the"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST midst of thos e condi tions wherein hum an receptivity and sensitivity are at their low est poi nt, ow ing to the num bne ss which com es through intense suffering. He stands in His place unm ove d and una fraid, with clear perception of the truth and spiritua l insight into the true situation. In collabor ation with His great Brother, the Buddha , He is preparing for the next step. Toda y the Hierarchy is facing a climaxing activity. From the Full Moon of May, 1944 , unt il the Full Moon of May, 1945 , the Members o f the Hierarchy will uni tedly be put ting forth Their maximum effort to close the doo r upon the Forces of Evil, to direct the Shamballa energy (now let loos e upon the world) so that its destructive aspect may be transmuted or directed tow ards the stimulatio n which will result in the rebui lding of the world. This will then affect not onl y the Members of the Hierarchy, but all on Earth who respond to hierarchical impression. Have the follow ing statement in mind: \"The focussed and conc entrated work of the Hier archy at the time of the Full Moon of May, 1944 is — by Their uni ted effort, Their blende d thought and Their illum ined will pow er, unde r the trained gui dance of the Buddha and the Christ — to withdr aw the energy of the will - to - separation and aggr ess ion (a distortion of first ray energy) away from the Forces of Evil and channe l it again, via the Hierarchy; it will then demons trate as the Will - to - Good, and this will expr ess itself via the men of goodw ill on Earth. This requi res a great Act of Absorptio n by the Hierarchy. \" The Buddha will start the process at the time of His appe arance, through the use of a great first ray mantram. This can be used onl y by som eone of His initiate standi ng and in collabor ation with the Lord of the World. He will thereby deflect the Shamballa force which the Adepts of the Black Lodge have turned loos e into the Axis nations ; this has been made pos sible by their receptivity to the will - to - pow er. He will \"corral\" it (if I may use such a colloqu ial and inappr opr iate term) and will place it at the dispos al of the Christ. The reception and the acceptance of this first ray energy will requi re a tremendous effort upon the part of the Christ, the Custodi an of the energy of the second Ray of Love - Wisdom . It is for this \"reception\" th at He started to prepare at the time of the April Full Moon. I have told you elsewhere that this direct impact of the Shamballa energy upon humanity very seldom occurs. It has been loos ed onl y three times dur ing the entire history of the hum an kingdo m. At other times, it makes its impact directly upon the Hierarchy, and is then transmuted or steppe d dow n so that hum anity can take it. The three times it has been directed, uni mpeded and unt ransmuted, tow ards hum anity are: 1. At the time of the indi vidua lisa tion of animal - man when the mind principle was implanted. This was the birth hour of the hum an soul . 2. In Atlantean days when the pow er of the Black Lodge was so great that defeat faced the Hierarchy and the destruction of the human soul . Shamballa then interfered, and the world of that time was destroye d. This period is recogni sed in mode rn history as the time of the Great Flood. 3. Toda y, onc e again, the Pow ers of Darkne ss are attempting to destroy hum anity and the spiritual values. The pow e r of Shamballa was let loos e, destroyi ng old forms — pol itical, social and religious — but at the same time this pow er was seized upon by the evil forces to destroy the soul s of men, to precipitate war and to destroy the cities and all our centres of civilisat ion and culture. The first pha se or form of destruction was directed by the disciples, the aspirants and the clear thinking peopl e of the world, and this was needed and very good. The old social, pol itical and religious forms were stultifying the hum an sou l and handi cappi ng all progress. The second pha se or form of destruction was directed by"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST evil, and was focussed through thos e nations who had succum bed to the glamour of supe riority, to the temptation of material aggr ession and to intolerant racial hatreds , implemented by cruelty and barbarism. The time has now com e when this divine energy must expr ess itself through the second aspect of the will - to - good , and not through the first aspect, the will - to - pow er. Manki nd has had to be show n that it is not yet re ady for pow er, because the will - to - good is not adequa tely strong to balance this first aspect of the will. This then is the task of the Christ and of the Buddha at the time of the May Full Moon — to channe l and redirect the Shamballa force. If They can do t his, the result will be a new realisation and accom plishm ent of the will - to - good by the New Group of World Servers, unde r the receptive gui dance of the world disciples and a respons ive activity of the men and wom en of goodw ill. Therefore, get this clearly in mind, so that your coope ration can be intelligent and right ly directed. First, at the time of the May Full Moon , the Buddha will sound out a great mantram and becom e the \"absorbing Agent\" of the first ray force. He will use the magne tic pow e r of the second ray to attract this force to Himself and will hol d it steady, prior to redirecting it. The Christ will then — on behalf of the Hierarchy — becom e the \"receiving Agent\" of this pot ent energy, and the seven groups of Masters Who work with the hum an and sub - hum an kingdom s will (in respons e to His demand) becom e the \"directing Agents\" for the sevenfold expr ession of this force. Second, at the time of the June Full Moon , the Hierarchy, unde r the guidance of the Christ, will let loos e this will - to - go od upon hum anity, produc ing seven great results, according to the seven subr ays of this first Ray of Will or Pow er: 1. Pow er will be given to the disciples of the world and the initiates among men, so that they can direct efficiently and wisely the com ing process of rebui lding. 2. The will - to - love will stimulate the men of good will everyw here so that hatred will gradua lly be ove rcom e and men will seek to live toge ther coope ratively. This will take som e time, but the inne r urge is there and subj ect to stim ulation. 3. The will - to - action will lead intelligent peopl e throughout the world to inaugur ate thos e activities which will lay the founda tion for a new, better and happi er world. 4. The will - to - coope rate will steadily increase also. Men will desire and d emand right human relations — a result more general than that produc ed by the activity of the first three aspects of this ray, but which will be a natural out com e of this activity. 5. The will - to - know and to think correctly and creatively will becom e an out standi ng characteristic of the masses. Know ledge is the first step tow ards wisdom . 6. The will - to - persist (which is an aspect of devot ion and idealism) will becom e a human characteristic — a subl imation of the basic instinct of self - preservation. This will lead to a persistent belief in the ideals presented by the Hierarchy, and the demons tration of immortality. 7. The will - to - organise will further a building process which will be carried forward unde r the direct"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST inspiration of the Hierarchy. The medium will be the pot ency of the will - to - good of the New Group of World Servers and the respons ive goodw ill of mankind. I have expr essed in these few simple terms the results of the planne d determination of the two Great Lords which must take shape and emerge at the time of the May and June Full Moons . What they succeed in doi ng will take years to demons trate, but the end is inevitable onc e the right direction of the will - to - good has been achieved. This demons tration is depende nt, how ever, upon two thing s: 1. The focussed work of the Christ and of the Hierarchy dur ing the com ing year, until May 1945 . 2. The reflective thinki ng and careful planni ng of the New Group of World Servers during the same period. Much out er activity upon a planetary scale will n ot be pos sible till 1945 , but much can then becom e pos sible if hierarchical requi rements are met. A year of preparation for the tremendous task of implementing the will - to - good and of produc ing a better civilisation and way of life is shor t inde ed. The Ch rist has gone into retreat for a month and cannot be reached even by the Masters unt il May 5th. He is in closest cons ultation with the Buddha and with the Lord of the World. This great Triangl e of Potencies — the Lord of Will or Pow er, the Lord of Wisdom , an d the Lord of Love — are toda y entirely preoccupi ed with the task of bringi ng the war to an end, and therefore with the task of neutralising the destroye r aspect of the first ray. This They will do by implementing the will - to - good by means of the wisdom of w hich the Buddha is the expe rienced Custodi an, and also by laying dow n thos e plans whereby the Christ may — via the Hierarchy and the New Group of World Servers — bring about that \"lovi ng unde rstandi ng\" (esoterically unde rstood and bearing little res emblance to what is usually unde rstood by thos e words) in the hearts of men. When this Triangl e of Energies has sync hroni sed its efforts, then at the May Full Moon, the great task of leading hum anity into the light of a new day can be begun. In the meanti me, the Masters and Their ashrams are likewise getting ready to implement these plans and are ende avour ing to inspire Their disciples with the same vision and obj ectives, so that they too may be prepared to play their due part. Such, my brothers, is the s ituation as regards the position of hum anity and the intentions and work of the Hierarchy. What then is the work which you can and must do? I have for years indi cated certain lines of activity which we, the Teachers and Guides on the inne r side of life, w oul d have all aspirants and disciples follow. The plans out lined by me during the past ten years are definitely a part of the hierarchical progr amme and are being presented in their specific forms by the other Masters. There is little that I can add. There is not hing which I tell you at this time that you do not already know . Do I need to ask you to work indi vidua lly and in the place where you are for nationa l and world uni ty? Must I plead with you to do what you can to heal divisions , and thus rende r effec tive that basic integrity which shoul d uni te the three major world pow ers through which the Hierarchy is attempting to work? Do I need to enjoin the necessity to count eract hate with justice, unde rstandi ng and mercy? Have I to cont inue expl aining the need for the com plete trium ph of the Forces of Light , for the trium pha nt progr ess of the armies of the United Nations , and for that trium ph to be won first of all on spiritual levels and then carried through — with com mons ense and persistence — on to the phys ical s ide of life, as well as in the intervening mental world? Do I need to ask for the cont rol of emotions in the general interest, and for the cons ecration of time, energy and mone y to the"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST enor mous task of hum an salvage? On these poi nts I shall not dw ell. Nothing is here gained by reiteration except the grow ing burden of a respons ibility which you can shoul der to you r eternal happi ness or discard to you r shame and eventual karmic reaction. Only this will I say: Get rid of selfishne ss, provi ncialism and insularity. Think in terms of the one hum anity. Let your lives count in the scale of useful and needed service. Leave off saying and thinki ng thos e things which are critical of others — other peopl e and other allied nations . See the issues of this conf li ct clearly, and let no false and glamorous sentiment lead you to favour weakne ss tow ards the Axis Pow ers at this uni que and critical mom ent. The form or forms of their tyranny must be broke n and due paym ent made in all justice and discrimination to an out r aged world. But the soul s that implemented that tyranny must — through sore trial and right spiritual direction — be again led to walk in the light . The children of the Axis nations must not be penalised for the wickedne ss or the weakne ss of their fathers; the y must be educ ated in new and better ways and love d into right unde rstandi ng of their relations hips. For two com plete generations there must be a peace which will be unbr oke n because behind it and protecting it will stand the Armies of the Lord. At the cl ose of that time, if the educ ationa l work done has been adequa te, sane, wise and sound, then these Armies can rest from their labou rs and the sword be turned into the ploughs hare. If this progr amme of supe rvision, educ ation and spiritual direction is not t hus enforced, the war that woul d then take place woul d wipe out hum anity — as happe ned onc e before in human history. I woul d here refer you to a parable, spoke n in terms of far - sight ed vision and warning by the Christ centuries ago, anent the man who cleane d hous e, casting out the devils; when it was all swept and garnished, it remained empty (as sym bol of unus ed oppor tuni ty and igno red respons ibility) and then, as the Lord of Light put it, \"the last state of that man was worse than the first.\" The sweeping and cleansing has been goi ng on for five long years, the final stages of this destroyi ng but cleansing process are now being taken. Then, my brothers, what? I have told you ove r the years what we seek to have you do: Rally to the aid of the New Group of World Servers, hard pressed in this day of battle. Spread goodw ill — to hum anity as a whol e, learning steadily to think in terms of that whol e; uphol d those activities which benefit the whol e and do not favour one particular nation, even if it is y our ow n. Work toda y for victory and for the anni hilation of evil. Work tom orrow for justice and for the restoration of security. When there is security, readjustment, the obl iteration of the aggr essor leaders, protection and restoration of the weak and the oppr essed, plus right living condi tions and wise educ ation for the yout h of the world, then peace will com e but not till then. Let the sopor ific of beautiful peace talk die out and let sane methods of establishing goodw ill and right hum an relations preced e the discussion of peace. The world talked itself into a dreamy state of idealistic rhapsody about peace between the first pha se of this world war and the present one . This must not again occur and it is the task of the intelligent hum anitarian to prevent it. For the work to be done dur ing the next twelve months (and then cont inue d dur ing the ensuing years), I make one last appe al. Stand with fixed intent, implementing the massed intent of the unt hinki ng, the terrified and the distressed and weak. Coope ra te with the New Group of World Servers in every land. Let the Full Moons of May and June cons titute high poi nts of spiritual attainm ent which can and will condi tion your daily life and service during the ensuing year. Let nothing deter you. Nothing from an y qua rter causes the Christ to deviate from His planned pur pos e; just in so far as His pur pos es coincide with your soul pur pos e, move out ward into a wider field of service. If you feel no respons e to world"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST need and no call to serve, then beware and seek a deeper measure of soul cont act and spiritual relations hip. Every word spoke n or written at this time by an aspirant or a disciple is of a definite pot ency — either good or bad. You know about the New Group of World Servers. The work of the men an d wom en of goodw ill has been presented to you. The reque st for the forming of triangl es of light and of goodw ill has been placed clearly before you . The need for clear thinki ng is plain. The Hierarchy asks for your aid and your suppor t in the arena of worl d affairs. I have myself laid my plans before you . There the programme must be left to be carried out by you if you choos e. For a qua rter of a century (since 1919) I have taught you. I ask now for you r coope ration in our mutual respons ibility — the helping o f hum anity. May He Whom we all love and serve, the Master of all Masters and the undyi ng Friend of Manki nd shed His light upon you r way and evoke your trust, your unde rstandi ng and you r help in His task — climaxing this year — of leading hum anity into the lig ht of a new day. THE CYCLE OF CONFERENCES March 1945 The three months of March, April and May in this year mark a mom ent in time of major signi ficance in our planetary history. I refer to the Easter Full Moon, celebrated on March 28t h, the Wesak Full Moon, which falls this year on April 27t h, and the Full Moon of June — Christ's \"Unique Occasion\" as it has been called — which falls on May 26t h. From the standpoi nt of both the Hierarchy and Hum anity, the events dur ing these few weeks of spiritual and munda ne impor t (focussed through these three Festival Moons of Aries, Taur us and Gemini ) will be of stupe ndous effect. What is done dur ing this time by the Members of the spiritual Hierarchy of our planet (Who face a major test of Their hierarchical pow er , not a test of Their love ), what is accom plished by the disciples working in the world at this time, and also by the New Group of World Servers, can and will determine the destiny of man for centuries to com e. Even thos e who have no know ledge of occult matters or of hum an fate or of the effective enterprise of hum an free will (esoterically unde rstood) stand toda y with bated breath, waiting to see what will happe n and tow ards which goa l or goa ls hum an thinki ng and planni ng will be directed. The masses of manki nd everyw here have onl y one desire — tranqui llity. I use not the word \"peace,\" because it has such a misleading connot ation. Thinking men and wom en in every count ry stand with massed intent, determined, if pos sible, to take thos e steps which will en sure peace on Earth, through the expr ession of goodw ill. Note that phr asing. The working disciples throughout the world are strugg ling with every means at their dispos al to spread the gospel of sacrifice, because onl y upon sacrifice can world stability be safely founde d — the sacrifice of selfishne ss. In thos e words is sum med up the demand being made on thos e whos e respons ibility it is to determine pol icies (nationa l and internationa l) and to take those steps which will establish right hum an relations . The Hi erarchy stands — no longe r watching and waiting, but acting toda y with impelling wisdom and fixed decision in order to strengt hen the hands of Their workers in every field of hum an activity (pol itical, educ ationa l and religious ) so that they may take right a ction and correctly influence hum an thinki ng. "},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST A pow erful first ray activity — the activity of will or pur pos e — is swingi ng into action. The Christ, as the Leader of the Forces of Light , has empow ered the Ashrams of the Masters upon this first Ray of Pow er to strengt hen the hands of all disciples in the field of gove rnm ent and of pol itical arrange ment in every nation; to enlight en, if pos sible, the various nationa l legislatures by whatever means may be needed, so that the potency of their words, the wisdom of their planni ng, and the breadth of their thinki ng may prove so effective that the \"Cycle of Conf erences and of Counc ils,\" now being initiated by the statesmen of the world, may be unde r the direct gui dance (again if pos sible) of Thos e in the Counc il Chambe r at Shamballa Who know what is the Will of God. The selfishne ss of the little minds in the various legislatures of the world must in some way be offset. That is the probl em. I wonde r if you can grasp the signi ficance of this happe ning? Dow n the ages, indi vidua l statesmen and rulers have from time to time been respons ive to the influence of that spiritually supr eme Counc il; but it has been the respons iveness of the indi vidual disciple who has worked alone and una ided and who has faced, (or expe ri enced) defeat as often, if not oftener, than he has expe rienced victory. Toda y, in the planni ng now goi ng forward in conne ction with the various internationa l conf erences and counc ils of which you all know , the spiritual effort (for the first time in hum an history) is to bring all of them, as func tioni ng groups , unde r the direct impact of the energy which motivates and actuates that place where the Will of God is know n and the pur pos es of divinity are defined and projected. This means that each of the com in g world conferences (and there will necessarily be many) will have a greater and far more extensive effect than woul d otherwise be the case; it means, how ever, that the risks invol ved and the clash of minds will also be far greater. This is a point which y ou shoul d bear in mind as you study and read repor ts of these various conf erences. Forget not that divine energy must make its impact upon hum an minds ; these minds are the onl y available instrum ent — in their aggr egated effect — through which the Will of God can expr ess itself; they are necessarily respons ive to the stimulating and energising results of that impact, and this will evoke results suited to the type of mind affected. Respons e will be com patible with the qua lity and the intention of thos e minds . W here goodw ill is present, and where there is uns elfish intention and a broad poi nt of view, thos e qua lities will be strengt hened and endow ed with pot ency; where selfishne ss rules, where isolationi sm and separativeness are present, and where there is the in tention to gain indi vidua l and nationa l ends instead of thos e internationa l purpos es which will profit all humanity, thos e qua lities will equa lly gain in strengt h. Two mom entous , but preliminary, conf erences have already taken place, thus inaugur ating thi s new cycle of group func tioni ng . The League of Nations was an abor tive effort — well intentione d but relatively useless, as later happe nings prove d. One of these initial conferences was held at Yalta. There, three men, cons tituting a basic triang le, met with goodw ill to all and ende avour ed to lay the ground for com ing world happe nings . All true move ments condi tioni ng long cycles in world affairs have at their centre a triangl e through which energy can flow and certain definite purpos es can be wor ked out . Little is unde rstood, as yet, anent the nature of the task to be done or the type of men who work in first ray groups and Ashrams, and in Whos e hands the pol itical destiny of man rests at any one time. The whol e subj ect of discipleship has been di storted by theologi cal definitions , based upon sweetness of character, which often works singul arly for ineffectiveness. The long cycle of ecclesiastical rule has biased hum an thinki ng so that the nature of spiritual strengt h and effectiveness is interpret ed in terms of religion and in the terminol ogy of chur chianity (I did not say, of Christianity), or in the phr aseology of a marked pacifism or a dom inating, religious , tempor al cont rol. The long rule of the various chur ches is ove r. This shoul d be grasped. They have done their work — in the early stages very good work, in the middle"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST stages a necessary cons olidating work, and in the mode rn stage a crystallising and reactiona ry work. The rule of the chur ches is ove r, but not the precepts of Christianity or the example of the Christ. He is, how ever, respons ible for a newer and more effective presentation of the com ing world religion, and for that the chur ches shoul d prepare, if they have enough illum ination to recogni se their need and His effort to meet that need . Toda y a balance must be reached, and this will take place through the medium of an enlight ened statesmanship and through a pol itical activity which will be based increasingl y upon the good of the whol e of hum anity, and not upon benefiting any one nation in particular. This balance will not be expr essed in religious terms and in so - called spiritual terminol ogy . It will expr ess itself through group work, through conf erences, through League s of Nations , organised parties and legislation. All of t his will be the result of an intensive activity of the Masters and of Their disciples upon the first Ray of Will or Pow er. The qua lity of their work will be to expr ess the will - to - good; they see the world in large terms. To the uni nitiate, they may at time s seem isolated in their actions and ove r - pow erful in the decisions which they reach and which they then proclaim to the world — much to the irritation of the little - minde d and of thos e who interpret freedom in terms of their indi vidua l, une nlight ened poi nt of view. They are, how ever, working unde r spiritual direction as much as any religious leader and this will increasingl y be recogni sed. History will justify their actions , because they will have given a trend to world affairs and to hum an thinki ng which wi ll work out in a clearer perception of necessity. What they do will evoke discussion and ofttimes disagreement, as have the decisions of the Yalta triangl e of workers. But they are so cons tituted that they do not resent this; they know that the discussion evoke d and the criticisms raised will reveal the inhe rent smallness and separative instincts of their oppone nts, and — at the same time — will evoke the bandi ng together of thos e who see behind the appa rently high - hande d initial activity an effort to precipita te with clarity the issues with which hum anity is faced. Thus hum anity can be brough t to unde rstandi ng. These are the things which the triangl e at Yalta attempted to do. These they may not have cons cious ly recogni sed as the work asked of them on account of their discipleship, but they autom atically worked this way because they correctly sensed hum an need. They were and are handi cappe d by the fact of their ow n hum anity, which makes them liable to make mistakes, but they are far more handi cappe d by the facts of human selfishne ss and nationa l greed and by the general low level of hum an attainm ent — viewing hum anity as one whol e. Having made the issues clear, as they see them, having evoke d the enthus iasm of the men of goodw ill in the world, and the violent criti cism of thos e who think in terms of partisanship, nationa lism, and prejudi ce, the expe riment of the conf erence in Mexico City was unde rtaken with success. It was realised that there was an ascertainable measure of hemisphe ric uni ty upon which st atesmen coul d count , and thus a founda tion coul d be created for the far more difficult internationa l conference to be held in San Francisco at the time of the Wesak, the Full Moon of the Buddha . Not for not hing is this conf erence being held dur ing the five days of the Wesak Full Moon. It will be a time of supr eme difficulty, in which the Forces of Light will face what I call \"the forces of selfishne ss and separativeness.\" Subj ectively speaking, the conf erence will be unde r the direct influence of the Hiera rchy. The cons eque nt stimulation of bot h the selfish and the uns elfish aspects will evoke a tremendous emotional and mental pot ency. It is therefore essential that all aspirants and disciples throw the weight of their spiritual developm ent and the light of their soul s on the side of the Forces which are attempting to plan for the good of hum anity, and who regard the welfare of the whol e as of far greater impor tance than any nationa l situation or demand. "},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Forget not that the Forces of Evil are still pow erful , particularly on the phys ical plane, and that there are many channe ls through which they can work. Germany is defeated, but is still capable of a final effort of destructiveness and violence. Japan is well on the way to defeat, but is still pow erful. The hierarchy of evil on the inne r side is being pus hed back by the Forces of Light , but its grip on hum anity has not relaxed. It is through ignor ance that these forces can still attain much pow er — the igno rance of hum anity itself. Nations and peopl e are still igno rant of the true nature of each other; the world is full of distrust and suspicion. Hum anity as a whol e kno ws little about Russia, for instance. The true signi ficance of Its ideology is misunde rstood because of the initial mistakes of thos e who engi nee red the revol ution; the license of unr uly men in the early days gave onl ooki ng hum anity a wrong slant on what was happe ning. But thos e days are ove r. In the fires of suffering and through deepened unde rstandi ng, this great and com pos ite nation w ill adva nce tow ards a demons tration of brotherhood which may yet set an example to the entire world. China needs a full literacy; her citizens as a whol e know not hing of other nations ; on a highe r turn of the spiral, that educ ationa l supr emacy which distin gui shed an oligarchy of learning in the days of China's ancient glory will again distingui sh the masses of her peopl e. The great cont inent of Europe and the British peopl es are still una ware of the real signi ficance of the Western hemisphe re and of the Uni ted States — with its exube rant yout hfulness. They find it as irritating as their deeper maturity and wide expe rience prove s irritating to Americans. Americans, bot h in the nor thern and in the sout hern hemisphe res, are still basically ignor ant of the history of the nations from which they spring, because they have laid the empha sis upon their relatively brief history and have been brought up on a biased and oft prejudi ced picture of Europe an culture and of British aims. This ignor ance throughout the world pla ys right into the hands of the Forces of Evil and — beaten as they now are on the phys ical plane — they will give more violent battle to world goodw ill on the planes of emotiona l decision, and on mental levels to thos e ideologi es which are of benefit to the wh ole of hum anity. Phys ical plane methods having resulted onl y in the com plete devastation of Europe and in casualties which (if civilian men, wom en and children are include d) amount to unt old millions , the forces of evil will now ende avour to utilise the c har acter of hum anity as a whol e (at its present total poi nt of developm ent) to hinde r the Forces of Light , prevent the attainm ent of world tranqui llity and world unde rstandi ng, and thus delay the day of their ow n final defeat. This defeat, when accom plishe d, must include the three worlds of hum an evol ution — mental, emotiona l and phys ical. For long these evil forces have used psychol ogy in order to reach the ends they had in view, and have used it with amazing success; they are still using it, and can be depe nde d upon to employ its methods to the uttermost. They use the press and the radio in order to distort hum an thinki ng; they present half - truths, imput e false motives, rake up past grievances, foretell (with forebodi ng) imminent difficulties; the y foster ancient prejudi ces and hatreds, and empha sise religious and nationa l differences. In spite of much shout ing, demandi ng and propos ed organisation, there is no truly free press anyw here; particularly is it absent in the United States, where parties and pub lishers dictate newspaper pol icies. The main reason why there is no really free press is based on two factors: first, the fact that hum anity is not yet free from its predetermined reasoni ngs , its basic igno rances of factual history, or of nations an d their psychol ogy; hum anity is still cont rolled by racial and nationa l bias and by prejudi ce. Secondl y, the fact that all this is nur tured and kept alive by the forces of evil, working upon the inne r side of hum an affairs and dealing mainly with the psych ologi cal angl e because it is so exceedingl y pot ent. This they will increasingl y do as this planetary war draws to a close; they will seek to offset the work of the Hierarchy, to hamper the activities of the New Group of World Servers and to cloud the issue s invol ved to such a degree that the men of goodw ill everyw here will be bewildered and will fail to see the clear out lines of the factual situation or distingui sh between what is true and what is false. Forget not , the forces of evil are exceedingl y clever ."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST It is necessary also to remind our selves that, having won the war against aggr ession and barbarity upon the phys ical plane (and it is won) , humanity has now earned the right to carry that accom plishm ent through to psychol ogi cal and actual mental victory , and to do this toge ther and with the mustered aid of enlight ened men and wom en from every count ry — hence the inaugur ation of this Cycle of Conf erences and Counc ils. This cycle will prove long or shor t, according to the release of the will - to - good from the spiritual world, in respons e to the massed intent of the men and wom en of goodw ill everyw here. As the destroyi ng aspect of the Will of God nears the accom plishing of divine pur pos e, the will - to - good can emerge with clarity and dom inate hum an affairs. Out of the immensity of planetary evil, demons trated through the destructive war of the past few years (1914 - 1945 ), great and permanent goo d can com e; the spiritual Hierarchy stands ready to evoke the good latent behind the work of destruction whic h has been done , but this can be so onl y if the goodw ill of hum anity itself is employe d with adequa te invoc ative pow er. If this goodw ill finds expr ession, two things can occur: first, certain pot encies and forces can be released upon the earth which will a id men's effort to attain right hum an relations , with its resultant effect — peace; secondl y, the forces of evil will be so pot ently defeated that never again will they be able to wreak such uni versal destruction upon earth. Years ago I said that the war wh ich may follow this one woul d be waged in the field of the world religions . Such a war will not work out , how ever, in a similar period of extreme carnage and blood; it will be fough t largely with mental weapons and in the world of thought ; it will invol ve also the emotiona l realm, from the standpoi nt of idealistic fanaticism. This inhe rent fanaticism (found ever in reactiona ry groups ) will fight against the appe arance of the com ing world religion and the spread of esotericism. For this struggl e certain of t he well - organised chur ches, through their cons ervative elements (their most pow erful elements), are already girding themselves. Thos e sensitive to the new spiritual impacts are still far from pow erful; that which is new always faces the supr eme difficulty of supe rseding and ove rcom ing that which is old and established. Fanaticism, entrenched theologi cal pos itions , and materialistic selfishne ss are to be found actively organised in the chur ches in all cont inents and of all denom inations . They can be expe cted to fight for their established ecclesiastical order, their material profit and their tempor al rule, and already are making the needed preparations. The com ing struggl e will emerge within the chur ches themselves; it will also be precipitated by the enligh tened elements who exist in fair num bers already, and are rapidly grow ing in strengt h through the impact of hum an necessity. The fight will then spread to thinki ng men and wom en everyw here who — in a protesting revol t — have denied orthodox chur chia nity and theology . They are not irreligious but have, through pain and sorrow , learned (withou t ecclesiastical help) that the spiritual values are the onl y values which can salvage hum anity, that the Hierarchy stands , and that Christ — as the sym bol of peace and the Leader of the Forces of Light — is not a negligible force but one that is evoki ng respons e from the hearts of men everyw here. True religion will com e to be interpreted in terms of the will - to - good and its practical expression, goodw ill . The com ing w orld conf erences and the internationa l counc ils will give indi cation of the strengt h of this new spiritual respons e (on the part of hum anity) to the ove rshadow ing spiritual Potencies awaiting the invoc ative cry of manki nd. When that cry arises, these divin e energies will precipitate themselves into the realm of hum an thinki ng and planni ng. Men will then find themselves gifted with renewed strengt h and with the needed insight which will enable them to drive out the entrenched materialistic forces and the pow er of selfish interests — bande d toge ther to prevent hum an freedom . If the conferences to be held in the near future demons trate that manki nd is truly striving to bring about right hum an relations , the forces of evil can then be driven back; the Forces of Li ght will then take cont rol."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST The probl em facing the Hierarchy is how to further these desirable ends without infringi ng on hum an freedom of thought and action. It is with this probl em that the great Counc il of the spiritual realm, of the Kingdom of God, is dealing at this time, and it will provi de the subj ect of Their discussions and final decision unt il the middl e of June . When the sun begins to move sout hw ard again, Their decisions will have been made on the basis of hum an demand. Hum anity will by then ha ve indicated the strength and nature of its goodw ill; it will have sounde d the \"word of invoc ation\" — reaching up into the spiritual realm like a breathing forth of the very soul of humanity; it will have expressed a measure of its willingne ss to sacrifice i n order to stabilise hum an living, and to rid the world of separativeness and of the abus es which culminated in this war; it will at least have set the stage for the blueprinting and planni ng which the Cycle of Conf erences and Councils will unde rtake. On the side of the Hierarchy and in respons e to hum an demand (in degree and in kind, according to the qual ity of the demand) , the Hierarchy will play its part and aid in making pos sible that which men dream, vision, and for which they plan toda y. L et us cons ider for a minut e what the Hierarchy stands ready to do and what its Members will plan and formulate during the Easter Festival this mont h, during the Wesak Festival in April, and dur ing the Festival of the Christ at the end of May. It might be s aid that the Hierarchy, in conj unc tion with the great Counc il of the Will of God at Shamballa, will divide Their work into three parts, each gove rning three pha ses of the com ing restoration of hum anity to civilised and cultured living on a new and higher t urn of the spiral. They will deal with the probl em of spiritual freedom , as it embodi es itself in the Four Freedom s, and with the probl em of right hum an relations , as it will expr ess itself through internationa l relations , nationa l parties and general hum a n affairs. It is not for me to tell you what hum anity, throug h its statesmen and leaders, will plan to do at the com ing conf erences. It is my task to mobilise the New Group of World Servers and the men and wom en of goodw ill so that they may stand as a grea t \"army of implacable spiritual will\" behind the participants in these conf erences and counc ils, enabling them to think with clarity about the issues invol ved and thus (through this clear thinki ng) affect telepathically the minds of men; this invo lves the use of a pow er seldom employe d as yet on the side of right eous ende avour , though already widely used by the materialistic leaders of the forces of evil. It is the task of the Hierarchy to find and reach the enlight ened men and wom en in all the chur ches, a ll the pol itical parties, all the organisations — social, econom ic, and educ ationa l — so that their uni ted pur pos e will be clear. This They will do through the medium of Their active, working disciples in the world. Thus They will pave the way for t he true freedom of manki nd — a freedom which is as yet a dream and a hope in even the most democratic countries. But behind all this activity, watched ove r by the spiritual Guides of the race but determined and implemented by hum anity itself, will be found the focussed attention of the Hierarchy. This spiritual tension which exists among Them is far more pot ent than any of you suspect; it is part of Their preparatory work to make available certain spiritual forces and pow ers which — though com plementary or sup plementary to the self - initiated effort of mankind — will make that effort successful. What hum anity has now to do, and is already doing to a certain degree, is to arrive at a right orientation as regards hum an affairs. Let us therefore look at the three pha ses of this preparatory work now goi ng on, and ende avour to gauge what will be the results if these energies and pot encies are released through the invoc ative demand of men. The Forces of Restoration"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST There is first of all the pha se, now in progress, whi ch will culminate at the time of the Easter Full Moon. This is dedicated to planni ng for an inflow of the Forces of Restoration . Do not misunde rstand these words. The Hierarchy is not occupi ed with the restoration of the old order, with the state of life p rior to the war, or with the renewal of the theologies (religious , pol itical and social) which have gove rned the past and which have been largely respons ible for the war. The restoration referred to is psychol ogi cal in nature, but will work out in the rest oration of the will - to - live and the will - to - good . It will cons eque ntly be founda tiona l, and will gua rantee the new civilisation and culture. This is a very different matter. These Forces of Restoration are conc erned with human vision, hum an integrity and hum an relations as they unde rlie the entire probl em of the brotherhoo d of man. These energies, if released upon the Earth, will rende r futile the efforts of the old order (in pol itics, religion and educ ation) to restore what was and to bring bac k that which existed prior to the war. They will ende avour to offset two tende ncies which will have to be taken into mom entous cons ideration dur ing the com ing cycle of conf erences: a. The tende ncy to crystallise, to cherish that which has gone (and gone f orever, let us hope ) and to ove r - estimate that which is old, worn - out and, if I may use the word, stagna nt. b. The tende ncy to ove r - fatigue and to com plete collapse — onc e the war is ove r. This tende ncy is due to the weight of the war and to the phys ical an d psychol ogi cal strain unde r which manki nd has labour ed for so many years. Great dange r to the future of the race lies in these two tende ncies; the Hierarchy is determined to offset them as far as pos sible, whilst the forces of evil are eagerly trying to foster and nur ture them. They are also dange rs which the intelligent leaders of the race equa lly recogni se. This recogni tion will make them slow in arriving at final decisions , because they will realise the need for a cycle of restoration before final and lasting decisions are made. They will therefore work for a slow er moving forward and for a more careful and even prolonge d inve stigation of the situation and of future pos sibilities than may seem desirable to the impatient. These new and living restorativ e forces are unde r the direction and the cont rol of One Whom we might call (speaking sym bol ically, yet factually) the Spi rit of Resurrection . It is this living spiritual Entity, working tempor arily unde r the direction of the Christ, Who will restore living ness to men's spiritual aims and life to their planni ng; Who will enge nde r anew the vitality needed to implement the trends of the New Age and Who will gui de hum anity out of the dark cave of death, isolation and selfishne ss into the light of the new day. I t is this resurrection life which will be pou red into hum anity at Easter time this year, to som e degree, but which — dur ing the next three Easter periods — can be pour ed in in full measure, if the men and wom en of goodw ill will think clearly, speak forcefully, demand spiritually and implement the inne r plans with intelligence. On a planetary scale, and not just in reference to manki nd, this Spirit of Resurrection is the oppone nt and the antagoni st of the Spirit of Death. Phys ical death takes place o nly when the psychol ogi cal and mental vitality of the indi vidua l, of a nation, or of hum anity drops below a certain level. Hum anity has been respondi ng to the processes of dyi ng dur ing the last 150 years; psychol ogi cally, manki nd has been ruled by selfishn ess, and selfishne ss is the pot ent seed of death — material death, psychol ogi cal death and mental death. This is seen well demons trated in the German nation. Think this statement out , and then recogni se that similar seeds and similar areas of death (though t o a lesser degree) exist in every"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST nation — even in the younge r nations of the world. Hence the war; hence the destruction of all the outer garments of civilisation. But the work of the Ange l of Death, awful as it may seem as it demons trates toda y on a plane tary scale — but beneficent as we know it to be in intent and in purpos e — will give place to that of the Spirit of Resurrection. It is the planni ng of this restoration and this resurrection activity which is now unde r cons ideration by the Hierarchy, having b een hande d ove r to Them because They are closer to man than are Thos e Who func tion in the Counc il Chamber at Shamballa. It must be remembered that this Spirit of Resurrection is a Member of that Counc il and Their chos en Emissary. He (if one may be permitte d to persona lise the impersona l) is in truth the \"Sun of Right eous ness\" Who can now arise \"with healing in His wings \"; Who can carry this life - giving energy which count eracts death, this vision which gives incentive to life, and this hope which can restore all nations . At the Full Moon of March, let the demand go out for the appe arance of this life - giving Spirit. Let it go forth with such intensity that the Hierarchy will be called into active respons e and will immediately release the pot ency of this Spirit into the hearts of men everyw here. All of these spiritual forces, working as they are at this time unde r the direction of the Leader of the Forces of Light , the Christ, are closely related and their activity is most intimately sync hroni sed. In a deeply occult sense, they are all working toge ther , because in the hum an family there are thos e who are at every stage of respons iveness. This triple work of the Hierarchy, therefore, proceeds simultaneous ly — from the standpoi nt of time. The Forces of Re storation are — on a small scale — evoki ng respons e from the members of the New Group of World Servers and from disciples everyw here. As their psychol ogi cal \"morale\" stiffens and their will - to - live and their will - to - good is strengt hened, an immediate effect wi ll be felt on a larger scale; the work of the Spirit of Resurrection will intensify, and is already making its presence felt. More and more peopl e are beginni ng to be forward - looki ng and to hope with greater convi ction and cour age for a better world set - up ; their hitherto wishful thinki ng and their emotiona l desire are slow ly giving place to a more practical attitude; their clear thinki ng and their fixed determination are far more active and their plans better laid because bot h their thinki ng and their plan ning are toda y based on facts; they are also beginning to recogni se thos e factors and condi tions which must not be restored, and this is a poi nt of major impor tance. At the stage which we are now passing through , these respons ive peopl e fall into three ca tegor ies: The visionar y dream er or the well - intentione d but impractical person whos e ideas and world plans and sugge stions as to the new world order litter the desks of world leaders and of thos e groups and organisations who are attempting practically to blueprint the future. Their dreams and ideas deal with projects for which the world of toda y is not ready and will not be ready for several thous and years. It is an easy thing for them to present impos sible Utopi as which have not the faintest relation to t hings which are needed toda y and which coul d be made pos sible. The name of these peopl e is legion, and at this time they cons titute a definite hindr ance. A vision of the impos sible is not the type of vision which will keep the peopl e from perish ing. Because of an inability to com prom ise and to face up to things as they are, these peopl e and thos e whom they influence are lande d in despair and disillusionm ent. The intelligent peopl e of the world who are actuated by the spirit of goodw ill and by th e convi ction that things must be change d. They are often stagge red by the magni tude of the task to be unde rtaken, and this freque ntly leads them to take one of three pos itions :"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST a. They fall into the depths of pessimism. It is a pessimism based on a real a bility to sense the scope of the probl em and to assess the resour ces available. This may land them in non - activity. b. They may leave the settling of the probl em to the trained statesmen, diplom ats and pol iticians, standi ng ready to help when — but onl y wh en — decision has been made. This leads to a shifting of respons ibility. Yet, because the war invol ved the peopl e of all lands and masses of popul ation, so must the recons truction of the world. c. They may assum e respons ibility, ventilate the abuses which must be put right, discuss propos ed plans and, from their particular angl e of vision, set to work to bring about , to the best of their ability, right hum an relations . This attitude of respons ibility and cons eque nt activity may lead to mistakes, but in the aggr egate of the ende avour it will meet the demand for right action in an emergency — this time a world emergency. Thos e par tisan and nat ional ly minde d persons who will attempt to expl oit the world situation for their ow n immediate ends and for the benefiti ng of their particular nation or group . These peopl e, and they are found in every nation, are selfishly motivated; they do not care for hum anity as a whol e and have no liking or interest in anyt hing or anyone but their pol itical party and the re actiona ry interests of som e nationa l group. They see in the present world situation a grand oppor tuni ty to engi neer move s which will benefit an indi vidua l, a class or a nation. In doing this, they freque ntly have a wide grasp of affairs and are keen pol iti cians, but all they know is to be used and so implemented that it attains their narrow ends , no matter at what cost to the rest of the world. These peopl e are usually a large majority. Their attitude leads inevitably to troubl e and hinde rs the work of rest oration; it handi caps thos e who are seeking to establish the entire hum an family in a sounde r way of life than heretofore, and to give a saner and wiser motivation to internationa l relationships. These are the peopl e who are the most to be feared at the co ming conf erence at San Francisco. The isolationi sts in all nations , particularly in the United States, French nationa l idealism, and the obsession of certain factors in the Polish race ove r bounda ries will need watching, as these attitude s can be expl oited by the evil and selfish interests which (behind the scenes) are seeking to prevent the world attaining that equi librium which will permit tranqui llity. These three groups , how ever, indicate the successful ope ration of the Forces of Restoration. These are tentatively beginni ng their work and preparing the way for a much fuller expr ession of the intentions of the Spirit of Resurrection, after the com ing Full Moon of March and in the three years which lie ahead. The Forces of Enlight enm ent A realisation of the need of hum anity, and a careful appr aisal of that which must be done to meet that need, have awakened the men of goodw ill to respons iveness to the Forces of Restoration; this has led to an insistent demand that the second pha se of the hierarchial work be set in motion. This pha se is directed tow ards thos e activities and the developm ent of that invoc ative spirit which will bring the Forces of Enlight enm ent into cont act with hum anity and lead to activity on their part. These forces can func tion fully and unt il 1949 hol d sway ove r the minds of men, if the peopl e of the world can be organised to stand with massed intent behind that type of statesmanship which is seeking the greatest good of the greatest num ber, which sees the world as one great i nterdepende nt whol e, and which refuses to be sidetracked by the clamour ing of the selfish little minds or by the demands of the reactiona ry forces to be found in all lands ."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST These Forces of Enlight enm ent are always present on Earth on a small scale, influe ncing the minds of the New Group of World Servers, the selfless workers for humanity, and the thinke rs in every school of thought , working in every field of hum an betterment; they work upon and through all who truly love their fellow men. They are una ble to influence the minds of the closed egoc entric person; they can do little with the separative isolationi st; they are ineffectual where the theologi an of all groups — pol itical, religious or social — is conc erned, and they can do little with the type of mind tha t is conc entrated upo n persona l or group probl ems ( their group , expr essing their ideas and working their way) and who fail to see themselves or the group in relation to the whol e of hum anity.

His message can be paraphr ased in the follow ing words: Cease to identify your selves with material things ; gain a proper sense of the spiritual values ; cease regarding pos sessions and earthly existence as of major impor tance; follow the Nobl e Eight - fold Path which is the path of right relations — right relations to God and to each other — and thus be happy. The steps on this Path are: Right Values Right Aspiration Right Speech Right Conduc t Right Mode of Living Right Effort Right Thinki ng Right Rapture or true Happi ness His ancient message is as new toda y as it was when He spoke His words on earth; a recogni tion of its truth and value is desperately needed, and the following of the \"eight right ways of living\" will enable hum anity to find liberation. It is on the founda tion of His teaching that the Christ raised the supe rstructure of the brotherhood of man to form an expr ession of the Love of God. To day, as it views the crum bling, devastated world, manki nd has a fresh oppor tuni ty to reject selfish, materialistic motives and phi losophy and to begin thos e processes which will — steadily and gradua lly — bring about its liberation. It will then be pos sible fo r men to tread the Light ed Way which leads back to the divine Sour ce of light and love . The Buddha coul d poi nt to the goa l and indi cate the Way because He had achieved full enlight enm ent; the Christ gave us an exam ple of One Who has reached the same goa l; the Buddha left the world after reaching illum ination; the Christ returned to us, proclaiming Himself as the Light of the World, and show ed us how we too coul d learn to tread the Lighted Way. The Buddha , Whos e Festival is held ever at the Full Moon of May (or of Taur us , falling this year"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST dur ing the last week in April), acts toda y as the agent of that great Life in Whom we live and move and have our being, Who is Himself the true Light of the World and the planetary Enlight ener. I refer to the A ncient of Days (as He is called in the Old Testam ent ), to the God of Love , to Sanat Kum ara, the Eternal Yout h, the One Who hol ds all men in life and Who is carrying His whol e creation along the path of evol ution to its cons um mation — a cons um mation of which we have not as yet the faintest idea. Year after year, ever since the Buddha achieved His goa l of illum ination, an effort has been made to increase the flow of enlight enm ent into the world and to throw the light of wisdom , expe rience and unde rstandi ng (as it is called) into the minds of men. At each Full Moon of May this has been the effort of the spiritual Forces which are working out the Will of God. A supr eme effort will be made by Them this year, during the five days of the Full Moon (April 25 - 30), and a major test of the effectiveness of Their activity will be given at the San Francisco Conf erence. This I woul d ask you to remember, and for this I beg you to mobi lise. A great Triangl e of Force will be called into play during thos e five days as the nuc le us through which the Forces of Enlight enm ent will work. The three Lives cont rolling the energy which it is hope d can be released for the illum ining of men's minds are: 1. The Lord of the World, the Light of Life Itself. 2. The Buddha , the Lord of Wisdom , bringi ng spiritual light to the Hierarchy and revealing what is the divine pur pos e. 3. The Christ, the Lord of Love , presenting the demand of hum anity and acting as the distribut ing Agent for the Forces of Enlight enm ent. The Forces of Light, upon the ph ysical plane, have driven the forces of evil and of darkne ss backw ard, and are bringi ng the war to an end through the defeat of the Axis Nations . But anot her great \"division\" of thos e Forces (if I may sym bol ically use a military term) is being mobi lised and can be brough t into active service at the Full Moon of May (Taur us) if the demand is strong enough, is mentally pow erful and adequa tely focussed. These Forces work entirely upon the level of the mind and with the minds of men; it is their tas k to bring the battle between the Forces of Light and the Forces of Darkne ss to an end — not only phys ically, but through the inaugur ation of an era of right thinki ng. This will end the present cycle of emotiona l distress, of agony, of glamour and illusion, and of materialistic desires which toda y form the pattern of men's lives. This has to be done by means of the spiritual will, working as enlight enm ent upon the mental plane and demons trating as wisdom , and as skill in action, motivated by lovi ng unde rstand ing. These three aspects of light — mental enlight enm ent, the illum ination which wisdom confers, and loving unde rstandi ng — all find their perfect expr ession in the Lord of the World (Whom the orthodox call God) and in His reflections , the Buddha and the Chris t — the One Who brought Illum ination to the world and the Other Who demons trated the actuality of the Love of God. These three great expressions of divinity (One so divine that we can onl y know Him through His representatives) can be called into a new and mo st pot ent activity through right invoc ation at the time of the Full Moon of May. Thos e who can carry out this great act of invoc ation are the spiritually minde d peopl e everyw here, the enlight ened statesmen, the religious leaders, and the men and wom en of g oodw ill, if they can stand with massed intent, particularly throughout the entire mont h of April. Their assistance can also be invoke d by the dire need of men, wom en and children everyw here who can voi ce no cry, for they know not where to turn, but whos e a ppe al is heard and not ed."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Their work, how ever, must be focussed through and implemented by the world intelligentsia, by leading \"love rs of hum anity,\" working in the various organisations and groups dedicated to hum an betterment, and by representative uns elfish peopl e. It is they who must receive the inflow of \"light ed wisdom \" and of lovi ng unde rstandi ng; toda y this can be made pos sible in a manne r never know n before. The success of the effort now being spiritually planne d is depende nt upon the a bility of manki nd to use the light they already have, in order to establish right relations in their families, in their com muni ties, in their nation and in the world. This matter of being in a pos ition to receive, and then be the agents of, enlight enm ent is an intensely practical matter. It is hope d that the respons e will be so real that it will cons titute a great and uni form activity which will leave no singl e thinking person unt ouc hed, which will put the respons ibility of establishing right hum an relatio ns upon the shoul ders of the men and wom en of goodw ill, and not on the shoul ders of the unt hinki ng, unde velope d and suffering masses. This is a major poi nt to bear in mind. If the thinki ng and executive peopl e of the world can have their minds \"illum ined\" by the spirit of wisdom and unde rstandi ng, they can act as distribut ors of that light through enlight ened planni ng and legislation, and thus affect the entire world. This is the immediate oppo rtuni ty ahead, and when I say \"immediate\" I refer to the com ing five days of the Wesak Festival. This shoul d have a pronounc ed effect upon the San Francisco Conf erence. I also refer to the next five years, with their five Wesak Festivals on five May Full Moons . This year will mark a climaxing effort in the long relati on of the Buddha to hum anity. Year by year, since He left the earth, He has com e back to humanity, bringi ng light and blessing. Year by year, He has released this light and has presented oppor tuni ty to the Forces of Enlight enm ent to strengt hen Their hol d u pon the minds of men. The success of Their effort has been so great that it has led to the crescendo of know ledge , to the glory of mode rn science and to the widespread educ ation which has distingui shed the past five hundr ed years. Know ledge is the hallmark of our civilisation; it has often been know ledge misappl ied and dedicated to the selfishne ss of men, but it has been an impersona l thing persona lly appl ied; this must end. Now anot her pha se of that light can begin to demons trate as the result o f the past, and that is Wisdom . Wisdom is the enlight ened appl ication of know ledge , through love , to the affairs of men. It is unde rstandi ng, pou ring out everyw here as the result of expe rience. I call you , therefore, everyone , to a great service of demand and of invoc ation on behalf of hum anity — a demand for the inflow of light upon the decisions of men. I woul d ask you to reque st and expe ct the needed enlight enm ent for thos e who have to make decision on behalf of men everyw here. Your indi vidua l enlight enm e nt has not hing to do with this demand. It is a selfless motive which is requi red and which must lie behind your indi vidua l and group demand. You are demandi ng enlight enm ent and illum ined perception for thos e who have to gui de the destiny of races, nations and world groups . On their shoul ders lies the respons ibility to take wise action, based on world unde rstandi ng, in the interests of internationa l coope ration, and in the establishm ent of right hum an relations . Throughout the mont h of April, unt il May firs t, the realisation of this is a major dut y. To the suppor t of the Forces of Enlight enm ent I call all toda y. As individua ls, you must work for an ope n and receptive mind, free from prejudi ce or nationa l bias; as indi vidua ls, you need to think in broader ter ms and of the one world and the one hum anity. The mass of right - thinki ng and convi nced demand which you , who seek to serve the Christ, can throw behind the men legislating for the world, can bring great results and can release the Forces of Enlight enm ent i n a new and pot ent manne r. "},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Conc entration upon the work to be done is of such impor tance and will call for such practical activities that I will write no more at this time. I desire to keep the immediate issue clear. We will deal later with the Forces of R econs truction . I woul d like to close this message with som e words which I wrote many years ago. They expr ess the needed attitude and orientation: \"I ask you to drop you r antagoni sms and your antipathies, your hatreds and your racial differences, and attempt to think in terms of the one family, the one Life and the one hum anity.\" AN EASTER MESSAGE Easter Day 1945 On this day, we recall to our minds the fact of Resurrection — a uni versal and eternally recurring resurrection. I woul d like to tal k with you anent the Christ, about His work as head of the Hierarchy, and about the rebui lding which hum anity must und ertake and which the Hierarchy is seeking to impul se at this time. A great period of recons truction is planne d. Here are the two words aro und which I wish to create my theme: Resurrection and Recons truction . It will be a recons truction implemented by Thos e Who know the meaning of resurrection, and it will invol ve a resurrection of hum anity through the medium of its intelligentsia and men and wom en of goodw ill. These two groups (the Hierarchy and Hum anity) will need to be brought into a closer rappor t, and this is entirely pos sible if the follow ers of the Christ realise their oppor tuni ty and shoul der their respons ibilities. I woul d point out t hat when I use the phr ase \"follow ers of the Christ\" I refer to all those who love their fellow men, irrespective of creed or religion. Only upon this basic premise can a hop eful future be founde d. I do not care whether or not thos e who read my words accept the occult teaching of a spiritual and planetary Hierarchy ove r which the Christ presides, or whether they think in terms of Christ and His disciples. The essential recogni tion for which I plead is that this great group of spiritual Indi vidua ls, Who recei ve so general a recogni tion throughout the world and in all the great religions , shoul d be regarded as active . The Christian view of the Christ is bui lt upon that which He enacted for us two thous and years ago and through which He sym bol ically i ndi cated to us the way which all aspirants must go. It portrays a picture of a waiting, qui escent Christ, living in som e vague and far away heaven, \"resting on His laurels\" and practically doi ng not hing very much unt il such time as the sons of men of every race and creed acclaim Him as Saviour ; this they must do bot h as indi vidua ls and as representing the organised Christian Chur ch. It is a picture of a listening, obs erving Christ, animated by pity and com passion, but Who has done all He coul d and now waits for us to do our part; it is also a picture of One Who waits to see what hum anity, as a whol e, will accept theologi cally. In the mind of the narrow, funda mentalist theologi an, Christ is seen as presiding ove r a peaceful place called Heaven, into which the elect are welcom ed; He is also seen as cons igni ng all who remain aware of their ow n spiritual integrity and respons ibility, who refuse to be gathered into organised chur ches or who go idly or wickedly through life, to som e vague place of eternal puni shm en t. To this vast multitude (proba bly the majority) His love and com passion appa rently do not reach, and His heart remains unt ouc hed. It appe ars that He cares not whether they suffer eternally or attain com plete anni hilation. This surely cannot be so. None of these pictures is accurate or adequa te; they are not true in any sense of the word. This is being realised by the more intelligent of the world thinke rs, and from the time of"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST this Full Moon of June ( Gemini , celebrated this year the last week of May) a d ifferent message must be sent out by the chur ches of Christendom , if they are to meet the need of manki nd and so aid in the work of recons truction which lies ahead. They cannot stop this work, but the chur ches coul d be ignor ed if an inability to think with clarity is show n and if they are not freed from theologi cal narrow ness. Resurrection is the keynot e of nature; death is not . Death is onl y the ante - chamber of resurrection. Resurrection is the clue to the world of meaning, and is the funda mental theme of all the world religions — past, present and the future. Resurrection of the spirit in man, in all forms, in all kingdom s, is the obj ective of the entire evol utiona ry process and this invol ves liberation from materialism and selfishne ss. In that r esurrection, evol ution and death are onl y preparatory and familiar stages. The not e and message sounde d by the Christ when last on Earth was resurrection, but so morbid has been manki nd and so enve lope d in glamour and illusion, that His death has been perm itted to sidestep unde rstandi ng; cons eque ntly, for centuries, the empha sis has been laid upon death, and onl y on Easter Day or in the cemeteries is the resurrection acclaimed. This must change . It is not helpful to a progr essive unde rstandi ng of the eterna l verities to have this condi tion perpetuated. The Hierarchy is toda y dedicated to bringi ng about this change and thus altering the appr oach of manki nd to the world of the uns een and to the spiritual realities. Before, how ever, They coul d do anyt hing, our present civilisation had to die. During the com ing century, the meaning of the resurrection will be unfolded and the new age will reveal its true signi ficance. The first step will be the emergence of hum anity from the death of its civilisation, of its old ideas and mode s of living, the relinqui shing of its materialistic goa ls and its damning selfishne ss, and its movi ng into the clear light of the resurrection life. I am not here speaking in sym bol ical or mystical terms. I am dealing with facts — facts as rea l and as imminent as the com ing Cycle of Conf erences, and facts for which the past two hun dred years have prepared humanity. This preparation has culminated in the restlessness of the twentieth century and has led to the horror of this world war, 1914 - 1945 through which we have been passing. The true work of The Cycle of Conf erences about which I wrote earlier will only be inaugur ated at San Francisco. There the stage will be set for thos e processes which will usher in an era of relative tranqui llity; thus the door of the dark cave of materialism will be ope ned and the stone rolled from the door of the sepul chre which has too long entom bed manki nd. Then will follow thos e steps which will lead to a new and better life and which will indi cate the e xpr ession of the spirit of resurrection. These facts (so near to manifestation) are phys ical facts; they will demons trate as such if the disciples of the world recogni se what it is that the Christ desires, and if the men and wom en of goodw ill implement the ir respons e to His wishes. Speaking sym bol ically, the first step after the adve nt of the spirit of the resurrection will be similar to that in the Biblical story. Mary, that wom an of sorrow , of expe rience and of aspiration, stands (as ever in the sym bol is m of the world) as the sym bol of materialism. Hum anity must say with her, \"They have taken away my Lord and I know not where they have laid Him.\" But — she said it to the Lord Himself, not recogni sing Him and realising onl y her ow n deep need and despair. So must it be again. Hum anity — materialistic, suffering, facing the future with despair and agony, but still aspiring — must go forth from the cave of matter, seeking the Christ and at first not recogni sing Him or the work that He is attempting to do. The church es — materialistic, hide - bound and subm erged in their theologi cal conc epts, seeking pol itical pow er or pos sessions , empha sising stone bui ldings and cathedrals whilst neglecting \"the Temple of God, not made with hands, eternal in the heavens\" — are occupi ed wit h the sym bol s and not with the reality. Now they must learn to recogni se that the Lord is not with them and"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST they too must go forth, as Mary did, and seek Him anew. If they will do so, they will surely find Him and again becom e His messenge rs. The fact of the resurrection will be demons trated during the next few centuries, and the Living Christ will walk among men and lead them onw ard tow ards the Mount of Ascension. The Pentecost will becom e truth. All men will com e unde r the tide of inspiration from on hig h, and though they may speak with many tongue s, they will all unde rstand each other. What I have to say to you , I intend to divide into two parts: The Work of the Christ Toda y The Com ing Work of Recons truction These two conve y the same basic ideas and thus complement each other. They proclaim the fact that all that truly conc erns us is that which takes place upon Earth in line with the \"blueprints\" which gui de the work of the Christ. (When I use the phrase \"conc erns us\" I refer to man's phys ic al, emotiona l and mental reactions .) They proclaim the fact that every state of cons cious ness is anchor ed within hum anity and that all are factual here and now , did men but know it. They proclaim also the truth that Christ has never left us for a distant h eaven of nebul ous out lines, but that He is ever within our reach. They proclaim also the fact that His interest, His arduou s labour s on our behalf and the activities of His working disciples, the Masters of the Wisdom and the Lords of Com passion, are with us, here and now. They proclaim that we are not alone , but that the Forces of Light and of Enlight enm ent are cons tantly working; that the strengt h and the wisdom of Thos e who know are being mobi lised to aid manki nd, and that not hing can now arrest or preve nt the cont act between that intelligent aspiring centre, called hum anity, and the inne r spiritual group, the Hierarchy. The Work of the Christ Today Forget not one important poi nt. The Hierarchy itself is the result of hum an activity and aspiration; it has been created by hum anity. Its members are hum an beings who have lived, suffered, achieved, failed, attained success, endur ed death and passed throug h the expe rience of resurrection. They are the same in nature as are thos e who struggl e toda y with the p rocesses of disintegration but who — nevertheless — have in them the seed of resurrection. All states of cons cious ness are know n to Them and They have mastered all of them; They have mastered them as men, thus gua ranteeing to hum anity the same ultimate achieve ment. We are apt to look upon the members of the Hierarchy as different radically from hum anity, forgetting that the Hierarchy is a com muni ty of successful men, Who earlier subm itted Themselves to the pur ificatory fires of daily living, working out their ow n salvation as men and wom en of affairs, as bus iness men, as hus bands and wives, farmers and rulers and that they know life, therefore, in all its pha ses and gradation. They have surmount ed the expe riences of life; Their great Master is the Chr ist; They have passed through the initiations of the new birth, the baptism, the transfigur ation, the final crucifixion and the resurrection. But they still are men and differ from the Christ onl y in the fact that He, the first of our hum anity to attain di vinity, the Eldest in a great family of brothers (as St. Paul expr esses it), the Master of the Masters and the Teacher of ange ls and of men was deemed so pur e, so hol y and so enlight ened that He was permitted to embody for us the great cosmic principle of love ; He thus revealed to us, for the first time, the nature of the heart of God. These perfected men, therefore, exist; They are more than men because the divine spirit in them"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST registers all stages of cons cious ness and awareness — subhum an, hum an and supe r hum an. This inclusive developm ent enables them to work with men, to cont act hum anity at need, and to know how to lead us forward to the pha ses of resurrection. There is no need for me to enlarge at this poi nt upo n the world that They are attempting to aid and to salvage. The state of hum anity toda y is know n to all truly thinki ng peopl e. Devastation, crucifixion, slaught er and death are widespread; sorrow , pain, disillusionm ent and pessimism are condi tioni ng the thinki ng and the reactions of millions , whils t the plight of the unt hinki ng but helpless masses has reached an inconc eivable height of misery. The ignor ance, lack of unde rstandi ng, and selfishne ss of men everyw here, particularly in the count ries which have escaped the ravages of war, aggr avate the si tuation. Nevertheless with serenity and conf idence, the Hierarchy toda y faces its arduous task. One aspect of Their work and attitude I woul d like to touc h upon, for it is apt to cause misunde rstandi ng among thos e with narrow vision and (if I m ay describe them) with cons tricted, though lovi ng, hearts. I refer to the attitude taken by the Hierarchy dur ing the past years of war. This attitude has caused som e to find in it cause for criticism. Let me be expl icit and also bring in the time equa tion. I can well do so, because it was through my writings that the pos ition of the Hierarchy was affirmed and publ icly stated. In 1932, I wrote a series of pamphl ets which were intende d to mobi lise the disciples of the world und er the name of the New Group of World Servers and to arous e the men and wom en of goodw ill in a final effort to awaken hum anity to the need for change . I ende avour ed to institute a worldw ide hous e cleaning and to incite men to take the steps which were needed to avert war — a war which the Hierarchy saw com ing closer, day by day. In a way unr ealised and undr eamt of by the average man, the Forces of Evil were in a most pot ent manne r emerging from their ancient lair; they were intent upon seeking thos e whom they coul d moul d and obs ess, and th us hur ry manki nd tow ards disaster. They found minds respons ive to their evil prom ptings in every count ry; they found also that it was pos sible to take pos session of two count ries, Japan and Germany and — to a very much less extent — of Italy. The Hierarchy, f oreseeing this, attempted to offset their efforts. They made appe al to the spiritually minde d peopl e of the world; Their appe al reached millions and culminated in May, 1936 , in a planetary effort wherein the Great Invoc ation was used upon a large scale in most of the count ries of the world. For anot her three years Their labour of love cont inued; They struggl ed to save hum anity and to arous e men to their imminent peril; They ende avour ed to arrest the selfishne ss of hum anity and to produc e a new and fresh ori entation to the spiritual values, and thus avert war. They failed. The men and wom en of goodw ill and the spiritually minde d peopl e coul d not appr eciate the true nature of the impendi ng dange r. Som e recogni sed it and did their utmost; a few worked hard, tru sting to the wisdom of thos e who kne w and asked their aid; most of them were disturbed and worried, but none of them appr eciated prope rly the doubl e dange r with which hum anity was faced: the dange r arising out of hum an selfishne ss and greed, plu s the dange r which was nearing the Earth through the agency of the com bined forces of evil. These forces were organised by beings of most evil and expe rt expe rience and were preparing to obs ess and ultimately pos sess the negative German peopl e, ruled by a group of men of such pos itive selfishne ss and aggr essive materialistic spirit that they coul d easily becom e the agents of the subj ective evil forces. In September, 1939 , supr eme wickedne ss broke loose upon earth. Because the Hierarchy coul d not and woul d not infringe upon hum an free will, the evil which hum anity itself had enge nde red manifested itself, and that to which certain nations and certain indi vidua ls had responde d appe ared, and thus World"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST War II started. Rampant evil took pos session of the earth t hrough the medium of the Axis nations . The Germans marched into Poland. This count ry was the recipient of the first impact because of her nationa l selfishne ss, her suppr ession of the low er classes, her exaltation of a Fascist - minde d aristocracy and her hat red of the Jews. The United Nations then began slow ly to organise unde r the impression of the Forces of Light . The war was on. What, unde r these circum stances was the Hierarchy to do? Full oppo rtuni ty had been given to hum anity to arrest the descent of ev il into manifestation. Voices of leaders and hum anitarians everyw here were proclaiming the need for reform. On which side shoul d the Hierarchy throw its weight and its influence? Shoul d it take sides at all, or shoul d it be neutral? Shoul d it remain aloof and take the pos ition of the onl ooke r, the obs erver? Shoul d it stand supe rior to the deeds of manki nd and await the decision of the battle to be fought ? Shoul d it conf orm to the sentimental ideas of the chur ch - trained publ ic and talk \"Peace, peace\" when th ere was no peace, and present a negative aspect of love - to - all - peopl es whilst hatred strode rampant ove r the earth? It must be remembered that if this war had resembled other wars dow n the centuries, and had simply been a fight between hum an gr oups and nations , the Hierarchy woul d have remained out side the conf lict and left manki nd to fight a conc lusive victory on the merits of its fight ing uni ts. But this time a great deal more was invol ved and this the Hierarchy kne w. This war has not onl y bee n an aggr essive conf lict between nations or of hate between the expone nts of differing ideologies but som ething far more serious . The Hierarchy kne w that extremely pow erful forces were taking adva ntage of hum an stupi dity to intrude into world affairs, and that pot ent groups of evil beings were organised to expl oit the existing world situation. They kne w also that the com bination of ancient evil with men's selfishne ss woul d inevitably prove too strong for even the United Nations , if they were left una ssisted to meet the Axis Pow ers and the Lords of Evil emerging from their hiding place. So the Hierarchy took its stand upon the side of the United Nations and let it be know n that it had done so. In doi ng this, definite phys ical steps were taken to aid the Force s of Light; men and leaders were carefully chos en and picked disciples were placed in pos itions of pow er and of author ity. The leaders of the United Nations and of their armies are not Godl ess men, as are the leaders of the Axis Pow ers; they are men of rec titude and of spiritual and hum anitarian pur pos e and are able thus to work — cons cious ly or unc ons cious ly — unde r the inspiration of the Hierarchy. This has been amply demons trated. On account of this decision of the Hierarchy, Christ became autom atically the Leader of these Forces. His work has been greatly hinde red by the sweet sentimentality of the unt hinki ng Christian and by the well - meaning, but oft uni ntelligent, pacifist. Both these groups woul d sacrifice the future of hum anity to tempor ary methods of \"b eing nice\" or \"being kind\" or taking gentle measures. The forces of evil, stalking the world toda y, do not unde rstand such measures. The cry of such peopl e that \"God love s all men\" is true — eternally and forever true. It is one of the una lterable facts of existence itself. God love s — without distinction and irrespective of race or creed. To that Great Life naught matters but hum anity and its perfecting, because upon hum anity depends the salvation of all the kingdom s in nature. But this statement (m ade in time and space and as it conc erns the form aspect and not the spirit in man) is freque ntly misleading, and the simple - minde d are apt to forget that the Christ said, \"He that is not with me is against me.\" Men fail also to realise the pot ency of the though t wielded by Thos e who work unde r and with the Christ. Thought is pur e divine energy, impersona l and — like the sun — it pour s dow n upon the worthy and the unw orthy, unl ess definitely and deliberately directed. The Hierarchy was therefore faced with the probl em and the necessity of seeing that pure impersona l thought energy did not find its way into the ranks of thos e fight ing hum an freedom s, for it stimulates the minds and the mental processes of the"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST good and the bad alike. This dange r They deliberately offset by directing Their thought to the forces fight ing unde r the leaders of the United Nations and by ope nly taking Their stand upon the side of right hum an relations . They did not dare to do otherwise, for — in their place and given circum stances — the lea ders of the forces of evil have prove d themselves cleverer and more calculating than thos e fight ing for hum an freedom . It is this distinction and its necessity that som e kindl y and well - intentione d but ignor ant Christian thinke rs often ove rlook. The work of Christ in relation to the war has also been handi cappe d by the com mercially minde d in all nations , particularly in the neutral count ries, who have profited by the war, as well as by \"big bus iness\" interests in many lands . These are focussed at this time through certain moni ed groups in every pow erful nation, particularly in the United States. He has been hinde red also by thos e indi vidua ls who seek to expl oit the plight of suffering hum anity to their ow n financial adva ntage. Therefore, when th e war broke out and hum anity chos e to fight and the forces of evil were let loos e upon our planet, the Hierarchy ceased its efforts to bring peace through goodw ill and ope nly sided with thos e fight ing to drive evil back whence it came, and to defeat the Ax is nations . Because of this decision on Their part, unt hinki ng peopl e claim that the statements of thos e who represent the Hierarchy on earth have been cont radictory and that the actions of the Hierarchy have not been com patible with their preconc eived ide as of how love shoul d be demons trated. For the past five years, therefore, the efforts of the Christ and of His followers, the Masters of the Wisdom , have been directed tow ards clarifying the true issues in the minds of men, tow ards indi cating the lines al ong which right action shoul d be taken, and tow ards uni fying inter - allied pol icies. They have been occupi ed with bandi ng toge ther the men of goodw ill throughout the world in preparation for the Cycle of Conf erences and the com ing world readjustments. They have sought to protect the sufferers, organising methods of relief, gui ding the minds of army leaders, and arousing publ ic opi nion to take thos e steps which will eventually lead to right hum an relations . Tempor arily, the German peopl e and the Japanese have been left to their fate and to the tende r mercies of the armies of evil; the present debacle in Germany is a testimony as to what evil can bring upon thos e who follow it. With all these mode s of strengt hening the Forces of Light and of extricating hum anit y from the descende d evil, the Hierarchy has also been occupi ed with lines of activity which may not be disclosed, because they conc ern the handl ing of the subj ective forces of evil. The pot ency of these forces will be realised if the lengt h of time which the war has lasted is cons idered and also the fact that two nations have been able to withstand — unt il the past few mont hs — an entire world of nations uni ted against them. This is a phe nom enal fact in itself and a witness to the strengt h of the e vil group — obj ective and subj ective — which has sought to gain dom inance over manki nd. Had the Hierarchy not taken sides with the United Nations and throw n the pow er of its thought into the battle, victory might still be a long way off. Toda y it is well - nigh in our hands . As I said elsewhere, it is a fallacy to believe, as som e do, that the main trend of Christ's work is through the medium of the churches or the world religions . He necessarily works through them when condi tions permit and there is a living nu cleus of true spirituality within them, or when their invoc ative appe al is pot ent enough to reach Him. He uses all pos sible channe ls whereby the cons cious ness of man may be enlarged and right orientation may be brought about. It is, how ever, truer to say t hat it is as World Teacher that He cons istently works, and that the churches are but one of the teaching avenue s He employs . All that enlight ens the minds of men, all propa ganda that tends to bring about right hum an relations , all mode s of acqui ring real k now ledge , all methods of transmuting know ledge into wisdom and unde rstandi ng, all that expa nds the cons cious ness of hum anity and of all subhum an states of"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST awareness and sensitivity, all that dispels glamour and illusion and that disrupt s crystallisation an d disturbs all static condi tions , com e unde r the realistic activities of the department within the Hierarchy which He supe rvises. He is limited by the qua lity and the calibre of the invoc ative appe al of hum anity and that, in its turn, is condi tione d by the poi nt in evol ution attained. In the Middl e Ages of history, and earlier, it was the chur ches and the school s of phi losophy which provi ded the major avenue s for His activity, but it is not so toda y; this is a poi nt which the chur ches and organised religio n woul d do well to remember. There is now a shift of His empha sis and attention into two new fields of ende avour : first, into the field of world - wide educ ation, and secondl y, into the sphe re of implementing intelligently thos e activities which com e unde r t he department of gove rnm ent in its three aspects of statesmanship, pol itics and legislature. The com mon peopl e are toda y awakening to the importance and respons ibility of gove rnm ent; it is therefore realised by the Hierarchy that before the cycl e of true democracy (as it essentially exists and will eventually demons trate) can com e into being, the educ ation of the masses in coope rative statesmanship, in econom ic stabilisation through right sharing, and in clean, pol itical interplay is imperatively necessary. The long divor ce between religion and pol itics must be ende d, and this can now com e about because of the high level of the hum an mass intelligence and the fact that science has made all men so close that what happe ns in som e remote area of the earth's surface is a matter of general interest within a few minut es. Time and space are now negated. The Com ing Work of Recons truction I have referred to the com ing Full Moon of June as \"Christ's Unique Occasion. \" ( The Reappe aranc e of the Christ, Chapt er II.) Just what is entailed in that statement I am not empow ered to say, but I can cast som e light upon one pha se of it. It has long been a legend (and who shall say it is not a fact?) that at each Full Moon of June , Christ repeats and preaches again to the assembled world (to the hearts and minds of men) the last sermon of the Buddha , thus linki ng the full enlight enm ent of the pre - Christian era and the wisdom of the Buddha to the cycle of the distribut ion of the energy of love , for which Christ is respon sible. This year the message of the past and of the present will be augm ented, enha nced and suppl emented by the enunc iating of the new not e, word or theme which will distingui sh the New Age and characterise the com ing civilisation and culture. It will cli max all the past and lay the seeds for the future. The signi ficance of this statement lies in the fact that telepathically and with the entire force of the Hierarchy behind Him, plus the pot ency of Thos e to Whom is com mitted the expr ession of the Will of G od (later to be implemented by the Hierarchy under the direction of the Christ), the World Teacher will, in His Own right , make certain statements and use certain word - formulas which will create the nuc leus of the thought form and present the blu eprint around which and upon which the New Age will be develope d. For this mom ent the thinki ng and the planni ng of the enlight ened aspirants of the world have made — cons cious ly, but mostly unc ons cious ly — long preparation. They have, through their efforts, pr ovi ded the mass of thought subs tance which the com ing pronounc ement will affect. Christ will bring this into prope r form for the creative activity of the New Group of World Servers working in every nation and in every religious , social, econom ic and pol iti cal group. Christ's pronounc ement will be embodi ed in certain Stanzas, of which thos e already given are a small part. Only He can use these Words of Pow er in their prope r manne r, connot ation and empha sis; onl y an inadequa te paraphr ase of certain sentences found in that pronounc ement can be given to hum anity, and"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST this paraphr ase can be used onl y when the war is over and not before. This means that they can be employe d onl y when bot h Germany and Japan are unde r the com plete cont rol of the United Nations , thr ough whom the Hierarchy has been working. This will not imply the attainm ent of com plete peace, but it will mean the end of all aggressive fight ing and all organised resistance, leading to a period of relative tranqui llity. Standi ng in His Own place at a central poi nt in Asia, remote from the throngs and the impact of hum anity, Christ will bless the world at the exact mom ent of the Full Moon of June . He will then repeat the Buddha 's last words or sermon, as well as the Beatitude s which He uttered when on e arth and which have been so inadequa tely and misleadingl y translated — a translation based upon the memory of what He said but not upon direct dictation. To these two messages, the Christ will add a new one , imbue d with pow er for the future. That part of wha t He says in which it is pos sible for men to participate will be used for years to com e in the place of the two Stanzas of the Great Invoc ation which have been used for nine years. Behind the Christ, focussing with intensity toda y and preparing for a great act of spiritual coope ration at the time of the June Full Moon, stands the Hierarchy. Toge ther with Him, They will invoke a group of spiritual Forces which (for lack of a better name) we will call the Forces of Recons truction . I woul d ask you to have clearly in your minds the three groups of spiritual energies which — at the time of the three Full Moons of April, May and June — will be released into activity and which will aid hum anity in its major task of rebui lding the new and better world: The Forces of Restoration . These will work to restore morale and psychol ogi cal health, thus implementing the resurrection of hum anity from the death cycle through which it has been passing. The restoration of men's mental condi tion to a whol esom e and happi er approach to life is the primary obj ective. These forces will bring about the emergence of the new civilisation — which is definitely man's creative work. The Forces of Enlight enm ent . These, when let loos e upon Earth, will produc e a clear grasp of the Plan w hich the Hierarchy desires to see work out , a revelation of the issues invol ved in their right and pos sible seque nce; and they will also give a sense of propo rtion to hum an thinki ng, plus an appr eciation of the spiritual values which shoul d determine the o bjective pol icies. These Forces will salvage the cultural gains of the past (a past which is dead and gone and of which little shoul d again be restored) and will implement (upon the few founda tiona l cultures of the past) that new and better culture which w ill be distinctive of the New Age. The Forces of Recons truction . These will usher in an era of pronounc ed creative activity and will bring about the rebui lding of the tangi ble world upon the new lines. This the total destruction of the old forms will nece ssitate. It is this great group of Forces which will be set in motion by the Christ at the June Full Moon; the focus of Their work will definitely be upon the phys ical plane. Their task is to precipitate and bring into manifestation that which t he work of the Forces of Restoration and of Enlight enm ent have made subj ectively pos sible. These Forces might be regarded as embodyi ng and making declarative the \"new materialism.\" This is a statement warranting our closest cons ideration. It is essential that we bear in mind, as we face the activities of the future process of rebui lding, that matter and subs tance and their fusion into living forms are aspects of divinity; it has been the prostitution of matter to selfish ends and for separative"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST pur pos es wh ich has been respons ible for the misery, the suffering, the failure and the evil which have characterised the career of manki nd dow n the ages and which precipitated this world war. Toda y hum anity is being given a fresh oppor tuni ty to bui ld again on sounde r and more cons tructive lines that better civilisation which is the dream of thos e who love their fellow men, and to attain a new aptitude in handl ing subs tance. If men can demons trate a gained wisdom in the creation of a form which will hous e the spirit of resurrection and expr ess the enlight enm ent gained by the bitter expe rience of the past, then hum anity will rise again. The uni que oppo rtuni ty which conf ront s the Christ as His great hour draws near is that of uni fying, synt hesising and integrating all the se forces into one great and pot ent dow npour ing of spiritual energy. These energies invol ve the activities of the Spirit of Resurrection, the inspiration of the Buddha as He this year conve ys the strengt h of the One in Whom we live and move and have our be ing, and that which the Christ Himself will set in motion in respons e to the invoc ative appe al of the New Group of World Servers, the men of goodw ill and the \"massed intent\" of the inarticulate masses. It is essential that we try to grasp the uni ty of this hierarchical effort. The energy which will lead to the restoration of human aspiration, right idealism and fixed hum anitarian intention is that distributed by the Forces of Restoration which were set in motion this year, at the time of the Eas ter Full Moon, unde r the direction of the Masters of the Wisdom and the supe rvision of the Christ. They will conc ern themselves with the reorientation of the hum an psyche and with the inevitable cons eque nces of that reorientation — the acqui ring of the visio n which will bring about right hum an relations . This will be largely done by the spiritual peopl e in the world, by aspirants, working disciples and (where pos sible) through the spiritually minde d peopl e in the chur ches and hum anitarian and esoteric groups . The energy which will lead to intelligent activity and to correct mental planni ng I have called that of the Forces of Enlight enm ent; onc e these have been released, it becom es the respons ibility of the New Group of World Servers to direct them. Then throu gh the enlight ened plans of the world intelligentsia and prom inent hum anitarians and racial servers, it will be pos sible to establish thos e spiritual principles and that correct coope rative relations hip which shoul d distingui sh hum an affairs in the future. Thos e who will be directly affected, if the plans go as desired, are the big educ ationa l systems, the world - wide propa ganda institutions , and all thos e agencies which work to educ ate and direct publ ic thinki ng and moul d publ ic opi nion. The energy which I have called the Forces of Reconstruction will be more general in their appl ication, and they will affect the masses of men through the work of the men and wom en of goodw ill. I have therefore out lined a planne d distribut ion of the three great streams of di vine energy which will be set in motion at the three current Full Moons — one already past and two to com e: The energy of restoration, at the time of the April Full Moon The energy of enlight enm ent, at the time of the Wesak or May Full Moon The energy of re cons truction, at the time of the June Full Moon. The inspiring sour ces of these spiritual agencies are, first of all, the Spirit of Resurrection (an extra - planetary Being) , then the Lord of the World, working through the Buddha , and finally the Christ Himself. These Three will work through the Hierarchy, the New Group of World Servers, and the men and wom en of goo dw ill. Such is the general plan propos ed by Thos e Who stand — with enlight ened spiritual pur pos e — ready at this time to lead hum anity out of darkne ss into light , from the unr eal to the"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST real, and from death to immortality. That most ancient of prayers com es toda y to have its deepest spiritual signi ficance. Let me repeat it in the order in which toda y it gains meaning: Lead us, O Lord, from death to Immortality; From darkne ss to Light ; From the unr eal to the Real. The beauty of this synt hesis and the wonde r of this oppor tuni ty are surely appa rent as we study what is here written and cons ider these aspects of the divine Plan. Great Forces, un der pot ent spiritual leadership, are standi ng ready to precipitate Themselves into this hum an world of chaos, conf usion, aspiration and bewilderment. These groups of energies are ready to focus and distribut e themselves, and the Hierarchy is closer to mank ind than ever before; the New Group of World Servers are also \"standi ng attentive to direction\" in every count ry in the world, uni ted in their idealism, in their hum anitarian obj ectives, in their sensitivity to spiritual impression, in their uni ted subj ect ive pur pos e, in their love of their fellow men, and in their dedication to selfless service; the men and wom en of goodw ill are also to be found everyw here, ready to be gui ded into cons tructive activity, and to be the agents (gradua lly trained and educ ated) for the establishm ent of what has never yet truly existed — right hum an relations . Thus , from the highe st spiritual Being upon our planet, through the graded spiritual groups of enlight ened and perfected men who work upon the inne r side of life, on into the out er world of daily living, where thinki ng, lovi ng men and wom en serve, the tide of the new life sweeps. The Plan is ready for immediate appl ication and intelligent implementing; the workers are there, and the pow er to work is adequa te to the need. The three Full Moons which we have been cons idering are simply the three poi nts in time through which the needed pow er is to be released. Here, my brothers, is a picture of pos sibility. I seek to present it to you toda y because of world need; here i s the ground for a sound , opt imistic appr oach to the future; here is the assurance that the world can be rebui lt, that cons tructive action can be successfully taken, that enlight enm ent will increasingl y make its presence obvi ous , and that hum anity will ind eed rise out of its unha ppy past into a new world of unde rstandi ng, of tranqui llity, of coope ration and of renewed spiritual impulse. It will not be easy. The spiritual energies which will be released will inevitably evoke oppos ition. Selfishne ss and hate , with their seconda ry effects of greed, cruelty and nationa lism, are not dead nor will they die for a long time to com e. In the pos t - war world these condi tions must be igno red and the New Group of World Servers and the men and wom en of goodw ill must work toge ther for an enlight ened educ ation, for a coope rative econom ic life, for right hum an relations in all departments of hum an expe rience, for clean pol itical activity, for disinterested service, and for a world religion which will restore Christ to His rig htful place in the hearts of men, which will take the pom p, the materialism and the pol itics out of the chur ches, and which will uni fy the spiritual intention of all the religions to be found in both hemisphe res. This is a vast progr amme, but the num ber of enlight ened men and wom en is also very great, and the pow er at their dispos al ensures the ultimate triumph of their spiritual idealism. The major need is to bring these peopl e into a much closer relations hip, to take thos e steps which will enable them to realise that they are an integral part of a group of directed and intelligent world servers, and yet to leave them free to work in their ow n way, each in his ow n place and chos en field of service, and to see all these pha ses of the work as supp lementary to all others and as the working out of a divine"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Plan, originating in the Hierarchy of spiritual Lives. Their work will be cons cious ly carried out unde r the direct gui dance of Christ and His disciples. Long patience will be needed. Mistakes will be made. There will be periods of inde cision, of ineffective action and of negative yet deep discour agement. Workers will be prone to attitude s of despair, and at times the task will appe ar to them to demand too much, to be too difficult and the forces op pos ing what they seek to do too strong . But behind all the recons truction with which hum anity is faced is the pot ency of inevitable resurrection, the cons tant flow of enlight ened thinki ng into and directing the mass cons cious ness, plus a grow ing realisatio n that hum anity is not alone , that the spiritual values are the onl y real values, and that the Hierarchy stands , immova ble in its spiritual strengt h, steadily oriented tow ards world salvation, and acting ever unde r the direction of that great divine yet hu man Leader, the Christ. The Christ has passed through all hum an expe riences, and has never left us; with His disciples, the Masters of the Wisdom , He is drawing closer to hum anity decade after decade; when He said at the Ascension Initiation, \"Lo, I am wit h you always even unt il the end of the age,\" He meant no vague or general idea of helping hum anity from som e distant locality called \"the Throne of God in Heaven.\" He meant just what He said — that He was staying with us. The fact of His Presence upon earth in phys ical form is know n today by many hund reds of thous ands , and will eventually be realised by as many millions . Therefore, my brothers, believe in the reality of the work to be done by these great spiritual Potencies, invoke d dur ing the three Full Moo ns of April, May and June . Go forth to the task of helping hum anity, of establishing goodw ill, of bringi ng about right hum an relations and of restoring a true spiritual perspective, with unda unt ed cour age, sure faith and the firm convi ction that manki nd is not alone . May the blessing of the Christ and of the Hierarchy rest upon all true servers and may they stand tranqui l in the midst of strife. THE GREAT INVOCATION - Stan za Three April 17, 1945 As this world catastrophe draws to its inevi table close and the Forces of Light triumph ove r the forces of evil, the time of restoration ope ns up. For each of you this indi cates a renewed time of service and of activity. I send you herewith the final Stanza of the Great Invoc ation, as I prom ised. 9 D iscipleship in the New Age , Vol. II, pp. 148 - 151 , to preserve the historical seque nce of the issuing of the three Stanzas of the Great Invoc ation. * I gave you the first about nine years ago and the second during the cour se of the war. I woul d ask you to us e it daily and as many times a day as you can remember to do so; you will thus create a seed thought or a clear - cut thought form which will make the launc hing of this Invoc ation among the masses of men a successful venture when the right time com es. That ti me is not yet. This Great Invoc ation can be expr essed in the following words: From the poi nt of Light within the Mind of God"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Let light stream forth into the minds of men. Let Light descend on Earth. From the poi nt of Love within the Heart of God Let lov e stream forth into the hearts of men. May Christ return to Earth. From the centre where the Will of God is know n Let pur pos e gui de the little wills of men — The pur pos e which the Masters know and serve. From the centre which we call the race of men Let t he Plan of Love and Light work out And may it seal the door where evil dw ells. Let Light and Love and Pow er restore the Plan on Earth. It has been difficult to translate into unde rstanda ble and adequa te phr ases, the very ancient word - forms whi ch the Christ will employ. These word - forms are onl y seven in num ber, and they will cons titute His com plete, new utterance. I have onl y been able to give their general signi ficance. Nothing else was pos sible, but even in this longe r form, they will be pot e nt in their invoc ative appe al, if said with mental intensity and ardent purpos e. The poi nts of empha sis upon which I woul d ask you to dw ell (onc e it is permissible to use the phr ases) are two in number: 1. May Christ return to earth . This return must not be unde rstood in its usual connot ation and its well - know n mystical, Christian sense. Christ has never left the earth. What is referred to is the externalisation of the Hierarchy and its exot eric appearance on earth. The Hierarchy will eventually, unde r its Head, the Christ, func tion ope nly and visibly on earth. This will happe n when the purpos e of the divine will and the plan which will implement it is better unde rstood and the period of adjustment, of world enlight enm ent and of recons truction has made real headw ay. This period begins at the San Francisco Conf erence (hence its major impor tance) and will move very slow ly at first. It will take time but the Hierarchy thinks not in terms of years and of brief cycles (though long to hum anity), but in terms of ev ents and the expa nsion of cons cious ness. 2. May it seal the door where evil dw ells . The sealing up of the evil forces, released dur ing this war, will take place within the immediate future. It will be soon. The evil referred to has not hing to do with the evil inclinations , the selfish instincts and the separativeness found in the hearts and minds of hum an beings . These they must ove rcom e and eliminate for themselves. But the reduc tion to impot ency of the loos ed forces of evil which took adva ntage of the wo rld situation, which obs essed the German peopl e and directed the Japanese peopl e, and which worked through barbarity, murder, sadism, lying propa ganda and which prostituted science to achieve their ends , requi res the impos ition of a pow er beyond the hum an. This must be invoke d and the invoc ation will meet with speedy respons e. These evil pot encies will be occultly \"sealed\" within their ow n place; what this exactly means has naught to do with hum anity. Men toda y must learn the lessons of the past, profit from the discipline of the war and deal — each in his ow n life and com munity — with the weakne sses and errors to which he may find himself prone .

It can be so presented that the masses everyw here, the general publ ic will be prompted to take it up and will use it widely; they will do this on a relatively larger scale than the intuitional, the spiritually minde d or even the men of goo dw ill.

THE RELEASE OF ATOMIC ENERGY Augus t 9, 1945 I woul d like at this time to touc h upon the greatest spiritual event wh ich has taken place since the four th kingdo m of nature, the human kingdom , appeared. I refer to the release of atom ic energy, as related in the newspapers this week, Augus t 6, 194 5, in conne ction with the bom bing of Japan. Som e years ago I told you that t he new era woul d be ushered in by the scientists of the world and that the inaugur ation of the kingdom of God on Earth woul d be heralded by means of successful scientific inve stigation. By this first step in the releasing of the energy of the atom this has been accom plished, and my prophe cy has been justified dur ing this momentous year of our Lord 1945. Let me make one or two statements anent this discove ry, leaving you to make your ow n appl ication and deduc tions . Little as to the true nature of this happe n ing is as yet kno wn, and still less is unde rstood. Certain ideas and sugge sted thought s may be of real value here and enable you to see this stupe ndous event in better perspective. 1. It was the imminence of this \"release\" of energy which was one of the m ajor subj ective factors in the precipitation of this last pha se of the war. This world war started in 1914 , but its last and most impor tant pha se began in 1939. Up till then it was a world war. After that date, and because the forces"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST of evil too k adva ntage of the state of war and belligerency existing on the planet, the real war began, invol ving the entire three worlds of hum an evol ution and a cons eque nt activity of the Hierarchy. Man's attention is nor mally focussed on the externalities of livin g. Nevertheless, all great discove ries, such as thos e made in conne ction with astronom y or in relation to the laws of nature or invol ving such a revelation as that of radio - activity or the epoc h - making event announc ed this week conc erning the first steps t aken in the harnessing of cosmic energy, are ever the result of inne r pressure emanating from Forces and Lives found in high Places. Such inne r pressures themselves func tion unde r the laws of the Spirit and not just unde r what you call natural laws; they a re the result of the impelling work of certain great Lives, working in conne ction with the third aspect of divinity, that of active intelligence, and are conc erned with the subs tance or matter aspect of manifestation. Such activities are motivated from Sha mballa. This activity is set in motion by these Lives, working on Their high plane, and it gradua lly causes a reaction in the various departments of the Hierarchy, particularly thos e working unde r third, fifth and seventh ray Masters. Eventually, disciples upon the phys ical levels of activity becom e aware of the inne r ferment, and this happe ns either cons cious ly or unc ons cious ly. They becom e \"impressed,\" and the scientific work is then started and carried through into the stages of expe rimentation and final success. One poi nt shoul d here be remembered, and that is that this pha se appl ies to bot h the great White Lodg e and the Black Lodge — the one dedicated to the beneficent task of purifying and aiding all lives in the three worlds of material evol ution and t o the release of the soul in form, and the other to the retardation of the evol utiona ry process and to the cont inuous crystallising of the material forms which hide and veil the ani ma mund i . Both groups have been profoundl y interested and implicated in thi s matter of the release of energy from the atom and the liberation of its inne r aspect, but their motives and obj ectives were widely different. 2. The imminence of this release — inevitable and unde r direction — produc ed an enor mous tension in hier archical circles because (to expr ess the idea colloqui ally) a race was on between the Dark Forces and the Forces of Light to acqui re pos session of the techni que s necessary to bring about this liberation of needed energy. Had the Dark Forces trium phe d, and had the Axis Pow ers obt ained pos session of the needed scientific formulas, it woul d have led to a major planetary disaster. The released energy woul d have been used first of all to bring about the com plete destruction of all oppos ing the forces of evil, an d then it woul d have been prostituted to the preservation of an increasingl y materialistic and non - idealistic civilisation. Germany coul d not be trusted with this pow er, for all her motives were com pelling wrong. You might here fall back on the trite reli gious platitude that the inna te good in hum anity and manki nd's inhe rent divinity woul d eventually have trium phe d, because naught can finally ove rcom e the uni versal trend to good . You are prone to forget that if the evil forces pos sess pot encies which can d estroy form in the three worlds on such a wide scale that the soul s of adva nced aspirants and disciples, and thos e of initiates seeking incarnation, cannot com e into out er expr ession dur ing a particular world crisis, then you have direfully affected the ti me - schedul e of the evol utiona ry process; you will have greatly delayed (perhaps for millenni a of years) the manifestation of the kingdo m of God. The time had com e for that manifestation, and hence the pow erful activity of the dark forces. This attempt to hinde r the planne d progr ess cons tituted a definite menace and indi cated a supr eme dange r and probl em. The evil forces were closer to success than any of you have ever dreamed. They were so close to success in 1942 that there were four mont hs when the membe rs of the spiritual Hierarchy had made every pos sible arrange ment to withdr aw from human cont act for an inde finite and"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST unf oreseen period of time; the plans for a closer cont act with the evol utiona ry process in the three worlds and the effort to blend and fuse the two divine centres, the Hierarchy and Hum anity, into one working, collaborating whol e seemed doom ed to destruction. Their fusion woul d have meant the appe arance of the Kingdom of God on earth; the obstacles to this fusion, ow ing to the a ctive tension of the dark forces, seemed at that time insupe rable; we believed that man woul d go dow n to defeat, ow ing to his selfishne ss and his misuse of the principle of free will. We made all preparations to withdr aw, and yet at the same time we strugg led to get hum anity to choos e rightly and to see the issues clearly. The necessity to withdr aw was averted. I may not say in what manne r, beyond telling you that the Lords of Liberation took certain une xpe cted steps. This They were led to do ow ing to the invoc ative pow ers of hum anity, used cons cious ly by all thos e upon the side of the will - to - good and unc ons cious ly by all men of goodw ill. Owing to these steps, the efforts of thos e fighting in the realm of science for the establishing of true know ledge and right hum an relations were aided. The trend of the pow er to know and to discove r (a definite form of energy) was deflected aw ay from the demandi ng evoc ative minds of thos e seeking to destroy the world of men, leading to a form of mental paralysis. Thos e se eking to empha sise the right values and to save hum anity were simultaneous ly stimulated to the poi nt of success. In these very few words I have dispos ed of a stupe ndous world event, and in this brief paragraph I have sum med up the working out of a special ised divine activity. 3. When the sun move d nor thw ard that year (1942 ), the great White Lodge kne w that the battle had been won. Their preparations were halted and the Masters then organised for renewed effort (throug h Their disciples) to bring about tho se condi tions wherein that which was new and that which was in line with lovi ng divine pur pos e coul d freely move forward. The war was not won by the surrende r of Germany. That was onl y the out er result of inne r happe nings . The war was won by th e Forces of Light when the mental pot ency of the forces of evil was ove rcom e and the \"energy of the future\" was directed or impelled by Thos e Who were seeking the highe r hum an values and the spiritual good of manki nd. Four factors lie behind the mom entous happe ning of the release of this form of atom ic energy, throug h the medium of what is errone ous ly and uns cientifically called the \"splitting of the atom .\" There are other factors, but you may find the follow ing four of real interest: a. There was a clearl y directed inflow of extra - planetary energy released by the Lords of Liberation, to Whom invoc ation had been successfully made; through the impact of this energy upon the atom ic subs tance being dealt with by the inve stigating scientists, change s were broug ht about which enabled them to achieve success. The expe riments being carried forward were therefore bot h subj ective and obj ective. b. A conc erted effort was made by a num ber of disciples who were working in fifth and seventh ray ashrams, and this enabled them to impress lesser disciples in the scientific field and helped them to surmount the well - nigh insupe rable difficulties with which they were conf ront ed. c. There was also a weakening of the tension which had hitherto successfully held the forces of ev il toge ther, and a grow ing inability of the evil group at the head of the Axis Pow ers to surmount the incidental war fatigue . This brought about , first of all, a steady deterioration of their minds , and then of their brains and nervous systems. None of the men invol ved in the direction of the Axis effort in Europe is toda y nor mal psychol ogi cally; they are all suffering from som e form of phys ical deterioration, and this has been a real factor in their defeat, though one that may be difficult for you to reali se. It is not so in the case of the Japanese, whos e psychol ogi cal make - up is totally different, as are"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST their nervous systems, which are of four th root race qua lity. They will be and are being defeated by phys ical war measures and by the destructi on phys ically of their war pot ential and the death of the form aspect. This destruction ... and the cons eque nt release of their imprisone d soul s, is a necessary happe ning; it is the justification of the use of the atom ic bom b upon the Japanese popul ation. The first use of this released energy has been destructive, but I woul d remind you that it has been the destruction of forms and not the destruction of spiritual values and the death of the hum an spirit — as was the goa l of the Axis effort. Forget not that all success (bot h good and bad) is depende nt upon the sustaining of the poi nt of tension. This poi nt of tension invo lves the dyna mic focussing of all mental, emotiona l and phys ical energies at a central poi nt of planne d activity. This, by the way, is the o bjective of all true meditation work. It is in this act of tension that the German peopl e failed. This cost them the war; their tension broke because the group of evil forces who were impressing the negative German peopl e were una ble to attain the poi nt of tension which the Hierarchy coul d reach when it was reinforced through the action of the Lords of Liberation. d. Anot her factor was the cons tant, invoc ative demand and the prayers (articulate and inarticulate) of hum anity itself. Men, impelled largely by fear and the inna te mobi lising of the hum an spirit against slavery, reached such a pitch of demandi ng energy that a channe l was created which greatly facilitated the work of the Hierarchy, unde r the direct influence of the Lords of Liberation. 4. The rel ease of the energy of the atom is as yet in an extremely embryoni c stage; hum anity little know s the extent or the nature of the energies which have been tappe d and released. There are many type s of atom s, cons tituting the \"world subs tance\"; each can release its ow n type of force; this is one of the secrets which the new age will in time reveal, but a good and sound beginni ng has been made. I woul d call your attention to the words, \"the liberation of energy.\" It is liberation which is the keynot e of the new era, just as it has ever been the keynot e of the spiritually oriented aspirant. This liberation has started by the release of an aspect of matter and the freeing of som e of the soul forces within the atom . This has been, for matter itself, a gre at and potent initiation, paralleling thos e initiations which liberate or release the soul s of men. In this process of planetary initiation hum anity has carried its work as the world saviour dow n into the world of subs tance, and has affected thos e primary uni ts of life of which all forms are made. 5. You will now unde rstand the meaning of the words used by so many of you in the second of the Great Invoc ations : The hour of service of the saving force has now arrived . This \"saving force\" is the energy which science has released into the world for the destruction, first of all, of thos e who cont inue (if they do) to defy the Forces of Light working through the United Nations . Then — as time goe s on — this liberated energy will usher in the new civilisation, the ne w and better world and the finer, more spiritual condi tions . The highe st dreams of thos e who love their fellow men can becom e practical pos sibilities through the right use of this liberated energy, if the real values are taught , empha sised and appl ied to da ily living. This \"saving force\" has now been made available by science, and my earlier prophe cy subs tantiated. 10 A Treatise on White Magi c , publ ished in 1934, beginni ng on page 333, where the follow ing statements appe ar: It might be not ed here that three gr eat discove ries are imminent and dur ing the next two generations will revol utioni se mode rn thought and life. One is already sensed and is the subj ect of expe riment and inve stigation, the releasing of the energy of the atom . This will com pletely change the econom ic and pol itical situation in the world, for the latter is"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST largely depende nt upon the former. Our mechanical civilisation will be simplified, and an era ushered in which will be free from the incubus of mone y (its pos session and its non - pos session) , and the hum an family will recogni se uni versally its status as a bridgi ng kingdom between the three low er kingdom s of nature and the fifth or spiritual kingdom . There will be time and freedom for a soul culture which will supe rsede our mode rn methods of edu cation, and the signi ficance of soul pow ers and the developm ent of the supe rhum an cons cious ness will engr oss the attention of educ ators and stude nts everyw here. A second discove ry will grow out of the present investigations as to light and colour. The thir d developm ent, which will be the last probably to take place, will be more strictly in the realm of what the occultists call magic. It will grow out of the study of sound and the effect of sound, and will put into man's hands a tremendous instrum ent in the world of creation.* As I said above , the first use of this energy has been material destruction; this was inevitable and desirable; old forms (obs tructing the good) have had to be destroye d; the wrecking and disappe arance of that which is bad and unde sirable must ever precede the bui lding of the good and desirable and the longe d - for emergence of that which is new and better. The cons tructive use of this energy and its harnessing for the betterment of hum anity is its real purpos e; this living e nergy of subs tance itself, hitherto shut up within the atom and imprisone d in these ultimate forms of life, can be turned whol ly into that which is good and can bring about such a revol utioni sing of the mode s of hum an expe rience that (from one angl e alone ) it will necessitate and bring about an entirely new econom ic world structure. It lies in the hands of the United Nations to protect this released energy from misuse and to see that its pow er is not prostituted to selfish ends and pur ely material pur pos es . It is a \"saving force\" and has in it the pot ency of rebui lding, of rehabilitation and of recons truction. Its right use can abol ish destitution, bring civilised com fort (and not useless luxur y) to all upon our planet; its expr ession in forms of right livi ng, if motivated by right human relations , will produc e beauty, warmth, colour , the abol ition of the present forms of disease, the withdr awal of manki nd from all activities which invol ve living or working unde rground, and will bring to an end all hum an sla very, all need to work or fight for pos sessions and things , and will rende r pos sible a state of life which will leave man free to pur sue the highe r aims of the Spirit. The prostituting of life to the task of provi ding the bare necessities or to making it pos sible for a few rich and privileged peopl e to have too much when others have too little, will com e to an end; men everyw here can now be released into a state of life which will give them leisure and time to follow spiritual obj ectives, to real ise richer cultural life, and to attain a broader mental perspective. But, my brothers, men will fight to prevent this; the reactiona ry groups in every count ry will neither recogni se the need for, nor desire this new world order which the liberation of co smic energy (even on this initial tiny scale) can make pos sible; the vested interests, the big cartels, trusts and monopol ies that cont rolled the past few decades, preceding this world war, will mobi lise their resour ces and fight to the death to prevent th e extinction of their sour ces of incom e; they will not permit, if they can help it, the passing of the cont rol of this illimitable pow er into the hands of the masses, to whom it right ly belong s. The selfish interests among the big stockhol ders, the banki ng firms and the wealthy organised chur ches will oppos e all change , except in so far as it will benefit them and bring more financial gain to their coffers. Signs of this oppos ition can already be seen in the utterances of certain pow erful men who are toda y encour aging a gloom y outlook in London and in Washingt on and elsewhere; the Vatican, that wealthy and reactiona ry ecclesiastical organisation, has already expr essed its disfavour , because that Chur ch"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST know s — as do all the vested and moni ed interests — that th eir days are num bered, provi ded hum anity gove rns its decisions dur ing the next fifty years by the idea of the greatest good to the greatest num ber. World decisions must therefore, in the future, be based upon a steady determination to further right hum an r elations and to prevent selfish cont rol, financial or ecclesiastical, by any group of men, anyw here, in any count ry. We believe the determination of Great Britain, the United States, and Canada, who are in pos session of the secrets, is along these lines. These few sugge stions will give you much food for thought and real ground for happy, confident, forward thinking. Organise now for the goodw ill work. The future of the world lies in the hands of the men of goodw ill and in thos e who have uns elfis h purpos e everyw here. This release of energy will eventually make mone y, as we know it, of no mom ent whatsoever; mone y has prove d itself (ow ing to man's limitations ) a produc er of evil and the sow er of dissension and discont ent in the world. This new relea sed energy can prove itself a \"saving force\" for all manki nd, releasing from pove rty, ugl iness, degradation, slavery and despair; it will destroy the great monopol ies, take the curse out of labour , and ope n the door into that gol den age for which all men w ait. It will level all the artificial layers of modern society and liberate men from the cons tant anxi ety and gruelling toil which have been respons ible for so much disease and death. When these new and better condi tions are established, then men will be f ree to live and move in beauty and to seek the \"Light ed Way.\" SECTION FOUR STAGES IN THE EXTERNALISATION OF THE HIERARCHY THE SUBJE CTIVE BASIS OF THE NEW WO RLD RELIGIO N Introduc tory Statements — December 1919 Thos e thought forms which will materialise as the religion of the New Age already exist on the mental plane and are in process of precipitation upon the phys ical plane. Their lineaments can already be discerned. The wise Guides of the race, working unde r the Christ and having in view the need of the publ ic for a form, seek at this time to hold just as much as may be of the old form and lineaments, as much, that is, as is cons istent with evol ution and progr ess. In the West, what the Great Ones seek to break is not the form of Christianity but the grip of the Chur ches on the minds of the masses. The old forms of thought and of interpretation are now too restricted and too tight ening in their hol d upon the imprisone d and struggl ing life. That life must break forth. It cannot be conf ined by the ancient restrictions . Yet at this time there doe s not exist the need for an utterly new venture or for an entirely new presentation of truth. Nature and evol ution move with gentl e gradations and not with breaks and unc orrelated manifestations in the world of forms. In all the progressing developm ents, the old outlines can be seen — enlarged, pur ified and more beautiful, yet recogni sable as the old form on a highe r turn of the spiral . It is not the freak cults, nor the widely divergent sects, nor the bands of adva nced religious revol utiona ries who can meet the crying need of the many enqui rers toda y. What is requi red is the re - vivification of the old forms, and their infusi on with fresh life; the old organisations must be awakened to the hour of oppor tuni ty and must change from static organisations to living organisms. The old"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST rituals must be revived and brough t up to date (in the esoteric sense of the word) and the religiou s stude nts of the world must be gradua ted into a higher school , given the occult interpretations , and taught that, after all, the truth has been present all the time, but hidde n and misinterpreted. It is surely easier to swing the masses into step and giv e them the newer light of truth if that light is pour ed on to familiar ground . All must be given the chance to see and hear, and be offered the oppor tuni ty to weigh and judge the signi ficance of reality. It is not just the two or three of supr eme impor tanc e, or who have the nerve to take the needed forward steps, who must receive prime cons ideration, but the truth must be steppe d dow n and adapted in such a way that the adva nced minds , the enqui ring minds , and the reactiona ry masses may have oppor tuni ty prof fered them, to the measure of their receptivity. Did not the greatest of all the Great Ones do this Himself in the syna gogue and with His disciples in Jude an days? The aspirants and disciples of the world must realise that the hour has struck, and that th e forces of the Christ are being marshalled for a supr eme ende avour . These forces include bot h the hum an and the ange l evol utions . It might be of use if I were to give you som e idea of the scheme of preparation for the transition period between the old age and the new as it is in process of com pletion in the Counc il Chamber of the Great Lord. Your acceptance and unde rstandi ng of it and of its sym bol ic implications are depende nt upon your capacity to assimilate truth, to use your intuition, and thus to assis t in the work itself when the right time com es. One event is already in process of manifesting. The Christ and His disciples, the Masters of Wisdom and the Great Com panions , are appr oaching nearer to the phys ical plane. The work of mental preparation for that event, and the cons truction of the thought form of the adve nt or second Com ing, has now been com pleted. There remains the precipitation of that event, its appe arance on astral levels and its materialisation on the phys ical plane. I woul d ask all of you who read these words anent the second Com ing, to reserve opi nion as to the exact nature of that event. Keep the conc ept impersonal and link not that appe arance to a persona lity or to an indi vidua l. If you make the mistake of attaching the meani ng to an individua l, you will limit your unde rstandi ng and fail in right recogni tion of group pur pos e. The work of pour ing out the principle of love (which is the Christ principle) and of lifting the masses in their cons cious ness to the pitch where they ca n unde rstand and welcom e that love - principle is the main work of the new age, and it will inaugu rate the age of brotherhood and moul d hum anity into the likeness of the Christ. That the oriental peopl es may call this great Official by anot her name than that of \"The Christ\" has no bearing on reality and alters not the fact of His influence and His esoteric com ing. Certain of the Masters have the work unde r Their cont rol, and through Their groupe d disciples are already actively enga ged in the work of preparat ion. The Master Morya, the Master K.H. and the Master Jesus are the three working at this time in closest coope ration with the Christ. With them work the Master Hilarion, He Whom you call the Master D.K., and anot her Master Who is specially linke d with the work of preparation in the sacred land of Indi a. One of the Engl ish Masters is also exceptiona lly active, and the Master in America is laying His plans tow ard an active participation in the work. These cons ecrated Workers form a nuc leus around the Christ and direct much of the preparatory work. It is not pos sible for me to tell you the lines of Their activity; I can but give you evidence which may later he demons trated as true. These Masters are definitely preparing Themselves for the task of out er activit y and are intensifying Their work on the astral plane. To this fact can be traced the interest peopl e are now show ing in occultism and in the work of the Masters; more and more peopl e are becom ing sensitive to and cons cious of Their presence, an d more and more are findi ng their way into"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST the groups of disciples. The Master Morya is at this time acting as the inspirer of the great nationa l executives throughou t the world. E'en thos e whos e ideals coincide not with your s are being welded into the wo rld plan, and much of their immediate work is organising the indi vidual nations and welding them into an hom oge neous whol e, preparatory to their entrance into the great internationa l thought form. All who work with far vision and all who hol d before any see thing and bewildered nation an ideal for the whol e are unde r His wide inspiration. Internationa lism is the aim of His ende avour . With Him works the great Ange l or Deva of the spiritual plane, referred to in the Treatise on Cosmic Fire as the Lord Agni ; He seeks to touc h with the hidde n spiritual fire the head centres of all intuitive statesmen. Three great groups of ange ls — the gol d, the flame colour ed and the white and gol d — work on mental levels with thos e lesser ange ls or devas who vitalise thought forms an d who keep alive the thought s of the Guides of the race for the benefit of hum anity. The Master K.H., the Choha n on the teaching ray and He Who will be the next world teacher, is already active in His line of ende avour . He is attempting to transmute the t hought form of religious dogm a, to permeate the chur ches with the idea of the Com ing, and bring to a sorrow ing world the vision of the Great Helper, the Christ. He works with the rose devas and with the blue devas on astral levels, with the wise help of the great gua rdian Angel of that plane, called (in Hindu terminol ogy) the Lord Varuna . The activity of the astral plane is being much intensified and the ange ls of devot ion, in whom the aspect of divine love is pre - eminent, work with the astral bodi es of all thos e who are ready to strengt hen and redirect their spiritual aspiration and desire. They are the ange ls who gua rd the sanctuaries of all the chur ches, cathedrals, temples and mosque s of the world. They are now increasing the mom entum of their vibration f or the raising of the cons cious ness of the attenda nt congr egations . The Master K.H. works also with the prelates of the great Cathol ic Chur ches — Greek, Rom an and Angl ican — with the leaders of the Protestant com muni ons , with the foremost workers in the field of educ ation, and also through , and with, the dom inant demagogue s and organisers of the peopl e. His interests lie with all thos e who, with uns elfish intent, strive after the ideal, and who live for the helping of others. The Master Jesus works especially with the masses of the Christian peopl e who inha bit the occidental count ries, and who gather in the chur ches. He is distinctively a great leader, an organiser, and a wise general executive. A special group of devas work unde r His com mand, and Hi s conne ction with all true chur ch leaders and executives is very close. He acts ceaselessly on the inne r esoteric counc il of the chur ches, and with Him the groups of violet ange ls coope rate. In chur ch matters He Himself carries out the behests of the Chris t, saving Him much and working as His intermediary. This will seem logi cal to you, for His destiny is closely interwove n with the Christian Chur ch and it marks the culmination of His work for the West. No one know s or unde rstands so fully and wisely as He the probl ems of the Western culture, nor the needs of the peopl e who carry forward the destiny of Christianity. The Master Hilarion is actively occupi ed in the field of America, stimulating the intuitive perception of its peopl e. He has unde r obs ervation all thos e who are true psychics, and who develop their pow ers for the good of the com muni ty. He cont rols and transmutes the great active move ments which ende avour to strip the veil from the world of the uns een. He impresses the minds of thos e whos e vision will justify His effort. And He has much to do with various psychical research move ments throughout the world. With the aid of certain groups of ange ls, He works to ope n up the world of departed soul s to the seeker, and much that has of late convi nced the materialistic world of life beyond has emanated from Him. "},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST He Whom you call the Master D.K. works much with thos e who heal with pur e altruism; He occupi es Himself with thos e who are active in the labor atories of the world, with great phi lanthrop ic world move ments such as the Red Cross, and with the rapidly developi ng welfare move ments. His work also embraces teaching, and He doe s much at this time to train the various disciples of the world, taking the disciples of many of the Masters and so reli eving Them tempor arily, in this hour of crisis, from Their teaching respons ibilities. Many of the healing ange ls, such as thos e referred to in the Bible, coope rate with Him. The Master Who works in and for Indi a labour s with the minds of the pol iticians, educ ators and religious dreamers and idealists. He strengt hens the efforts of all thos e who work for the liberation of the subm erged masses, provi ded their methods are cons tructive and not destructive, and that the gains desired are not furthered at the ex pense of any part of the hum an family. He labour s not to exalt one section of the popul ace at the expe nse of anot her, but works tow ards brotherhood and the right unde rstandi ng of the requi rements of all soul s, be they far adva nced along the path, or just s tarting upon their planetary pilgrimage unde r the Law of Rebirth. One of the Engl ish Masters has in hand the definite gui dance of the Angl o - Saxon peopl es tow ards a joint destiny. The future for the Angl o - Saxon is great and not yet has the highe st flow of the tide of its civilisation been reached. History hol ds much glory for Engl and and America when they work toge ther for world good , not suppl anting each other or interfering with each other's empire but working in the fullest uni son for the preservation of the peace of the world and the right handl ing of world probl ems in the field of econom ics and of educ ation. As the seventh Ray of Organisation and of ceremonial work is now com ing into prom inence and manifestation, the work of the Master on that ray is t hat of synt hesising, on the phys ical plane, all parts of the plan. The Master Rakoc zi takes of the general plan as it is out lined in the inne r Counc il Chamber and appr oxi mates it to the pos sible. He might be regarded as acting as the General Man ager for the carrying out of the plans of the executive counc il of the Christ. It might be of interest here to point out that when He com es Whom ange ls and men await, and Whos e work it is to inaugu rate the new age and so com plete the work He began in Pale stine two thous and years ago, He will bring with Him som e of the great Ange ls, as well as certain of the Masters. The ange ls have ever been active in Biblical history, and will again enter into the lives of hum an beings with more pow er than has lately been the case. The call has gone out for them again to appr oach hum anity, and with their height ened vibration and supe rior know ledge uni te their forces with thos e of the Christ and His disciples for the helping of the race. They have, for instance, much to com muni cate anent colour and sound, and the effect of these two forces on the etheric bodi es of men and animals and flow ers. When what they have to impart is appr ehende d by the race, phys ical ills and sickne ss will be offset. The group of violet ange ls or dev as who work on the four etheric levels will be especially active and they will work in the four main groups of men who are in incarnation at any given time. Four rays dom inate at any period, with one of the four more pot ent than the other three. You have t his idea sym bol ised in the four castes in Indi a and you will find also that these four castes are found uni versally throughout the planet. These four groups of ange ls are a band of servers, pledge d to the service of the Christ, and their work is to cont ac t men and to teach them along certain lines. a. They will teach humanity to see etherically, and this they will do by height ening hum an vibration by"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST interaction with their ow n. b. They will give instruction in the effect of colour in the healing of disea se, and particularly the efficiency of violet light in lessening hum an ills and in curing thos e phys ical plane sickne sses which originate in the etheric body . c. They will also demons trate to the materialistic thinke rs of the world the fact tha t the supe rcons cious world exists and that ange ls and men who are out of incarnation and pos sess no phys ical bodi es can be cont acted and know n. d. They will train human beings in the know ledge of supe rhum an phys ics so that weight shall be for them transmut ed. Motion will becom e more rapid, speed will be accom panied by noi selessness and smoot hne ss, and hence fatigue will be eliminated. In the hum an cont rol of etheric levels lies the ove rcom ing of fatigue and the pow er to transcend time. Until this prophe cy i s a fact and recogni sed as such, the meaning of the above words will remain obs cure. e. They will teach humanity how right ly to nou rish the body and to draw from the surroundi ng ethers the requi site food . Man will conc entrate his attention upon the etheri c body and the work and health of the phys ical body will becom e increasingl y autom atic. f. They will also teach hum an beings as indi vidua ls and as a race to expa nd their cons cious ness to include the supe rphys ical. In the accom plishm ent of this, the separa ting web (the veil of the temple) which divides the phys ical plane from the uns een world will be recogni sed as a fact in nature by the scientist. Its pur pos e will be acknow ledge d. Eventually it will be destroye d, by man discove ring how to penetrate it. The date is imminent. Through the increasing sensitivity of men and through the steady thinni ng of the separating veil, more and more dur ing the com ing years will the telepathic faculties of men and their pow er to respond to inne r inspiration be develope d an d demons trated. By the grow th of intuitiona l telepathy and the increasing com prehension of the pow er of colour and sound will the work of the Christ and of the Great Ones be cont acted and unde rstood, and the peopl es released from the thraldom of the past a nd enabled to enter into the liberty of the Kingdom of God. Religious Organi sations in the New Age Let us now return to our cons ideration of the spread of the deepened religious ideals and the grow th of the new religious organisms. In the pro cess of transmuting the old form and so releasing the imprisoned life, there are two things which are steadily held in view by the Guides of our evol ution: First, that the general publ ic serves or is dom inated by the conc rete mind and is una ble to grasp a bstractions . It is the form which matters to them the most, for they are cons ervative and cling to the familiar. The chur ch is intende d to serve the masses and is not intende d to be of use (except as a field of service) to the esotericists of the world, fo r they heed not the form to the same extent, having cont acted som ewhat the inne r com pelling life. Secondl y, the church move ment, like all else, is but a tempor ary expe dient and serves but as a transient resting place for the evol ving life. Eventually, the re will appe ar the Chur ch Universal, and its definite out lines will appe ar tow ards the close of this century. In this conne ction, forget not the wise prophe cy"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST of H.P.B. as touc hing events at the close of this century. This Chur ch will be nurtured into acti vity by the Christ and His disciples when the out pou ring of the Christ principle, the true second Com ing, has been accom plished. No date for the adve nt do I set, but the time will not be long . The Christian chur ch in its many branches can serve as a St. J ohn the Baptist, as a voi ce crying in the wilderness, and as a nuc leus through which world illum ination may be accom plished. I indi cate the hope . I do not assert a fact. Its work is intende d to be the hol ding of a broad platform. The chur ch must show a wid e tolerance, and teach no revol utiona ry doc trines or cling to any reactiona ry ideas. The chur ch as a teaching factor shoul d take the great basic doc trines and (shattering the old forms in which they are expr essed and held) show their true and in ner spiritual signi ficance. The prime work of the chur ch is to teach , and teach ceaselessly , preserving the out er appe arance in order to reach the many who are accustom ed to chur ch usages. Teachers must be trained; Bible know ledge must be spread; the sacra ments must be mystically interpreted, and the pow er of the church to heal must be demons trated. The three main channe ls through which the preparation for the new age is goi ng on might be regarded as the Chur ch, the Masoni c Fraternity and the educ ationa l f ield. All of them are as yet in relatively static condi tion, and all are as yet failing to meet the need and to respond to the inne r pressure. But in all of these three move ments, disciples of the Great Ones are to be found and they are steadily gathering mom entum and will before long enter upon their designa ted task. The Masoni c Movement when it can be divor ced from pol itics and social ends and from its present paralysing condi tion of inertia, will meet the need of thos e who can, and shoul d, wield pow er. It is the custodi an of the law; it is the hom e of the Mysteries and the seat of initiation. It hol ds in its sym bol ism the ritual of Deity, and the way of salvation is pictorially preserved in its work. The methods of Deity are demons trated in its Temples, and unde r the All - seeing Eye the work can go forward. It is a far more occult organisation than can be realised, and is intende d to be the training school for the com ing adva nced occultists. In its ceremoni als lies hid the wielding of the forces conne cted with the grow th and life of the kingdom s of nature and the unf oldm ent of the divine aspects in man. In the com prehension of its sym bol ism will com e the power to coope rate with the divine plan. It meets the need of thos e who work on the first Ray of Will or Pow er. The Chur ch finds its mission in the helping of the devot ee, in aiding the great publ ic which is inna tely religious and of good will. It hides in its heart thos e who vibrate to the great love ray, the second Ray of Love - Wisdom . Christ Hi mself works through it and by its means seeks to cont act the vast Christian publ ic. It is the leaven in His hands to leaven the whol e lum p, and being in a form com prehende d by the peopl e, it can touc h the great masses of seeking soul s. By means of the edu cational work of the world, the Great Lord seeks to reach thos e of the intelligent publ ic who cannot be reached by means of ceremonial and sym bol ism, as in Masonr y, or by religious means and ritual, as in the Chur ch. It touc hes the masses and thos e in whom the intelligence aspect predom inates to the lessening of the other two aspects. It aids thos e men who are predom inantly on the third Ray of Intelligent Activity. In all these bodi es there are to be foun d esoteric groups who are the custodi ans of the inne r teaching and whos e uni formity in aspiration and in techni que is one . These inne r groups cons ist of occult stude nts and of thos e who are in direct or occasiona l touc h with the Masters and of thos e whos e soul s are in sufficient cont rol so that the will of the Hierarchy may be com muni cated and gradua lly filter dow n to the channe l of the phys ical brain. These groups which cons titute the true inne r esoteric group"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST are many, but their membership is yet small, for the fact that a stude nt may belong to any of the out er esoteric groups so - called is no indi cation of his true esoteric status. When the few who are the true esoteric stude nts of the world know the difference between etheric and astral forms, between mental clairaudi ence and clairvoya nce and their astral counterparts, between the elementals of thought and the elementals of nature, then will the Christ and His chur ch have a real esoteric group on the phys ical plane and the out er organisations receive the needed stimulation. That is why it is necessary to wo rk with the stude nts at this time and train them in the nature of true occultism. When we unde rstand better the signi ficance of time in prevision, and of force in move ment, and when we com prehend more fully the laws that cont rol the subt ler bodi es, and thr oug h them therefore the laws that func tion on the planes whereon thos e bodi es expr ess themselves, then will there be more intelligent and more useful work offered in coope ration with the Occult Hierarchy. In the esoteric group, which is com pos e d of the true spiritual esotericists found in all exot eric occult groups , in the chur ch, by whatever name it may be called, and in Masonr y you have the three paths leading to initiation. As yet they are not used, and one of the things that will eventuate — w hen the new uni versal religion has sway and the nature of esotericism is unde rstood — will be the utilisation of the bande d esoteric organisms, the Masoni c organism and the Chur ch organism as initiating centres. These three groups conve rge as their inne r san ctuaries are appr oached. There is no dissociation between the One Universal Chur ch, the sacred inne r Lodge of all true Masons , and the inne rmost circles of the esoteric societies. Three type s of men have their need met, three major rays are expr essed, and the three paths to the Master are trodde n, leading all three to the same por tal and the same Hieropha nt. It must not be forgot ten that onl y thos e soul s who are on the Proba tiona ry Path or the Path of Discipleship will form the nuc leus of the com ing world religion. It exists on the inne r planes for the pur pos e of gathering out of all the chur ches thos e who have reached the poi nt in evol ution where they can cons cious ly and of their ow n free will place their feet upon that PATH which leads to the centre of pe ace; who can in full awareness turn their eyes upon the Great Lord, and transmute the life of worldly ende avour into the life of service. The first detachment gathered into the com ing Chur ch will be found to be a part of the present great band of servers. These have, dow n the ages, been associated with the Christ in His work. Remember always the fact of the work He did in conne ction with the last adve nt, and remember likewise that in the turning of the cyclic wheel, in the evol ution of the spiral, similar c ondi tions will eventuate, the same needs arise, and the same egos incarnate that were present in the days of old in Palestine. The num bers of thos e associated with Him will be greatly increased, for all who kne w Him in earlier incarnations in th e ancient East, all whom He cured or taught , all who cont acted Him or in any way incurred karma with Him or with the Master Jesus, will have the oppor tuni ty to coope rate at this time. Each sincere aspirant who is closely conne cted with the present Chur ch o rganisations , who feels a close link with the Christ and who love s Him, can be practically sure that in Palestine they saw Him, kne w Him and mayha p served and love d Him. The sacraments, prope rly unde rstood, serve to strengt hen this link and realisation, a nd such a one as that of Baptism (when entered upon with unde rstandi ng) will draw forth oft a respons e from the Great Lord Himself. It is almost as if a gol den strand were directed from His heart to the heart of the servant — a strand unbr eakable and unf atho mable and which, with each adm inistration of any of the hol y rites in the succession of lives, becom es stronger, broader and bright er. Eventually these many strands will becom e reabsorbed into their sour ce when the Body of the Christ — one of the seven Heave nly Men on the second or mona dic plane — is com pleted in full expr ession, for each one linke d to Him becom es, in a vital sense, a cell in His Body . This the initiate Paul truly sensed and kne w. Via this strand passes the pow er to strengt hen, to stimulate, to vivify and to bless, and this is the true apos tolic"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST succession. All true disciples are priests unt o the Lord. There is no que stion therefore that the work to be done in familiarising the general publ ic with the nature of the Mysteries is of paramount imp ortance at this time. These Mysteries will be restored to out er expr ession through the medium of the Chur ch and the Masoni c Fraternity, if thos e groups leave off being organisations with material pur pos e, and becom e organisms with living obj ectives. When t he Great One com es with His disciples and initiates we shall have (after a period of intensive work on the phys ical plane beginni ng around the year 1940 ) the restoration of the Mysteries and their exot eric presentation, as a cons eque nce of the first initia tion. Why can this be so? Because the Christ, as you know , is the Hieropha nt of the first and second initiations and He will, if the preparatory work is faithfully and well done , adm inister the first initiation in the inne r sanctuaries of thos e two bodi es. Many faithful workers will, dur ing His period of work on earth, take this first initiation, and som e few will take the second. The race has now reached a point where many soul s are on the Proba tiona ry Path and need but the height ening of their vibration (made pos sible by His Presence) to reach the por tal of the Path itself. And now what is it that you all can do? What is the condi tion surroundi ng the aspirants of the world toda y? We have a world full of unr est, a world full of pain, sorrow and strife, a world in which the emotiona l bodi es of humanity are in a condi tion of tremendous disturbance, a world in which animals, men, wom en and children suffer, agoni se and die; a world in which hunge r, sin, sickne ss, famine, rapine, and murder stalk una r rested; a world in which the forms of religion exist but the life has gone , in which science is prostituted to the ends of mone y and hate, and in which the produc e of the earth is not for the sustenance of the race but for the nour ishing of the pur ses of t he few; a world in which faith is oft the subj ect of scoffing, in which uns elfishne ss is regarded as the attribut e of a fool , and in which love is expl oited in its low est expr ession, sex. Is this the atmosphe re in which the Christ and His disciples can bre athe? Is this a condi tion in which They can find harmoni ous influences? Is this a state of affairs in which They can work and live? Are the vibrations extant upon this planet similar to Theirs and to which They can respond? We know that it is not so and th at much must be done to facilitate Their work. What then can we do? First, teach the law of evol ution and its inevitable corollary, perfected men. Men must be taught that such Great Soul s exist, and exist entirely to serve Their fellow men. The publ ic must be familiarised with Their names and attributes, with Their work and pur pos e, and men must be told that They are com ing forth for the salvation of the world. Secondl y, disciples and aspirants must on every hand live harmoni ous ly and love . The violent vibrations of our surroundi ngs must be stilled by a strong count er vibration of love , remembering ever that as we work on the side of evol ution, the pow er of the Godhe ad itself is with us, available for use. Naught can withstand the steady pressure s of love and harmony when they are appl ied long enough . It is not spasmodi c efforts that count . It is the long - sustained, unva rying pressure which eventually breaks dow n oppos ition and the walls of separativeness. Thirdly, esoteric organisations must sta nd for all that tends to uni ty. All type s of work, all the exterior efforts of the many organisations must meet with lovi ng coope ration and assistance. We stand in a world of ende avour as focal points for love . Our objective is the helping of the Great One s and the rende ring to Them of that intelligent assistance which will make Their plans for hum anity materialise. Through us, They choos e to work for the upl ift of the world, and through the esoteric groups there must be the put ting forth of that intensifie d spiritual effort which will stem the tide of evil and avert the"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST pos sible difficulties that lurk in the darkne ss of the present chaos. The living organism of aspirants and disciples can provi de a centre of peace, pow er and love , of practical help and spir itual upl ift such as the world has not hitherto seen. Such is the hope . See you do it. Definite work must also be done in healing, in exorcising, in curing mental and astral diseases, and it must be demons trated to the world that the ancient pow er to heal still lies in the hands of thos e who cons istently follow the Christ. Thos e who use this pow er onl y for the sake of the little one s, taking and seeking no persona l reward, can manifest the ancient way to heal which has small resemblance to the mode rn metho ds of the mental school s. Preparation too must be given to the developi ng of the highe r psychic pow ers, and through the trained expr ession of thos e pow ers can proof be given to the scientists of the world of the latent forces in man which can be utilised by thos e who wisely and sanely follow in the foot steps of the Christ, the greatest Psychic of all time. Hospitals and school s will appear unde r the direct gui dance of the Masters; Teachers Who can heal will com e forth, and others will appe ar who will train the minds of the pupi ls to be respons ive to direct inspiration from above . The faculty of the intuition must be develope d scientifically. Finally, Chur ch members and members of the Masoni c Fraternities must familiarise themselves with the inne r signi ficance of the various rites, ceremonies, colour s and rituals, and with the work performed upon the floor of the temple. They must know why such and such things are done in due order and the reason for the various precedences, the words, gestures an d acts. Shoul d there be a real and true respons e to these practical sugge stions , it may be pos sible for the work to go forward more rapidly than at present seems pos sible. Much troubl e and stress may be averted if the aspirants of the world measure up to their proffered oppor tuni ty and make due sacrifice and effort. Much preliminary work has to be done . There must be much heavy work, ploughi ng the soil and weeding out that which is unde sirable. This may take seven years. The work to be done in that period will be silent educ ationa l work, and the diligent propa ganda that the Chur ch and analogous organisations can do. Classes must be held by the occultists of the world in which the teaching is steppe d dow n to meet the need of the little one s; the broad platf orm upon which the Chur ch shoul d stand shoul d be proclaimed, and instruction shoul d be given in the meaning of its ceremoni es and teachings. Then will follow seven years of germination of the seed sow n, a period of grow th and developi ng influences. This br ings us to the period of thirteen years from now for the cycle of four teen began the year before I proffered you these sugge stions . Shoul d the work progress as desired, it may mark the time of the near appe aring of the Great Lord and the close sound of His feet. These Servers who watch on the inne r side, the disciples and initiates enga ged in this work, watch with lovi ng care all who struggl e in the thick of the fray. They are like the Headqua rters Staff who follow the battle from a secure emine nce. In Their security lies your ultimate success, for They hol d in Their hands the solution of many probl ems, and appl y the solution when the battle goe s cont rary. One thing always I appe al to you to remember, for it is of vital impor tance. It is the fact that in the destruction of the form lies hid the secret of all evol utiona ry growth. This is not a truism. You can see it in cons tant expr ession. The Masters utilise the form (a form of Chur ch organisation, a Masoni c Fraternity, an esoteric group) as much as may be. They seek to work through it, imprisoni ng the life within the cont aining walls for just as long as the pur pos e is served and the race is instructed through that form."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Then com es the time when the form may no longe r serve the intent, when the str ucture atrophi es, crystallises, and becom es vul nerable and easily destroye d. So it goe s, and a new form takes its place. Watch and see if this is not ever so. In the infancy of the race the forms for long endur ed. Evol ution move d more slow ly. But now on th is upw ard trend the form has but shor t duration. It lives vitally for but a brief period; with rapidity it move s through its cycle; with rapidity it disintegrates and is succeeded by anot her. This rapidity will increase and not decrease as the cons cious nes s, or inne r expa ndi ng realised life of the race, vibrates to a more rapid rate of rhyt hm . This will be tremendous ly increased dur ing the vital and unus ual cycle upon which we entered in 191 8, which will be tremendous ly speeded up in 1925 , and will climax in a peculiar sense in 1934 . We shall then enter upon three years of excessive ende avour in an effort to hasten the Com ing and to prepare manki nd for the great day of oppor tunity. You who know of these times and can interpret them aright in the light of th e illumined intuition, must uni te together for the rende ring of Service and for the helping of the Brotherhood , of which the Christ is the divine Leader, and of which the Masters, the initiates, disciples and aspirants are the working and living organism o n the phys ical plane. THE EXTERNALISATION OF THE ASHRAMS Janua ry 1946 In these words I refer to an aspect of the amazing enterprise upon which the Hierarchy is embarked within this cycle: Its appe arance, expr ession and activity upon the ph ysical plane for the first time since it withdr ew into the subj ective side of life and focussed itself on the mental plane (instead of the phys ical) dur ing the days of ancient Atlantis and after the war between the Lords of the Shining Count enance and Lord s of the Dark Face, as The Secret Doctrine calls it. For millions of years, as a result of the trium ph of evil in thos e days, the Hierarchy has stood in silence behind world events, occupi ed with the follow ing work — a work which will eventually be carried o n exot erically instead of esoterically: 1. The Hierarchy stands as a wall between hum anity and excessive evil. Forget not that as hum anity is thus protected that protection extends to all the subhum an kingdom s, of which the fourth kingdom , the hum an, is t he Macrocosm. The excessive evil, emanating from cosmic sour ces, requi res the trained skill of the Hierarchy and the fiat of Shamballa to prevent it floodi ng ove r disastrous ly. 2. The Hierarchy works cons tantly at the task of awakening the cons cious ness a spect in all forms, so that it is awakened, expa nde d and intelligently employe d. 3. The Hierarchy directs world events, as far as manki nd will permit (for the free will and free decision of manki nd may not be ignor ed), so that the unfolding cons cious ness may expr ess itself through developi ng and adequa te social, pol itical, religious and econom ic world forms. They give direction; They throw a light ; They impress thos e who are in cont act with Them, and through the inflow of ideas and through revelation They definitely influence the tide of hum an affairs. 4. The Hierarchy directs and cont rols, more than is realised, the unfolding cyclic cultures and their"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST resultant civilisations . These can then provi de adequate forms, tempor arily useful for the eme rging soul of hum anity. The format of cultures and civilisations receives special attention. 5. The Hierarchy receives and transmits energies and cons eque nt forces from Shamballa, with resultant effects within the Hierarchy itself, and also with effects u pon hum anity and upon the soul of all things to be found in all kingdom s. 6. The Hierarchy receives that esoteric \"Fire of God\" which brings to an end cycles, ideologi es, organisations and civilisations when the due and right time com es. This They do in o rder to make place for that which is better and which will prove adequate and not limiting to the awakening cons cious ness and the emerging life. 7. The Hierarchy prepares men for initiation by: a. Receiving them into the Ashrams of the Masters. b. Offer ing Their disciples oppor tuni ty to serve in relation to the emerging Plan. c. Inaugur ating through the means of the disciples of the period thos e new presentations of the training needed for initiation. Each major cycle receives new forms of the same anci ent, yet basic, teaching. This present one is such a cycle, and much of my own work is in conne ction with this. All of these activities and func tions of the Hierarchy are well know n to many of you theoretically, and to som e at first hand — which is a good a nd useful thing to recogni se. These activities have all been carried on \"behind the veil\" and are, of cour se, onl y a very small part of the total work of the Hierarchy. Much of it woul d be entirely incom prehensible to you. How ever, if the disciples of this mode rn world, and the initiates, can measure up to their present and presented oppor tuni ty, it shoul d be pos sible for all of this not onl y to be carried forward in the full light of day, but with the coope ration and the unde rstandi ng acceptance of the int elligent peopl e everyw here, and also with the devot ed acqui escence (though blind acceptance) of the man in the street. Som ething of this, som ething of the new activities which will be brought to the attention of disciples in phys ical bodi es, so mething of the scope of the und ertaking of externalisation, som ething of what all of you can do to prepare the way for this major change, and som ething of the tremendous difficulties invol ved, I am seeking to conve y to you, if I can. One of the things now occupyi ng the attention of the Masters is the externalisation of their ashrams on the out er plane. This is preparatory to later envi sioned developm ents. If this can be done then other developm ents may be pos sible. An extension of the ashram is desired. It was with this in view that I inaugur ated a new activity in May 1941 and chos e so many of my disciples resident in New York. I also began to give out the teaching on the stages of discipleship ( Discipleship in the New Age, Vol. I, Section III) and sugge ste d that the group members meet toge ther for one full afternoon around the time of the full moon each mont h, and to do this in a quiet and unhur ried spirit. I desired that they spend the entire afternoon in conf erence, mutual unde rstandi ng, discussion of gro up probl ems as these affect group service, and — above all — make an attempt (through deep uni ted meditation and the pool ing of know ledge ) to appr oach closer to the Hierarchy. This woul d aid them to work toge ther as a group for world aiding and to do it toge th er . I asked them to study the relation which exists between a Master and His disciples."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST These groups , indi cated for externalisation, exist on the inne r side as part of one inne r Group; they must be externalised for service pur pos es. The fact that this ext ernalisation is pos sible indi cates certain developm ents which are the result of the past, of the unf oldm ent of hum anity's developi ng pow ers to recogni se Reality, of the invoc ative cry of the masses everyw here, plus the directed invoc ation of the spiritual peopl e of the world, and the effect of the world war (1914 - 1945 ). All these factors have wrought a great destruction in the materialistic world and have produc ed a very real expa nsion in the hum an cons cious ness; also, as one of the Masters, unkn ow n to you , remarked at a meeting of Members of the Hierarchy a few weeks ago, \"One of the gates is ope n; thos e who are ready can com e in, but we now can go through it also, and can go to them in a new sense and more directly. May Shamballa help us.\" It i s realised by all in the Hierarchy that the major test conne cted with a highe r initiation conf ront s Them. Disciples shoul d attempt to realise the tremendous sacrifice invol ved in this out ward move of the Hierarchy into secular existence. The highe r the sta te of initiation, the harder it will be for the initiate conc erned. It is, for instance, less of an effort for me to cont act you than it woul d be for som e of the Choha ns, such as the Masters M. and K.H. I am nearer to you, because I am still utilising the same phys ical body in which I took the fifth initiation, nearly ninety years ago. Choha ns have taken a still highe r initiation and are focal poi nts of pow erful Ashrams; Their task of adjustment is very much harder. Their invoc ative appe al to the Lord of th e World in His Counc il Chamber at Shamballa has been mount ing for som e time. It has been called \"The Appe al for Alignm ent\" because the Members of the Hierarchy feel and know that this great return to Earth which has been arrange d for the Hierarchy after so long an absence, will call for a fuller expr ession of the spiritual will than even They realise; They know that it will requi re the coope ration of Shamballa as well as the coope ration of hum anity. What I have to say about the externalisation of the Hiera rchy and its Ashrams coul d well be divided for the sake of clarity into the follow ing poi nts which will form the basis of the instruction. We shall attempt to follow this outline. Hierarchical Adjustment and Alignm ent: Within Itself. In conne ction with the Counc il Chamber of Sanat Kum ara. Little can be said about this. In relation with hum anity. You will not e that this involves the three planetary centres. Hierarchical preparation at the Wesak Festival. The Mode of Approach tow ards Externalisa tion. Steps in the externalisation process. Appr oach via certain Ashrams. In the cons cious ness of the disciple in phys ical expression. Through dissemination of information of a preparatory nature. The Externalisation itself. This invo lves: The Return of t he Christ. The Ashrams conc erned at the Com ing. The organisation of the implicated Ashrams into due form on earth. The externalisation of the Ashrams."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Adjustment of the Ashrams and the Masters to exoteric living. It will invol ve also adjustment by discipl es and aspirants to the increased stimulation, and the enunc iation of certain basic statements. The Work of the Externalised Ashrams. Creating and vitalising the new world religion. The gradua l reorganising of the social order. The publ ic inaugu ration of the system of initiation. The exot eric training of disciples and of hum anity in this new cycle. We can begin on our first poi nt, but onl y thos e stude nts who are an integral part of the Hierarchy and in active com muni cation with som e Ashram can profit in a ny measure by information on this subj ect. For example, thos e of you who are affiliated with my Ashram (or that of anot her of the Masters), and goi ng through your preliminary training and func tioni ng on the periphe ry of the hierarchical centre can get a ge neral idea and develop (if you attempt to do so) an intuitive perception of the propos ed hierarchical integrity and future func tioni ng. Resent not my words \"func tioni ng on the periphe ry,\" for they indi cate great oppor tuni ty for service. The Mas ters need many such as you on the out skirts of Their Ashrams, to aid in hierarchical ende avour , because you can reach the general publ ic more easily than They can do, and you can step dow n the teaching far more adequa tely than coul d more adva nced disciples . You and disciples like you are a definite part of the Hierarchy; as you func tion in an Ashram you have a most useful place, and I woul d beg you to have this ever in mind. I will, therefore, give you whatever information I can and which is permissible, bu t shall of necessity have to leave much uns aid. Hierarchical Adjustment and Alignm ent What do I mean by the use of the word \"adjustment\" in conne ction with the Hierarchy? Adjustment to karma, to the persona lity, to the soul , to circum stances in the thre e worlds, to the impact of astral forces, or to the thought currents of thos e not oriented to the Kingdo m of God, doe s not cons titute part of the training of Thos e Who are beyond the third degree of initiation. Initiates on and beyond that level have trans cende d reaction along these lines, whilst thos e below the third initiation are in process of rapid adjustment. I use the word `adjustment' here definitely in the sense of reorientation , and in this sense much can be not ed. For aeons and for count less cycl es, the Hierarchy has func tione d withdr awn into a silence on the higher levels of the mental plane and on the buddhi c levels where cont act has had to be made with Them by thos e disciples who have, by discipline, developm ent and service, fitted themselves t o establish such a relations hip. This reorientation and emergence into phys ical plane publ icity is goi ng to demand much from the Members of the Hierarchy. Just as it has not been easy for me to establish and retain cont act with you, even when you have esta blished the right to such a cont act, so — for Them — it is goi ng to be still more difficult to be in touc h with thos e who are not even disciples. For aeons and for cycles, the Members of the Hierarchy have been subm itting Themselves to the needed t raining in order to react correctly when fuller cont act has been established by Shamballa with the Hierarchy. I woul d have you not e the phrasing here. That cont act has now been established as a"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST result of the inflow of certain extra - planetary forces and by an \"act of determined direction, \" emanating from the Counc il Chamber of the Lord of the World. Misunde rstand me not . The Hierarchy has always been in touc h with the \"Place of Purpos e\" (as it has been called) through the medium of its Choha ns and its senior Directors, such as the Christ, the Manu and the Lord of Civilisation. These great Beings have steadily revealed this pur pos e to the Members of the Hierarchy so that They have been able to grasp and work out the emerging Plan. But even to the Masters the S hamballa force has had to be steppe d dow n, just as the force of the Hierarchy requi res modi fying for the average disciple and aspirant, if they are to respond cons tructively to it. Toda y, how ever, things are som ewhat change d. New inflow ing energies and th e partial \"sealing\" of evil in its ow n place (a sealing which will be progressively effective) have made a closer relations hip pos sible. The Masters are som ewhat freer from certain of the arduous labour s of the past cycles. Som e of the available inflow ing Shamballa forces are being absorbed directly by hum anity and by certain of the subhum an kingdom s, particularly the mineral kingdom . This latter absorption will lead eventually, when com plete, to thos e vol canic episode s and those basic earthqua kes which wil l change the face of the earth by the time the sixth root race com es into manifestation. It is this direct inflow to the kingdo ms func tioni ng exot erically in the three worlds which has relieved and will to som e extent relieve the otherwise ove rpow ering pres sure upon the Hierarchy, and will also act as a great aligni ng antahka rana between the three planetary centres. It is to this alignm ent I refer in this instruction — the alignm ent of the three centres upon this planet and the adjustments that this necessitates and inevitably enforces. For the sake of hum anity in the first place, and seconda rily for the developm ent of the subhum an kingdom s, the Hierarchy has made certain difficult adjustments and alignm ents between the planetary centres, and these have been com pul sory in their effects. Therefore, bear in mind that the adjustments which the Hierarchy may impos e upon itself bear small resemblance to the adjustments which you have to make in relation to your persona lity life. They are all hallmarked by the idea of service to the whol e. The Hierarchy in its true sense has no persona lity through which to expr ess itself, and this greatly com plicates the probl ems which have to be faced as it cont emplates exot eric manifestation and work. Adjustments and Al ignm ents within the Hierarchy What, in the last analysis, is this Hierarchy? It is a great salvaging corps of dedicated, liberated Units of Life, working in group formation with all forms and lives in all kingdom s and with all soul s particularly. As the H ierarchy so works, its empha sis is solely on the cons cious ness aspect of all forms; its present agency of salvage and of service is the mind, as it expr esses itself through the minds of all hum anitarians, all aspirants, all disciples (of all rays and degre es) and of all initiates; the Hierarchy also can expr ess itself through the medium of thought currents and ideas and through them impos e its hierarchical conc epts upon the embryon ic minds of the general and average publ ic; and it also directs the educ ation al work of all nations , so that the und evelope d masses can becom e — in due turn — the intelligent general publ ic. The Hierarchy works, as you know , in or through three major departments, each pos sessing its full Personne l, and unde r three Great Lords. I have dealt with this in som e detail in Initiation, Hum an and Sol ar, as well as elsewhere in my writings ; more information at this poi nt is needless and of no real service to you. The Hierarchy works also through the seven major Ashrams and their aff iliated Ashrams, and these"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST \"seven which are the forty - nine\" represent in their totality the seven rays with their subr ays, and are the custodi ans, transmitters and distribut ors of the seven ray energies to the seven planetary centres and — via these seven ce ntres — to thos e in the fourth kingdom in nature (as they gradua lly unfold ove r the aeons ) and then, via these, to the seven centres in indi vidua l man. Such is the synt hesis. The seven major centres or Ashrams within the Hierarchy are each presided ove r by Masters of Choh an rank; the seven subs idiary centres or Ashrams are presided ove r by Masters and Adepts (of the fifth and four th initiations ), aided by initiates of the third degree and certain picked and senior disciples. Several of the seven affiliated A shrams are, as yet, incom plete as regards personne l, but vacancies are rapidly being filled as the spiritual effects of the world war (1914 - 1945 ) make themselves felt. These effects are very real and have been a sour ce of great encouragement to hierarchica l workers. Before the Hierarchy can emerge (as is the intention), the relation between a major Ashram and its subs idiary Ashrams must be firmly established, whilst that between a major Ashram and other major Ashrams has to be brought more definitely and u nque stiona bly closer to Shamballa, and unde r the influence of that great first ray centre. The energy which will align and adjust the subs idiary forty - nine Ashrams is that of the second Ray of Love - Wisdom . That, how ever, which will bring about a similar ad justing and aligni ng impetus in the seven major Ashrams is the energy of the first Ray of Will or Pow er. I have here given you a most important item of occult information, but one which is of no impor tance to you indi vidua lly; it serves, how ever, to presen t proof of the signi ficant occult relation between the three planetary centres. Just as the third planetary centre, Hum anity, has now reached a poi nt of intelligent developm ent so that a closer rappor t can be set up between it and the Hierarchy, so the Hierarchy also has move d forward as a uni t so that a closer correspondi ng rappor t can also be set up between It and Shamballa. Just as the rappor t between the Hierarchy and Hum anity is established via aspirants, disciples and initiates in phys ical existence who are respondi ng to the love - wisdom of the uni verse in som e measure and who work via the intelligent peopl e in incarnation primarily, so rappor t between Shamballa and the Hierarchy is being more closely established via the senior Ashrams, and n ot via the seconda ry one s. You have, therefore, a situation which might be depicted som ewhat as follow s: I. First Planetary Centre ---------------------- Shamballa working through 1. The seven Rays or the seven Spirits before the Throne . 2. Certain great I ntermediaries. 3. The Counc il Chamber of the Lord of the World. II. Second Planetary Centre ------------------- Hierarchy working through 1. The seven major Choha ns and Their Ashrams. 2. The forty - nine Masters of the seconda ry Ashrams. 3. The sum tot al of the seconda ry Ashrams. III. Third Planetary Centre --------------------- Hum anity working through 1. Disciples in manifestation — of the seven ray types. 2. The New Group of World Servers. 3. The sum total of humanitarians, educ ators and men of good will. "},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST This is but a rough picture and one which is not totally correct; it will, how ever, show you certain direct lines of cont act and of relations hip which are true and which will suffice to give you a vague and general idea of the new alignm e nt being set up between the three major planetary centres, requi ring new adjustments. At this particular time, the empha sis of the needed alignm ents and adjustments with which the Hierarchy is faced is being placed upon activity within the Hierarchy Itsel f. The seconda ry Ashrams are being stimulated; new one s are being gradua lly formed, for there are not as yet forty - nine minor Ashrams; vacancies in the major Ashrams are being filled as rapidly as pos sible from the ranks of those working in minor Ashrams a nd the places of these latter are being taken by accepted disciples who are being fitted for this work through expe rience, difficulties and the tension of world service. All these change s necessitate much adjustment. The interior work of hierarchical align ment is in the charge of the Choha ns of the Major Ashrams, whilst the task of supe rintendi ng the interior adjustments incident to new alignm ents and the adm ission of new personne l is being watched ove r and directed by the forty - nine Masters who are in char ge of minor Ashrams — either Ashrams with what is regarded as a full com plement of workers, or Ashrams in process of attaining that full com plement, or embryoni c Ashrams of which there are already quite a few. One of the results of this hierarchical alignm e nt and adjustment will be the establishm ent, for the first time, of a fluid interplay and move ment between the three planetary centres. Choha ns are toda y passing out of the Hierarchy into the Counc il Chamber of the Lord of the World, or on to one or other of the Seven Paths; senior Masters in charge of Ashrams are taking highe r grades of initiation and taking the rank of Choha ns; initiates above the third degree are rapidly taking the four th and fifth initiations and becom ing Masters (taking bot h initiation s in one life), and their places are being taken by lesser initiates; these, in their turn, have been training disciples to take their places, unt il in this process of subs titution and replacement we arrive at the door which sym bol ically stands between hum anity and the Hierarchy, and toda y stands wide ope n, so that accepted disciples are taking initiation, pledge d disciples are being accepted, and accepting disciples are taking their pledge s. Thus a great and new move ment is proceeding and a tre mendous ly increased interplay and interaction is taking place. This will go on unt il A.D. 2025. During the years intervening between now and then very great change s will be seen taking place, and at the great General Assembly of the Hierarchy — held as usual every century — in 2025 the date in all probability will be set for the first stage of the externalisation of the Hierarchy. The present cycle (from now unt il that date) is called techni cally \"The Stage of the Forerunne r\". It is preparatory in nature, testi ng in its methods , and intende d to be revelatory in its techni que s and results. You can see therefore that Choha ns, Masters, initiates, world disciples, disciples and aspirants affiliated with the Hierarchy are all at this time passing through a cycle of g reat activity. In the adjustment necessitated by the rapidly adva ncing alignm ent, the Members of the Hierarchy are fitting Themselves for the obj ective work of pub lic expr ession. This entails far more difficulty than you might imagine or anticipate, becau se it entails the developm ent of that form of \"resistance to the pul l of the low er vibration\" of which you can know not hing, for that low er vibration is a necessary aspect of your nor mal expr ession — little as you may like to realise this. You need to realis e that there is not hing in the Masters or highe r initiates which can respond to any vibration of this nature. Though They cannot absorb it or react to it or redevelop it again, it can cause Them the acutest discom fort and pain; that is the reason why the S on of God was called in The Old Testament a \"man of sorrow s and acqua inted with grief\". This did not in reality refer to His sufferings for poo r miserable humanity (as"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST orthodox theology so selfishly interprets it) but to the fact that He had to subm it Hims elf to cont act with hum anity. The Hierarchy is therefore, along all lines (many of which I may not indi cate or upon which I may not enlarge), preparing Itself for the expe rience of phys ical manifestation; It is also ende avour ing to \"create\" the needed resp ons ive appa ratus which will be of such a nature that Members of the Hierarchy may func tion with the minimum of difficulty on earth and will expe rience the least pos sible measure of handi cap; They will thus be enabled to give full time and attent ion to the work to be done by Them in phys ical manifestation. They are ende avour ing also to establish a closer telepathic rappor t and a more intimate (though strictly impersona l) relations hip with Their disciples on all rays, so that there can be a free i nterplay of thoug ht and a cons eque nt better hierarchical integrity and one which — no matter what may happe n in the three worlds — cannot be disrupt ed or in any way lessened. Although for Them no astral plane exists and glamour is entirely non - existent, They have to learn to do a most peculiar thing: to work on the astral plane (because it exists for hum anity and for the animal kingdom ), to traverse this region of glamour and then to \"demons trate light in dissipating fog\" in a manne r for which there has hither to been no call. None of this information may make much sense to you, but I am simply seeking to go on record for the sake of thos e who will com e after you . There is little more that I may give you anent adjustment and alignm ent within the Hierarchy. It is rapidly proceeding, and just in so far as disciples demons trate upon the out er phys ical plane and in the three worlds their affiliation with an Ashram will they share in this dua l process. Are you prepared for this? In Conne ction with the Counc il Cham be r of Sanat Kum ara, the Lord of the World As this subj ect conc erns one of the seven goa ls tow ards which the Masters aim after They have attained the fifth initiation, it will be obvi ous to you that there is little that I can say about it. One of the seven Paths for which the Way of the Highe r Evol ution prepares the senior initiates is the Path of Earth Service. This Path, as you know , keeps the Masters attached to service in the three worlds for a period much longe r than the average. It invol ves tremendous sacrifice. Just as the disciple has to live a dua l life, with one part of his reflective nature and awareness centred in the life of the Hierarchy and the other part of his mental respons iveness equa lly centred on life in the three worlds, and t his simultaneous ly, so the Master, when He choos es this Path, forms a cons tituent part of the Counc il Chamber of the Lord of the World and at the same time works cons cious ly in the three worlds, via the Hierarchy (of which He remains also a part), and with the hum an and subhum an kingdom s in nature. As evol ution proceeds, He will work increasingl y via hum anity because hum anity will be shoul dering its respons ibilities as the Macrocosm of the lesser microcosm. This dual activity entails much specialised traini ng, and as the initiatory process becom es exot eric and men everyw here recogni se it and participate in it, the training which Members of the Hierarchy also unde rgo will not be so secret and mysterious as it is toda y. But the time has not yet com e to publ ici se it. Only certain further generalisations are here pos sible, som e of which are already know n to you because they are so broad that their inclusions and implications are obvi ous . This, for instance, conc erns the \"centre where the Will of God is know n\". H ere at Shamballa work Thos e Who have uni fied Their persona lity will and Their spiritual will with the universal will, and such a uni fication inevitably brings know ledge . It is, how ever, not know ledge as you unde rstand it. It is a blend of wisdom based on k now ledge , unde rstandi ng based on intuitive perception, and identification based on alignm ent, esoterically com prehende d. For this peculiar condi tion or awareness we have no word in any langua ge,"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST and onl y the utilisation (the trained utilisation) of the abs tract mind can pos sibly conve y to you even an embryoni c factual conc eption. But that type of imaginative conc eption will becom e more com mon dur ing the next two centuries, and my words here will therefore serve an ultimate pur pos e. Thos e Who form the Counc i l Chamber of the Great Lord are unde r no misappr ehension as to His will because They see it whol e . Paul, the initiate, hints at this when writing one of the Epistles; he is in touc h then with certain Members of the Hierarchy and is conc erned wit h the theme of Love , which is the funda mental hierarchical theme and motive. He says to Them: \"Now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face; now we know in part, but then shall we know even as we are know n.\" He there points tow ards the future p rogress of the Hierarchy — a progress which remains as yet onl y a vague promise, lacking form and shape. But he wrote for initiates to whom love was a grow ing, vital conc ern, and to whom love and its practice meant light and the basic motif of all living, di vine activity. It is not pos sible to reveal the will of God and the motivating Purpos e of His manifesting Self, except to Thos e Who have demons trated perfected love and Who register no sense of disuni on or the faintest reaction to separateness. At Shambal la, the Great Lives Who func tion there not onl y see manifestation whol e and apart from all the limitations of time, but They feel all the major evol utiona ry impul ses which are bringi ng the developi ng world into line with the divine Will. They embody thos e impul ses not in terms of progr essive move ment, but in terms of one great divine and spiritual reaction. This idea can perhaps be best unde rstood by you in terms of the Eternal AUM which is the sym bol of the Eternal NOW. You have been told, and it has been demons trated, that the AUM is com pos ed of one major Sound , three minor sounds , and seven subs idiary vibratory tone s. So it is with the Will of God which is embodi ed and held in synt hesis by the Members of the Coun cil Chamber. To Them, as They \"hol d the Wil l of God in solution, it is one clear not e; as They see that Will in motion, it is three abiding chor ds, carrying out wards into all the worlds the Purpos e of the ONE Who for aeons will abide; as They impel that Will to demons trate, it is seven vibratory to nes, drawing out into the reflected worlds the structure of the Plan. And thus the not e, the chords and tone produ ce the Plan, reveal the Purpos e and indi cate God's Will.\" This is a quot ation from certain of the ancient Archives which cons titute the study of the Masters; they relate to the nature of Shamballa, its work and emanating energies. Shamballa, as it cons titutes the synt hesis of unde rstandi ng where our Earth is conc erned, is also the centre where the highe st Will of the Solar Logos is i mpos ed upon the Will of our planetary Logos , Who is, as you know , onl y a centre in His greater body of manifestation. With this item of information you can have no pos sible conc ern; the Masters Themselves are onl y learning the Will of the planetary Logos ; the obj ective of effort in Shamballa is, how ever, the apprehension of solar Purpos e, the Plan of which is working out on the highe st levels of our planetary system, just as the Will, Purpos e and Plan of Shamballa work out on the three low est levels of our planetary system. Again, this item of information serves onl y to indi cate hierarchical obj ectives, and thos e obj ectives extend away from time and space into the Mind of God Himself. There are certain synonym s which here may serve to develop your synt hetic thinki ng and so bring in a definite measure of enlight enm ent.

All I can say is that synt hesis is , whilst uni ty is achieved and is the reward of action and effort. As y ou progr ess upon the Path of Initiation the meaning of uni ty clarifies. As you direct your self tow ards the Way of the Highe r Evol ution synt hesis emerges. More than that it woul d be useless for me to say. This probl em of the appa rently impenetrable darknes s of intention as grasped by Shamballa, of meaning, of inscrutability, of a spiritual imperviousness which hol ds , in spite of all fluctuations in the three worlds of hum an evol ution and the remaining two of supe rhum an unf oldment, provi des a situation to wh ich the Hierarchy has to make adjustment through alignm ent. You are, in your small way, making you r adjustment to the Hierarchy through a steady cons truction of the antahka rana, and in so doi ng are aiding in the cons truction of the antahkarana which uni tes Hum anity and the Hierarchy — the first few strands of which were established through the sacrifices of certain of the Sons of God when the Hierarchy was founde d on Earth. Toda y, the Hierarchy is working at the establishing of the linki ng strands between Its elf and Shamballa, and good progr ess has already been made. It might be said here that for the past seven hundr ed years the chain of Hierarchy has been com plete; by this I mean that the planetary rainbow bridge uni ting the three major centres has existed. The task ahead of all these three major centres, working in alignm ent through adjustment, is to strengt hen and beautify (if I may so express it), to electrify this bridge , thus produc ing full planetary intercom munication between the three centres and the f our minor centres, so that \"the weight of the Will of God, the mom entum of the Purpos e of Sanat Kum ara and the Plan of His Representatives may progr ess uni mpeded from poi nt to poi nt, from sphe re to sphe re and from glory to glory.\" It is this com plete esta blishm ent of relations hip between Shamballa, the Hierarchy and Hum anity which brought about the planetary crisis through which the world has just passed and, from som e standpoi nts, is still passing. Shamballa, as I have told you, can now reach H um anity, the third major centre, directly, and therefore has two poi nts of planetary cont act: the first, via the Hierarchy, as has been for long the case, and secondl y, in a straight line, carrying energy direct to Hum anity, without any transmission and co nseque nt modi fying of impact, as has also been the case hitherto. When this direct line of spiritual, dyna mic, electrical energy made its first impact on earth (after the Great Counc il held in 1825) , it first of all awakened men's thinki ng in a new and com prehensive way, produc ing the great ideologi es; it arous ed their massed desire, and registered obs truction on the phys ical plane. It found its cour se impeded and discove red it was faced with barriers. This energy from Shamballa, being an aspect of the ray of the destroye r, proceeded to \"bur n up\" in the fires of destruction, all such hindr ances upon the planes in the three worlds. This was the deeply esoteric and unr ecogni sed cause of the war — the beneficent bringi ng to an end of the impediments to the free f low of spiritual energy dow n into the third centre; this was the factor which called \"evil from its hidde n place\" and brought the oppos ing forces to the surface of existence, prior to their \"sealing\" . To the extent that this was so, manki nd in the World Wa r (1914 - 1945 ) was the unha ppy victim of spiritual circum stance; how ever, from the angl e of man's"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST historical past, hum anity was the engi neer of its own fate; but it took bot h the esoteric activity of Shamballa and the exot eric activity of hum anity over a mi llenni a of years to precipitate the condi tions which made this new alignm ent pos sible and brought about the sealing (still being carried slow ly forward), and plunge d manki nd into the vor tex of war. This impelling dow npour ing energy from the highe st centre penetrated not only to the heart of hum anity, but into the very depths of the mineral kingdom , implicating also the animal and the vegetable expr essions of divine life. Because of this direct impact between Shamballa and Hum anity, by - passing the Hierarchy , the Hierarchy was left free for the work of rehabilitation and salvaging, for recons truction and for the appl ication of the regenerative forces of resurrection. The Hierarchy needed and welcom ed this interlude and recogni sed it as an essentia l aspect of the Plan. The \"cycle of Shamballa impact\" is now ove r; the appe al of hum anity to the Christ and His Hierarchy has again refocussed the energy of Shamballa via the Hierarchy, and the direct work of the Hierarchy with Hum anity can again take on fresh meaning, can be re - established on new and som ewhat different lines, and thus definitely bring in that \"new heaven and new earth\" for which men have so long waited. This will take time, but the new energies and their emerging qua lities are adequa te to the task, and will alleviate much and bring about great change s in due cour se of time. You will note, therefore, that the Hierarchy has been faced with three adjustments as the result of being deliberately \"put out of alignm ent,\" though onl y tempor arily, with bot h Shamballa and Hum anity. This was sym bol ised for us at the Crucifixion when the Saviour hung penda nt between heaven and earth. These adjustments are: 1. Adjustment to thos e extra - planetary energies which were released into the highe st centre. Thi s was made pos sible by two factors: a. The direct impact between Shamballa and Hum anity or between will and intelligence. This is an impor tant poi nt to recogni se. b. The tempor ary qui escence of the love principle, as the Hierarchy waited for the results and effects of this direct impact upon the earth. This was effectively carried out with much destruction in the world of forms. 2. Adjustment to certain basic change s within the Hierarchy Itself in preparation for the process of externalisation which was begun this century. 3. Adjustment to a disciplined and reoriented humanity, working toda y in the dark, it is needless to say, gropi ng along unknow n ways, appe aling to the Hierarchy for more light and unde rstandi ng, but awakened and alert for c hange s. These adjustments are proceeding with rapidity; the techni que being employe d is realignm ent, throug h a definite action of the Will, as far as Shamballa is conc erned, and by an out pour ing of Love , as far as hum anity is conc erned. This Act of the Wi ll is carried out by the three Heads of Departments in the Hierarchy, unde r the gui dance of the Christ and by the Choha ns of the seven major Ashrams. They cons titute a group of ten to Whom this task has been com mitted, for the reason that They are the onl y Members of the Hierarchy Who pos sess the needed qua lifications and in Whom the Will aspect is adequa tely develope d. The task of pou ring out the Love principle in a new and dyna mic manne r is being carried out by all the Masters and by all initiates who hav e taken the third initiation. This stream"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST of love will focus itself each com ing Full Moon in a special act or demons tration of love . You will not e also how fully occupi ed the Hierarchy is with work, preparatory to emergence, and with thos e plans and activ ities which will lead to renewed interior activity, based not on lack of previous uni ty and integrity, but on the absorption of new energies, made available via Shamballa, of these extra - planetary forces to which I have earlier referred. This task of reorg anisation prior to movi ng out ward, will be com pleted by May, 1946 . Then the task of the new alignm ent with hum anity will be started and the great work unde rtaken which will proceed for several hund red years. In Relation with Hum ani ty I shall not deal he re with the work to be done in centuries to com e in and through hum anity, which is the goa l of all these adjustments — at least as far as your present interest is conc erned. I shall touc h onl y upon the activities of the Hierarchy as it establishes — on a more pow erful basis — a more direct cont act with manki nd. Since 1925 the Hierarchy has directed Its thought s to men, but It has not vitalised, as It will eventually do, the religious move ments or churches in all lands , or the educ ationa l work in all co unt ries, or any of the activities which are conc erned with the aiding of hum anity through welfare move ments. It was felt that it was necessary for manki nd to show the Hierarchy, as well as themselves, the nature of the impul ses tow ards love and selflessnes s which may have been already established, and to do this free of hierarchical prom pting and influence, and in this way demons trating that they pos sessed that which might be depende d upon as inna te and as present in a living, creative manne r. The demons tra tion has been good ; hum anity has show n creative love , of which goodw ill and hum anitarian efforts are the low est aspects. The show ing has been better than was anticipated, and this new and vital re - alignm ent between the Hierarchy and Hum anity becom es now be autifully pos sible and can be carried forward without dange r. The Hierarchy is now the Custodi an of far greater pow er than heretofore, on account of Its adjustment to Shamballa. This hierarchical readjustment to hum anity is being carried out at this time in the Ashrams by the setting up of magne tic centres which, through their directed activity, will influence hum anity in the com ing large scale process of reorientation. In studyi ng this, you must remember that these are not centres or conc entrations of for ces, but groups of disciples whos e qua lity is oriented tow ards manki nd and whos e pot ency of thought will act magne tically upon aspirants and hum anitarians and, through them and their goodw ill activities, will reach and impress men everyw here. The adjustmen t being at this time unde rtaken, therefore, is between hierarchical groups and groups of men and wom en upon earth; it is intende d, as you have been told, that Humanity itself will be the world - saviour , working with the aid of the Hierarchy — as yet invi sibly behind the scenes. When this interim work of salvage is accom plished, then the Hierarchy will externalise Itself. You can imagine the adjustments, therefore, goi ng on in all the Ashrams in preparation for all this and — though I touc h not upon i t — you can imagine the general effect of these inter - hierarchical adjustments and alignm ents upon disciples and aspirants upon the earth; they are the first, needless to say, who will respond to this activity. As all this is taking place in the present diff icult period of world rehabilitation, the immensity of the probl em invol ved and the qua lity of the tension are abnor mal. It is not easy for disciples toda y; of this the Hierarchy is well aware. This fact also invo lves for Them still anot her aspect of hiera rchical adjustment. They have — for the sake of the work to be done — to establish a closer alignm ent between the inne r Ashrams and the out er groups , between Themselves and Their senior disciples carrying the bur den of the outer world service; this alignm ent h as also to be"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST extende d between senior disciples and initiates and the workers on earth. The pur eness of the motives animating the Hierarchy will cons tantly emerge with greater clarity in your minds , as you attempt to unde rstand, even in a small measure, T heir probl ems. There are other probl ems of which you can know not hing — probl ems related to the new energies pour ing into our planet, impersona lly and dyna mically; probl ems of fresh tensions , incident to stronge r and new alignm ents; probl ems conc erned with h uman enlightenm ents and reactions in the face of the darkne ss which evil initiated; probl ems of increased personne l, disturbing the rhythm but necessitated by the demand for workers; probl ems conne cted with the grow th and training of the Members of the Hie rarchy upon the Way of the Highe r Evol ution; other probl ems incident to the planetary crisis, to the Initiation of the Lord of the World Himself, and to the amazing demons tration of the success of the evol utiona ry process up to the present time. This succe ss has been prove n by the alignm ent for direct interplay of the three major planetary centres — Shamballa, the Hierarchy and Hum anity. HIERARCHICAL PREPARATION AT THE WE SAK FESTIVAL April - May 1946 I have delayed writing my usual Wesak messag e until this late date because of a certain event in the Hierarchy which was maturing and which necessitated my entire attention. This event was conne cted with the Wesak Festival and invol ved among other matters the formation of a new Ashram in which the W isdom aspect woul d be of particular impor tance and not the Love aspect; this Ashram woul d also be related in a peculiar manne r to the Buddha . It had to be formed at this time in order to be the recipient, and then the custodi an, of certain \"endow ments\" whi ch the Buddha will bring at the time of the May Full Moon. The endow ments conc ern the will - to - good of the Lord of the World, the Ancient of Days, though they do not conc ern goodw ill as you unde rstand that phr ase. This Ashram, when dul y formed and establish ed, will enable the Members of the Hierarchy to respond to this aspect of the divine Purpos e — the Purpos e which as you know lies behind and implements the Plan; this Ashram, related to the Buddha , will be specifically unde r the close supe rvision of the Chri st, and also of the Lord of Civilisation — at this time the Master R. They are the onl y two Members of the Hierarchy able to register the divine Purpos e (in regard to its immediate obj ectives) in such a manne r that the entire Hierarchy can be informed and ca n then work uni tedly and intelligently at its implementation. More than this I may not tell you about this particular hierarchical move , affecting as it doe s bot h Shamballa and the Hierarchy. This Wesak Festival is of supr eme impor tance because it is the first Festival since the war ende d, because it takes place at a time when a definite orientation of the Hierarchy will take place, and because a fresh tide of spiritual impulse and directed second ray energy will flood the entire Hierarchy; the work, there fore, to be done by the Hierarchy will be far more effective. This you may anticipate and upon this you can count . But — as you may well have surmised — it is the Full Moon of June which is (this year) the season of prime and out standi ng impor tance ; it is in many ways easier for Western believers and esotericists to tune in and participate in the activities of the Hierarchy when closely conne cted with the Christ than it"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST is in thos e related to the Buddha . The main intention in these early stages of k eeping the Eastern Festival of Wesak is to familiarise the Western world with the fact of the presence of the Buddha and with His activities in conne ction with hum anity. Such great progress has, how ever, taken place in the spiritual developm ent of hum anity that the Buddha need no longe r cont inue with His task unl ess He so desires — and then onl y for a period of years, know n to Him and the Lord of the World. He coul d cease His annua l cont act with the Hierarchy at this time, if He so chos e, ow ing to the direct cont act now established between the Hierarchy and Shamballa. This, how ever, He doe s not immediately choos e to do. For a few decades longe r He will coope rate with the Christ in widening the channe l of cont act between Shamballa, the Hierarchy and Hum anity. A fter that, He will \"proceed to His Own place\" in the solar Hierarchy and will no longe r visit the Himalayas annua lly, as has been His custom for so many centuries. The Eastern Festival of Wesak (Vaisaka) and the Christian day of remembrance, Good Friday, w ill fade out of the cons cious ness of hum anity in due time; they are bot h festivals related to aspects of the first Ray of Pow er or Will. The abol ition of the fear of death and the establishm ent of a close relation of the Hierarchy with Shamballa will rende r obs olete these ancient ceremoni al rites. In this message I woul d like to cons ider with you primarily the Festival of the Christ, held at the time of the Full Moon of June , and the work of the Christ as He prepares Himself for the fulfilment of His true mission on Earth. The Christian Chur ch has so distorted that mission and ruthlessly perverted the intention for which He originally manifested that a cons ideration of that mission is deeply needed and shoul d be revol utiona ry in its effects. Starting with St. Paul, the theologians interpreted His words in such a manne r that they served to bridge the gap between the spiritual future of the world and the Jewish dispensation which shoul d have been passing out . So effective has been their work that th e teachings of the lovi ng, simple Son of God have been largely ignor ed; the failure of Christianity can be traced to its Jewish backgr ound (empha sised by St. Paul), which made it full of propa ganda instead of lovi ng action, which taught the blood sacrifice instead of lovi ng service, and which empha sised the existence of a wrathful God, needing to be placated by death, and which embodi ed the threats of the Old Testament Jehova h in the Christian teaching of hell fire. This situation is one which the Christ i s seeking to alter; it has been in preparation for His instituting a new and more correct presentation of divine truth that I have sought — with love and unde rstandi ng — to poi nt out the faults of the world religions , with their obs olete theologi es and their l ack of love , and to indi cate the evils of Juda ism. The present world faiths must return to their early simplicity, and orthodox Juda ism, with its deep - seated hate, must slow ly disappe ar; all must be change d in preparation for the revelation which Christ wi ll bring. The first things which the Christ will do, beginni ng with this full Moon of June , will be to prepare all peopl e everyw here (if pos sible through their regenerated, religious institutions ) for the revelation for which all hum anity waits. It is thi s revelation which lies behind all the activities which now engr oss the attention of the Hierarchy. There have been many revelations of divine pur pos e dow n the ages, each of which uni que ly altered the poi nt of view and the pattern of living for men everyw h ere. There was the ancient revelation, given through the peopl e of India, as to the existence of the Self and the Not - Self — a revelation which is now com ing to have meaning through the teaching of mode rn psychol ogy; there was the revelation of the Ten Com ma ndm ents, given through the Jews and — because of the negativity show n then and toda y by the Jews — given in a negative and not a pos itive form. The Christ ende avour ed to offset and bring to an end the need for the Ten Com mandm ents, by giving us the eleventh com mandm ent; this, if kept, woul d entail the keeping of all the others. There was the revelation which Christ Himself gave, sum ming it up for us in His life of service, in the love which He"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST preached and in His cons tant repudi ation of theological J uda ism (the Sadduc ees and the Pharisees). This difficulty with Juda ism still persists and is sym bol ised for us in the failure to recogni se the Messiah when He came to them in their ow n count ry and let it be know n that He came to the whol e world and not to the Jews alone . For this new revelation the Christ is preparing as are all the members of the Hierarchy, from the highest Choha n dow n to the humblest accepted disciple; it is for this that all the ashrams are getting ready; it is for this also that (in a weak and feeble manne r) Christian peopl e, thos e of the other world faiths, and spiritually minde d peopl e are likewise preparing. Therefore, we have isolated (if I may use such a word) three activities to which the Christ is at this time dedicated: 1. The reorganisation of the world religions — if in any way pos sible — so that their out - of - date theologi es, their narrow - minde d empha sis and their ridiculous belief that they know what is in the Mind of God may be offset, in order that the chur ches may eventually be the recipients of spiritual inspiration. 2. The gradua l dissolution — again if in any way possible — of the orthodox Jewish faith, with its obs olete teaching, its separative empha sis, its hatred of the Gentiles and its failure to recogni se the Christ. In s aying this I do not fail to recogni se thos e Jews throughout the world who acknow ledge the evils and who are not orthodox in their thinki ng; they belong to the aristocracy of spiritual belief to which the Hierarchy itself belongs . 3. Preparation for a revelation which will inaugu rate the new era and set the not e for the new world religion. To these three efforts of the Hierarchy, supe rintende d by the Christ, anot her two must be adde d, of perhaps even greater importance. The first one is the reac tion of the Hierarchy itself to the new relations hip established between It and Shamballa and to that new, direct and pot ent channe l which has lately been induc ed by the efforts of the Hierarchy and hum an invoc ativeness. The second activity is one leading tow ards a much closer relation between the Hierarchy and Hum anity; this will lead eventually to the externalisation of certain of the Ashrams, and later to the appe arance of the Hierarchy on earth, bringi ng the new revelation. These various efforts may ap pear to the casual reader as relatively uni mpor tant. This is a supe rficial poi nt of view and one which meets with little sym pathy from the Hierarchy. That the Jews shoul d be rid of fear is of major impor tance; that they shoul d know and recogni se the Christ as the Messiah, and therefore find for themselves that the religion they follow is destructive of many of the finer values, is likewise of major impor tance; that orthodox Juda ism, along with all the other faiths, shoul d realise that there is no desire to make them Christian (in the ordinary sense of the term), but that they shoul d all move tow ards som e lovi ng synt hesis and eliminate their mutual antagoni sms and rivalries is equa lly urgent, and this statement include s the Christian faiths as well. That the Vatican cease its pol itical scheming, its expl oitation of the masses and its empha sis upon ignor ance is as impor tant; that the manifold divisions of the Protestant chur ches be bridge d is imperative. If none of these things happe n, hum anity is headed tow ard s a religious war which will make the past war appe ar like child's play; antagoni sms and hatreds will embroil entire popu lations and the pol iticians of all the nations will take full adva ntage of the situation to precipitate a war which may well prove the end of humanity. There"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST are no hatreds so great or so deep as thos e fostered by religion. The Christ, therefore, has to add to all the many objectives which occupy His attention still anot her — the effort to avert a final war. This incipient war i s cont rary to the will - to - good of the Lord of the World and any world plan; it can be averted by goodw ill. This is the most impor tant statement in this message, as far as hum anity is conc erned. Great and stirring events are imminent, and they will take pl ace when the effect of the new Invoc ation is more pronounc ed and its use more general. This is primarily the respons ibility of thos e who are affiliated with the three move ments which demons trate the part I have sought to take in the world preparation. Thes e are: The Arcane School , and this refers primarily to the books for which I am respons ible; the Triangl es, which cons titutes a deeply esoteric mode of working, yet one of extreme simplicity; and the Goodw ill move ment, which has in it a factor of major imp ortance in that this move ment (embracing already as it doe s many, many thous ands ) seeks to prom ote right hum an relations with its acute and immediate appe al to the masses; it is this that the masses want essentially, and is oft what lies behind the things which they do and the plans which they make, so often ignor antly and disastrous ly. You will not e that my out standi ng theme is that of world planni ng ; this is the main preoccupa tion of the Hierarchy. This planni ng falls into two categor ies, and for these t he Christ is respons ible. These are: 1. The esoteric preparation for the phys ical appe arance or the material emergence of the Hierarchy on earth; with this activity the Buddha is definitely associated as it is conne cted with His final service to manki nd. 2. The establishing, by all means available, of right hum an relations ; this, as it is achieved, will swing the Ashrams gradua lly into external activity as need arises, and it invol ves the cons tant coope ration of the Masters. Since 1931 I have hinted at much of this, and my activities (carried forward with these things in view) have follow ed the seque nce out lined below : 1. I attempted to reach certain peopl e in order to see how far an ashram coul d func tion in external form on earth. It has prov ed onl y a partial success and the results of my expe riment have been given in the book, Discipleship in the New Age. The effects of the expe riment upon the indi vidua ls invol ved have not prove d encour aging; the effect upon the esotericists and aspirants of the world has been most successful and has greatly enha nced the sense of reality, so essential to the recogni tion of the hitherto uns een Hierarchy. 2. I publ ished books which gave the new esoteric teaching, founde d on the past, of service toda y, and indi c ative of the future. In thos e books I isolated for the new generation of esoteric stude nts the \"truths\" which were true, extracting them from the mass of imaginative thinki ng and cons eque nt formulation of thought forms which esotericists (since the time of H.P.B.) have so cons istently created and presented to the enqui ring publ ic as truths. I indi cated the new truths which were of signi ficance for the future and for which the truths of the past were a needed foun dation, and gave enough in outline and in \"see d\" conc epts to show the lines along which the new world religion, the new pol itical regimes and the new social order coul d be set up. I gave you the blueprints. I enunc iated these as principles, leaving men free — as must ever be the case — to work out the det ails according to their cont ribut ing civilisations and"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST their peculiar nationa l cultures, which shoul d uni tedly create a beautiful whol e and not provi de barriers of separativeness as is toda y the case. I finally brought to the attention of the publ ic the id ea that the externalisation of the Hierarchy was a major hierarchical project, for which due preparation woul d have to be made. 3. The world war then reached a final stage; the first stage was from 1914 - 1918; it then proceeded in a subt erranean fashion, onl y to erupt onc e more in 1939, cont inui ng with extreme fierceness and cruelty till 1945, when the pow er to cont inue the fight ende d and the atom ic bom b wrote finis to the world chapter of disaster. That atom ic bom b (though used onl y twice destr uctively) ende d the resistance of the pow ers of evil because its pot ency is predom inantly etheric. Its uses are twofold at this time: a. As the forerunne r of that release of energy which will change the mode of hum an living and inaugur ate the new age wher ein we shall not have civilisations and their emerging cultures but a world culture and an emerging civilisation, thus demons trating the true synt hesis which unde rlies hum anity. The atom ic bom b emerged from a first ray Ashram, working in conj unc tion with a fifth ray group; from the long range poi nt of view, its intent was and is purely beneficent. b. As a means in the hands of the United Nations to enforce the out er forms of peace, and thus give time for teaching on peace and on the grow th of goodw ill to t ake effect. The atom ic bom b doe s not belong to the three nations who perfected it and who ow n the secrets at present — the United States of America, Great Britain and Canada. It belongs to the United Nations for use (or let us rather hope , simply for threate ned use) when aggressive action on the part of any nation rears its ugl y head. It doe s not essentially matter whether that aggr ession is the gesture of any particular nation or group of nations or whether it is generated by the political groups of any pow e rful religious organisation, such as the Chur ch of Rom e, who are as yet una ble to leave politics alone and attend to the bus iness for which all religions are respons ible — leading hum an beings closer to the God of Love . 4. The world war now being ostensibly ove r and the work of restoration, leading to resurrection, being slow ly implemented, the work of the Hierarchy is to foster that enthus iasm in the hearts of peopl e everyw here which will enable them to work whol eheartedly for right hum an relatio ns and the spread of that simple but tonic qua lity, goodw ill. It is enthus iasm in the spiritual sense which is lacking toda y, even among thos e who see the Mind of Christ and the Plans of the Hierarchy as existing in factual usefulness; thos e who have for y ears read my teachings on goodw ill with real belief in what I say but who evidence no willingne ss to sacrifice time or mone y, block the grow th of the move ment. It is the task of the Hierarchy to prom ote goodw ill as the first step in Their plans, and it is that qua lity which is toda y closest to the heart of Christ; \"goodw ill to men,\" or rather among men, was the primary stage in the threefold prom ise made by the ange ls at His Birth: a. Goodw ill, leading to right hum an relations , leading to b. Peace on Earth , leading to c. Glory to God. Analysed, these words simply mean that goodw ill will result in right hum an relations in that centre which we call Hum ani ty ; this will produc e the pos sibility of that peace which characterises the Hierarchy appe aring on earth, and leading to the glory of God, which animates the activity of Sham bal la , the centre where the Will of God is know n. Therefore, intelligent relations hip, practical love and the full expr ession of the divine will are bound to occur, if the correct seque nc e of activities is follow ed. At present, even the first of them remains a hope . The factors of the failure of the religious"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST and pol itical groups and the apathy of the mass of men have greatly com plicated the task of the Hierarchy. 5. My persona l work has been to bring all this to the attention of the general publ ic through my interpretation of the Probl ems of Hum ani ty and bring it to the poi nt where simplicity of pur pos e, an inspiring and flaming ardou r and a minimum of organisation may implement the new p resentation of goodw ill as it affects and change s the sove reign world religions which are forgetful of the words of the Christ, \"My kingdom is not of this world\"; as it permeates into the pol itical conf erences of world statesmen and rulers, and as it gove rns the decisions of science and econom ics. In so doi ng and in the direful task of poi nting out mistakes and errors of ancient standi ng, wrong and disastrous attitude s and hum an separativeness, an inevitable oppos ition has been evoke d; had there been none , my efforts woul d have been futile. I have said naught that is not true and I retract no singl e word which I have said. There are many who prefer the esoteric truths anent the antahka rana, the world cons titution, the doc trine of man, the Law of R ebirth and the many intricate teachings related to world planni ng. These they have received in full measure from me. There are others who desire information anent the Hierarchy, the work and standi ng of the Masters, the training to be given to disciples an d initiates. This again they have received. I have now dealt in the past few years with world abus es and the probl ems with which hum anity is faced in this period of restoration — of God's plan for man, and not of former condi tions . It is interesting to not e that when the Hierarchy seeks to meet the need of the masses for better condi tions , and to aid in the changi ng of ecclesiastical and pol itical abus es, men are apt then to withdr aw their interest because the task is hard, or to repudi ate the statements ane nt that which is evil because (from their poi nt of view) it is not pos sible for the Hierarchy to find fault or take a stand against wrong, just as many repudi ated the fact that the Hierarchy took its stand, dur ing the war, upon the side of the Forces fight ing for the freedom of hum anity and refused in any way to endor se thos e fight ing on the side of darkne ss. The Hierarchy is a great fight ing body toda y, fight ing for the soul s of men, fight ing all that blocks the expa nsion of the hum an cons cious ness, fight ing all that limits hum an freedom (I said not license) and fight ing to remove thos e factors and barriers which militate against the return of the Christ and the emergence of the Hierarchy as a fully func tioni ng body on earth. There is not hing we ak, vacillating, sentimental or neutral in the attitude of the Hierarchy; this must be grasped by hum anity, and the strengt h and insight as well as the love of the Hierarchy must be count ed upon . I have in the above remarks enum erated for you certain of t he obj ectives facing the Hierarchy at this time and invol ving the persona l attention of the Christ; they all have a pot ent and beneficent effect upon hum anity. Let me enum erate them in conc ise form, because it is essential that there be clear perception of the emerging values on the part of workers of all grades and kinds in the world, for otherwise perception is not pos sible. To each poi nt enum erated I will appe nd in a few brief words the reason why it is regarded as impor tant: 1. The Reorganisation of th e World Religions . Reasons a. To make way for the World Religion, universal religion. b. To return hum anity to the simplicity which is in Christ. "},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST c. To rid the world of theology and ecclesiasticism. 2. The Gradua l Dissolution of Orthodox Juda ism. Reason s a. Because of its presentation of a wrathful Jehova h, caring onl y for his chos en peopl e. This is a basic evil. The Lord of the World, the God in whom we live and move and have our being, is totally otherwise. b. Because of its separativeness. c. Becaus e it is so ancient that its teachings are largely obs olete. d. Because when the Jews becom e spiritual they will greatly benefit manki nd, for they are found in every land. 3. Preparation for a New Revelation. Reasons a. Because where there is no vision th e peopl e perish. b. Because hum an expe ctancy indi cates its emerging presence. c. Because the new Invoc ation will inevitably bring it to us. 4. The Reaction of the Hierarchy to Shamballa. Reasons a. Produc es a direct channe l. b. Condi tions the inflow of pow er energy. c. Relates the will - to - good to goodw ill. d. Creates new cons tructive tensions and new ashrams. 5. A Closer Relation of the Hierarchy to Hum anity. Reasons a. Produc es (in the near future) the externalisation of certain ashrams. b. Leads to the reappe arance of the Hierarchy on earth. c. Recogni ses that man's poi nt of developm ent warrants this. d. Presents a nearing oppor tuni ty for revelation. 6. An Effort to avert War. Reasons a. Because the next war woul d anni hilate the greate r part of the hum an race. b. Because, having a religious basis, the hate invol ved woul d be greater far than anyt hing hitherto know n."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST c. Because Shamballa woul d be invol ved, and this has never been the case. You can see therefore how critical, spirituall y, are these times, and how urgent is the task which conf ront s the Hierarchy and its workers on earth. The war may be ove r in the phys ical sense, but great issues are still invol ved and unde termined and can lead either to peace or to a renewal of thos e con ditions in which wars are generated and which, onc e generated, cannot be avoi ded. It is with all these foregoi ng factors in mind that we appr oach the next two great Festivals: the Wesak Festival and Christ's Unique Occasion . One poi nt I must ma ke here, and I make it with great joy: this year 1946 marks the beginni ng of a cycle in which hum anity is more closely invol ved in the Festivals than ever before and in which they can take a much more impor tant part than ever before. The Wesak Festival has long been kept in many count ries and — as time goe s on and the instruction of the masses proceeds — the meeting held at the time of the May Full Moon will assum e great importance, but its keynot e will be change d . What the new keynot e will be has not yet been announc ed, and will not be for 35 years. As I earlier poi nted out , its signi ficance, and that of Good Friday, belong to the past and their usefulness is nearly finished. It is the intention of the Buddha and the Christ that in each count ry there shoul d eve ntually be som eone who will act as Their Representative at the time of the two Festivals, so that the distribut ion of spiritual energy from the first great Aspect or Ray will be direct from the Buddha (and later Shamballa) to the Christ, and then from the Christ to thos e disciples in every count ry who can be ove rshadow ed, and so act as channe ls for the direct current of energy. The same procedur e will be follow ed at the time of the Full Moon of June , except that Shamballa will not be so invol ved, and with the difference that at the May Festival it will be a first ray disciple who will be ove rshadow ed, and at the June Festival a second ray disciple will represent the Christ in every land. This can mean either the soul or the persona lity ray of the disciple. It has not been pos sible to organise this developm ent this year, but next year a beginni ng can be made, even if onl y three or four count ries can work unde r this inspiration. The effects of this developm ent will be far - reaching, though not immediately appa rent to the onlooke r. This year, at the great Festival in the Himalayas at which the Buddha will appe ar as usual, He has let it be know n that His main dut y is to bring the initial inflow of the threefold energy which the Invoc ation invoke s and will cont inue to invoke for many decades. From the Mind of God, Light will flow throug h Him to the waiting world of men — that human centre whos e eternal mission is to bring light to all created lives. From the Heart of God, He will bring to the Hierarchy, v ia the Christ, that deep une ndi ng inflow of Love which will make it pos sible for the Hierarchy to perform its hard task and externalise itself. It is not pos sible for hum an beings to realise the sacrifice and the hardship which this emergence will entail, and onl y a vast inflow of divine love can make it pos sible. An effort also will be made to relate Shamballa, \"the Centre where the Will of God is know n,\" directly to the New Group of World Servers, via thos e Ashrams which are working along the lines of ou ter, practical goodw ill. The reception of this energising will - to - good shoul d produc e a definite \"steppi ng - up\" or increase of goodw ill and enable the Goodw ill move ment to proceed with greater mom entum this com ing autum n and winter; it will take the entire sum mer for the needed assimilation by thos e engi neering this move ment all ove r the world. The absorption of the Love which flow s from the Heart of God to the Hierarchy will necessarily have"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST widespread effects; how ever, one of the most immediate will affec t the Triangl es and increase the pot ency of the network of light and of goodw ill, already in existence. You can see, therefore, from all the above , how much closer the Buddha is com ing this year to hum anity. He now finds it pos sible to permit hum an beings to know His specific obj ective; this has never before been the case. It is the result of war and the efforts of the Hierarchy to bring out in the hum an being certain ennobl ing qua lities and spiritual reactions which the stress of war coul d evoke . This year will mark a uni que and peculiar oppor tuni ty, based on the fact that there has not yet been time for peopl e to slip back into the old ways of thinki ng or for the setting up of any reactiona ry structures. This may not be the case next year and therefore it woul d be wise to take as full adva ntage as pos sible of the com ing Festivals. Thos e who have faith and vision are asked to link up (imaginatively, because anyt hing else woul d scarcely be pos sible) with the Buddha , then offer themselves as channe l s for the spiritual pot encies which He will bring. The Festival of June which is so uni que ly Christ's, and which empha sises His relations hip to hum anity, in reality cove rs three whol e days, each with a different keynot e: 1. The keynot e of Love in its hie rarchical sense — free from sentiment, emotion and persona l empha sis — a love that sacrifices and unde rstands , that acts with strengt h and decision, and that works on behalf of the whol e and not in the interests of any group or indi vidua l. 2. The keynot e of R esurrection , empha sising the new not e of livingne ss, of the living Christ and of that \"life more abunda ntly\" which the war has made possible by forcing a return to the real values. 3. The keynot e of Cont act , of a closer relation between Christ and His peo ple, between the Hierarchy and Hum anity. The word \"keynot e\" has been deliberately chos en and signi fies the sound which preceded each major inflow at the May Festival; these energies will be released at a solemn ceremony on each of the three days. At each ceremony the Christ will say the new Invoc ation alone , and then the uni ted Hierarchy will intone the stanza alone , invoki ng light , love and the will - to - good (one on each of the three days). Thos e disciples or initiates who happe n to be interested and watch ing the Triangl es or the Goodw ill move ment will have them in their minds as they say the first and third stanzas, and the New Group of World Servers will receive som e attention when the second stanza is chanted. I woul d call your attention, therefore, to the interest show n by the Hierarchy in the embryon ic efforts in which you are enga ged and which I started; I woul d poi nt out , how ever, that the attention paid is not exclusive, but that wherever two or three are gathered toge ther in the name of the Master of the Hierarchy, energy will flow ; that wherever goodw ill is a goa l and evoke s effort in no matter what form, the energy of the will - to - good will make itself felt, and that the New Group of World Servers is a far larger group than just the few know n to you. Toda y its num bers are several million. The result of this solemn three days of invoc ation will be follow ed by a climaxing day wherein the Hierarchy will unitedly, and led by the Christ, pronounc e the entire Invoc ation, prefacing each stanza with its appr opr iate keynot e, again sounde d in uni son. These not es you cannot know , but if, for instance, a very large num ber of the New Group of World Servers were brought toge ther, their uni ted OM might appr oxi mate the appr opr iate keynot e. It will be ap parent to you , therefore, that in the new cycle now beginni ng with the climaxing of the war"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST and the formation of the United Nations , the Festivals of May and June not only becom e more closely linke d, but the procedur e has been change d and the effect on hum anity intensified. I woul d have all who care to meet toge ther at these Festivals to try and do so subj ectively (wherever they may find themselves) and to participate intelligently in the ordained ceremoni es. I woul d ask all to think imaginatively and to ac t as if they were accepted disciples or at least on the periphe ry of som e ashram. I am asking you to take part in these two ceremoni es with a full play of the imagination; these ceremoni es will later be externalised at som e centre in every count ry. A train ed nuc leus and a devot ed band of believers is in process of being gathered together (though onl y as yet in the cons cious ness of the Hierarchy) , and though at the present time there will be no out er ceremoni es or any know ledge as to who will be chos en in th e various lands to represent the Hierarchy, in deed and in truth, the first step tow ards hum an participation is being made this year. The know ledge of this will give purpos e and fixed intention to all of you who have for years kept these Festiv als. In truth, I bring you the invi tation of the Hierarchy to share in Their ancient work, and not — as in the past — to play the part of interested onl ook ers. I woul d warn you that, if you do succeed in any measure of participation, it will be necessary to gu ard your selves from ove rstimulation and to take steps wisely to use, on behalf of humanity, the energy with which you may be charged. This know ledge will be particularly useful to thos e who are occupi ed with any of the groups and organisations which are r espons ive to hierarchical interests. True participation may lead to the sudde n convi ction of the reality of that which I have told you; faith and belief and com mon - sense will then no longe r be needed, and you will know . I have here told you the things whi ch the Christ has planne d for the immediate future. I have told you also som e of the things which He and the Masters must do as preparatory steps to the new world which can and will supe rsede the old unha ppy world that lies immediately behind us. I have ch osen to speak to you of these activities in which it is now pos sible for you to share, with the exception of thos e which affect the relation between Shamballa and the Hierarchy. How ever, thos e who are initiates of the third degree (and there are qui te a fe w working on the earth among men at this time) can share in all of them. This is an intensely practical message and calls for your renewed pledge to serve humanity and to find your way into an Ashram where that service may be directed. It calls for sacrif ice unt il it hur ts, and where it touc hes you the most; it calls for a joyous sense of uni ty with that station of pow er and light which we call the Hierarchy and which stands ready — as never before — to share with hum anity that pow er and that light to the limi t of hum an capacity to use it. I beg you , in closing, to aid in two matters which are of impor tance to Him Whom all disciples, initiates and spiritual men have love d and follow ed for nearly three thous and years, the Christ. (I am referring here to His app earance as Shri Krishna and as one other who was little know n but who did a great work in still earlier centuries.) It is work in preparation for His com ing. I beg you to shoul der the respons ibility of distributing the Invoc ation on as large a scale as pos sible and in every count ry. It is of great pot ency, and when used by men of all faiths can aid in the process of averting war. I ask you also to make pos sible the wide distribut ion of the book The Probl ems of Hum ani ty which I have written, for they strengt hen the hands of thos e who are already seeking to deal with these probl ems and they bring the need to the attention of the una wakened. This will requi re sacrifice, for it calls for the expe ndi ture of mone y; even the Hierarchy works through nor m al channe ls and needs mone y, and even the Christ has need of financial resour ces in order to reach the needy sons"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST of men. I ask your aid and I await you r decision. That He Whom we serve may be nearer to all of us than ever before, that the work of establi shing right hum an relations may proceed apace, and that light and love may stream forth from Shamballa and the Hierarchy ove r all of you who love your fellow men is the earnest wish, accom panied by my blessing, for you at this season of the will - to - good. 11 T he Tibetan has asked me to make clear that when he is speaking of the Christ he is referring to His official nam e as Head of the Hierarchy. The Christ works for all men, irrespective of their faith; He doe s not belong to the Christian world any more than t o the Buddhi st, the Moham medan or any other faith. There is no need for any man to join the Christian Chur ch in order to be affiliated with Christ. The requi rements are to love your fellow men, lead a disciplined life, recogni se the divinity in all faiths a nd all beings , and rule your dai ly life with Love . A.A.B.* Mode of Appr oac h Tow ard External isation (Augus t 1946) One of the most impor tant things emerging from the theme of this amazing and imminent event (the reappe arance of the Hierarchy on the phys ic al plane) is the factor of the developm ents and the adjustments goi ng on within the Hierarchy Itself in preparation for this happe ning. Incidentally, I woul d here poi nt out that what will take place, and what is already tentatively taking place, is the external isation of the Ashram s . The great official departments, such as the teaching department or that of emerging civilisations , will not at this time reappear. Their activities will still, for a long time, be retained within the Hierarchy upon I ts ow n plane. The first step is the appe arance of certain Ashrams, cont rolled by certain Masters, upon the phys ical plane, evoki ng general recogni tion and gua ranteeing to the publ ic the fact of the Hierarchy and the restoration of the Mysteries. Later, if these steps prove successful, other and more impor tant reappe arances will be pos sible, beginni ng with the return of the Christ. But in the meantime, great and mom entous happe nings are taking place within the Hierarchy and in relation to Its Membership. Di sciples upon the periphe ry of any Ashram are apt to be unobs ervant of the training and attitude s of Thos e Who are senior to them in an Ashram; They freque ntly ove rlook the fact that They too — from the Christ dow n to the humblest initiate — are in process of s teady and increasing hierarchical discipline, training and instruction. Because the senior disciples and initiates have reached a goa l which has seemed for long qui te una ttainable to the average aspirant, it is assum ed that they have attained; the fact tha t they have onl y passed a milestone upon the endl ess Way of Bliss is entirely forgot ten. But, ow ing to the impul sion of life itself, progr ess ever cont inue s; know ledge must ever be transmuted into wisdom ; love must ever be accom panied by divine will; plann ing must ever give way to divine pur pos e; light must ever be succeeded by life; from the Hierarchy, the initiate must pass to Shamballa, and from Shamballa he will follow one or other of the seven Paths; the Path of Evol ution gives place to the Way of the Highe r Evolution; planetary recogni tions eventually expa nd into solar cont acts; the Christ - cons cious ness eventually unf olds into som ething so all - inclusive that we have as yet no word for it or any need of words; recogni tion of the Father and of mona dic being causes all lesser recogni tions to fade out , and soul - cons cious ness and progr essive life in form are no longe r goa ls but are left far behind. In spite of all this, it is necessary to remember that the gain of all expe rience for ever persists , not hing is ever lost; that which life in form has conf erred is still in the pos session of the immortal spiritual entity; that which the soul - cons cious ness has enfolded and include d is still the rich endow ment of"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Being, centred now in the Mona d; hierarchi cal experience is merged into the pur pos es of the Counc il Chamber at Shamballa, but ability to work in the Hierarchy ever lasts because the hierarchical cons titution and institution condi tion all manifestation — for what reason this is so, no one know s, but so is the divine Will. In synt hesis and in the all - inclusive awareness of the great Life which enfolds all that is, everything (except what we know as evil) is persistent and for ever endur es. You will have not ed (if you are true stude nts of what I have g iven out to the world) that information anent the Hierarchy has fallen into three major categor ies: 1. The work of the Hierarchy in relation to man and to the three worlds of human evol ution. 2. The interior cons titution of the Hierarchy and its internal activity. 3. Its supe rior relation to Shamballa and to extra - planetary livingne ss. A great deal that has been conve yed to you in the two final categor ies has been merged by you into an interested but totally impractical realisation that the Hierarchy appa rently has a life of its ow n which proceeds inde pende ntly of hum anity and that it also has its ow n goa ls and obj ectives which are no conc ern of your s. These deduc tions are depende nt upon your domination by the separative mind, for in reality the work and t he activity proceeding in all three centres — Shamballa, the Hierarchy and Hum anity — are merged, fused and interdepende nt; they are all mutually evoc ative and invoc ative. The fact, for instance, that the Hierarchy is appr oaching closer to hum anity and will eventually make an appe arance upon the phys ical plane is due , not only to hierarchical intent, but to the demand of manki nd and to the strong vibration and not e which hum anity has set up. To that extent, hum anity cont rols som e of the activities o f the Hierarchy and thus precipitates action. At the same time, all that is happe ning can be traced to Shamballa, is inhe rent in divine pur pos e and is impul sed and impelled by Shamballa energy, distribut ed throughout the planet, via the Hierarchy in the ma jority of cases. Both the Hierarchy and Hum anity are brought unde r the influence of extra - planetary forces which make their impact upon the planet, via Shamballa. Therefore, a great interdepende nce emerges, of which the head, heart and solar plexus centres in the indi vidua l man's etheric body are sym bol s; their uni fied relation keeps the man func tioni ng and demons trating as a cohe rent whol e at a particular level of cons cious ness. It is essential that stude nts ende avour to grasp this, and so develop within t hemselves at least the rudi ments of this synt hetic uni fied grasp of living condi tions and of a vital situation. These instructions can aid all earnest aspirants and disciples to develop this type of unde rstandi ng with as much speed and accuracy as pos sibl e. It is distinctive of the hierarchical type of mind: conc erned with itself as a divine group , cons cious of the pul l and evoc ative pow er of the highe st centre, Shamballa, respons ive to the demands of hum anity, and sensitive to the \"call\" of that third maj or centre through which the life of the planetary Logos expr esses itself. The cons cious ness of the Master is therefore preoccupi ed with three main lines of respons ibility, but onl y one of them is inna te within the living organism of which He is a part; tha t aspect of His life is invoc ative in two directions : tow ards Shamballa and tow ards Hum anity; to Him, the other two centres are evoc ative. Toda y, hum an beings as a whol e are so loudl y invocative that the entire trend of the life of the Hierarch y and Its plans to date have been subj ected to change , to pos tpone ment as far as certain interior and pur ely hierarchical determinations are conc erned, and to a hastening of certain plans which were slated (if I may use such a word) to take place several c enturies later than this but which — ow ing to the une xpe cted preparedne ss of hum anity — can take place, not prematurely really, but securely and in the"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST fullness of time; this fullness of time, as regards the particular planni ng with which we are dealing, is fr om now unt il the year 2025 A.D. — a brief period of time inde ed in which to see the cons um mation of the larger purpos e of the planetary Logos , working through the three major centres within His body of manifestation. This pur pos e was threefold in nature: 1. It invol ved the ability of Thos e in the Counc il Chamber at Shamballa to react to and absorb certain extra - planetary energies and to use them in an intra - planetary sense. It had not been anticipated by the Directing Agents of these forces that our planetar y Logos woul d achieve a certain goa l so early in time and space as He has. 2. It invol ved a great expa nsion, num erically and in the cons cious ness of the Hierarchy. This predicates a great influx of initiates and disciples and a tremendous inflow of what i s esoterically called \"ange lic essence\" from the deva kingdo m, unde r the direction of certain great Devas who have affiliated dur ing the past two hundr ed years with the Hierarchy. This again had not been expe cted so early. The result of this happe ning has been that the door of initiation through which manki nd passes stands wider ope n (sym bol ically speaking) than ever before, and at the same time, the Masters are passing with greater rapidity on to the Way of the Highe r Evol ution; this is due to the fact tha t initiates are fitting themselves so rapidly to take Their places, and disciples are movi ng on into initiate pos ition so fast, that a great pressing forward has becom e legitimate. 3. It invol ved, finally, a great awakening in the human family and a major spiritual reorientation. This again had been believed pos sible of accom plishm ent when the sun passed into Capricorn about 2300 years hence. But — it has already taken place and necessarily has brought about a basic adjustment in the plans of the Hierarchy and a renewed empha sis upon the purpos e, as registered in Shamballa. This, being factual, and the time ripe for decision, has caused an intra - planetary ferment and great activity in the three major centres. In the last analysis (and this is the factor of supr eme importance) this developm ent — this une xpe cted right absorption of spiritual energy, and this seizing of spiritual oppor tuni ty — is due to hum anity itself; above everything else, it is the readiness of manki nd for that which is new, and hum an ity's determination to create a new and better world, adapted more adequa tely to their \"renewed\" spiritual nature, that is respons ible for all the activity. In this section of our training themes (if I may call them so) we shall deal primarily with the re spons e and the subs eque nt activity of the Hierarchy in relation to hum anity. This will take the form of a new Appr oach and a reappe arance exot erically. It woul d be wise, therefore, to keep the follow ing ideas cons tantly in mind; I will enum erate them sequ entially and for the sake of clarity: 1. The work of the Hierarchy, throughou t the ages, has been funda mentally threefold in nature: a. A cons tant effort to set up a closer and more und erstandi ng relation with Shamballa. This invo lves: An unf oldm ent of the will aspect in conj unc tion with a full use of intelligent love . A cons tant adaptation of the developi ng Plan to the emerging, energising Purpos e. An increasing ability to transmit energy from Shamballa to the three worlds, from the cosmic etheric level s to the cosmic dense phys ical planes. "},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST b. To unf old — within the periphe ry of the hierarchical centre — a life, a plan and a techni que which will train all who find their way into an Ashram, which is in itself an aspect of the life of the Hierarchy . This ancient and intelligent effort has created and condi tione d what you know as the Hierarchy. How ever, it is cons tantly subj ect to change in respons e to new situations and developm ents. c. To represent, finally, within the Hierarchy, the qualities of all the seven Rays, through the medium of the seven major Ashrams and their allied and subs idiary Ashrams. There are many other aspects of the hierarchical cons titution and obj ectives, but these three are the one s with which we are at this time the most c onc erned. 2. Toda y, the relation of Shamballa to the Hierarchy is closer than at any previous time, ow ing to the follow ing factors: a. The one - poi nted work and plan — pur sued by the three great departments in the Hierarchy (the department of the Manu, that of the Christ, and that of the Lord of Civilisation) — in which the three Leaders have uni tedly acted as a Triangl e of transmission between the Counc il Chamber of the Lord of the World and the Hierarchy. They are, all three, Members of the Counc il, though n one of Them is yet working at the very centre of affairs; in order to be of greater service in Their ow n sphe re, They have taken Their stand upon the periphe ry of the Counc il's influence. b. The invoc ative work carried out bot h cons cious ly and unc ons cious ly by hum anity itself, which has been of such a pot ency that it has penetrated beyon d the ring - pass - not (sym bol ically unde rstood) of the Hierarchy to Shamballa itself, and has evoke d respons e. This invoc ative work reached a high poi nt of pot ency as a result of the world war (1914 - 1945 ) and its not e and appe al are still persistent. c. The rapid developm ent of integration among advanced peopl e, which has forced many on to the Path of Discipleship, and therefore into certain of the Ashrams, and has likewise enabled many disciples to take initiation. 3. The recogni tion by a very much larger number of the general publ ic of the fact of the Hierarchy; this has established a new type of relation between the Hierarchy and hum anity. Hitherto the relation was depende nt upon recogni tion, by adva nced aspirants, of the nature of their pos ition in relation to the Hierarchy; toda y, the recogni tion of thous ands who are not in any way adva nced aspirants or in any sense prepared for affiliation with the Hierarchy h as created a new type of problem; it connot es to the Hierarchy a prom ising developm ent, though at the same time an embarrassing one , requi ring as it doe s a different mode of adjustment to hum an demands than that entailed by the adm ittance of disciples to T heir Ashrams; it requi res the attention of certain disciples and initiates in all the Ashrams and the ability of the Hierarchy to penetrate and dissipate the thick cloud of inchoa te though tforms which the bewildered, interested and curious publ ic have crea ted anent Them. 4. The use by the Hierarchy of the destroye r aspect of divinity, the first Ray, in such a manne r that it is in fact a creative factor and one which, in the last analysis, not onl y releases the life from its previous limitations , but also ca lls in — unde r the Law of Balance — the bui lding activity of the second Ray. The work of destruction is now practically accom plished and ove r, and the work of the Builders is beginni ng. 5. The New Group of World Servers has been created as an inter mediate body between the Hierarchy and the general publ ic. This group is divided into two lesser groups :"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST a. Thos e disciples and workers who are already integrated into som e one of the Ashrams. b. Intelligent and hum anitarian aspirants and workers in worl d affairs and in all departments. These two groups uni tedly form a transmitting agency through which the Hierarchy can reach the mass of men with the new conc epts, the techni que s of the new civilisation and the basic propos itions unde r which hum anity will move forward into greater light. 6. The recogni tion by hum anity of its major probl ems, and the increasing ability of the general publ ic to view these probl ems in terms of One Hum anity, of the whol e. This ability indi cates to the Hierarchy the pos ition of Hum anity upon the Path at this time and the readiness of manki nd for the new revelation — to be follow ed later by the restoration of the Mysteries. 7. The new orientation of the hum an family within itself to the conc ept of the One Hum ani ty and the intensel y alert spiritual demand which is toda y distinctive of manki nd everyw here, and which has forced the Hierarchy to com e to certain basic decisions and to readjust Itself to a much closer coope ration with the hum an centre of life and purpose. It is interesti ng to not e (though it is of no immediate mom ent) that the work of destruction initiated by the Hierarchy dur ing the past one hundr ed and seventy - five years (therefore since the year 1775 ) has in it the seeds — as yet a very long way from any germination — of t he final act of destruction which will take place when the Hierarchy will be so com pletely fused and blende d with Hum anity that the hierarchical form will no longe r be requi red. The three major centres will then becom e the two, and the Hierarchy will disappe ar and onl y Shamballa and Hum anity will remain, only spirit or life, and subs tance as an expr ession of intelligent love will be left. This corresponds to the expe rience of the indi vidua l initiate at the four th initiation, when the causal body, the soul body , disappe ars and onl y the mona d and its expr ession, the persona lity (a fusion of soul and form) are left. This event of final dissolution will take place onl y at the close of our planetary existence, when the doo r to indi vidua lisation is fina lly closed for a pralayic period and the Way of the Highe r Evol ution will be more closely trodde n than the Path of Initiation. Therefore, my brothers, the closer relation of the Hierarchy to Shamballa, the stimulation of its ow n interior life, and the rea diness of hum anity for revelation and for certain une xpe cted developm ent, will condi tion the cycle into which we are now entering. This is, therefore, the most amazing period in the history of humanity. Adde d to this, it must be bor ne in mind that we are e ntering anot her greater roun d of the Zodi ac, and this coincides with the lesser zodi acal activity because Aqua rius gove rns the greater immediate cycle of 25,000 years and is also the sign into which the sun is now movi ng for a period of 2300 years — a most a mazing happe ning and full of impor t in our planetary history; it is a coincidence of which our planetary Logos is well aware and of which He is making full and intelligent use. It is a cycle also wherein, for the first time, the three major planetary centr es — Shamballa, Hierarchy and Hum anity — are in direct and uni mpeded relation, for toda y the alignm ent is correct and adjusted for the first time in planetary history. Even if this be onl y tempor arily so, som ething has been initiated, the effects of which will never be lost. It is a cycle also in which the planetary Logos , having successfully taken initiation and thus affected His entire planetary life, has also established certain extra - planetary relations hips which are necessarily incom prehensible to you and of no mom ent whatsoever to the indi vidua l hum an being, but which will eventually create a situation in which our planet will becom e a sacred planet. This process, as it unf olds and develops , will have a pot ent subj ective and deeply"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST spiritual eff ect upon every kingdo m in nature and in the realm also of supe rnature. Let us now proceed with our cons ideration of our theme, after our study of these basic premises. Steps in the External isation Process For som e time, ever since 1425 A.D., ( a date t o which I referred earlier) the Hierarchy has been aware that the time woul d com e when this projected move woul d take place. Preparations have gone steadily forward. A poi nt to be remembered is that this impulsed intention (emanating in the first place fro m Shamballa) came as a major disturbance to the rhythm of many tens of thous ands of years; it has been a basic condi tioni ng factor. The Masters, how ever, Who will make the move out wards into cont act with the world are not the Ones Who registered the initia l impul se from Shamballa, nor are the three Heads of the great departments the same. The earlier Masters initiated the needed steps of preparation, and the work has gone steadily forward since. You might well ask what were these steps and along what lines has the preparation gone ? The first steps conc erned internal preparation. Though the Masters of the Wisdom have all passed through the hum an expe rience and are simply men who have achieved a relative measure of perfection, there are aspects of phys ical co ntact which They have com pletely transcende d and utterly negated. There is not hing in the three worlds with which They have any affinity, except the affinity of life and the impul se of love for all beings . Recove ry of certain facilities of activity has bee n deemed necessary. For instance, the five senses, where a Master is conc erned, exist and are used at need, but the cont act established and maintained with disciples and senior aspirants in the world (through whom They primarily work) is largely telepathic ; hearing and sight , as you unde rstand their uses, are not invol ved. The science of impression, with its greatly increased effectiveness ove r indi vidua l cont act through the senses, has entirely supe rseded the more strictly human method. Except i n the case of Masters working on the phys ical plane and in a phys ical body , the outer phys ical senses are in abeyance; for the majority of Masters Who still use these senses, the use is strictly limited; Their work is still almost entirely subj ective and t he mode of telepathic interplay and of impression is practically all the means which They employ to reach Their working agents. Therefore, the recove ry of past usages of a more phys ical nature has been one of the preparatory move s. Anot her has been the ach ievement of a wide culture and unde rstandi ng of the current civilisation which will be com ing into activity and cont rol when the intende d project is carried out . You have been told — and told correctly — that the Masters do not troubl e Themselves to attain pro ficiency in all educ ationa l subj ects — in mode rn history, for instance, or the newest scientific procedur es, or in the use of foreign langua ges. In all Their Ashrams there are thos e who can suppl y Them with any specified know ledge which They may need at any given time or for any specific pur pos e. This will still remain true of Those Who have attained the rank of Master, but it is not true of all the senior initiates, many of whom , as they passed into highe r grades and unde r instruction from a Master, have ret ained their worldly know ledge , besides specialising in certain strictly munda ne appr oaches to worldly affairs. For instance, there are adepts who are author ities upon mode rn financial matters, and these initiates of the four th degree are com petently prepar ing to institute later thos e newer techni que s and mode s of financial interplay which will supe rsede the present disastrous methods ; they will inaugur ate a system of barter and exchange , of which mode rn mone y is the travestied sym bol . This newer method of f inancial relations hips will be com prehensively hum an and it will supe rsede big bus iness and private enterprise. It will at the same time, how ever, retain thos e pha ses of mode rn enterprise which will draw out the initiative and the resour cefulnes s of the individua l. Other initiates have specialised in the various"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST langua ges, and two of them are author ities in basic Engl ish; this is the form of the Engl ish langua ge which will eventually take the place of other langu ages in all forms of internationa l and bus iness intercour se without in any way obl iterating the individua l nationa l langua ges in daily use in any count ry. Two things must be realised as the interested stude nt cons iders this event of externalisation: 1. The senior Members of the Hierarchy will not at first be the one s who will make the needed appr oach. Unde r Their direction and Their close supe rvision, this appr oach will be made — in the early stages — by initiates of and unde r the degree of the third initiation, and also by thos e disciples wh o will be chos en and designa ted to implement Their efforts and so will work unde r Their direction. It is only in the later stages, and when the time has com e for the return into recogni sed phys ical expr ession of the Christ, leading to the definite restorat ion of the Mysteries, that certain of the senior Members of the Hierarchy will appe ar and take out er and recogni sable phys ical cont rol of world affairs. The time for this will be depende nt necessarily upon the success of the steps taken by the members of t he Hierarchy who are not so adva nced. 2. Members of the Hierarchy, whether working in the early stages or later when the true externalisation takes place, will work as members of the hum an family and not as proclaimed members of the kingdo m of God or of s oul s, know n to us as the Hierarchy; they will appe ar in office of som e kind or anot her; they will be the current pol iticians, bus iness men, financiers, religious teachers or chur chm en; they will be scientists and phi losophe rs, college professors and educ at ors; they will be the mayor s of cities and the custodi ans of all publ ic ethical move ments. The spiritual forcefulness of their lives, their clear, pure wisdom , the sanity and the mode rn acceptableness of their propos ed measures in any department in which t hey choos e to func tion, will be so convi ncing that little impediment will be set in the way of their unde rtakings . At the present stage of preparation, the task of the disciple who is charged with laying the founda tion for the New Age methods a nd with the labour of getting ready for the first group of Ashram members, is hard inde ed. He stands for so much that is deemed visiona ry and impos sible; the difficulties which conf ront him seem impos sible; he teaches truths whos e first effect is necessari ly destructive, because he ende avour s to rid hum anity of old forms of religious , econom ic and pol itical doc trine; his impersona lity — which recogni ses faults as well as virtues — enrages many and often thos e from whom he had expe cted unde rstandi ng and a true i mpartiality; his failure to be impressed or attentive to old rites and ceremoni es, to ancient and obs olete but precious ideas, and his cons tant warfare on condi tioni ng glamour s and illusions meet, in these early stages, with little encour agement. He works freque ntly alone and usually with little recogni tion and lacks time for his ow n persona l hierarchical cont acts; he is not necessarily conne cted with any so - called esoteric groups and — if he is — his task is that much harder; onl y adva nced disciples with a ful l and cons cious cons tant cont act with their particular Ashram are able to work in this way. Occult bodi es and esoteric groups are, at this time, the most glamour ed of any of the world groups ; the work of any disciple in such groups is bound , in the early s tages, to be destructive. The present occult groups which came into existence prior to 1919 will eventually all disappe ar; the members who are true and sound, broad - minde d and sane, and right ly oriented and dedicated, will find their way into esoteric bodi es which are free from dogm atism and doc trines and which are recipients of hierarchical life. The preparatory work of externalisation, therefore, falls into three pha ses or stages, as far as relation to manki nd is conc erned:"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST First . The present stage in w hich a few isolated disciples and initiates, scattered all ove r the world, are doi ng the important task of destruction, plus the enunc iation of principles. They are preparing the way for the first organised body of disciples and initiates who — co ming from certain Ashrams — will proceed with the next pha se of the work. Second . The stage of the first real externalisation upon a large and organised scale will succeed upon the above ende avour s. These disciples and initiates will be the real Builders of the new world, of the new civilisation; they will assum e leadership in most count ries and take high office in all departments of hum an life. This they will do by the free choi ce of the peopl e and by virtue of their adva nced and prove n merit. By this means , gradua lly the Hierarchy will take ove r the cont rol upon the phys ical plane — subj ectively as well as obj ectively — of the direction of hum an affairs. This direction will be in virtue of their know n and approve d capacity and will not invol ve the impos ition of any hierarchical cont rol or author ity; it will simply signi fy the free recogni tion by free peopl e of certain spiritual qua lities and effective activities which they believe signi fy that these men are adequa te to the demande d job, and whom they therefore c hoos e as directing agents in the new and com ing world. Freedom of choi ce unde r the author ity of a spiritual livingne ss which demons trates com petency will be distinctive of the attitude of the general publ ic. Men will be put into high office and into pos iti ons of pow er not because they are disciples or initiates, but because they are wise and intelligent servants of the publ ic, with an internal awareness, a deeply religious and inclusive cons cious ness, and a well - trained mind with an obe dient brain. This st age of hierarchical appe arance is depende nt upon the effective service of the first group of isolated and hard - working disciples who are the senior members of the New Group of World Servers and who are toda y working among the sons of men. This second group will take ove r from them, and theirs will be the task of instituting a more uni fied preparation for the return of the Christ. The first group prepare hum anity for the pos sibility; the second group definitely prepare for the return itself. They will bui ld for a future which will arise out of the wreckage of the past, which wreckage they will remove ; they will instill certain basic conc epts anent right hum an relations into men's minds . Their immediate group work, when they are com ing into pow er an d recogni tion, will cons ist of a sweetening and a clarification of the pol itical situation and the presentation of thos e ideas which will eventually lead to a fusion of thos e principles which gove rn a democracy and which also condi tion the hierarchical met hod — which is som ewhat different; this effort will produc e a third pol itical situation which will not be entirely depende nt upon the choi ces of an uni ntelligent publ ic or on the cont rol which the hierarchical techni que evidently invol ves. The mode of this n ew type of pol itical gui dance will later appe ar. This second group will implement the new religion; by the time they com e into cont rol the old theologi cal activities will have been com pletely broke n; Juda ism will be fast disappe aring; Buddhi sm will be spr eading and becom ing increasingl y dogm atic; Christianity will be in a state of chaotic divisions and uphe avals. When this takes place and the situation is acute enough , the Master Jesus will take certain initial steps tow ards reassum ing cont rol of His Chur c h; the Buddha will send two trained disciples to reform Buddhi sm; other steps will also be taken in this department of religions and of educ ation, ove r which the Christ rules, and He will move to restore the ancient spiritual landm arks, to eliminate that w hich is none ssential, and to reorganise the entire religious field — again in preparation for the restoration of the Mysteries. These Mysteries, when restored, will uni fy all faiths. Groups of spiritually - minde d financiers who are cons cious members of an As hram will take hol d of the"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST world econom ic situation and bring about great and needed change s. All these activities, built upon the preparatory work of the first group , are also preparatory in nature. Third . The stage wherein Christ and the Masters of the Wisdom can make pub lic appe arance and begin to work publ icly, ope nly and out wardly in the world of men. The time of Their com ing will be depende nt upon the success of the work unde rtaken by the first two groups ; it is not pos sible for me to prop hesy anent this matter. So many factors are invol ved: the earnest work of the two groups , the readiness and the willingne ss of manki nd to learn, the rapidity with which the forces of restoration and of resurrection can rehabilitate the world, the respons iv eness of adva nced hum anitarians and intelligentsia to the oppo rtuni ty to rebui ld, to recreate and to reorganise the factors which the new culture and the new civilisation will demand. Even the Hierarchy Itself, with all Its sour ces of information, doe s not know how long this will take, but They are ready to move at any time. In the meantime, as the first group struggl es with the immediate probl em in the out er world, and the second group — still within the conf ines of the Hierarchy Itself — makes due interior p reparation and appl ies to its chos en membership the needed training and the desired reorientation, the Christ and the Masters are occupi ed with the task of preparing for the restoration of the Mysteries. This restoration will fall into three pha ses and wil l cove r and include in its sym bol ism all pha ses of hum an unfoldm ent. The story of manki nd will be pictorialised. These three pha ses correspond broadly and in a general sense to the three degrees of the Blue Lodge in Masonr y. The analogy is not entirely acc urate, ow ing to the una voi dable degeneracy of Masonr y, but with the restoration of the Mysteries, Masonr y also will com e into its ow n. These pha ses are: 1. The stage of a general recogni tion of light in all departments of hum an living. This is inferred in the first stanza of the new Invoc ation. If the ritual of the E.A. is studi ed in the light of this information the signi ficance will emerge. The poo r and destitute candi date emerges into the light . 2. The stage of com plete econom ic reorientation; in this, hum anity is relieved of all econom ic anxi ety and is free to receive its due wages and the right reward of all service rende red in the bui lding of the Temple of the Lord; this bui lding proceeds with rapidity. 3. The stage wherein the reward of l ight is received and the reward of service rende red; spiritual status is recogni sed through the medium of what is regarded as a major initiation, for which the first two initiatory degrees are onl y preparatory. This first great initiation will be obj ective ly staged and the general publ ic will recogni se it as the major rite and ritual of the new religious institution of the period. This is the stage where the forces of resurrection are active, when the Lord is with His peopl e and Christ has returned to earth . Religion is then recognised as an attitude gove rning all pha ses of hum an expe rience. Appr oac h, via Certain Ashram s Stude nts must not proceed on the assum ption that in the process of externalisation there is a general movi ng forward of the entire Hiera rchy ont o the phys ical plane. Such is not the case. The whol e effort is as yet (and will be for som e time) expe rimental, and onl y a few of the Ashrams and a certain num ber of the trained disciples and initiates will be invol ved at first. It still remains t o be prove d how ready hum anity is for this attempt. The Christian conc ept of the return of a trium pha nt Christ, com ing in the clouds of heaven to Jerusalem, there to reign for a thous and years, is true in one way and utterly false as to design, location an d method. Christ will return; the Jerusalem referred to (literally \"the place of"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST peace\") is not the chief city of a small count ry called Palestine or the Holy Land; the word is simply sym bol ic of a peaceful world — a world which, through its ow n self - initiat ed efforts, has attained a general qui etude and has acqui red a certain measure of right hum an relations . His com ing in the air might be interpreted literally to mean that at the right time He will com e by plane from the place on earth where He has been for many generations , watching ove r the sons of men; the words \"every eye shall see Him\" might mean that, by the time He comes, television will have been perfected and He will then be seen, by its means, from even the most distant spot on earth. To the orthodox Christian, the above will sound like the ranke st blasphe my, but the que stion immediately arises: Why shoul d it be blasphe my for Him to use mode rn methods ? Whilst on earth before, He conf ormed to the custom s of His time. \"Riding on the clouds of Heaven\" may sound more picturesque and appa rently requi re a greater expr ession of divinity, but why use such a means when a plane will equa lly well fulfil the pur pos e and carry the prophe cy to com pletion? A great deal of reactiona ry stupi dity will have to be eliminated before He can com e, and it will be as the new generation assert their hol d ove r hum an thinki ng. But it is not the event or the stage of Christ's appe aring with which we are now dealing, but with the preparatory stages and with the task of fitting the world (which means, in this case, preparing the hum an cons cious ness) for the presence in phys ical activity and manifestation of the Hierarchy — in full force and with its esoteric equi pm ent. In the early stages, the task of preparation is arduo u s and difficult. Things will be relatively easy for the senior Members of the Hierarchy when They find the right time for Their appe arance. In the meantime, the world disciples have to take the world — as it is at this time — and slow ly and labor ious ly instill the new ideas, incite to better methods of hum an relations , help dissipate the aftermath of war, hol d before the eyes of distraught humanity the new vision of hope and of spiritual enlight enm ent, offset the scheming of reactiona ry and cons ervative pol itic ians and chur chm en, and teach the yout h of the age the new mode s of living, indicating to them the better values, and thus slow ly and gradua lly bringing in the new order. Among the seven major Ashrams and their subs idiary and affiliated Ashrams onl y a few have unde rtaken to send their disciples and their initiates at this time to carry out this initiatory task. The three major Ashrams so enga ged are: 1. The Ashram of the Master K.H. This is the second ray Ashram and — with that of the Master M. — t he most pow erful in the Hierarchy; it cont rols the bui lding forces. 2. The first ray Ashram, that of the Master M. He is the custodi an of the principle of synt hesis, the work of which is that of organic fusion, and this is ever needed to suppl ement that o f the bui lding agents. 3. The Ashram of a Master on the fifth ray, the custodi an, among other things, of science and of that which relates and brings into expr ession the dua lity of spirit - matter. This Ashram has an important part to play in the work of pr eparation, for it is through the scientific use of energy that the world will be rebui lt and the factual nature of the Hierarchy be prove d. Through the pressure of educ ation (second ray energy) , through the grow th of the conc ept of synt hesis (first ray en ergy) , and through the correct use of energy (fifth ray energy) , this world can be brought into a condi tion of preparedne ss for the externalisation of the Hierarchy. The efforts of the disciples com ing from the Ashram of K.H. will be largely directed tow a rds the"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST general publ ic, but they will work primarily throug h educ ators in all count ries and through thos e conc erned with the teaching of religion. Educ ators touc h thos e preparing for all type s of activity. The task will be necessarily slow , particularly at first, but the second ray endow ment of these disciples (as that of all disciples on this ray) is a steady persistence which brooks no discour agement, even when discour agement makes its appe arance. Such disciples refuse to discont inue their effort or to ch ange the spiritually - ordained plans, even when the obs tacles to accom plishm ent seem insupe rable. Disciples will com e deliberately into incarnation and will take office in institutions of highe r learning and in the chur ches, and will exert such pressure tha t old and obs olete methods , ancient out worn theologi es and selfish and com petitive techni que s will be ende d and the sciences of coope ration, of right hum an relations and of correct adjustment to life through meditation and right vision will supe rsede the present methods of learning; this will lead to no damage to the acqui sition of academic know ledge or the right appr ehension of spiritual truth. The vision will be different and the goa ls of a highe r order, but the best that is now taught along th e lines of art, religion and science will still be available; they will, how ever, be presented with a greater enlight enm ent and a better empha sis. They will meet the peopl e's need. The chur ches, being toda y headed tow ards failure and lacking vision, will e ventually and inevitably crash upon the rocks of unw arranted and abus ed author ity, yet out of the wreckage will emerge thos e true and spiritually enlight ened chur chm en who — with vision and sure know ledge , free from dogm atism and hating ecclesiastical author ity — will develop the new world religion. Paralleling these activities (and disciples on this ray are already taking the needed steps) will com e that of the disciples and initiates who are working unde r the direction of the Master M. Their work lies in the field of right hum an relations and in the produc tion of that synt hesis of effort which will create a new intuitiona l cons cious ness and — cons eque ntly — a changi ng pol itical cons cious ness and situation in which the family of nations will stand toge ther for cer tain basic values. These are funda mentally three in num ber: 1. The freedom of the indi vidua l. These freedom s have been voi ced for us in the words of that great first ray disciple, Frankl in D. Roos evelt. They are the four essential freedom s. 2. Right inte rnationa l interplay, necessitating finally the abol ition of war. 3. Clean pol itical regimes, free from graft, selfish ambition and dirty pol itical manoe uvr ing. In the achievement of these ends (and onl y major issues will be cons idered, leaving the lesser and uni mpor tant effects to be dealt with later) the disciples of synt hesis and the instigators of right pol itical relations hips will work in close coope ration with disciples upon the second ray whos e task it is to educ ate the general publ ic in the truer values. A trained and enlight ened publ ic, shoul dering right respons ibility, will elect onl y thos e men whos e vision is in line with the new ethics, the new science of right hum an relations , and who recogni se as a basic pol itical tenet the equa lity of all men — an equa lity founde d on a universal and basic divinity. Allied to the efforts of these two groups of disciples and initiates will be thos e disciples on the fifth ray, whos e task it will be to lead manki nd into the benefits of the atom ic age. T he occultist has ever proclaimed that the field wherein the Hierarchy works is that of energy; they have taught that there is not hing in existence but energy in som e form or other, and that all we see, all with which we daily work (includi ng our ow n materi al natures, mental, emotiona l and phys ical), and all that produc es phe nom ena is energy in relation to forces, or forces as they are directed by energy. "},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST This the emerging group of disciples will incont rovertibly prove ; by their efforts the new civilisation will be created, in which hum anity will have time for freedom , for the deeper educ ationa l cons iderations and for a pol itical activity of the spiritual kind; science will produc e a world wherein labour (as we now know it) will be abol ished and every pha se of man's life will be implemented by science — not in order to make him more com fortable or more like a robot or more selfish, but as an aspect and out grow th of true freedom ; men will be free to think, to establish new mode s of cultural interests, and free a lso to unf old the highe r abstract mind and to interpret its conc lusions through the medium of the trained low er conc rete mind. The uni ted work of these three groups of disciples and initiates prepares the way for the externalisation of the Hierarchy; this preparation is already unde r way and taking definite form, though as yet the efforts are embryoni c and the workers very few in num bers. A beginni ng has nevertheless been made and great change s will take place during the next twenty - five years; these will indi cate the general structure of the new world of culture, will empha sise as nor mal the highe r conc epts of the so - called \"visiona ry\" world planne r and lay the founda tion for the work of the other Ashrams, when the time for an expa nde d effort a rrives. When the three major Ashrams have done their work, and this work — in spite of the difference of ray — is largely educ ationa l, then the other Ashrams will slow ly send in their representatives to coope rate and to cont inue with the task. The first Ashra m to do so will be that of the third ray; by the time disciples appe ar from that Ashram the world will be ready for an all - ove r financial adjustment; the \"principle of sharing\" will be a recogni sed motivating conc ept of the new civilisation. This will not invo lve beautiful, sweet and hum anitarian attitude s. The world will still be full of selfish and self - seeking peopl e, but publ ic opi nion will be such that certain funda mental ideals will motivate bus iness, being forced upon bus iness by publ ic opinion; the fact that the new general ideas will in many cases be gove rned by the expe diency of interplay will not basically matter. It is the sharing that is of impor tance. When the \"adjuster of finances\" (as an adva nced disciple from this Ashram is called in the Hie rarchy) appe ars, he will find condi tions greatly change d from thos e now prevalent, and this to the follow ing extent: 1. The principle of barter and of exchange (to the benefit of all conc erned) will cont rol. 2. Owing to the developm ent of atom ic energy o n behalf of human welfare, nationa l currencies will have been largely supe rseded, not only by a system of barter but by a uni versal mone tary exchange — representative of the bartered goods when they are relatively small and uni mportant — and by a planne d scale of related values. Nationa l material assets and the needed com modi ties will all be provi ded for unde r an entirely new system. 3. Private enterprise will still exist, but will be regulated; the great pub lic utilities, the major material resour c es and the sour ces of planetary wealth — iron, steel, oil and wheat, for instance — will be ow ned in the first place by a gove rning, cont rolling internationa l group; they will, how ever, be prepared for internationa l cons um ption by nationa l groups chos en by the peopl e and unde r internationa l direction. Upon this subj ect I have no time to give, and besides this, anyt hing I coul d say woul d be regarded as visiona ry and impractical in a world which has not yet been subj ected to the educ ationa l processes of the disc iples and initiates on the first, second and fifth rays or to the funda mental change s which the new generation of young peopl e (now grow ing up) will shor tly inaugur ate. "},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Upon this threefold condi tion of the basic cont rol of the produc ts of the planet, thes e third ray disciples, working unde r the senior initiates above mentione d, will bui ld the new structure of material relations hips — a most difficult task, ow ing to the evil \"pul l\" of the subs tantial assets and the cont inue d cont rol, even though greatly lesse ned, of hum an selfishne ss. This \"pul l\" is regarded esoterically as evil because it embodi es the principle of imprisonm ent and has, for unt old aeons , engr ossed the attention of the hum an being, to the exclusion of all true values. Later, disciples and init iates of the seventh ray and of the sixth ray will com e into phys ical incarnation. The onl y Ashram which will be then unrepresented — and this for a long time — will be the four th. As the four th ray is, how ever, the cons tant ray of the hum an family, its influe nce is cons istently present, and this Ashram is equa lly cons tantly aware of and influential in hum an affairs; it will com e into full expr ession when the intuition of the hum an being, emanating as an energy from the four th or buddhi c plane, has been evoke d by the hum an soul and is a recogni sed asset in hum an cons cious ness. The four th ray will com e into manifestation before many generations have passed, but onl y from the angl e of its incarnating Mona d, and not from the angl e of its active Ashram. Once the cont act — in phys ical manifestation and phys ical recogni tion — has been established, a system of \"appe arances and of abstractions \" will be instituted by the Hierarchy, produc ing what might be regarded as a circulation of its life and representatives b etween the two major planetary centres, the Hierarchy and Hum anity. According to the need upon the phys ical planet, and upon the acceptance of certain designs , will an Ashram be prominently active or relatively inactive. The ancient activities of the Hier archy will still persist — the activities of preparing disciples and initiates for initiation and for participating cons cious ly in hierarchical effort; the School s of the Mysteries (as out lined by me in Letters on Occult Meditation ) will com e into being and practice, but this will be temporarily a seconda ry activity; the full expr ession of ashramic energy will be directed to practical world affairs and to the educ ation of the general publ ic, and not in the early stages to esoteric matters. In the last analysi s, there is for the Master and His disciples no such thing as esotericism, except in so far as Shamballa is conc erned. There is onl y definite and planne d work with the cons cious ness of all forms, and — where hum anity is invol ved — this is regarded as a process of educ ation, leading to an expa nsion of perception and the changi ng of acqui red academic know ledge into an ove rshadow ing and condi tioni ng wisdom . The implementing of human affairs to bring about this unf oldm ent in cons cious ness is in the hands of discipl es who are unde rgoi ng the process themselves, and it is not in the hands of the Masters, Whos e cons cious ness is fully expa nde d — a cons cious ness entering a highe r and greatly different pha se, conne cted with Being and Life and the pur pos es of Shamballa. App roac h Tow ards External isation in the Disciple's Cons cious ness I find it necessary here to make one point clear. The disciples sent out from the various ashrams do not arrive on earth cons cious of a high mission or kno wing well the nature of the task to wh ich they have been subj ectively assigne d. In the case of certain disciples who will be of special world prom inence and who are of initiate rank, they may attain to a convi ction of mission (if I may call it so) in their extreme yout h and thus be oriented tow ards their life task from the very start; that convi ction will grow and deepen and clarify as the years go by. But it must be remembered that the majority of disciples will not so react. They will com e into incarnation with certain gifts and in nate talents and with certain firmly root ed ideas, endow ed with irrevoc able ideals and a brain which is respons ive to a well -"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST develope d mind. They will, normally and through natural trends and predilections , find their way into that field of hum an activity wherein they are intended to work and in which they are to bring about certain basic change s in line with hierarchical intent. This hierarchical intent will usually be unknow n to them (though this may not always be the case), but the work to be done will s eem to them impelling and necessary and som ething which they must do at all costs. They will find their way into pol itics, into the educ ationa l move ments and into science; they will work as hum anitarians, as social workers and in the field of finance, but they will follow these lines of activity through natural inclination and not because they are being \"obe dient\" to instruction from som e Master. They will be successful in their ende avour because the pot ency of the Hierarchy will be behind them, and there i s much that the inne r Ashram can accom plish for its out er working disciples in the way of ope ning door s, implementing efforts and arrangi ng cont acts, and other facilities; this is ill done , how ever, without any evidence of the inne r impulsion. Recogni tion of the inne r effort will be depende nt upon the status in the Ashram of the disciple. When the disciple is a very adva nced one , he may becom e aware of his high mission and know it to be no fanatical and self - initiated intention, but a definite task unde rtak en in respons e to ashramic planni ng. Such cases will usually be the exception and not the rule, particularly in the early stages. Such hierarchical workers will gather aroun d them lesser disciples who will work along the same lines, through com munity of in terest but not through recogni tion of similar instructions — a very different thing. In the one case, the cons cious ness of mission is develope d through periods of definite planni ng with the Ashram and in cons ultation with the Master or His senior workers. In the more usual case, the disciple reacts and works in respons e to impression, being at this stage totally una ware from whence the impression com es; he regards it as an activity of his ow n mind acting as a directing agent in all the planne d acti vities, the life theme and pur pos e which are his service dyna mic. One major characteristic is, how ever, present in all these working disciples and aspirants; this is a wide hum anitarianism and a determination to aid in the cause of hum an welfare. One inte resting distinction will later emerge and condi tion the new age in contradistinction to past and present methods . Disciples and aspirants will not be dedicated to purely hum anitarian and welfare work. That will be a motive and not an obj ective in work. The y will not give up their days and efforts solely to the relief of hum an necessity. All pha ses of hum an living — pol itics, finance and science, as well as religion — will be recogni sed to be their immediate and spectacular task, but the motivation in the future will not be primarily bus iness success or persona lity ambition but the impul se to subor dinate these to the general effort and to aid hum anity as a whol e, with a long range vision. It is this grow ing spirit of hum anitarianism which will lie behind all mov ements tow ards world socialisation in the various nations . This move ment is sym ptom atic of a change in the orientation of man's thinki ng, and therein lies its major value. It is not indi cative of a new techni que of gove rnm ent in reality, and this particula r pha se of it is ephe meral; it is at the same time founda tiona l to the new world order which will emerge out of all these expe riments which hum an thinki ng is at this time evol ving. These are the things which will be in the cons cious ness of disciples com mi ssione d by the Hierarchy to bring about the needed change s and the new orientation, and not any recogni tion of Masters and Their orders or of any hierarchical and ashramic backgr ound. Whilst in incarnation such disciples stand free to serve one - poi ntedly and whol eheartedly that section or pha se of hum an effort in which their lot and life - trend appe ar to cast them. They may be quite unc ons cious of any spiritual obj ective (so - called today) except the recogni tion that they love their fellow men; thi s love will condi tion all they do and will motivate their every effort. "},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST From the standpoi nt of the Master, they can be reached, impressed and directed, and most definitely they are so reached; from their ow n standpoi nt they are simply bus y, energetic peop le, gifted with a good mind, profound ly interested in their chos en life task and provi ng themselves capable of effective work along som e particular line, able to influence and direct others in similar activity and definitely bringi ng about change s in the b ranch of human endeavour with which they are conc erned, thus lifting unde rlying principles on to highe r levels. This is straight hierarchical work. It affects on broad lines the cons cious ness of hum anity. These disciples may be cons cious that their effort and their thinking are part of a forward - movi ng evol utiona ry ende avour ; to that extent they are mission - cons cious , but the value of this attitude is that it relates them, in cons cious ness, to many others, similarly motivated and cons cious of a similar vis ion. It is of cour se wise to remember that all such disciples are pronounc ed ray type s and are integrated persona lities in the highe st sense of the word. They will work on earth as high grade persona lities, unde r the impact of strong motives which emanate from the soul in respons e to impression from the Ashram, but of this, in their phys ical brains, they know not hing and care less. Part of their effectiveness in service is due to the fact that they are not preoccupi ed with soul cont act and with the idea of academic service. Their eyes are on the job to be done , their hearts are with their fellow men, and their heads are bus y with methods , techni que s and practices which will raise the entire level of ende avour in their chos en field. Hence their inev itable success. Disciples who are intensely interested in persona l respons iveness to the soul , who work diligently at the probl em of soul cont act, who are bus y with the art of serving cons cious ly and who make service a goal, who are keenly alive to the fa ct of the Ashram and to the Master, will not be asked to do this work of preparing for the externalisation of the Hierarchy. Adva nced disciples who are stabilised in the Ashram, and who are so used to the Master that He assum es in their cons cious ness no un due prom inence, can be trusted to work along right lines in the world and do the work of preparation. They cannot be sidetracked or deflected from one - poi nted attention to the task in hand by any soul call or urge; hence they are free to do the intende d wo rk. The situation, therefore, in relation to the cons cious ness of disciples in the intensely difficult, though interesting, period with which hum anity is faced coul d be sum med up in the follow ing statements: 1. The disciple is not motivated by any desire to externalise the Hierarchy or to see the Ashram with which he is affiliated func tioni ng phys ically on the out er plane. He may be totally una ware of this hierarchical intention. If he is aware of this unde rlying pur pos e, it is entirely seconda ry in his c ons cious ness. The good of hum anity and a stabilised spiritual future for manki nd are his major life incentives. 2. The disciple is strictly hum anitarian in his out look. He works for the One Hum anity and though aware pos sibly that he is affiliated with the Hierarchy, his loya lties, his service and his life intention are directed entirely to the cause of hum an betterment. In this attitude he is com ing to resemble the Masters Whos e life directive is not hierarchical pos sibilities but adhe rence to the pur pos es of Shamballa, in action, in relations hips and to the Plan for all living uni ts in the three worlds. 3. The intuition of the disciple is alert and active; the new ideas and the vital fresh conc epts are foremost in his mind. He almost autom atica lly repudi ates the reactiona ry and cons ervative thinking of the past and — without fanaticism and undue emphasis — he lives, talks and instructs along the new lines of right hum an relations ."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST 4. The disciple, occupi ed with hierarchical plans for the future, ha s a com pletely ope n mind as regards the grow th of true psychic pow ers. He deplores and represses all negative condi tions and forms of thinki ng as he cont acts them in his envi ronm ent, but he encour ages the grow th of all forms of highe r sensory perception wh ich expa nd the hum an cons cious ness and enrich its cont ent. 5. According to his hierarchical status, he will becom e increasingl y a channe l of pow er in the world. His ow n ashramic life will deepen as his world service develops . The statement in the Bible (o r rather injunc tion) to \"take root dow nw ard and bear fruit upw ard\" has for him a deeply occult signi ficance. I am not here touching upon the grow th of a disciple as a disciple , or on his indi vidua l progress on the Path; I am cons idering the type of cons ci ous ness with which he faces the task which conf ronts him. Unless he fulfils within himself the requi rements enum erated in this section of our study, he will not be one of the workers in this interlude between the old age and the new. The Disseminat ion of Information of a Prepar atory Nature Thos e who do the work of reaching hum anity with the needed information fall into two main groups : 1. Disciples and convi nced aspirants who are toda y working in the field of occultism. 2. Thos e disciples and initiates who will emerge from the three Ashrams and whos e work is largely to act as the vangua rd of the Hierarchy and precede it into out er manifestation. This will begin in the year 1975, if the disciples now active will do their work adequa tely. Much has already been done in familiarising the general publ ic with the conc ept of the Hierarchy. Much of it has been done in such a manne r as to bring the whol e subj ect into disreput e, as well you know . The groups now occupi ed with the dissemination of occult teaching woul d be well - advi sed to change their methods if — beneath their pronounc ed ignor ance and their love of the spectacular — there lies a true belief and a real hum anitarian desire. Information anent the Hierarchy shoul d take the follow ing lines: 1. Em pha sis shoul d be laid on the evol ution of humanity with peculiar attention to its goa l, perfection. This is not the idealistic perfection of the visiona ry mystic, but the cont rol of the instrum ent, man in incarnation, by the indw elling and ove rshadow ing so ul. The cons titution of man shoul d be increasingl y taught . 2. The relation of the indi vidua l soul to all soul s shoul d be taught , and with it the recogni tion that the long - awaited kingdom of God is simply the appe arance of soul - cont rolled men on earth in e veryda y life and at all stages of that cont rol. 3. From a recogni tion of this relations hip, the fact of the spiritual Hierarchy can then be deduc ed and the nor mality of its existence empha sised. The fact will appe ar that the Kingdom has always been prese nt but has remained unrecogni sed, ow ing to the relatively few peopl e who expr ess, as yet, its qua lity. 4. When this recogni tion has becom e general, the idea (by this time permanently present in the hum an"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST cons cious ness everyw here) and good sense also will testify to the fact of the presence of Thos e Who have achieved the goa l; Their demons tration of divinity will be regarded as nor mal, as cons tituting a uni versal obj ective, and as the gua rantee of hum anity's future achievement; degrees of this divine expr es sion can then be poi nted out , rangi ng from that of the proba tiona ry disciple, through disciples, to Thos e Who have achieved mastery, and up to and inclusive of the Christ. 5. Thus gradua lly the idea or conc ept of the existence, in bodi ly presence, of the Masters will be inculcated and steadily accepted; a new attitude to the Christ will be develope d which will be inclusive of all the best that the past has given to us but which will integrate men into a more sane and acceptable appr oach to the e ntire problem. 6. The time will com e when the fact of the presence on earth of the Christ as Head of the Hierarchy and the Director of the Kingdom of God will be accepted; men will also realise the truth of the present revol utiona ry statement that at no time has He ever left the earth. 7. Empha sis will also increasingl y be laid upon the unf olding Plan, and men will be brought to its recogni tion through a study of the evol ution of the hum an family, through a close cons ideration of historical processes, an d through a com parative analysis of ancient and mode rn civilisations and cultures. The thread of pur pos e will be not ed and follow ed through, century after century, integrating not onl y history into one com plete story of the revelation of divine qua lities t hrough the medium of hum anity, but integrating with it and into it all world phi losophi es, the central theme of all creative art, the sym bol ism of architecture and the conc lusions of science. This appr oach of the central fact of hum an evol ution — the steady grow th of divinity and the revelation through man of divine pow ers — will offset the fanciful, fantastic presentation of the Hierarchy which has colour ed all the occult move ments and the various Theosophi cal and Rosicrucian presentations . The subj ect will b e presented in a manne r acceptable and reasona ble. It will not be a slow er process, but the reverse. The results of the old and fool ish way of introduc ing the subj ect has greatly retarded the intende d work. Men, how ever, in the future, will accept with rap idity and thankf ully what is reasona ble and which has its root s in the past, can be prove n by history, and which presents a true and pos sible hope for the future. It can be expe cted that the orthodox Christian will at first reject the theories about the C hrist which occultism presents; at the same time, this same orthodox Christian will find it increasingl y difficult to induc e the intelligent masses of peopl e to accept the impos sible Deity and the feeble Christ which historical Christianity has endor sed. A Christ Who is present and living, Who is know n to thos e who follow Him, Who is a strong and able executive and not a sweet and sentimental sufferer, Who has never left us but Who has worked for two thous and years through the medium of His disci ples, the inspired men and wom en of all faiths, all religions and all religious persuasions ; Who has no use for fanaticism or hys terical devot ion but Who love s all men persistently, intelligently and opt imistically, Who sees divinity in them all and Who co mprehends the techni que s of the evol utiona ry developm ent of the hum an cons cious ness (mental, emotiona l and phys ical, produc ing civilisations and cultures appr opr iate to a particular poi nt in evol ution) — these ideas the intelligent publ ic can and will accept . They will prepare and work for condi tions in the world in which Christ can move freely among men, in bodi ly Presence; He need not then remain in His present retreat in Central Asia. They can and will accept with ease the uni ty of all faiths when the rel ations hip of the Buddha and the Christ is correctly presented; then the picture of a Christ demandi ng a uni que pos ition, to the exclusion of all other sons of"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST God, will fade out in the wonde r of the true apos tolic succession, in which many sons of God, on different rays, of differing nationa lities and with varying missions , are to be seen historically leading hum anity along the path of divine unfoldm ent and nearer to God, the Sour ce. Tempor arily, the fact of God Immanent will engr oss the attention of all t rue spiritual teachers, and the fact of that divine immanence making itself felt in perfection through the Christ and other divine Representatives will for a time relegate the teaching on God Transcende nt into the backgr ound. Undu e empha sis has been placed on this major truth, to the exclusion of the nearer and more practical truth of God in every man and in every form in every kingdom in nature; much evil has eventuated by the failure to lay the empha sis upon God Immanent. Later on, when the tru th of the Christ indw elling every man and revealed in perfection through the historical Christ and His great Brothers dow n the ages has been accepted, the teaching of God Transcende nt, which is the secret mystery in the custody of Shamballa, will be reveal ed and empha sised. The two halves of a perfect Whol e will then be recogni sed by hum anity. The key to the Hierarchy and Its reappe arance on earth in phys ical form, and the cons eque nt materialisation of the kingdom of God among men, is the simple truth of G od Immane nt . It is the clue to the evol utiona ry process, and the eternal hope of all forms in all kingdom s in nature. This is the central truth, the convi ncing truth, and the revealing truth which will unde rlie all information anent the Hierarchy, and this the com ing generation of disciples will distribut e. If this truth is factual and pos sible of demons tration, then the fact of the Hierarchy is prove d and the authenticity of the eternal existence of the kingdom of God on earth is established. THE RETURN OF THE CHRIST 12 Part of this message and the one follow ing it on page 612 appe ar in chapters III and VII of The Reappe aranc e of the Christ . Chronol ogically they belong in the historical seque nce here given.* May 1947 Year after ye ar I have written you (and all who care to listen) a message which has often been prophe tic, always related to the funda mental spiritual uni on of the East and the West, of the Buddha and the Christ, and which has cons istently laid empha sis upon the immedia te spiritual oppor tuni ty. Every year I have prepared these messages with great care, and in their synt hesis there emerges (if you have read them in order and intelligently) a picture of the spiritual life of the world. It is a picture which invol ves the kn ow able past, which conc erns the immediate present, and carries forward into a future of spiritual unf oldm ent, transcendi ng in expression all that has hitherto been know n, because it has ever been based on the reality, on the fact of God Immane nt . God Transcende nt, greater, vaster and more inclusive than His created world, is uni versally recogni sed and has been generally empha sised; all faiths can say with Shri Krishna (speaking as God, the Creator) that \"having pervaded the whol e uni verse with a fragm ent of Myself, I remain.\" This God Transcende nt has dom inated the religious thinki ng of millions of simple and spiritually - minde d peopl e dow n the centuries which have elapsed since hum anity began to press forward tow ards divinity. Slow ly, there is d awning upon the awakening cons cious ness of hum anity, the great paralleling truth of God Immanent — divinely \"pervading\" all forms, condi tioni ng from within all kingdom s in nature, expr essing inna te divinity through hum an beings and — two thous and years ago — por traying the nature of that divine Immanence in the Person of the Christ. Toda y, as an out com e of this unf olding divine"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Presence, there is entering into the minds of men everyw here a new conc ept: that of Christ in us, the hope of Glory. There is a grow ing a nd developi ng belief that Christ is in us, as He was in the Master Jesus, and this belief will alter world affairs and manki nd's entire attitude to life. The wonde r of that Life lived two thous and years ago is still with us and has lost none of its freshn ess; it is an eternal inspiration, hope , encour agement and example. The love He demons trated still hol ds the thinki ng world in thrall, even though relatively few have really attempted to demons trate the same qua lity of love as He did — a love that leads une r ringly to world service, to com plete self - forgetfulness and to radiant, magne tic living. The words He spoke were few and simple, and all men can unde rstand them, but their signi ficance has largely been lost in the intricate legalities and discussions of St . Paul, and the lengt hy disput ations of theologi cal com mentators since He lived and left us — or appa rently left us. Yet — toda y Christ is nearer to hum anity than at any other time in hum an history; He is closer than the most aspiring and hope ful d isciple know s, and can draw closer still if what I here propos e to write is unde rstood and brought to the attention of men everyw here. For Christ belongs to hum anity, to the world of men, and not onl y to the chur ches and faiths throughout the world. Aroun d Him — in that High Place on Earth where He has His abiding place — are gathered toda y all His great Disciples, the Masters of the Wisdom , and all Thos e liberated Sons of God Who, dow n the ages, have passed from darkne ss to Light, from the unreal to the Real, and from death to Immortality; They stand ready to carry out His biddi ng and to obe y the Master of all the Masters and the Teacher alike of Ange ls and of men. The Expone nts and the Representatives of all the world faiths are there waiting — unde r His gui dan ce — to reveal to all thos e who today struggl e in the maelstrom of world affairs, and who seek to solve the world crisis, that they are not alone . God Transcende nt is working through the Christ and the Spiritual Hierarchy to bring relief; God Immanent in all men is standi ng on the verge of certain stupe ndous Recogni tions . The great Apos tolic Succession of the Know ers of God is poi sed toda y for renewed activity — a Succession of Thos e Who have lived on earth, accepted the fact of God Transcende nt, discove red th e reality of God Immanent, portrayed in Their Own lives the divine characteristics of the Christ life and (because They lived on earth as He did and doe s ) have \"entered for us within the veil, leaving us an example that we too shoul d follow His steps,\" and Theirs. We too belong eventually in that great Succession. You may wonde r why, at this hour of the Festival of the Buddha , I am writing to you anent His great Brother, the Christ. I am doi ng it with deliberation because the eyes of all spiritual Know ers are fixed upon Him, because the Buddha Himself is standi ng behind Him in hum ble recogni tion of the divine task which He is on the verge of cons um mating, and because of the imminence of that spiritual accom plishm ent. I write thus because not onl y are all th ose who are func tioni ng cons cious ly in the Kingdom of God aware of His plans, but because thos e great spiritual Beings Who live and dw ell in the \"Father's Hous e,\" in the \"centre where the Will of God is know n,\" are also mobi lised and organised t o assist His work. The spiritual line of succession from the throne of the Ancient of Days dow n to the hum blest disciple (gathered with others at the feet of the Christ) is toda y focussed on the task of helping hum anity. The great moment for which He has so patiently waited has almost arrived; the \"end of the age\" to which He referred when speaking to His small group of disciples — \"Lo! I am with you all the days"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST even unt o the end of the age\" — has com e and toda y He stands and waits, know ing that the hour has com e when He will \"see of the travail of His soul and be satisfied.\" May I repeat: Right through the spiritual succession of the Sons of God there is naught to be seen and felt but expe ctancy and preparation. From the Father's Hous e (the Shamballa of the esotericist) the fiat has gone forth: \"The hour has com e.\" From the kingdom of God where reigns the Christ, the answer has been flung back: \"Father, Thy will be done \"; dow n in our struggl ing, bewildered, unh appy world of men, the cry is ceaselessly rising: \"May Christ return to Earth.\" Thus in the three great spiritual centres — the Father's Hous e, the Kingdom of God, and awakening Hum anity — there is but one Purpos e, one idea and one uni ted expe ctancy.... I write here in no fanatical or adve ntist spirit; I sp eak not as a speculative theologi an or an expone nt of one pha se of religious wishful thinki ng. I speak because the time is ripe and because the appe al of simple faithful hearts has penetrated to the highe st spiritual sphe re and set in motion energies and f orces which cannot now be stoppe d; I speak because the invoc ative cry of distressed hum anity is today of such a vol um e and sound that — uni ted to the wisdom and the know ledge of the spiritual Hierarchy — it has given rise to certain activities in the Father's Hous e. These will result in the glory of God, in the transformation of the divine will - to - good into hum an goodw ill and resultant peace on Earth. A new chapter in the great book of spiritual living is about to be written; a new expa nsion of cons cious ness is an imminent happe ning; a fresh recogni tion of divine attentiveness is now pos sible to hum anity, and a revealing expe ctancy will prove the accuracy of the Biblical statement, \"every eye shall see Him.\" The religious livingne ss or spiritual hist ory of manki nd can be sum marised for us by a series of recogni tions — recogni tion of Thos e Who, dow n the ages, have cons tituted the Apos tolic Succession, culminating for us in the great religious leaders who have com e out among us since 700 B.C. and founde d the great mode rn world faiths, and — above all else — in the Christ Himself Who embodi ed the perfection of God Immanent, plus awareness of God Transcende nt; recogni tion of thos e major spiritual conc epts of love , life and relations hip which have hove red ever in the backgr ound of man's thinki ng and which are now on the verge of right expr ession; recogni tion of the true brotherhood of man, bas ed on the one divine life, working through the one soul and expressing itself through the one hum ani ty ; recogni tion, theref ore, of relations hip bot h to the divine life throughout the world and to manki nd itself. It is this developi ng spiritual attitude which will lead to right hum an relations and eventual world peace. Toda y anot her recogni tion is becom ing pos sible. It is the recogni tion everyw here of the imminent return of Christ (if such a phr ase can be true of One Who has never left us) and of the new spiritual oppor tuni ties which this event will make possible. The basis for this recogni tion lies in the deep - seated convi cti on, inna te in the hum an cons cious ness, that som e great Teacher, som e Saviour, Revealer, Lawgiver or divine Representative must com e forth from the world of spiritual realities, because of human need and hum an demand. Always, dow n the centuries, at the hou r of man's greatest need and in respons e to his voi ced demand, a divine Son of God has com e forth and unde r many different names. Then the Christ came and appa rently left us, with His work unf inished and His vision for manki nd not yet cons um mated. For two thous and years it has seemed as if all His work had been blocked, frustrated, and of no avail — for the grow th of the chur ches dur ing the centuries is no gua rantee of the spiritual success at which He aimed. It needed more than theologi cal interpre tations and the num erical grow th of the world religions (includi ng Christianity and"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Buddhi sm) to prove His world mission successfully carried forward. It all seemed impos sible, necessitating three condi tions ; in these a test of His work coul d be attempted; toda y these three condi tions are prove n facts. First: a general planetary situation which has (unf ortuna tely ow ing to man's selfishne ss) prove d to be so catastrophi c in nature that hum anity has been forced to recogni se the cause and sour ce of the disaste r; secondl y, a spiritual awakening which woul d have its impul se in the deepest depths of man's cons cious ness, and such is the case toda y as a result of the world war (1914 - 1945 ); thirdly, a steadily mount ing invoc ative cry, prayer or demand, directed tow ar d high spiritual sour ces, no matter by what names such sour ces may be called. Today , all these three condi tions hav e been fulfilled and hum ani ty faces renewed oppor tuni ty . The disaster which has ove rtaken manki nd is uni versal and widespread; no one has es caped, and all men are invol ved in som e way or anot her — phys ically, econom ically and socially. The spiritual awakening of men everyw here (within or without the world faiths, and largely out side of them) is general and com plete, and a turning to God is to be seen on every hand. Finally, these two causes have arous ed — as never before — the invoc ative cry of hum anity; it is clearer, pur er and more selfless than at any other time in hum an history, because it is based on clearer thinki ng and com mon distress. True re ligion is again emerging in the hearts of men in every land; this recogni tion of a divine hope and backgr ound may pos sibly take peopl e back into the chur ches and world faiths, but it will most certainly take them bac k to God . Religion is the name, surely, which we give to the invoc ative appe al of hum anity which leads to the evoc ative respons e of the Spirit of God. This Spirit works in every hum an heart and in all groups . It works through the spiritual Hierarchy of the planet; it impels the Head of the Hierarchy, the Christ, to take action, and the action which He is taking will lead to His return, with His disciples. I wonde r if you appr eciate the impor t of what I have just said? The idea of the return of Christ is a most familiar one , and the c onc ept of a returning Son of God in respons e to hum an need has its place in the teaching of the majority of the world faiths. Ever since He appa rently departed to the sphe re where the faithful have put Him, little groups of these peopl e have reasone d thems elves into the belief that on such and such a date He will com e back, and ever their prophe cies and expe ctancies have been doom ed to failure. He has not com e. Such peopl e have been laughe d at by the crow d and rebuke d by the intelligent. Their eyes have not seen Him and there has been no tangi ble indi cation of His Presence. Toda y, I tell you that He will com e; that plans for His com ing are already set on foot , but I set no date or hour . The time is know n onl y to the two or three, but \"in such an hour as ye t hink not , He will com e.\" (Matt. XXIV. 44) I tell you, first of all, a truth hard for the orthodo x thinke r of any faith to accept: He cannot return becaus e He has always been here upon our Earth, watching ove r the spiritual destiny of hum anity; He has neve r left us, but in phys ical body and securely conc ealed (though not hidde n), He has gui ded the affairs of the spiritual Hierarchy, of His disciples and workers who are uni tedly pledge d with Him to Earth Service. He can onl y reappe ar . It is a spiritual fact that thos e who have passed from the cave of the tom b into the fullness of the resurrection life can be seen, and at the same time evade the vision of the believer; seeing and recogni tion are two very different things , and one of the great recogni tions of m anki nd in the near future is the recogni tion that always He has been with us and shared with us the familiar usefulness and peculiar characteristics of our civilisation and its many gifts to man. "},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST The early signs of His appr oach with His discipl es can already be discerned by thos e who not e and right ly interpret the signs of the times. There is (among these signs ) the com ing toge ther spiritually of thos e who love their fellow men. This is in reality the organising of the out er phys ical army of the Lord — an army which has no weapons but thos e of love , of right speech and right hum an relations . This unknow n organisation has proceeded with phenom enal speed dur ing the aftermath of war, because hum anity is sick of hate and of cont rove rsy. The general sta ff of the Christ is already active in the form of the New Group of World Servers; they are as pot ent a body of forerunne rs as has ever preceded a great world Figur e into the arena of manki nd's living. Their work and influence is already seen and felt in ev ery land, and not hing can destroy that which they have accom plished. The spiritual and organising effect of sound in the form of expr essed and voi ced invoc ation has been also attempted since 1935, and the energy of the invoc ative cry of hum anity has been d irected into thos e channe ls which reach from Earth to that High Place where dw ells the Christ. From there, it has been transmitted on to thos e still highe r sphe res where the attention of the Lord of the World, the Ancient of Days, the Father of all, plus t he Creative Energies and Living Beings Who dw ell there with Him, can be focussed on hum anity and thos e steps can be taken which will embody more rapidly the Purpos es of God. For the first time in hum an history, the demand of the peopl e of the Earth is so potent and so in line with divine direction in time and space that the end is inevitably sure; the looke d - for spiritual Representative must com e forth, and this time He will not com e alone but will be accom panied by Thos e Whos e lives and words will evoke r ecogni tion in every department of hum an thinki ng. The sym bol ic prophe cies found in all the world Scriptures anent this imminent event will prove their veracity; their sym bol ism will nevertheless elicit re - interpretation, and circum stances and happe nings wi ll not necessarily be exactly as the Scriptures would appe ar to indi cate. For instance, He will com e inde ed \"in the clouds of the air\" as the Christian Scriptures say (Matt. XXIV. 64) , but of what great interest is that when millions com e and go in the clouds each hour of the day and of the night ? I mention this as one of the out standi ng prophe cies and one of the most familiar; it is, how ever, one which means little in our mode rn civilisation. The fact that is of importance is that He will com e. The Wesak Festival has been held, dow n the centuries, in the well - know n valley in the Himalayas (if the faithful woul d onl y believe it) in order: 1. To subs tantiate the fact of Christ's phys ical existence among us ever since His so - called departure. 2. To prove (on the phys ical plane) the factual solidarity of the Eastern and Western appr oaches to God. Both the Christ and the Buddha are then present. 3. To form a rallying - point and a meeting - place for thos e who annua lly — in synt hesis and sym bol ically — lin k up and represent the Father's Hous e, the Kingdom of God, and Humanity. 4. To demons trate the nature of the work of Christ as the great and chos en Intermediary, standi ng as the Representative of the spiritual Hierarchy and as the Leader of the New Group of World Servers, and in His Person voi cing their demand for the recogni tion of the factual existence of the Kingdom of God here and now . Perhaps one of the major messages I have for all of you who read my words is this great truth and fact of the phys ica l Presence on Earth at this time of the Christ, of His group of Disciples and Executives,"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST of Their representative activities on behalf of mankind and of Their close relations hip. This relations hip com es out at certain of the great spiritual Festivals where relations hip include s not onl y the Kingdo m of God but also the Father and the Father's Hom e. There is the Festival of Easter; the Festival of the Buddha Who, in phys ical Presence, expr esses the spiritual solidarity of our planet; and the Festiv al in June , peculiarly the Festival of the Christ, when He — as Leader of the New Group of World Servers — employs the new Invoc ation on behalf of all men of goodw ill in all lands ; at the same time, He gathers up the inchoa te and une xpressed demands of thos e m asses who seek a new and better way of life. They want love in daily living, right hum an relations , and an unde rstandi ng of the unde rlying Plan. It is these phys ical happe nings which are of mom ent, and not the vague hope s and prom ises of the theologi cal f aiths. It is the phys ical Presence upon our planet of such recogni sed spiritual Figur es as the Lord of the World, the Ancient of Days; the seven Spirits Who are before the throne of God; of the Buddha , the spiritual leader of the East, and the Christ, the spiritual leader of the West, which I bring at this climaxing time to your attention. To you I say that the vague belief in Their existence, the dreamy speculations as to Their work and Their interest in hum an welfare, and the unc onvi nced, yet hope ful, wis hful thinki ng of believers (and also unbe lievers), will soon give place to certain know ledge , to visual recogni tion, to prova ble signs of executive work, and to the reorganisation (by men of unus ual pot ency) of the pol itical, religious , econom ic and social life of the planet. All this will not com e as the result of som e proclamation or som e stupe ndous planetary event which will force hum an beings everyw here to say: Lo! He is there! Lo! Here are the signs of His divinity! for that woul d evoke onl y antagoni s m and laught er, resistance or fanatical credul ity. It will com e as a recogni tion of pot ency in leadership, through dyna mic but logi cal change s in world affairs, and through action taken by the masses of the peopl e from the depths of their ow n cons cious ness . Many years ago I indi cated that the Christ woul d com e in three ways, or rather, that the fact of His Presence coul d be prove d in three distinctive pha ses. I said then that the first move which the Hierarchy woul d make woul d be the stimulatio n of the spiritual cons cious ness in man, the evoc ation of hum anity's spiritual demands on a large scale, and the nur turing — on a worldw ide scale — of the Christ conscious ness in the hum an heart. This has already been done , and with most effective results. Of the factual nature of this process the voc iferous demands of men of goodw ill, of welfare workers and of thos e pledge d to internationa l coope ration, to the relief of world distress and to the establishm ent of right hum an relations are the unde niable expr ess ion. That pha se of the preparatory work which is indicative of His com ing has now reached a stage where not hing can arrest its progr ess or slow dow n its momentum . In spite of appe arances, this upr ising of the Christ - cons cious ness has been successful, and w hat may appe ar as reverse activity is of no impor tance in the long run, and onl y of a temporary nature. The second move of the Hierarchy, I told you, would be the impressing of the minds of enlight ened men everyw here by spiritual ideas embodyi ng the new t ruths, by the \"descent\" (if I may so call it) of the new conc epts which will gove rn hum an living, and by the ove r - shadow ing of all world disciples and the New Group of World Servers by the Christ Himself. You will recall how , in the Bible story, Christ sym bol ically evoke d the recogni tion of John the Baptist and imparted the things of the Kingd om of God to the disciples who walked to Emmaus, though they recogni sed not their Com panion. This planne d move of the Hierarchy is also progr essing well; men and wom en everyw here and in every department of life are enunc iating thos e new truths which shoul d in the future gui de hum an living; they are bui lding thos e new organisations , move ments and groups — large or small — which will familiarise"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST the mass of men with the reali ty of the need and the mode of meeting it. This they are doi ng because they are driven thereto by the warmth of their hearts and their lovi ng respons e to hum an distress; without formulating it thus to themselves, they are nevertheless working to bring into visibility the Kingdom of God on earth. No denial of these facts is pos sible, in view of the multiplicity of this type of organisations , books and speeches. Thirdly, I told you that Christ might com e in person and walk among men as He did befo re. This has not yet taken place, but plans are being laid which will enable Him to do so. Thos e plans do not invol ve the birth of som e nice child in som e nice hom e on earth; they will not produc e the wild claims and the credul ous recogni tion of the well - m eaning and the uni ntelligent, as is so freque ntly the case toda y, nor will som eone appe ar and say: This is the Christ. He is here or He is there. I woul d poi nt out to you, how ever, that the widespread appe arance of such tales and claims, though unde sirable , misleading and wrong, nevertheless demons trates hum an expe ctancy of the imminence of His com ing. Belief in His com ing is basic in the hum an cons cious ness. How He will com e, in what manne r, I may not and shou ld not say. The exact mom ent has not yet arrive d, nor has the method of His appe arance been determined. The factual nature of the two earlier and preparatory move s, already made by the Hierarchy unde r His direction, are the gua rantee that He will com e and that — when He doe s — manki nd will be ready. For a brief mom ent, I would like to sum marise certain aspects of the work He set in motion two thous and years ago, because it hol ds the clue to His future work. Som e of it is well know n to you , for it has been empha sised by the world faiths and particularly by teachers of the Christian faith. But all of them have made His work appe ar difficult for man to grasp, and the undue empha sis laid upon His divinity (an empha sis which He Himself never made) has made it appe ar that He and He onl y, and no one else, coul d po ssibly do the same things . Theologi ans have forgot ten that He Himself stated that \"greater things shall ye do, because I go unt o the Father\" (John XIV. 12) . He here indi cates that this passing to the Father's Hous e woul d result in such an inflow of spiritu al strengt h, insight and creative accom plishm ent in men, that their deeds woul d surpass His. Because of the distortion of His teaching and its remote relation to man, we have not yet done thos e \"greater things .\" Som e day we assuredly will, and — a long certain lines — we already have. Let me relate som e of the things He did which we can do, and which He will aid. 1. For the first time in hum an history, the love of God was embodi ed in a man, and Christ inaugur ated the era of love . That expr ession of d ivine love is still in the making; the world is not yet full of love and few there are that unde rstand the true meaning of the word. But — speaking sym bol ically — when the United Nations has emerged into factual and actual pow er, the welfare of the world will then be assured. What is that welfare but love in action? What are right hum an relations but love among men, groups and nations ? What is internationa l coope ration but love on a world scale? Thos e are the things which the love of God in Christ expr essed, an d those are the things which we are working here toda y to bring into being. We are attempting to do it on a vast scale, and this in spite of oppos ition — an oppos ition which can onl y tempor arily succeed, such is the pot ency of the awakened spirit of man. The se are the things which the Hierarchy, in its already successful procedur es, is aiding and will cont inue to aid. 2. Christ taught also that the Kingdom of God is on Earth and told us to seek that Kingdom first and let all things go for its sake. That King dom has ever been with us, com pos ed of all thos e who, dow n the ages, have sought spiritual goa ls, liberated themselves from the limitations of the phys ical body, emotiona l cont rols and the obs tructive mind.

The Kingdom of God is not som ething which wi ll descend on earth when men are good enough! It is som ething which is func tioni ng efficiently toda y and demandi ng recogni tion. It is an organised body which is already evoki ng recogni tion from thos e peopl e who do seek first the Kingdom of God a nd discove r thereby that the Kingdom they seek is already here. Christ and His disciples are know n by many to be phys ically present on Earth and the Kingdom which They rule, with its laws and mode s of activity are familiar to many, and have been throug hout the centuries. Christ is the World Healer and Saviour. He works because He is the embodi ed soul of all Reality. He works toda y, as he worked in Palestine two thous and years ago, through groups . There He worked through the three belove d disciples, through the twelve apos tles, through the chos en seventy, and the interested five hundr ed.... Now He works through His Masters and Their groups , and thereby greatly intensifies His efforts. He can and will work through all groups just in so far as they fit themsel ves for planne d service, for the distribut ion of love , and come into cons cious alignm ent with the great pot ency of the inne r groups . Esotericists, occult stude nts, Rosicrucians and Theosophi sts have always proclaimed the phys ical Presence of the Christ, b ut have so distorted the teaching by dogm atic assertions on uni mportant details and by ridiculous claims, that they have evoke d little recogni tion of the unde rlying truth, nor have they por trayed a Kingdom which is attractive. Yet that Kingdom exists and i s not a place of disciplines or gol den harps and peopl ed by uni ntelligent fanatics, but a field of service and a place where every man has full scope for the exercise of his divinity in human service. 3. At the Transfigur ation, Christ revealed the glory which is inna te in all men. The triple low er nature — phys ical, emotiona l and mental — is there show n as prostrate before the glory which was revealed. In that mom ent, wherein Christ Immanent was in the phys ical form, wherein hum anity was represented by the th ree apos tles, a Voice came from the Father's Hom e in recogni tion of the revealed divinity and the Sons hip of the Transfigur ed Christ. On this inna te divinity, upon this recogni sed Sons hip, is the brotherhood of all men based — one life, one glory which shall be revealed, and one divine relations hip. Toda y, on a large scale (even when by - passing the implications of divinity) the glory of man and his funda mental relations hips are already a fact in the hum an cons cious ness. Accom panyi ng thos e character istics which as yet remain deplorable and which woul d appe ar to negate all claims to divinity, is the wonde r of man's achievement, of his triumph ove r nature. The glory of scientific attainm ent and the magni ficent evidence of creative art — both mode rn and a ncient — leave no room to que stion man's divinity. Here then are the \"greater things \" of which Christ spoke , and here again is the triumph of the Christ within the hum an heart. Why this trium ph of the Christ cons cious ness must always be spoke n of in terms o f religion, of church - goi ng and of orthodox belief is one of the incredible trium phs of the forces of evil. To be a citizen of the Kingdom of God doe s not mean that one must necessarily be a member of som e one of the orthodox chur ches. The divine Christ in the hum an heart can expr ess itself in many different departments of hum an living — in politics, in the arts, in econom ic expression and in true social living, in science and in religion. It might be wise here to remember that the onl y time it is recorded th at Christ (as an adul t) visited the Temple of the Jews, He created a disturbance! Hum anity is passing from glory to glory and, in the long panor ama of history, this is strikingl y obs ervable. The glory is toda y revealed in every department of hum an activity , and the Transfigur ation of thos e who are on the crest of the hum an wave of civilisation is very close at hand. 4. Finally, in the trium ph of the Crucifixion or (as it is more accurately called in the East) the Great"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Renunc iation, Christ, for the first ti me, anchor ed on earth a tenuous thread of the divine Will, as it issued from the Father's Hous e (Shamballa), passed into the unde rstandi ng custody of the Kingdom of God, and through the medium of the Christ was brought to the attention of manki nd. Through the instrum entality of certain great Sons of God the three divine aspects or characteristics of the divine Trinity — will, love and intelligence — have becom e a part of human thinki ng and aspiration. Christians are apt to forget that the crisis in t he final hou rs of the Christ was not in thos e spent upon the Cross, but dur ing thos e spent in the Garden of Gethsemane, when His will — in agony and almost despair — was subm erged in that of the Father. \"Father,\" He said, \"not my will but Thine be done .\" (Luke XXII. 42.) Som ething new, yet planne d for from the very depth of time, happe ned then in that qui et garden; Christ, representing manki nd, anchor ed or established the Father's will on earth and made it pos sible for intelligent hum anity to carry it out . Hit herto, that Will had been know n in the Father's Hous e; it had been recogni sed and adapted to world need by the spiritual Hierarchy, working unde r the Christ, and thus took shape as the divine Plan. Toda y, because of what Christ did in His mom ent of crisis hundr eds of years ago, hum anity can add its efforts to the working out of that Plan. The will - to - good of the Father's Hous e can becom e the goodw ill of the Kingdom of God and be transformed into right hum an relations by intelligent hum anity. Thus the direct line or thread of God's will reaches now from the highe st place to the low est poi nt and can, in due time, becom e a cabl e of ascension for the sons of men and of descent for the loving, living spirit of God. I woul d have you forget distance, remoteness an d vague ness and realise that I am talking of exact and literal happe nings on our planet. I am dealing with recogni tions and occurrences and with factual events which are the cons cious pos session of many. The Christ of history and the Christ in the hum an he art are plane tary facts . There is one aspect of this return of the Christ which is never touc hed upon and to which no reference is ever made. I, a hum ble disciple of the Christ, would like here to speak of it. It is the factor of what this com ing out agai n among men, this return to outer everyda y activity, will mean to the Christ as He faces it. How will He feel when the hou r of His appearance arrives? There is a great initiation spoke n of in the New Testament, to which we have given the name o f the Ascension. Of it we know not hing. Only a few items of information are brought to us in the Gospel story: the fact of the mount ain top, of attenda nt watchers, and of the words of Christ, assuring them that He was not leaving them. Then the clouds rece ived Him out of their sight . There were none present who coul d go further with Him. Their cons cious ness coul d not penetrate to the place where He had chos en to go; they even misinterpreted His words and onl y in a vague and mystical sense has hum anity ever unde rstood His disappe arance or the signi ficance of His persistent but unobs erved Presence. The watchers were assured by two of the Know ers of God Who were also present that He woul d com e again in like manne r. He ascende d. The clouds received Him and toda y the clouds which cove r our planet are waiting to reveal Him. He is now waiting to descend. This descent into our unha ppy world of men can present Him with no alluring picture. From the qui et moun tain retreat where He has waited, gui ded and watched ove r h um anity, and where He has trained His disciples, initiates and the New Group of World Servers, He must com e forth and take His place prom inently on the world stage, and take His part in the great drama which is there being played. This time, He will play H is part, not in obs curity as He previous ly did, but before the eyes of the entire world. Because of the smallness of our little planet, and because of the prevalence of the radio, television and the rapidity of com muni cation, His part will be watched by"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST al l, and the prospect must surely, for Him, hol d certain hor ror, must present its tests and major adjustments, plus painful and una voi dable expe rience. He doe s not com e as the om nipot ent God of man's ignor ant creation, but as the Christ, the Foun der of the K ingdom of God on Earth, to com plete the work He started, and again to demons trate divinity in far more difficult circum stances. The Christ suffers, how ever, far more from thos e in His Own hous ehol d than from thos e in the out er world; His work i s more impeded by the adva nced aspirant than by the intelligent thinke r. It was not the cruelty of the outer world of men which caused the depths of sorrow to the Christ; it was His Own disciples, plus the massed sorrow — spread ove r the entire cycle of livi ng — past, present and future — of hum anity. He com es to correct the mistakes and the misrepresentations of thos e who have dared to interpret His simple words in terms of their ow n ignor ance, and to recogni se thos e whos e faithful service has made His return p ossible. He too is facing a major test, preparatory to a great initiation, and when He has passed the test and fulfilled His task He will pass to a still more exalted pos ition in the Father's Hous e or to som e distant place of service where onl y the most ex alted can follow Him; His present pos ition will then be taken by the One Whom He has prepared and trained. But before all this can happe n He must again enter the publ ic arena, play His part in world affairs and prove the scope of His mission. He will gath er around Him, in the flesh, His chos en associates and advi sors; these will not be the one s who gathered around Him in thos e earlier simpler days, but thos e members of our hum an family who toda y recogni se Him and are preparing to work with Him as far as in them lies. It is a different world to which He is now planni ng to return and this is largely due to the intellectual developm ent of the mass of men. This presents Him with stupe ndous difficulties, for the intellects of men must now be reached and not just their hearts (as in the earlier days), if the Will of God is to be intelligently carried out on Earth. His major task is surely the establishing of right hum an relations in every department of hum an living. I woul d ask you to use your divine imagination a nd ende avour to think out what must be the implications of the task which conf ront s Him; I woul d ask you to ponde r on the difficulties which He must inevitably face — the difficulty, above all, of mass intellectual wrong empha sis. He, the Represe ntative of the love of God, is asked to work again in the world arena wherein His earlier message has been negated, forgot ten or misinterpreted for two thous and years, and wherein hate and separativeness have distingui shed all men everyw here. This will plu nge Him into a foreign atmosphe re and into a situation wherein all His divine resour ces will be needed and will be tried to the uttermost. The generally accepted idea that He will return as a trium pha nt warrior, om nipot ent and irresistible, has surely no b asis in fact. That He will ultimately lead His peopl e, hum anity, into Jerusalem is a fact, founde d on a secure founda tion; but it will not be into a Jewish city called Jerusalem, but into \"the place of peace\" (as the word Jerusalem means). A careful cons id eration of the world situation toda y, and a dedicated use of the imagination, will reveal to the sincere thinke r how appa lling is the task which He has unde rtaken. But He has again \"set His face to go up to Jerusalem\" (Luke IX. 51); He will again appe ar an d gui de manki nd into a civilisation and a state of cons cious ness in which right hum an relations and worldw ide coope ration for the good of all will be the uni versal keynot e. He will — through the New Group of World Servers and the men of goodw ill — com plete His association with the Will of God (His Father's bus iness) in such a manne r that the eternal will - to - good will be translated by hum anity into goodw ill and right relations . Then His task will be done ; He will be free again to leave us, this time not to retur n, but to leave the world of men in the hands of that great spiritual Server Who will be the new Head of the Hierarchy, the Chur ch Invi sible."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST The que stion now arises: In what way can we be of service? How can we aid dur ing this preparatory stage? On this poi nt I have but little to say. The whol e idea of His return is so familiar to you in its anticipatory nature (though not in the factual details as I have hinted them to you) that I find it hard to say anyt hing practical or which will arrest you r attentio n. What the members of the spiritual Hierarchy are doing is much inde ed; thos e disciples who are in cons cious touc h with the Masters of the Wisdom — or, if you prefer the term, with the senior disciples of the Christ — are working day and night in order to establish such conf idence, correct attitude s and unde rstandi ng of the divine spiritual \"pus h\" or enterprise that His way will be made easier. They and their groups of lesser disciples, aspirants and stude nts of the realities stand uni tedly behind the Christ and can thus enable Him to accom plish His pur pos e. Their major realisation is that of a cyclic crisis in the spiritual life of our planet; it is one which has been anticipated in the Father's Hous e (Shamballa) for thous ands of years. They have r egistered the fact that, for the first time in hum an history, all the three spiritual centres or groups through which God works are uni tedly focussed on the same obj ective. Shamballa, the Spiritual Hierarchy, and Hum anity (the Father's Hous e, the Kingdom o f God, and the world of men) are all striving in one vast move ment for an intensification of the Light of the World. This Light will irradiate in a fashion unknow n before, not onl y the Father's Hous e, which is the sour ce of all our planetary light , but als o the spiritual centre from which have com e all Thos e Teachers and World Saviour s Who have stood before men and said, as did Hermes, the Buddha and the Christ: \"I am the Light of the World.\" This light will now flood the world of men, bringing illum ination to men's minds and light into the dark places of hum an living. It is light and — above all else — \"life more abunda ntly\" which Christ will bring, and until He brings it we know not what it signi fies; we cannot realise the revelation which this will entail an d the new pos sibilities which will ope n before us. But throug h Him, light and life are on their way, to be interpreted and appl ied in terms of goodw ill and of right hum an relations . For this the spiritual Hierarchy is preparing. This time the Christ will n ot com e alone , for His co - workers will com e with Him. His expe rience and Theirs will be the reverse of the previous one , for this time every eye will see Him, every ear will hear Him, and every mind will pass judgm ent upon Him. Therefore I say that you can freely aid in the reconstruction work which the Christ propos es, if you will familiarise your selves and all men whom you can cont act with the follow ing facts: 1. That the return of Christ is imminent. 2. That the Christ, immanent in every hea rt, can be evoke d in recogni tion of His appe arance. 3. That the circum stances of His return are onl y sym bol ically related in the world Scriptures; this may produc e a vital change in the preconc eived ideas of hum anity. 4. That the major requi red preparati on is a world at peace; how ever, that peace must be based on an educ ated goodw ill, which will lead inevitably to right hum an relations , and therefore to the establishm ent (figur atively speaking) of lines of light between nation and nation, religion and rel igion, group and group, and man and man.

It is pos sible, sur ely, that the ancient truism, \"the mind is the slayer of the real\" may be funda mentally true where the mass of hum anity is conc erned, and that the pur ely intellectual appr oach (which rejects the vision and refuses to accept the unpr ova ble) may be far more at fault than the anticipations of the Know ers of God and the expe ctant multitude . The intelligence of divinity is vested in the spiritual Hierarchy, and that Hierarchy is toda y com pos ed of Thos e Who have uni ted in Themselves bot h the intellect and the in tuition, the practical and the appa rently impractical, the factual way of life and the way of the man who sees a vision. There are also the peopl e who must be found in the market place of daily life; these are the peopl e who must be trained in t he divine recogni tions which are essentially phys ical plane respons es to the new expa nsions of cons cious ness. The Christ Who will return will not be like the Christ Who (appa rently) departed. He will not be a \"man of sorrow s\"; He will not be a silent, pens ive figure; He will be the enunc iator of spiritual statements which will not necessitate interpretation (and give rise to misinterpretation) be cause He will be present to indi cate the true meaning. He has been for two thous and years the supr eme Head of t he Chur ch Invi sible, the spiritual Hierarchy, com pos ed of disciples of all faiths. He recogni ses and love s thos e who are not Christian but who retain their allegiance to their Founde rs — the Buddha , Moha mmed, and others. He cares not what the faith is, if th e obj ective is love of God and of hum anity. If men look for the Christ Who left His disciples centuries ago they will fail to recogni se the Christ Who is in process of returning. The Christ has no religious barriers in His cons cious ness. It matters not to Him of what faith a man may call himself. The Son of God is on His way and He com eth not alone . His adva nce gua rd is already here and the Plan which they must follow is already made and clear. Let recogni tion be the aim. PREPARATION FOR THE REAPPEARANC E OF THE CHRIST June 1947 I have much to say here as a seque nce to my previous com muni cation to you — and here I am speaking to all aspirants and disciples. The oppor tuni ty is so great at this time that I seek to face you with your choi ces, leaving you fre e to make up you r ow n minds . What you decide will, how ever, affect definitely the remainde r of your life activity . Herein lies you r challenge . What I have to say is of a relatively simple nature — so simple that it may seem to you as in the nature of an anti - climax. Yet simple as the probl em may be, it is most difficult to solve. Your reaction to what I have to say will depend upon the nature of you r sense of values, and not upon any capacity for abstruse reasoni ng. The average hum an aspirant and t he intelligent hum an being are apt to empha sise the present com plexity of hum an affairs and events; these they believe are engul fing men in every land. They thus provi de — for themselves — an answerable alibi. The empha sis of what I have to say is related to the message which I recently sent out re the Return of the Christ. That message carried its ow n challenge and the que stions which it arous ed in every sincere hum an heart are: "},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST 1. How can I persona lly meet this challenge ? 2. What can I specifically do? 3. W hat are the steps which I and every aspirant shoul d take? These que stions mean one thing to one person and anot her thing to anot her. Som e of the replies will emerge as you read what I have to say. I am writing here for peopl e who are disciples of the Chri st, but my words can conve y meaning to all sincere thinkers and Christian believers. The com plexities and difficulties of this pos t - war period are very great. The closer an aspirant is to the sour ce of spiritual light and pow er, the more difficult is his problem, and at the same time the clearer will be his unde rstandi ng of the facts. Looki ng away from the detail of the foreground, which ever assum es undue propor tions , and divor cing one self from thos e details as they deluge one 's daily life with perplexiti es and anxi eties, the probl em is relatively simple and twofold in nature. First of all, the out er, phys ical war is onl y just ove r; two years is a shor t time since the firing ceased and no count ry has as yet recove red from its dire effects. There is no tru e intercour se between nations and no true unde rstandi ng. Toda y the United States permits the raising of funds in order to arm the Zioni sts against Great Britain, an ally and a friendl y pow er; it is author ising propa ganda against Russia, also an allied and friendl y pow er. There is no true effort anyw here (carried on with fixed determination and right com prom ise) to bring to an end thos e econom ic condi tions which are the major cause of war and which are respons ible for breeding hatred among nations . Secondl y (and of still more importance from the angl e of the spiritual values, though less easily perceived), the Forces of Evil are still active; they may have been driven back, but they are still pow erful; they are still subt ly working and are still s triving for a firmer foot hol d; they are still cleverly feeding world anxi ety and world insecurity in order to create anot her poi nt of world tension. Until these two sour ces of world tension are recognised and correctly handl ed, the life of the aspirant, a nd still more of the disciple, is exceedingl y hard. You may retort (and truly) that the life of all who suffered through the war, the fate of the starving peopl e who are still taking the brunt of the attack in Europe — the inha bitants of Great Britain, Italy , China, Poland, and the Balkans, plus Germany and Japan, who are respons ible for the difficulty, and all who are engul fed in the results of Germany's attack upon the world — is hard beyond endur ance, and must therefore be shared by all aspirants and discipl es. That is inde ed true. But the more adva nced thinke rs and workers have far more than the general fate to endur e. They — if they ope n their hearts and minds — participate not onl y in the difficulties conf ronting the mass of men everyw here, but they are also a ware of the spiritual pos sibilities ahead, of the task to be com pleted in sealing \"the door where evil dw ells,\" and of the stupe ndous and uni que circum stances which are faced by thos e who recogni se and accept the imminent return of the Christ. As the disc iple conf ront s bot h the inne r and the out er events and pos sibilities, he is apt to register a sense of com plete frustration; he longs to help, but know s not what to do; his grasp of the menacing difficulties, his analysis of his resour ces and of those with whom he works, and his clarity of perception as to the forces range d against him, make him feel inclined to sit back and say: What is the use of any effort I can make? Why not let the two forces of good and evil, of the Black Lodge and the Spir itual Hierarchy, fight it out alone ? Why not permit the pressure of the evol utiona ry current, eventually and at long last, to bring cessation to the fight and the triumph of the good? Why attempt to do it now ? "},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST These are natural reactions when cons idering the present field of conf lict, the prevalent greed and the internationa l and racial antagoni sms, and the selfish motives which cont rol so many nationa l uni ts, plus the dul l apathy of the masses, and in particular, the grow ing suspicion and distrust between the United States and Russia — a situation in which bot h group s are almost equa lly to blame. This war - generating situation is fostered behind the scenes by the highl y clever and strongl y anti - com muni stic pow er of the Rom an Cathol ic Chur ch, with its organise d pol itical plans — plans which are grow ing not ably in the United States. To these, the intelligent thinke r adds the reactiona ry activities in every land, and the fight for oil which gove rns the pol icies of Russia, the United States and Great Britain. To the se factors must be adde d toda y the struggl e between Hindu and Moslem for the cont rol of Indi a, and the fight ove r Palestine — fom ented by the Zionists, and not by the Jews as a whol e — a fight in which the Zioni sts prevented the displaced Jewish persons (onl y 20% of the whol e) from discove ring how welcom e they are in many count ries throughout the world; a fight which has greed and not any love of Palestine behind it, and which is gove rned by financial interests and not by the hum anitarian spirit which the Zioni sts claim and which woul d force them to accept the offers made by Great Britain, Canada, Chile, Belgium and many other lands . These factors, when realised by thinki ng men and wom en, produc e a deep discour agement and a sense of futility and hope lessness. I nstead, they shoul d be faced with cour age , with truth and unde rstandi ng, as well as with the willingne ss to speak factually, with simplicity and with love in the effort to expos e the truth and clarify the probl ems which must be solved. The oppos ing forces of entrenched evil must be rout ed before He for Whom all men wait, the Christ, can com e. The know ledge that He is ready and anxi ous publ icly to appe ar to His love d humanity onl y adds to the sense of general frustration, and anot her very vital q uestion arises: For what period of time must we endur e, struggl e and fight ? The reply com es with clarity; He will com e unfailingl y when a measure of peace has been restored, when the principle of sharing is at least in process of cont rolling econom ic affai rs, and when the chur ches have begun to clean hous e. Then He can and will com e; then the Kingdom of God will be publ icly recogni sed and will no longe r be a thing of dreams and of ideals. Aspirants are prone to ask the que stion as to why the Christ doe s no t com e — in the pom p and ceremony which the chur ches ascribe to the event — and by His com ing demons trate His divine pow er, prove convi ncingl y the author ity and the pot ency of God, and thus end the cycle of agony and distress. The answers to this are many. It must be remembered that the main obj ective of the Christ will not be to demons trate pow er but to make publ ic the already existent Kingdom of God. Again, when He came before He was unr ecogni sed, and is there any gua rantee that this time it woul d be differen t? You may ask why woul d He not be recogni sed? Because men's eyes are blinde d with the tears of self - pity and not of cont rition; because the hearts of men are still corrode d with a selfishne ss which the agony of war has not cured; because the standa rds of value are the same as in the corrupt Rom an Empire which saw His first appe arance, onl y in thos e days these standa rds were localised and not uni versal; because thos e who coul d recogni se Him and who hope and long for His com ing are not willing to make the ne eded sacrifices, and thus ensure the success of His adve nt. Anot her factor militating against His being recogni sed, and one which will proba bly surprise you , is the fact that there are so many exceedingl y good peopl e in the world toda y, so many selfless workers and disciples and so many truly saintly peopl e, that the spiritual com petition woul d call forth a degree of hol iness on His part which woul d negate His appr opriation of a phys ical body of a calibre which woul d enable Him to manifest among men.

I am not , how ever, presenting you with an impos sibility. Mode rn esotericism and the success of scientific, spiritual living are n ow so widely recogni sed that the cons cious ness of men everyw here has been profoundl y affected; this will be increasingl y so as the hope of His com ing and the preparation for it spread among men. The situation indi cates no divine frustration (of which that of the world disciples might be the reflection) , nor doe s it indi cate any inability to appe ar. Rather, it indi cates the wonde r of the divinity in man and the success of the divine plan for man. Divinity, how ever, awaits the expr ession of man's free will. Anot her answer is that when Christ com es forth from the Place of Pow er, bringi ng His disciples, the Masters of the Wisdom , with Him, that Place of Love and Pow er will be situated on earth, and will be publ icly recogni sed; the effects of that appe arance and of that recogni tion will be terrific, calling forth an equa lly terrific ons laught and effort by the Forces of Evil — unless hum anity itself has first sealed \"the door where evil dw ells.\" This must be done by the establ ishing of right hum an relations . Still anot her reply, upon which I woul d ask you to ponde r, is that Christ and the spiritual Hierarchy never — no matter what the incentive may be — infringe upon the divine right of hum anity to achieve freedom by fight ing for freedom , indi vidua lly, natio nally and internationa lly. When true freedom cove rs the earth, we shall see the end of tyranny, politically and religious ly. I refer here not to mode rn democracy, which is at present a phi losophy of wishful thinki ng, but to that state of the realm in which the peopl e themselves will rule; these peopl e will not tolerate authoritarianism in any chur ch, or totalitarianism in any pol itical system or gove rnm ent; they will not accept or permit the rule of any body of men who unde rtake to tell them what they must believe in order to be saved, or what gove rnm ent they must accept. I say not that these desirable obj ectives must be accom plished facts on earth before Christ com es. I do say that this attitude to religion and pol itics must be generally accepted as necessa ry to all men, and that steps must have been successfully taken in the direction of right hum an relations . These are the things which the New Group of World Servers, the disciples, the aspirants and the men of goodw ill everyw here must believe and teach in preparation for His com ing. There is, therefore, not hing to offset the sense of frustration (which is unde niably present and based on factual condi tions ) but the acceptance and the developm ent of a state of mind which will be founde d on a belief in the v eracity of the historical records which bear witness to many adve nts at crucial times in hum an affairs, and to many world Saviour s — of Whom the Christ was the greatest. The right and cons tructive attitude must also be based on an inna te recogni tion of the e xistence of the Christ and of His Presence with us at all times; it must be groun ded in the know ledge that the war — with all its uns peakable hor rors, its cruelties and its cataclysmic disasters — was but the broom of the Father of all, sweeping away obs tructi ons in the path of His returning Son. It woul d have been well - nigh impos sible to prepare for the com ing in the face of the pre - war condi tions . Upon these facts the New Group of World Servers must toda y take their stand. They must recogni se the obs tructing factors, but must also refuse to be frustrated by them; they must be aware of the hindr ances (many of them financial and based on material greed), and then employ such skill in action and such bus iness acum en that these hindr ances will be ove rco me; they must walk clear - eyed through world difficulties and — hol ding His five - poi nted star before them — pass uns cathed and successful through the midst of all frustrating factors."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST I seek not here to deal with the usual spiritual frustrations or wish to was te time with the ordinary platitude s and the well unde rstood replies, which do not aid because they remain platitude s and are not translated into action. I shall deal here with onl y two factors which condi tion the present oppor tuni ty; these can be regarded as so com pletely hinde ring that, unl ess they are remove d, there will be a long delay before Christ can return. They are: 1. The inertia of the average aspirant or spiritually - minde d man. 2. The lack of mone y for the work of preparation. Both these hindr ances are funda mentally based on one and the same thing: materialism — one on the materialism of phy sical effort, and the other on that of a world attitude . Let us keep these themes simple and dow n on the level at which most peopl e work and think toda y; let us be intensely practical and force our selves to look at condi tions as they are, thus arriving at a better know ledge of our selves and of our motives. 1. The Inertia of the Average Spi ritual ly - Minde d Man The average aspirant, man of goodw ill, or disciple , is cons tantly aware of the challenge of the times and the oppor tuni ty which spiritual events may offer. The desire to do good and to accom plish spiritual ends is ceaselessly gna wing away within his cons cious ness. No one who love s his fellow men, who has a dream of seeing the Kingdom of God materialise on earth, or who is cons cious of the awakening of the masses — slow though it may be — to the highe r spiritual values, but is thoroughl y dissatisfied. He realises that what he cont ribut es of help to th ese desirable obj ectives is little inde ed. He know s that his spiritual life is a side issue; it is som ething which he keeps carefully to himself and which he is freque ntly afraid to mention to his nearest and his dearest; he tries to dove tail his spiritual efforts into his ordinary out er life, strugg ling to find time and oppor tuni ty for it in a gentle, futile and innoc uous manne r. He finds himself helpless before the task of organising and rearrangi ng his affairs so that the spiritual way of living may dom i nate; he searches for alibis for himself and eventually rationa lises himself so successfully that he ends by deciding that he is doi ng the best he can in the given circum stances. The truth is that he is doi ng so little that proba bly one hou r out of the twe nty - four (or perhaps two) woul d cove r the time given to the Master's work; he hides behind the alibi that his hom e obl igations prevent his doi ng more, and he doe s not realise that — given tact and lovi ng unde rstandi ng — his hom e envi ronm ent can and must be the field in which he trium phs ; he forgets that there exist no circum stanc es in which the spirit of man can be defeated or in which the aspirant cannot meditate, think, talk and prepare the way for the coming of the Christ, provi ded he cares enough and know s the meaning of sacrifice and silence. Circum stanc es and environm ent offer no true obs tacle to the spiritual life. Perhaps he hides behind the alibi of poor health, and freque ntly behind that of imaginary ills. He gives so much time to the care of himself that the hour s which coul d be given to the Master's work are directly and serious ly curtailed; he is so preoccupi ed with feeling tired, or tendi ng a cold, or with fancied heart difficulties, that his \"body cons cious ness\" steadily develops unt il it eventual ly dom inates his life; it is then too late to do anyt hing. This is particularly the case with peopl e who have reached their fiftieth year or ove r; the troubl e then is predominantly with wom en. It is an alibi which it is hard not to use, for many feel tired and ailing and this, as the years go by, is apt to get worse. The onl y cure for the creeping inertia is to ignor e the body and take your joy in the livingne ss of service. This leads to"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST a longe r life. I speak here not of definite disease or of s erious phys ical liabilities; to these right care and attention must be dul y given; I speak to the thous ands of ailing men and wom en who are preoccupi ed with taking care of themselves, and so waste hour s of the time which coul d be given to the service of hu manity. I ask thos e who are seeking to tread the Path of Discipleship to release thos e many hour s spent in needless self - care into the service of the Hierarchy. Still anot her alibi leading to inertia is the fear people have of speaking about the things of the Kingdo m of God to others; they are afraid of being rebuf fed, or of being thought peculiar, or of intrudi ng. They therefore preserve silence, lose oppor tuni ty, and never discove r how ready peopl e are for the discussion of realities, for the com fort and hope which the thought of Christ's return can bring, or for the sharing of spiritual light . This is essentially a form of spiritual cow ardice, but it is so widespread that it is respons ible for the loss of millions of hou rs of world service. There are, b rother of mine, other alibis, but the three above not ed are the most com mon; the release of the majority of aspirants from these hinde ring conditions woul d bring to the service of the Christ (to use the langua ge of the labour union) so many man - hour s and s o much ove rtime ende avour that the task of thos e who adm it no alibis woul d be greatly light ened and the com ing of the Christ woul d be much nearer than it is toda y. What we call inertia is not simply psychol ogi cal in nature. The qual ities of matter or subs t ance itself are invol ved. Inertia is the slow est and the low est aspect of material subs tance and is called in the Eastern philosophy, the qua lity of tamas. It has to be transmuted into a highe r qua lity, that of activity or (giving it its technical term) it s rajasic qua lity, and this leads later on to the highe st qua lity of rhyt hm or sattva. To the rhythm of life unde r which the Christ and the spiritual Hierarchy ope rate, and which vibrates in harmony with hum an need and hierarchical respons e, I c all you not . I do, how ever, call you to demons trate the qua lity of activity and to refuse to hide behind alibis. It is essential that all aspirants recogni se that in the place where they now are, among the peopl e who are their karmic associates, and with t he psychol ogi cal and phys ical equi pm ent with which they are endow ed, they can and must work. I shall not labour this subj ect. There is no pos sible coercion or undue pressure exerted in the service of the Hierarchy. The situation is clear and simple. There are at the present time three great activities goi ng on: First, the activity to be felt in the \"centre where the will of God is know n,\" that will - to - good which has carried all creation on tow ard a greater glory and a steadily deepening, intelligent respon siveness; this toda y is creatively ende avour ing to bring in the new world order, the order of the Kingdom of God unde r the phy sical supe rvision of the Christ. This might be regarded as the externalisation of the spiritual Hierarchy of our planet. Of this, the return of the Christ to visible activity will be the sign and the sym bol . Secondl y, the critical activity which is condi tioni ng the spiritual Hierarchy, from the Christ Himself dow n to the low est aspirant to be found on the periphe ry of that centre wh ere the love of God has full play. There it is fully realised that (in the words of St. Paul) \"the whol e creation groaneth and travaileth in pain toge ther unt il now , waiting for the manifestation of the Sons of God\" . It is for that manifestation that They now prepare, these \"Sons of God Who are the Sons of Men\"; it is for this com ing forth to out er active service that They are already — one by one — entering into out er activity upon the phys ical plane. They are not recogni sed for what They are, but They go abou t the Father's bus iness, demons trating goodw ill, seeking to enlarge the hor izon of hum anity, and thus prepare the way for the One Whom They serve, the Christ, the Master of all the Masters and the Teacher alike of ange ls and of men. "},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Thirdly, there is hum a nity itself, \"the centre which we call the race of men\" — a centre at present full of chaos, turmoil and conf usion, a hum anity full of pain, bewilderment, disturbance, yet mentally aware of infinite pos sibilities, emotiona lly fight ing for that pla n which seems to them to be the best, but with no sense of cohe rency or any realisation that it must be the one world for the one hum ani ty . They desire simply emotiona l peace, security in which to live and work, and a vision of a future which will satisfy som e inchoa te sense of divine persistence. They are phys ically ill, deprived for the most part of the essentials of nor mal whol esom e living, wracked with the sense of financial insecurity and — cons cious ly or unc ons cious ly — invoki ng the Father of all on behal f of themselves and of the rest of the world. The solution is the return of the Christ . This is the ascertained will of God; it is the desire of Christ Himself and of His disciples, the Masters of the Wisdom ; it is the unr ealised demand of men in all land s. Where there is uni fication of purpos e, of spiritual intention and of realised need, then there is onl y one thing which can arrest that return, and that is the failure of manki nd to prepare the stage for that stupe ndous event, to clear the highw ays, fami liarise the peopl e with the idea, and bring about the requi red measure of peace on Earth — a peace based upon right hum an relations . 2. The Lack of Mone y for the Work of Prepar ation We com e now to the second of the major hindr ances: the lack of financial suppor t for the Christ's workers and disciples in all lands as they ende avour to release spiritual energy and bring a new order out of the present world chaos. This is perhaps the major difficulty, and it appe ars at times an insupe rable one ; it invol ves th e probl em of true financial trusteeship and the deflection of adequa te sum s of mone y into channe ls which will definitely aid in the work of preparation for the return of the Christ. It is for this reason that I closed the previous section of this article w ith the words \"right hum an relations .\" The probl em is therefore a peculiarly hard one , for the spiritual workers of the world have not onl y to train peopl e to give according to the need and their means, but in many cases they have first of all to provi de them with a motive so magne tic in its appe al that they must perforce give; they have also to provi de the trust, founda tion and organisation through which the mone y given may be adm inistered. This presents them with a most impressively difficult task and one which is respons ible for the present impasse. The impasse is not , how ever, based onl y on the nove lty of raising funds in preparation for the return of the Christ, but it is based also on the trained selfishne ss of the majority of thos e who ow n the world's wealth and who — even if they give — do so because it fosters prestige or indi cates financial success. It must be remembered here that every generalisation presuppos es exceptions . Generalising, and therefore ove r - simplifying the subj ect, we can a ssum e that mone y finds its way into four main channe ls of expe ndi tures: 1. Into the myriad hom es of the world in the form of wages, salaries or inhe rited wealth. All this is at present most une venly balanced, produc ing extreme riches and extreme pove rty. 2. Into great capi talistic systems and monopol ies to be found as tow ering structures in most lands . Whether this capital is ow ned by the gove rnment, or by a muni cipality, or by a handf ul of wealthy men or by the great labou r uni ons matters not . Little of it is yet spent in reality for the betterment of hum an living, or for the inculcation of the values which will lead to right hum an relations ."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST 3. Into the chur ches and religious groups througho ut the world. Here (again speaking in general terms and at the same time recogni sing the existence of a small spiritually - minde d minor ity) the mone y is deflected into the material aspects of the work, into the multiplying and preservation of ecclesiastical structures, into salaries and general ove rhead, and onl y a percentage of it really goe s into the teaching of the peopl e, into a living demons tration of the fact of His return — for centuries a definite doc trine of the chur ches. That return has been anticipated dow n the ages, and might have occurred ere now h ad the chur ches and religious organisations everyw here done their dut y. 4. Into phi lant hropi c, educ ational and medical work. All of this has been exceedingl y good and greatly needed, and the debt of the world to the publ ic - spirited men who have made these institutions pos sible is great inde ed. All of this has been a step in the right direction and an expr ession of the divine will - to - good. It is, how ever, freque ntly mone y misused and misdirected and the values develope d have been largely institutiona l and c onc rete. They have been limited by the separative tenets of the donor s or the religious prejudi ces of thos e who cont rol the disbursement of the funds . In the qua rrelling ove r ideas, religious theories and ideologi es, the true assistance of the One Hum anity is ove rlooke d. The fact remains that had the directing agencies through whos e hands the mone y of the world is channe lled any vision of the spiritual realities, of the one hum anity and the one world, and had their obj ective been the stimulation of right h um an relations , the mass of men everyw here woul d be respondi ng to a vision very different from the present one ; we woul d not be faced as we are toda y with the expe ndi tures — runni ng into count less billions — necessitated by the need to restore phy sically , not onl y the phys ical bodi es of count less millions of men, but entire cities, transpor tation systems and centres respons ible for the reorganisation of hum an living. Equa lly, it can be said that if the spiritual values and the spiritual respons ibilities attach ed to mone y (in large qua ntities or in small) had been prope rly appreciated and taught in hom es and school s, we woul d not have had the appa lling statistics of the mone y spent, prior to the war in every count ry in the world (and spent toda y in th e Western Hemisphe re), on candy, liquor , cigarettes, recreation, unne cessary clothes and luxur ies. These statistics run into hund reds of millions of dollars every year. A quot a of this mone y, necessitating the minimum of sacrifice, would enable the discipl es of the Christ and the New Group of World Servers to prepare the way for His com ing and to educ ate the minds and hearts of men in every land in right hum an relations . Mone y — as with all else in hum an living — has been tainted by selfishne ss and grabbe d for selfish indi vidua l or nationa l ends . Of this, the world war (1914 - 1945) is the proof , for although there was much talk of \"saving the world for democracy\" and \"fight ing a war to end war,\" the main motive was self - protection and self - preservation, the hope of gain, the satisfaction of ancient hatreds, and the regaining of territory. The two years which have elapsed since the war have prove d this to be so. The United Nations is occupi ed with rapacious demands from all sides, with the angl ing of the nations f or place and pow er, and for the pos session of the natural resour ces of the Earth — coal, oil, etc., and also with the unde rground activities of the great Pow ers and of the capitalists which they all create. Yet all the time, the one hum anity — no matter what the place of residence, what the colour of the skin, or what the religious beliefs — is clamour ing for peace, justice and a sense of security. All this, the right use of mone y and a realisation on the part of many of their financial respons ibility (a respons ibility based on the spiritual values) woul d rapidly give them. With the exception of a few great far - sight ed phi lanthropi sts, and of a mere handf ul of enlight ened statesmen, chur chm en and educ ators, this sense"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST of financial respons ibility is to be found no where. The time has now com e when mone y must be re - valued and its usefulness channe lled into new directions . The voi ce of the peopl e must prevail, but it must be a peopl e educ ated in the true values, in the signi ficances of a right culture, and in the need for right hum an relations . It is therefore essentially a que stion of right educ ation and correct training in world citizenship — a thing that has not yet been unde rtaken. Who can give this training? Russia woul d gladly train the world in the idea ls of com muni sm, and woul d gather all the mone y in the world into the coffers of the proletariat, eventually produc ing the greatest capitalistic system the world has ever seen. Great Britain woul d gladly train the world in the British conc epts of justice a nd fair play and world trade, and woul d do it more cleverly than any other nation because of vast expe rience. The United States woul d also gladly unde rtake to force the American brand of democracy upon the world, using her vast capital and resour ces in so doi ng, and gathering into her banks the financial results of her wide - spread financial dealings , preserving them safely by the threat of the atom ic bom b and the shaking of the mailed fist ove r the rest of the world. France will keep Europe in a state of un rest as she seeks to regain her lost prestige and garner all she can from the victory of the other allied nations . Thus , my brother, the story goe s — each nation fight ing for itself and rating each other in terms of resour ces and finance. In the meantime, hu manity starves, remains une duc ated, is brought up on false values and the wrong use of mone y; until these things are being righted, the return of the Christ is not pos sible. In the face of this disturbing financial situation, what is the answer to the pro blem? There are men and wom en to be found in every land, every gove rnm ent, every chur ch and religion, and every educ ationa l founda tion who have the answer. What hope is there for them and for the work with which they have been entrusted? How can the peopl e of the world, the men of goodw ill and of spiritual vision help? Is there anyt hing they can do to change the thinking of the world in regard to mone y, and to deflect it into channe ls where it will be right ly used? The answer lies within these peopl e themse lves. There are two groups who can do much: thos e already using the financial resour ces of the world, if they will catch the new vision and also see the handw riting on the wall which is bringing the old order dow n in destruction; and secondl y, the mass of the good, kindl y peopl e in all classes and sphe res of influence. The pow er of the little man and of the unimpor tant citizen is not yet truly grasped, yet there is a vast oppor tuni ty before them if they have the courage and the patience to do t he needed work. These men and wom en of goodw ill and spiritual inclination must reject the thought of their relative uselessness, insigni ficance and futility, and realise that now (in the critical and crucial mom ent that has com e) they can work pot ently. T he Forces of Evil are defeated, though not yet \"sealed\" behind the door where hum anity can put them and which the New Testam ent foretold woul d happe n. The world is in the balance again. Evil is seeking every avenue available for a new appr oach but — and this I say with conf idence and insistence — the little peopl e of the world, enlight ened and selfless in their viewpoi nt, exist in sufficient numbers to make their pow er felt — if they will. There are millions of spiritually - minde d men and wom en in every count ry wh o, when they com e to the poi nt of appr oaching in mass formation this que stion of mone y, can permanently rechanne l it. There are writers and thinke rs in all lands who can add their pow erful help, and who will if correctly appr oached. There are esoteric stud ents and devot ed chur ch peopl e to whom appe al can be made for aid in preparing the way for the return of the Christ, particularly if the aid requi red is the expe ndi ture of mone y and time for the establishing of right hum an relations and the grow th and spre ad of goodw ill. "},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST A great campaign to raise mone y is not demande d, but the selfless work of thous ands of appa rently uni mpor tant peopl e is requi red. I woul d say, my brothers, that the most needed qua lity is cour age ; it takes cour age to put aside diffidence, shyne ss and the dislike of presenting a poi nt of view, particularly a poi nt of view conne cted with mone y. It is here that the majority fail. It is relatively easy toda y to raise mone y for the Red Cross, for hos pitals and for educ ationa l institut ions . It is exceedingl y difficult to raise mone y for the spread of goodw ill, or to secure financial sour ces and the right use of mone y for forward looki ng ideas, such as the return of the Christ. Therefore I say that the first prerequi site is cour age . The second requi rement for the workers of the Christ is to make thos e sacrifices and arrange ments which will enable them to give to the limit of their capacity; there must not be simply a trained ability to present the subj ect, but each worker must practise w hat he preaches. If, for instance, the millions of peopl e who love the Christ and seek to serve His cause gave at least a tiny sum of mone y each year, there woul d be adequa te funds for His work; the needed trusts and the spiritually - minde d trustees woul d t hen autom atically appe ar. The difficulty is not with the organising of the mone y and work; it lies with the seeming inability of peopl e to give. For one reason or anot her, they give little or not hing, even when interested in such a cause as that of the ret urn of the Christ; fear, or the love of pur chasing, or the desire to give presents, or failure to realise that many small sum s mount up into very large sum s — all these things militate against financial generosity, and the reason always seems adequa te. There fore, the second prerequi site is for everyone to give as they can . Thirdly, the metaphys ical school s and the esoteric groups have given much thought to this bus iness of directing mone y into channe ls which appe al to them. The que stion is often asked: Why d o the Unity School of thought , the Christian Science Chur ch, and many New Thought move ments always manage to accum ulate the requi red funds , whilst other groups, and particularly the esoteric groups , do not ? Why do truly spiritual workers seem una ble to mat erialise what they need? The answer is a simple one. Thos e groups and workers who are the closest to the spiritual ideal are as a hous e divided against itself. Their main interest is on abstract spiritual levels, and they have not appa rently grasped the fa ct that the phys ical plane, when motivated from the spiritual levels, is of equa l impor tance. The large metaphys ical school s are focussed on making a material demons tration, and so great is their empha sis and so one - poi nted is their appr oach tha t they get what they demand; they have to learn that the demand and its answer must be the result of spiritual pur pos e, and that that which is demande d must not be for the use of the separated self or for a separative organisation or chur ch. In the new age which is upon us, prior to the return of the Christ, the demand for financial suppor t must be for the bringing about of right hum an relations and goodw ill, and not for the grow th of any particular organisation. The organisations so demandi ng must work wit h the minimum of ove rhead and central plant, and the workers for the minimum yet reasona ble salary. Not many such organisations exist toda y, but the few now func tioni ng can set an example which will be rapidly follow ed, as the desire for the return of the Christ grow s. Therefore the third prerequi site is the service of the one hum ani ty . The four th prerequi site must be the careful presentation of the caus e for which the financial suppor t is requi red. Peopl e may have the cour age to speak, but an intelligent presentation is of equa l importance. The major poi nt to be empha sised in the preparatory work for the return of Christ is the establishing of right hum an relations . This has already been started by men of goodw ill all ove r the world, unde r their many names , and here I have done naught but indi cate anot her motive for presentation. We com e now to the fifth prerequi site: a vital and sure belief in hum ani ty as a whol e . There must be no pessimism as to the future of manki nd or distress ove r the disappe arance of the old order. The good , the"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST true and the beaut iful is on its way, and for it manki nd is respons ible, and not som e out er divine intervention. Hum anity is sound and rapidly awakening. We are passing through the stage where everything is being proclaimed fr om the hous etops — as the Christ stated woul d be the case — and as we listen or read of the flood of filth, crime, sensual pleasure or luxur y buyi ng, we are apt to be discour aged; it is wise to remember that it is whol esom e for all this to com e to the surface and for us all to know about it. It is like the psychol ogi cal cleansing of the subc ons cious to which indi vidua ls subm it themselves, and it presages the inaugur ation of a new and better day. There is work to do, and the men of goodw ill, of spiri tual instinct, and of truly Christian training must do it. They must inaugur ate the era of the use of mone y for the spiritual Hierarchy, and carry that need into the realms of invoc ation. Invoc ation is the highest type of prayer there is, and a new form of divine appe al which a know ledge of meditation has now made pos sible. To this end I will give you a shor t form of spiritual demand which I woul d ask you all to use in the place of any prayer, meditation or invoc ation for mone y which you may have hitherto u sed. It is shor t and pow erful, but requi res a uni fied group or a truly integrated persona lity to use it.... I have naught to add in the way of an appe al for funds , cour age or unde rstandi ng. If the cour age of the Christ, as He faces return to this phys ical out er world, if the need of hum anity for right hum an relations , and the sacrificing work of the disciples of the Christ are not enough to fire you and to energise you and thos e whom you can reach, there is not hing that I can say which will be of any use. WO RK IN THE COMING DECADES April 1948 This is the last Wesak Message which I intend to give you. In 1949 , I shall have com pleted thirty years of carefully planne d and meticulous ly outlined work; this work I unde rtook unde r cyclic law (related to the periodi cal giving out of the esoteric teaching) in order to aid hum anity and the work of the Hierarchy, to bot h of which I happe n to belong . On Nove mber 19t h, 1919 , I made my first cont act with A.A.B. (much to her distress and dismay), and I have worked s teadily with her ever since. The boo ks which I then planne d have been well - nigh finished; the various pha ses of the work which were a part of the preparation for the reappe arance of the Christ have taken form and shoul d go forward with gathering momentum dur ing the next twenty years. The two major ideas which it was my task to bring to the attention of hum anity everyw here througho ut the world have been securely anchor ed (if I may be permitted to use such a term), and these cons titute by far the most important aspect of the work which I have done . These formulated ideas are: 1. The announc ement of the existence (hitherto unr ecogni sed) of the New Group of World Servers . This is an effective group of workers, intermediate between Hum anity and the s piritual Hierarchy of the planet. "},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST 2. The statement, sent out lately, in conne ction with the Reappe aranc e of the Christ , and for the immediate cons olidation of the work of preparation. All else that I have done in the service of the Hierarchy is of second ary impor tance to these two statements of spiritual fact . The fifth vol um e of A Treatise on the Seven Rays remains to be finished, as doe s the second vol um e of Discipleship in the New Age ; there is not hing else; what remains, therefore, can easily be acco mplished before my term of thirty years com es to an end. Other work awaits me unde r the reorganisation of all the hierarchical efforts incident to the reappe arance of the Christ and the closer relations hip which will then be established between hum anity an d the Hierarchy. The work of hierarchical reorganisation is at present largely internal and conc erns not humanity at this time. I have made it entirely clear to all of you what is the work which you shoul d do and I have no intention (in this final message ) of pleading with you to do it — beyond asking you to carry on where I leave off. I refer of cour se to my exot eric work. That the work which I am now doi ng was definitely endi ng in 1949 was qui te unknow n to A.A.B. and has no relation whatsoever to the fact that her health is precarious . It has, how ever, som e relation to the fact that she has resum ed more active work as a disciple in the Ashram of her ow n Master, after twenty - eight years of service in mine. Before I began the work of the past thre e decades, I kne w exactly the time I had in which to bring about the results desired by the Hierarchy; all has been meticulous ly carried out unde r a most clearly visione d plan. First, there was the necessity to find the nuc leus of peopl e through whom I ha d to work; the first step was therefore the writing of certain books which woul d carry the new teaching, and act therefore as a selective agent for the discove ry of thos e who would work in the new emerging cycle. The starting of the Arcane School by A.A.B . was only incidental to this obj ective; its aim is to train thos e disciples who can implement the Plan and thus prepare for the reappe arance of the Christ; the Arcane School can therefore provide a trained bod y of workers. Ten years after that, I began t o expa nd the range of cont acts, and the teaching began to reach thinke rs on cont inents other than the American. As a result, I began to form my ow n Ashram and to find peopl e in all count ries who were disciples, qua lified as such, but who needed the impact of the influence of a second ray Ashram. When this was done , the major part of the second decade of my work became pos sible, and I therefore wrote a pamphl et entitled The New Group of World Servers . In it I called attention to the fact that there existed u pon the Earth, in every nation, men and wom en who (in som e form or anot her) recogni sed the spiritual Hierarchy of the planet, who had a qua lity of non - separateness, definitely present or else rapidly developi ng, and who were gathered toge ther in no limitin g organisation but primarily by their trend of thought and the habit of their activity. They cons tituted a group who were subj ectively, spiritually, practically and ope nly creating a new form of hum an relations hip. This new relation resulted in mutual unde rstandi ng and a mental coope ration which recogni sed no barriers or nationa l limitations. On the inne r side of spiritual incentive and ende avour , they work toda y as one group; on the outer side of world affairs, they may not be aware of each othe r phys ically, or arrive at any ope n cont act, yet they are animated by the same principles and are carrying forward — in all nations and in every great department of hum an thinki ng and planni ng — a similar work."},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST In this decade of my work, two major activities were inaugur ated: the creation of the Triangl es and the formation of Men of Goodw ill, 13 * and these are just on the verge of a major creative activity. They cons titute an effort to energise and relate members and adhe rents of the New Group of World Servers (and particularly in the organisation of men of goo dw ill), to find and mobi lise the groups formed by the New Group of World Servers throughout the world, so as to bring adde d strengt h to all of them by swingi ng into a massed effort men of prayer, men of go od intention, and thos e who believe in the divine will - to - good, plus thos e who implement it through love — no matter what they mean by that vague term. Thus a nuc leus of a great synthesis was brought about in this second decade, and it will have lasting effe cts upon hum an living and design. Owing to planetary frustration and the enha nced activity of the Forces of Evil, the work of the Triangles and of the men of goodw ill has been more slow ly formulated than had been originally expe cted, but this has been thro ugh no fault of theirs; this period of frustration will be ove r before very long and a greatly increased mom entum will be the result. For this increased respons e upon the part of the public, you shoul d now lay your plans. In the third and final decade of my work, the time and oppor tuni ty came to announc e, in a new and more empha tic manne r, what all the world religions have proclaimed, that — with due preparation and the establishm ent of a pronounc ed tende ncy tow ards right hum an relations — the time had com e wh en the Christ coul d again appe ar and take His right ful place as World Teacher. The empha sis has never before been laid upon the needed work of preparation. The results of this pronounc ement have not yet had time to make themselves felt, but the next ten years will reveal the full impor t of what has been done . With that pronounc ement my planne d work was brought to a finish; the book 14 The Reappe aranc e of the Christ .* which will indi cate the proxi mity of this happe ning and the lines along which the new world religion will be prom oted is now in the press. I woul d call your attention to the fact that the general conc ept of a World Saviour (always attached to the office of the Christ, no matter by what name the exalted Son of God may be called in any w orld cycle) is in reality closely related to the far more impor tant func tion of World Teacher. Peopl e love to be saved, for it ignor es their ow n immediate respons ibility, which teaching definitely empha sises. It must be remembered that it is the teaching g iven by the Christ which saves hum anity — not any sym bol ic death upon a cross. Men must save themselves by their reaction and their respons e to the teaching given in its pur ity by the Christ ; this is a poi nt which shoul d be forcefully instilled by all of you ; it is not man - made interpretations which save a man, but his self - initiated appl ication of his ow n unde rstandi ng of the teaching. This must be brought toda y to the cons cious ness of as many hum an beings as the follow ers of the Christ can reach. Here you have a brief account of the work which I unde rtook on behalf of the Hierarchy and for the Christ, Whom I most reverently regard as my Master. This work has not been uns uccessfully carried forward; many of you who read these words have done what you coul d t o help and of this I am not unm indf ul nor is the Hierarchy ung rateful. Perhaps — with a still clearer picture in you r minds — you will find your selves able to do still more. I intend to indi cate (still briefly) what shoul d be done in the next two decades, but woul d like first of all to touc h upon the state of the world and refer to its condi tion, because they have bot h handi cappe d hierarchical effort and particularly what I sought to do (which was a major hierarchical enterprise), and yet at the sam e time they have cleared the way in a most extra - ordinary manne r for the appe arance of the Christ. "},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST When I began my exot eric work in 1919, I had not expe cted to be frustrated by the second world war, or rather by the final pha se of World War I. The Hierarc hy had hope d that the lesson had been severe enough to force thos e change s which were essential to the future of manki nd. But hum anity had not learned the needed lessons . As I have often told you, the Hierarchy — because of the divine principle of free will in hum anity — cannot foretell how men will act in times of crisis; the Hierarchy cannot enforce the good way of life against nor mal hum an desire, for this good way of action must com e from out the very depths of human thinki ng and feeling, and must emerge as a free and non - supe rvised ende avour ; the Hierarchy may not take thos e pos sible steps which will prevent men making mistakes, for it is through thos e mistakes that men learn \"by the means of evil that good is best,\" as your great initiate - poe t has expr esse d it. All that the Hierarchy can do is to present the needed teaching which will direct man's thinki ng along right lines, to poi nt the way of true relations hips, and at the same time demons trate obj ectively the nature of the bad way. This the Hierarchy has always done . As a spiritual group, They can and do set Their faces against selfishne ss, greed, and against all that seeks to imprison the hum an spirit and impair its freedom . To illustrate — the Hierarchy demons trated against the totalitarianism which the t wo great Pow ers, Germany and Japan expr essed when they precipitated the second world war. This They still do and will cont inue to do when any aspect of totalitarian greed and aggr essiveness in any form (subt le and unde clared or ope nly demons trated) attempt s to limit the freedom of the indi vidua l, the free spiritual man, no matter what his poi nt in evol ution. Tow ard the end of the second decade of my work, totalitarianism reared anew its most evil head, and perforce, the Hierarchy took sides against this pr imary principle of evil, though never against any group of hum an beings . Please not e this. The poi nt I seek to make is that the Hierarchy is inflexibly against any demons tration of the principle of non - freedom, no matter what form it takes, but is ever on the side of hum ani ty. The spirit of evil which animated German actions evoke d every pos sible oppos ition from the Forces of Light and from their sour ce, the Hierarchy. Toda y this totalitarian evil is expressing itself through the planni ng of the Russian oligarchy, through the Zioni st move ment, and through all groups which seek to fetter and imprison the spirit of man; but the peopl e unde r the sway of this evil influence and the scheming of these evil groups are never regarded in any light differe nt to that of the rest of manki nd. They are looke d upon as glamoured, or as weak and ignor ant (which they undoubt edly are), but they are never separated off in the thinki ng and planni ng of the Hierarchy from the rest of manki nd. The evil must not be permit ted or allow ed to trium ph, but the unha ppy and glamour ed expone nts of this evil are love d, along with the rest of manki nd. This is a point which is hard for the illogi cal thinke r to unde rstand, but it expr esses most truly the attitude of the Christ and of all who serve His cause. With the focussed entrance of greed and of totalitarian ruthlessness into the world arena, much that I had planne d and much that all of you were attempting to do, met with frustration; the work of all disciples was in many ways gr eatly hinde red and handi cappe d, though not from the long range vision, but onl y from the angl e of shor t range action. I would ask you to have this in mind. The vision stands even when immediate action is blocked. Toda y it woul d appe ar, from all the indi ca tions and from the dom inant world trends , that the still unc onque red greed of certain of the more pow erful nations is unde niably rampant, and that we are therefore facing anot her period of frustration and of major world difficulty. Feeling against Russia i s runni ng high among the Western Pow ers and is largely her ow n fault, though it is primarily based upon two main factors — one of them bad and the other good. The bad reaction is based on the same old triplicity of fear, greed and jealous y and — fr om the angl e of"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST thos e three pha ses of selfishne ss — is entirely justified. That fact, in itself, suppl ies a major difficulty. Think this out . The good reaction is based on the frustration of the idea or conc ept of developi ng a uni fied peaceful world — a world in which there woul d be no war and in which men coul d live at peace with each other and in security, and in which men everyw here coul d work, relatively unoppos ed, tow ards right hum an relations . This supe r - world and this uni fied hum anity is a true ideal, b ut is not a feasible project. Spiritual workers shoul d face the various world alternatives: 1. An all - dom inant Russia, whos e regime woul d cove r the planet, enforcing her totalitarian interpretation of com muni stic doc trine (there is a right and true inter pretation), refusing freedom to the indi vidua l in the interest of the State, and — because of a low opi nion of the hum an masses — everyw here standa rdising her interpretation of democracy. 2. A world in which all nations live in an armed armistice, in which d istrust is forever rampant and in which science is prostituted to the art of destruction. In this world an expl osion must and will eventually take place which will destroy hum anity as onc e before it was destroye d, according to the Bible and the other world Scriptures and the hierarchical records. 3. A world in which the United States prove s itself to be the cont rolling factor, after wiping out Russia, which she can well do if she acts now . It will be a predom inantly capitalistic world, run by several natio ns but headed by the United States. A capitalistic nation is not necessarily wrong; capital has its place, and Russia (the enemy of capitalism) is by no means free from capitalistic bias. The motives of the United States are very mixed motives: greed of mo ney or its equi valent, such as oil, and at the same time sincerely good intentions for the establishm ent of human freedom in a democratic world — mode lled, of cour se, on American democracy. Other motives are an appr eciation of the armed fist and, at the same time, a longi ng for econom ic sharing and for that essential kindne ss which is such a strong American characteristic — a mass characteristic. These mixed motives will produc e eventually a very conf used world, one in which it will be found that hum anity has learned very little as the result of the World War (1914 - 1945) and is acqui escent to the cycle of well - intentione d mone y cont rol. 4. A world divided into \"blocs\" for mutual aid and econom ic sharing. Of this, the propos ed treaty between Great Br itain, France and the Benelux count ries is a tentative sample, though tainted by obj ectiona ble motives, from the angl e of the Hierarchy. Fear is the major factor produc ing this treaty, but it has in it nevertheless the seeds of hope . There is not hing intri nsically wrong in any group of nations standi ng toge ther for mutual aid and econo mic coope ration. The wrong factor com es in when they stand uni ted agai nst any other group of nations, and therefore against any group of hum an beings . It is this attitude , eng ineered and fostered by Russia, which has lead to the relatively new conc ept of blocs agai nst . Along this line, and with this attitude of antagoni stic group ings , onl y disaster can lie. Blocs in themselves can be good and prope r if they follow lines of nat ural cleavages, of langua ge differences and of cultural distinctions . They can be essentially right if they are formed for econom ic, educ ationa l, religious and social aims and can therefore provi de no true cause for alarm. Such blocs woul d be cultural and not militaristic, econom ic and not greedy, and they coul d provi de a normal and progr essive move ment away from the separative nationa lism of the past and tow ards the distant creation of the One World, and the One Hum anity. This will som e day be seen, but th e time is not yet.

As yet, there are more seeds of dange r in this conc ept than there are of helpfulness. Nevert heless, it is a dream which will som e day materialise, after the creation and the func tioni ng of blocs have prove d how men shoul d work and live toge ther. The United Nations is still the hope of the world and can remain so; it is a great field o f expe rimentation, but is suffering toda y from an initial error. That error was the adm itting of a totalitarian Pow er into its nations . For seven long and terrible years the Forces of Light had been fight ing totalitarianism. In the early days of the post - w ar period the Nations com prom ised with principles and adm itted Russia to the United Nations. Had they proceeded to uni te all the other nations of the world on the sure ground of econom ic reform, of needed nationa l reorganisation and of regional groups (a b etter term than \"blocs\"), Russia woul d have been forced to conf orm, for her very existence woul d have been at stake. An initial error can lead to much troubl e, and it is this type of troubl e which the United Nations toda y faces. I have here given you the pos sibilities with which the work is challenge d and conf ront ed, and again I must refuse to foretell what will happe n. It is not permitted. I have felt it necessary to sum marise the situation because it is in this world that you and all men of goodw ill will have to work for the next twenty years; this period of settlement will not be an easy one in which the disciples of the Christ have to prepare for His appe arance. The two decades ahead of you are thos e in which you must bring to fruition the seeds which I have planted. Though I shall not be actively and out wardly working with you or com muni cating with you as I have done ove r the past thirty years, you will have my books (which will then be finished) and the relation which I now hol d to you and to all the a ctivities which I have helped you to inaugu rate will remain basically the same; it will be more subj ective but many in the world toda y know the means of reaching me. The Christ, Whom I serve as a disciple, and the spiritual Hierarchy, of which I am a memb er, are drawing steadily nearer to hum anity; in the past I have used the statement to reassure you, \"The Hierarchy stands \"; toda y I say to you, \"The Hierarchy is near.\" The work that must be done in the two com ing decades is as follow s, and I shall not en large upon it because you have been trained to do it; you know what to do and the respons ibility is your s — as will be my unf ailing help. 1. Prepare men for the reappe arance of the Christ. This is your first and greatest dut y. The most impor tant part of that work is teaching men — on a large scale — to use the Invoc ation so that it becom es a world prayer and focusses the invoc ative demand of hum anity. 2. Enlarge the work of the Triangl es so that, subj ectively and etherically, light and goodw ill may e nve lop the earth. 3. Prom ote ceaselessly the work of World Goodw ill, so that every nation may have its group of men and wom en dedicated to the establishing of right hum an relations . You have the nuc leus, and expa nsion must be unde rtaken. You have the prin ciple of goo dw ill present throughout the world; the task will be heavy inde ed but far from impos sible. 4. Unde rtake the cons tant distribut ion of my books , which cont ain much of the teaching for the New Age. In the last analysis, the books are your working tool s and the instrum ents whereby you will train your workers. See that they are kept in steady circulation."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST 5. Ende avour to make the Wesak Festival (at the time of the May Full Moon) a uni versal festival and know n to be of value to all men of all faiths . It is the festival in which the two divine Leaders, of the East and of the West, collaborate toge ther and work in the closest spiritual uni on; the Christ and the Buddha use this festival each year as the poi nt of inspiration for the com ing year's work. S ee that you do likewise. The spiritual energies are then uni que ly available. 6. Discove r the members of the New Group of World Servers, whenever pos sible, and strengt hen their hands . Look for them in every nation and expr essing many lines of thought and p oints of view. Remember always that in doc trine and dogm a, and in techni que s and methods , they may differ widely from you , but in love of their fellow men, in practical goodw ill and in devot ion to the establishing of right hum an relations they stand with yo u, they are your equa ls, and can proba bly teach you much. And now : What shall I say to you in closing, my com rades, my brothers and my co - disciples? I have said to you so much ove r the past years that there is little left to say; you have all y ou need wherewith to carry on the work, impul sed from the Hierarchy, through what I have attempted to do. I can onl y say that I have conf idence in you and that I expe ct no slackening of effort from you. You are dedicated and cons ecrated and will remain so, for the closeness of the Hierarchy and the nearness of the Christ indi cate to you increased sour ces of strengt h. May the blessing of the One Whom we all serve rest upon you all and upon all disciples everyw here, and may you do your full share in helping men to pass from darkne ss into light and from death to immortality. THE ASHRAMS CONCERNED AT THE COMING June 1948 The Full Moon is upon us and the thought s of the world (to a far larger extent than you realise) are directed tow ards the Christ. It is upon His conc erns that I speak to you toda y, inextricably bound up, as they are, with the conc erns of hum anity, and this by His Own choi ce. Many toda y in all lands are turning their thought s cons cious ly to Him; others are aware of a vague turning tow ards s om e divine Person or Pow er Who must and shoul d help manki nd in its hou r of need. There is a rising, an ascension of the spirit of man everyw here which is better kno wn to us than to you , whos e values and reactions are not so spiritual. The strengt h, the pow er and the special energies which He received at that dramatic mom ent when He, the Buddha and the Lord of the World created a Triangl e of Light at the time of the Wesak Festival, will be released by Him at the hou r of the Full Moon of June . This Light has been conc entrated upon the \"centre which we call the race of men,\" but it has not yet been released. At the Full Moon it will be pour ed out all ove r the Earth. During the interim between reception and distribut ion, it has been transformed into t he energy of goodw ill and into that light which will illum ine the minds of men. The Great Invoc ation — now being used by so many — has greatly facilitated the receptivity of men; the creative appe arance of effective goodw ill can, how ever, be som e time in mani festing. Nevertheless,"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST not hing can arrest its subt le working and its eventual widespread appe arance, on a scale great enough to be effective throughout the whol e world. This greatly to be desired expression of divine purpos e will be fulfilled if humanity ( as a whol e) stands in steady expe ctancy, wise activity, and makes broad and brotherly decisions . As I have often told you, the final decisions in world affairs have to be made through manki nd's deliberate choi ce; no com pul sion is ever exerted by the Hierar chy or by the disciples of the Christ to force men to take som e desirable action. Man's free will must be preserved. In an uni que manne r, men are toda y facing a period of the freeing of the hum an soul , or a period of its imprisonm ent inde finitely; the righ t decision will lead to the Kingdom of God, and the other to a retrogr ession which will deify the past and prolong past wrong action. This out pour ing of spiritual energy passes through the groups or (to use a techni cal word which is relatively uni mpor tant ) through the Ashrams of all the Masters of the Wisdom , the Disciples of the Christ. It is then transformed or transmuted by them so as to meet adequa tely the needs of the different type s of peopl e who com pos e hum anity and who are represented in the Ashram s by different Masters. Through all the Masters and through all disciples this energy passes, so that all — at their many different stages — may receive the needed stimulation. They precipitate certain specialised aspects of this newly received energy, and the y therefore will be peculiarly active in the com ing period. Five of the Masters and Their five Ashrams are primarily invol ved in this preparatory work. There is first of all the Ashram of the Master K.H., which is the presiding Ashram in this work, ow ing to the fact that it is a second ray Ashram, and therefore upon the same line of spiritual energy and descent as the Christ Himself. Anot her reason is that the Master K.H. will assum e the role of World Teacher in the distant future when the Chris t move s on to highe r and more important work than dealing with the cons cious ness of hum anity. Next com es the Master Morya and His Ashram, because the whol e procedur e is projected from Shamballa, and He is in close touc h with that dyna mic centre. The Master R., as the Lord of Civilisation, is necessarily closely invol ved in this preparatory work, and also because He is what has been called the Regent of Europe . Anot her Ashram is also very deeply conc erned in this work; I have, at times, referred to the Maste r Who was respons ible for the organisation of Labour . This work He began to do in the latter part of the nineteenth century, but left it to carry forward of its ow n mom entum when Russia entered the field and laid an undue empha sis upon the proletariat dur i ng the revol ution and in the later years of the first qua rter of the twentieth century. I (D.K.) am the fifth Master conc erned in this special work and am, as it were, the liaison officer between thos e active and cons cious disciples who are working in the world of out er affairs and thos e directly respons ible to the Christ for the desired work of preparation. Certain disciples from these five Ashrams or groups have been (and will be) especially trained for the work of cont acting the publ ic. The stimulation which can be given will be released at the com ing Full Moon. The five specialised energies are as follow s: 1. The Energy of Love - Wisdom . This energy always has an effect upon every type of hum an being in the world. Its effect is to stimulate the tende ncy towards goodw ill and to produc e a mental developm ent which can transmute the know ledge — garnered down the ages — into wisdom . It is wisdom which is needed toda y. Thos e who are now attempting to foster goodw ill in themselves and others will be stimulated into wise action. You can see, therefore, that the out pour ing of this energy is the first and greatest need. It can reach manki nd because the Founde rs of all the world religions (I refer not to their many diversifications ) are bande d toge ther in uni s on with the Christ, Their Lord and Master; through Their uni ted and directed effort, these energies will flow . Forget not that Christ represents the energy of love and the Buddha that of wisdom ."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST 2. The Energy of Will or Pow er . The out pour ing of this energ y, ow ing to the \"little wills\" of the majority of men and the develope d strenuous wills of certain present world Leaders, will not have as wide or pot ent an effect or cont act as may the others. Its inflow will, how ever, serve to bring about a \"fixed intent ion\" on the part of many to work ceaselessly for true peace and unde rstandi ng. These peopl e will therefore aid in the task of implementing goodw ill. It will, nevertheless, strengt hen the will of the selfish, ambitious and obs tinate men who are in pos itions of pow er and influence, and produc e increased troubl e — at least tempor arily. The salvation of the world and the produc tion of the needed security will be brought about in the long run by the mass of men everyw here, in all lands ; it will be the result of an intensified educ ationa l process. Hum anity, as yet, doe s not know how to handl e wisely the energy of the will - to - pow er, and it is largely this that has handi cappe d the manifestation of the will - to - good. The Shamballa force is too strong for thos e who are n aturally wilful. In the case of certain pot ent men, this energy reaches them directly, and is not steppe d dow n for them through cont act with the Hierarchy of Love ; it naturally expr esses itself in the pol itical fields and in the realm of gove rnments, throu gh rulers, officials, statesmen and pol iticians. When the \"little wills\" of the intelligentsia, of thos e who serve the publ ic in som e capacity or other, and thos e above all who are working in som e conne ction with the United Nations , becom e strengthened, st imulated and focussed on goodw ill, the uni on of the two energies of Love - Wisdom and of Will can bring about the needed change s in the planetary life. This is not an immediate happe ning, but it is not a visioni ng of the impos sible. 3. The Energy of Active Intelligence . This third type of energy is the easiest one for mode rn hum anity to receive — which is perhaps a sad com mentary upon man's aspirations . The proof of this lies in the fact that much of this type of energy (through the selfish percepti on and desires of manki nd) has been crystallised into mone y . Hum an intelligence has served on the side of materialism and not on the side of the spiritual values. Mone y is the conc retised expr ession of the third type of spiritual energy. This particular ex pression appe ared first in the ancient and equa lly materialistic system of barter and exchange ; then, in later civilisations (predom inantly includi ng ours) we have the appe arance of mone y, made first from the produc ts of the mineral kingdo m, and then later came paper mone y, made from the produc ts of the vegetable kingdom . This has culminated in the mode rn preoccupa tion with mone y. There is very deep occult meaning to be found in the statement in the New Testam ent that \"the love of mone y is the root of all e vil\". It is largely mone y and selfishne ss which lie behind the present disastrous econom ic situation. Great financiers are in reality thos e in whom the receipt of mone y, or of this type of energy, cons titutes the line of least resistance, plus the will to make vast fortune s, which cannot be gainsaid. They will to make a fortune ; they bring their intelligence to bear upon their goa l, and naugh t can stop them. Many of them are pur ely selfish; som e regard their mone y as a trust to be used for others and are am azingl y generous in a phi lanthropic and hum anitarian sense. These men are receptive to the first type of energy, and freque ntly all the three type s find a channe l through them, and the world is greatly benefited; such men are nevertheless very rare. It sti ll remains for the crystallised aspect of this third energy — mone y — to be used on a large scale for the furtherance of the work of the Hierarchy. It is at this poi nt and in conne ction with mone y that the great test of goodw ill shoul d demons trate. 4. The ene rgy which produc es order . This is the energy of the seventh ray or pow er of divinity. At this time, its major expr ession will com e through the relations hips and adjustments requi red between capital and labour , and labour will be primarily invol ved. This en ergy is being assimilated in the Ashram of the Master Whom I mentione d above ; at the inception of the indus trial era He was respons ible for the formation of the labour move ment — a move ment bringi ng into relation the workers of the world. It is in teresting to have in mind that toda y labour func tions internationa lly; it is a group which learns with rapidity and has in it the seeds of vast good; it is proba bly the group which will place goodw ill in the"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST forefront of hum an thinki ng — upon a pinna cle of t hought . This Master to Whom I refer belongs to the Ashram of the Master R. He relieves Him of this phase of the work to be done . 5. The energy of right hum an relations . This energy is a subs idiary expr ession of the energy of Love - Wisdom — the first of the g reat out pour ing energies. It emanates, therefore, from the subs idiary Ashram for which I am respons ible. I have written and taught much about it, and with som e success. \"Right hum an relations \" is not simply goodw ill, as peopl e seem to think; it is a produc t or result of goodw ill and the instigator of cons tructive change s between indi vidua ls, com muni ties and nations . About it I need not write, for you have enough teaching from me to gui de you. Your daily actions will be thos e of goodw ill, directed tow ards th e establishing of right hum an relations if you are rightly oriented within the race of men and tow ards the spiritual Hierarchy. These energies — along with others at this time far less pot ent and therefore of onl y seconda ry impor tance — will greatly stimulate the hearts and minds of men. It is the task of the Members of the Hierarchy to distribut e these energies (onc e they are released by the Christ) to the working disciples on the phys ical plane and to the myriad aspirants in training for discipleship and to the members of the New Group of World Servers. Members of the New Group of World Servers cons ist of thos e who are com pletely dedicated to the service of hum anity and to the establishing of right hum an relations unde r hierarchical impression; aspirants and qui te a few disciples have diversified interests and onl y serve part time. To all these groups is com mitted the task of implementing the work and directing the energies for which the Christ is respons ible. The objectives of the Hierarchy in this divine act of massed impression and stimulation are briefly three, as follow s: 1. To bring about thos e condi tions which will make the com ing of the Christ pos sible. The blende d influence of these energies will bring about what may at first appe ar to be u nde sirable results, because the remaining oppos ition of the Forces of Evil is still active and must be ove rcom e; this may necessitate drastic measures, but great good will eventually appe ar. 2. To prepare the minds of men so that they may be ready for the influence of the Avatar about Whom the Scriptures speak. He is called the Avatar of Synthesis and His influence will be spread through the work and the activity of the Christ. It must be remembered that synt hesis is an aspect of the first divine characte ristic, the Will, or rather, the Will - to - Good . This energy or influence, which the Christ Himself will wield (and for which He has been long preparing Himself), produc es cohe sion, a drawing toge ther and a tende ncy to fusion and uni on. The separateness of h um anity, and its selfishne ss, had reached such vast propor tions , and its effects were so com pletely dom inated by the Forces of Evil, that — in respons e to the massed inchoa te demand of hum anity — the Hierarchy called for spiritual interpos ition. The endl ess se lfish propa ganda , in speech or in writing, most of it materialistic, nationa listic and basically unt rue and wrongl y motivated, became such a clamour that it reached to sphe res usually impervious to the sounds of earth; the Avatar of Synt hesis was called in to aid. The main obj ective and the immediate task of the Christ is to bring to an end the separ ateness which exists between man and man, fam ily and fam ily, communi ty and com muni ty, and nat ion and nat ion. This is a simple statement, and one that can be un derstood easily by the most ignor ant; it is simple also in that it provi des a practical obj ective and task for the smallest and the most uni mpor tant of the sons of men; all can coope rate if they will. It is nevertheless a task which has requi red the mobi lising of the entire planetary Hierarchy, and the assistance also of a great Being Who woul d nor mally work on"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST levels of cons cious ness highe r than thos e on which Christ and His disciples labour . 3. To stimulate the aspiration in the hearts of men s o that hum an receptivity to the good, the beautiful and the true may be greatly increased. These energies will bring in the new creative era, which will sweep into expr ession as soon as world tension has subs ided; then men will be free to think and to crea te the new forms for the new ideals; then they will bring into manifestation in words, in colour , in music and in sculptured forms the new revelation and the new world which the com ing of Christ will inaugur ate. It will be obvi ous (if you have cons idered my words with care) that a great spiritual move ment is under way — perhaps the greatest of all time, if we except the great spiritual crisis which brought the fourth kingdom into being, the hum an kingdo m. I have mentione d above onl y three of the most importa nt results for which the Hierarchy hope s. Hum anity is deemed to have reached a poi nt in evol ution where much can be done , because the minds of men — for the first time on a worldw ide scale — are sensitive to spiritual impression; the oppo rtuni ty of the mom ent is uni que , because minds everyw here are show ing themselves supe rlatively receptive to bot h good and evil. Men are not toda y gove rned so much by blind impul se as by cons idered thought . There have always been small groups and rare soul s who have demons trated the capacity to respond to spiritual impression. The line of least resistance for the masses is the selfish impul se, and there lies the major poi nt of attack by the Forces of Light . The totalitarian pow ers have always realised and expl oited this capacity of hum an beings to be respons ive to good or bad impression. By impressing certain doc trines, certain principles and certain beliefs on their peopl e, and by withhol ding the truth or the facts and igno ring the realities, they cont rive to swing th eir peopl e into an acceptance which means — for the cont rolling initiators — immense pow er. Other nations , the so - called democracies, are in a state of great conf usion, split into pol itical, religious and social parties, listening to the teaching, the dreams and the plans of every person who has an idea and thrusts himself forward into the pub lic cons cious ness, having no true or good pol icy, tainted by selfishne ss (persona l or nationa l, and som etimes bot h), and demandi ng the settlement of material affairs with small attention — if any — to the recogni sed spiritual goa ls and values. There is fortuna tely a grow ing body of thos e of all faiths, or of no religious faith, to be found in every cont inent and nation who are aware of the stirring of this spiritual move ment — linki ng hum anity and the Hierarchy. This is due to their reaction to spiritual hope , to the expe ctancy and to the curious ly widespread belief that divine intervention is pos sible and at hand. As the momentum of this spiritual activity develops , so will the respons iveness among men develop, and if the reaction is that which is hope d for, it will be the masses everyw here who will slow ly uni te to bring about the condi tions needed for the reappe arance of the Prince of Peace, bringi ng with Him the pot ency and th e benediction of the Avatar of Synt hesis. The number of these semi - enlight ened peopl e is grow ing fast; desperation is hastening their respons e to help from on high, and in due time their numbers will be so great that totalitarianism, as well as chaotic dem ocracy, will not be able to stand against them. This is no mystical or visiona ry dream with which I am presenting you. It invol ves hard bus iness sense on the phy sical plane , a practical com mons ense, a cessation of the cons tant presentation of a beautiful future in a mythical heaven of idleness and uselessness. The bringi ng in of the Kingdom of God, the preparation for the com ing of the Christ and the salvaging of manki nd demand cour age, organisation, bus iness acum en, psychol ogy and persistence; it needs trained workers and much mone y; it calls for carefully cons idered programmes, pos sessing long range vision, plus sensible mode rn procedur es. It is to this that all with true vision and a love of hum anity are called toda y; it means the spreading of an"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST intelligently cultivated goodw ill and the fostering of thos e condi tions , attitude s and poi nts of view which will inevitably bring about right hum an relations . I woul d call your careful attention to one most important matter. The mom ent that a poi nt of balance is reached, the mom ent that thos e who stand for separateness and materialism, for totalitarianism or for any impos ed regime (and cons eque ntly an evil uni ty), and thos e who stand for the freedom of the hum an soul , for the right s of the indi vidua l, for brotherhood and right hum an relations , are equa l in force, in pos ition and in influence, then the door s of the Hierarchy (sym bol ically speaking) will ope n, and the Christ with His disciples will com e. This balance has to reach a poi nt upon mental level s; it has to be reached by thos e who can think, who can influence, and in whos e hands lies the respons ibility for what the masses below the mental level know and believe. The uns killed labour er, the num erous people who never think, who are onl y young in th e expe rience of incarnation, and the multitude s who evade thought even when they are capable of it, lie in the hands of two vast and dom inant groups : the totalitarians and the democracies. The cons eque nces of attaining a poi nt of balance are very close to day. Organised evil is not in pow er; organised good is still qui te ineffective, largely ow ing to the failure of the religions of the world to give a true picture of Christ's mission; therefore the struggl e for cont rol is with us now . If the forces of evil, plus the groups of men who seek cont rol of the human spirit (no matter in what count ry they are foun d, and they can be found in every singl e count ry without exception) , becom e dom inant, the doo rs of evil will ope n and the life of man will lose its meaning ; death will settle dow n upon our planet — death bot h spiritual and mental. If the forces of good, the work of the New Group of World Servers, and the activities of men of goodw ill everyw here prevail, the door s of the spiritual Hierarchy will ope n and — to use a Biblical phr ase — the Hosts of the Lord will issue forth. The Christ Will Com e. ORGANISING THE ASHRAMS INTO FORM ON EARTH June 1949 I woul d ask you , at the time of this Full Moon of June to spend a little time in visualising the situation which is likely to com e about on Earth if and when (as a result of the preparatory work done by and for hum anity), the Hierarchy is externalised or manifests itself as a definite and recogni sed organisation upon the phys ical plane. What will happe n in the world if and when the Masters of the Wisdom func tion obj ectively and phys ically among peopl e in — for instance — our great cities? For millions of years, They have worked behind the scenes, utilising the minds , brains and phys ical equi pm ent of Their disciples in order to carry out Their beneficent pur pos es. Such workers unde r hierarchical inspiration are by no means medium istic in their nature, but have established a right relations hip with their ow n soul s and with the Master of their Ashram. They are respons i ve to hierarchical impression; they know the plans which the Masters are ende avour ing to carry out , and their coope ration is willingl y and cons cious ly given; they are left entirely free to work as they see fit — after due recogni tion of the information and t he inspiration given. Will this system of working on behalf of hum anity com e to an end? In what manne r will the effective and needed change s be made? How will the propo sed organisation take place? Of how much of these"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST change s and organisation will average hum anity be aware? These and many similar que stions almost autom atically arise in you r minds , and it is essentially necessary that the creative imagination of the adva nced man, of aspirants, of proba tiona ry disciples (as well as that of the wor king disciple), doe s not run riot, creating thos e thought forms which coul d intervene between the true vision and the work to be done , and interfere therefore with the needed manifestation. It is exceedingl y important that the follow ing facts shoul d be real ised: the thinking of thos e who are preparing hum anity for the reappe arance of the Christ must be most closely guarded and cont rolled; wishful thinking and the formulation of plans in line with ordinary hum an methods and techni que s must not be permitted at this time. The first lesson, therefore, which you have to learn in this work of preparation, is cont rolled thought and sensitivity to hierarchical impression. The sole task which conf ront s you and all aspirants and disciples, is to prepare hum anity for t wo events: 1. The organisation of certain of the Masters' Ashrams in the different count ries of the world wherein they can rende r effective service. 2. The reappe arance of the Christ at a date som ewhat later than the externalisation of the Ashrams and th eir phys ical plane organisation. How , where, when and in what manne r the Masters will make Their appe arance is none of you r affair. Their plans are laid, and They look for and expe ct no unt hinki ng and uni ntelligent obs tructions and assum ptions from thos e to whom the task of preparation is com mitted. They have seen to it that the teaching of the New Age has been given to aspirants and disciples in the world, for distribut ion; They are rapidly adm itting new disciples into Their Ashrams, and as fast as is des irable and permissible (for the Hierarchy works ever unde r law) They are passing them into the halls of initiation. At the same time, com petent disciples are searching the world for sensitive and willing aspirants; these disciples are laying their empha si s upon intelligence and spiritual freedom , working out as free and unde rstandi ng coope ration; these disciples will not be sidetracked by the devot ion — uni ntelligently expr essed — of the neophyt e upon the occult way. It is occult stude nts for whom s earch is now being made, and not mystics; it is for clear - thinki ng men and wom en that the call has gone forth, and not for the fanatic or for the person who sees not hing but the ideal, and who is una ble to work successfully with situations and things as th ey are, and who cannot , therefore, appl y the necessary and una voi dable com prom ise. The com ing or the adve nt of the Hierarchy on earth will not bring the sudde n and the beneficent change s which the enthus iastic desire. Every necessary evol utiona ry move is always a slow move . At no time will the Hierarchy infringe the natural processes of evol utiona ry grow th or the normally slow developm ent of the various kingdom s in nature towards divine expr ession. The Masters will, how ever, take adva ntage of all the poi nt s attained by these kingdom s, and They will (at certain critical times) utilise the more adva nced specimens of the natural type s — in a selective process — in order to bring in som ething new, better or different. This appl ies to the hum an kingdom just as much as it doe s to the vegetable, for instance. There is a line of thought for you in this statement. One major techni que employe d by the Hierarchy is a cons tantly appl ied stimulation. Of this, the effect of the sun upon all life - forms is a sym bol . It must how ever be remembered that the Masters have, therefore, to appl y such stimulation scientifically, working first in one direction and then in anot her,"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST modi fying the stimulation and the inpour ing stream of energy to meet a need; this They do in order to produc e the desired result, and to bring to fruition that which is latent within the indi vidua l. They work with seven major type s of energy; five of these are now in full use and two of them are rapidly com ing into effective service. It must be borne in mind that I am here referring to the use of stimulating, vivifying, fructifying and mutable energies unde r what is called (esoterically) \"scientific impression. \" These energies are: 1. The energy of prana; this is the life - giving energy from the Sun whi ch deals out bot h life and death, health and disease, according to the qua lity of the subs tance or material form upon which it makes its impact. This impact and its results are toda y entirely autom atic in appl ication and effectiveness, and are regarded as func tioni ng \"below the threshol d of the cons cious ness\" of hum anity, and necessarily of the Hierarchy. Its rhyt hm is established and its effects are well know n and prove n. The direction of this energy will eventually be in the hands of that great planetary centre, Hum anity; therefore, to manki nd will then be com mitted the respons ibility for its distribut ion to the sub - hum an kingdom s in nature. 2. The energy of the emotions or that of the astral plane. This energy is toda y in a condi tion of extra - ordinary ac tivity, produc ing basic change s upon all sides, stimulating desire (bot h good and bad), and gove rning, via the solar plexus centre, all that lies below the diaphr agm in the hum an vehicle of expr ession upon etheric and phys ical levels. This, when com bined w ith a pow erful inflow of the energy of prana, produc es and stimulates every aspect of the animal magne tism with which every phys ical form is equi ppe d; when com bined with the energy of mind, it produc es a magne tic persona lity, and this in bot h the good and the bad sense. 3. The energy of the mental plane . This is rapidly com ing into an uni que pot ency and its effects toda y are reaching dow n into the very depths of hum anity, thus bringi ng to the surface the mental capacity which is latent in and hitherto unus ed by the masses of men everyw here. It can be described as pour ing into the hum an cons cious ness by means of four divisions of mental energy: a. The energy of ideologi cal though t. b. The energy of religious formulations ; these are in process o f creating great change s in the minds of men conc erning the religious conc epts of the world and the new spiritual values. c. The energy which is toda y produc ing the struggl e for freedom and liberation from envi roni ng condi tions . This may expr ess itself as the world fight (at this time) for the freedom of the will of men, as it expr esses itself in the press, in speech, in gov ernm ent, or in the struggl e for a deepened spiritual life for man. This \"energy of liberation\" was sensed, registered and voi ced for h um anity by Frankl in D. Roos evelt in The Four Freedom s , so much discussed by men toda y; he thereby laid the founda tion for the new civilisation and the new world culture. d. The energy of the spiritual Hierarchy of the planet, as it is appl ied toda y by the Hierarchy in the transmutation of the sad and sorry past of hum anity into the glorious prospect of the New Era. This is, as you may well imagine, a sevenfold energy, emanating from and directed by the seven major Ashrams, unde r the direction of the Christ and of the senior Masters and Choha ns, deciding in counc il the method, the extent and the qua lity of the distribution of the energy invol ved; They decide also where it shoul d make its impact so as to achieve the best and the most cons tructive results. It is with this sevenfold energy that the Hierarchy will work in preparation for its phys ical plane manifestation and for the reappe arance of the Christ."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST 4. The energy of hum ani ty itself , organised and directed by the adva nced thinke rs and workers in all and every (and this I reiterate) branch of hum an executive work; in every educ ationa l process and in all pol itical regimes. I woul d most definitely empha sise the widespread nature of this energy cont act because esoteric stude nts have very freque ntly the errone ous idea that the Hierarchy works onl y through the medium of esoteric and so - called occult groups . The more adva nced a man may be, the more sensitive to impress he becom es, and the human race has now reached a point of sensitivity never before attained. This has happe ned through the agency of the energies listed above . Disciples and aspirants and the intelligentsia everyw here and in every land are toda y — cons cious ly or unc ons cious ly — respon sive to these four energies; the closer they are affiliate d with som e Ashram in the Hierarchy, the more the sevenfold hierarchical energies can be distribut ed to the rest of the hum an family. It is therefore in this field that the major hierarchical ende avour will — dur ing the next fifty years — expr ess itself. Here, cons eque ntly, lies the funda mental probl em conf ront ing the Hierarchy, for these energies must be most carefully directed and their resultant impact be most scientifically cons idered if ove r - stimulation is to be avoi ded. 5. The energy of the second aspect of divinity , vaguely called by the mystics of the past era \"the Christ cons cious ness.\" This naturally focusses through the Christ Himself, standi ng as the Representative in the Hierarchy of the solar energy of love - wisdom . It is a form of peculiar, magne t ic energy of which manki nd toda y know s little; nevertheless, upon this energy much speculation has been permitted and many false thought forms have been bui lt. It is a dange rous energy because of its exceeding pot ency and also because this inflow ing energy has to use the vehicle of the subs tance of the three low er worlds, and its area of influence is on the three low er planes of hum an existence. This at first necessarily produc es conf lict, and its first major conf lict is now impendi ng. I have dealt with this conf lict elsewhere when discussing with you the four th Ray of Harmony through Conf lict. 15 A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Volum e V.* The use of this second funda mental energy (which is the primary energy of our present solar system, focussing upon our planetary life) presents to Christ Himself a great test of His skill in action; its use cons titutes the major test or task which faces Him when He reappe ars and has the respons ibility of releasing its pot encies on earth. The task of all disciples is c ons eque ntly to prom ote wisdom , and this they must learn to do under the influence of the Buddha . He taught the primary lesson of mental discrimination and detachm ent — two basic qua lities which must be called into activity dur ing this amazing preparatory per iod with which all aspirants are toda y conf ront ed. These are, therefore, the poi nts which all groups of disciples and spiritual workers must learn to present to seeking hum anity. They conc ern the creating and the vitalising of the new world religion. This theme lies at the root of all that is new: discrimination between the mental appr oach and the soul appr oach, thus learning that true detachm ent which was sym bol ically but errone ous ly appl ied by all mona stic orders throughout the world (bot h occidental and oriental) during the past few centuries, appl ied therefore in time and space but having no relation to the inne r spiritual impor t. The true mona stic spirit and discipline will emerge later in the historical processes of hum anity. 6. The energy of the fir st divine aspect (that of will or pow er) now being appl ied with the most scrupul ous care by Shamballa. This energy of the will is — as you have been taught — the pot ency of the life in all beings ; it has in the past onl y been permitted to make cont act with \"th e subs tance of hum anity\" via the Hierarchy. Lately, direct impact has been permitted expe rimentally and of this the world war (1914 - 1945 ) was the first evidence, clarifying issues, presenting oppor tuni ty, pur ifying hum an thinki ng and destroyi ng the old and worn - out civilisation. It is an exceedingl y dange rous energy and cannot be appl ied in fuller measure unt il the race of men has learned to respond more adequa tely to"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST the energy of the second aspect of love - wisdom , and therefore to the rule of the Kingdom o f God. 7. There remains anot her energy which can onl y be appl ied very much later on and onl y if the activity of the six preceding energies fulfil their purpos e. With it we cannot here deal, for the future is too unc ertain, and in any case, it w ill onl y com e into activity in the middl e of the Aqua rian Age. These energies, along with the five specialised energies referred to in my June (1948) Full Moon Message will swing into great activity as the years slip away. The year 1952 will see the five specialised energies assum ing great pot ency. I woul d again call your attention to the fact that the evoc ative pow er of the Great Invoc ation (now used by so many hundr eds of thous ands ) and the sound of its mantric rhyt hm is increasingl y respons ible for thi s work; a great deal of the resultant effectiveness is due to the fact that hum anity is using this mantram in steadily increasing num bers, and this — com bined with its scientific use by the Hierarchy — is very fruitful in results. It is well here to bear in mi nd that (to quot e an old sentence by one of the Masters) \"w here the focus is, so will be the anc hor age where descendi ng pot encies unde r mant ric inspiration are conc erned.\" This means that, due to the effort of count less thous ands of men and wom en everyw her e, energies hitherto una ble to penetrate deeper into subs tance than the hierarchical subs tance and the levels of the highe r mental plane can now , for the first time, be successfully anchor ed on dense phys ical levels or at least upon etheric levels. This is a fact and is far more impor tant than you are perhaps able to appreciate. I have earlier told you that the five Masters conc erned with the initial stages of the organisation of the Hierarchy on earth are the Master K.H., the Master Morya, the Master R., the Master Who started the labour move ment in the mode rn world, and myself, the so - called Master D.K. The division of labour is here of great interest. In my June message for 1948, I referred to the five specialised energies which were at that time releas ed to carry forward their impersona l task. Each of these energies is conc erned with the desired organisation, for it must ever be remembered that though the organisation which we are cons idering is conc erned with the interior or subj ective work of the Hierarchy, the repercussions and the resultant effects will take place on earth, with phys ical plane effects, because the old occult truism \"as above , so below \" will be rapidly and obj ectively demons trated. This result and the effects produc ed will cons titute one of the mode s whereby the Hierarchy will prove its factual presence on earth. The Ashram of the Master K.H. is already assum ing an increased stimulating pot ency, but it will nevertheless be one of the last to manifest obj ectively on the phys ical plane. The mission of that Ashram is to produc e the energy which will make pos sible and definite the reappe arance of the Christ. That reappe arance is the major preoccupa tion of the Master K.H. and His group of initiates and disciples. The first step t aken by the Ashram was embodi ed — as far as all of you are conc erned — in the pamphl et entitled The Reappe aranc e of the Christ (Wesak Message, May 1947) . To this must be added the vitalisation and the stimulation of the two - thou sand - year - old thought form which men, dow n the centuries, have created in anticipation of His com ing or adve nt. The move ment tow ard expe ctancy and preparation is now rapidly gaining mom entum . This was the first conc rete result of the com bined desire of this second ray Ashram. How ever, the work being done in this Ashram is more definitely conc erned with three lines of activity. These are: 1. The preparation of the many com bined Ashrams, leading to externalisation."},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST 2. The formulation of the techni que s and disciplines which will be of servi ce to the initiate or disciple who is making the primary effort to func tion obj ectively, to work before the screen of life and not behind the scenes, as hitherto, and to develop that \"resistant capacity\" which is needed to withstand the violent impacts of phys ical plane living. 3. The mental and spiritual registration of the plans of the Christ, and the cons eque nt developm ent of that skill in action which will permit these plans to materialise correctly. Within the second ray Ashram of the Mast er K.H. and His affiliated groups (such as the Ashram for which I am respons ible) it is the energy of wisdom which is being effectively used. It might be said that this dua l energy, hitherto a fused and blende d energy, is toda y working as a true dua lity. T he energy of wisdom is active within all the Ashrams (on all rays and unde r all the Masters); the energy of love is directed primarily tow ards the third great planetary centre, Hum anity, stimulating the aura of that mass of living uni ts so that their \"magn etic appe al will be the out standi ng qua lity of their divine appr oach.\" The directing Agents for this dua l activity are the Master K.H. and a chos en group of His senior initiates and disciples, of whom I am not one , because I have anot her task com mitted to me. The Master K.H. is therefore cons tantly in close association with the Christ, the Head of the Hierarchy. Christ is toda y, with the aid of the Lord of the World and the Buddha , preparing Himself for the most difficult task with which He has ever been c onf ronted. It is not a matter of the Christ issuing forth from the High Place where He is toda y to be found, and sudde nly appe aring among men; it is not a case of His taking infant form and grow ing into His work with adva ncing years; it is not a case of Hi s being instantly recogni sed and acclaimed by millions of miserable hum an beings awaiting liberation. None of these ideas or hope s form any part of His plan, nor are they pos sible. No Member of the Hierarchy, and certainly not its Supr eme Head, attempts to bring about results which are doo med to failure; presented thus , they woul d be bound to fail, because the poi nt of sensitivity of hum anity makes failure inevitable — if success is expe cted along these most ordinary lines. Skill in action, wise a nd unde rstandi ng judgm ent, the adaptation of present affairs to the desired future, the coor dination of the work to be done , and the clear enunc iation of the platform upon which the new teaching must be founde d, plus the survey (if I may so expr ess it) of the founda tions upon which the new structure of the com ing civilisation must be founde d — it is with these things that the Christ is at this time conc erned. You can realise, therefore, the tremendous and coope rative activity with which the Master K.H. and Hi s Ashram are conc erned. The stimulation of that activity com es from two directions : necessarily from Shamballa, from the Buddha and from the Avatar of Synt hesis, and increasingl y from the world of men, as expe ctancy, hope and demand com bine to make their u nited appe al. The Ashram or group centre through which the Master Morya works is also exceedingl y bus y. It is obvi ous to you that as this is a first ray Ashram, the energy com ing from the Avatar of Synt hesis will make its primary impact upon this Ashram, which provi des the line of least resistance. There, it is scientifically steppe d dow n or broke n dow n, prior to distribut ion to the Ashrams of the five Masters enga ged in the work of preparation. The highe st aspect pos sible of assimilation by the Hierarchy is directed by the Masters tow ards the Christ and is used by Him in His indi vidua l and planne d preparatory work. Though He demons trated when here before that His mission or work had a group or brotherhood obj ective, it is well know n in"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST hierarchical circle s that first ray synt hesis is som ething highe r still than uni ty, and that even the Christ has som ewhat to grasp anent this new pot ency — coming bot h from Shamballa or from the Father (as the Christ used to call that emanating sour ce), and also from extra - pla netary sour ces. Above all, He has the difficult task of training or adapting His phys ical vehicle so that it can assimilate this extra - ordinary high pot ency and, at the same time, keep it in a condi tion in which He can move out ward on the phys ic al plane among men. The Christian Chur ch has laid so much empha sis on Christ's uni que pos ition as the one and onl y Son of God that great error has crept in and has been fostered for centuries; Christ Himself foresaw the pos sibility of this error and tried to offset it by poi nting out that we are all the \"Sons of God\" and that \"greater things than I do shall you do\" — a statement which no com mentators have ever unde rstood or adequa tely expl ained. The occult fact is that there is no being on Earth, from the ve ry low est form of life to the very highe st, who is not moving onw ard tow ards a greater and finer expr ession of divinity, and Christ Himself is no exception to this uni versal evol utiona ry law. He is therefore, at this time and because He is preparing to rai se the entire hum an family nearer to God, laying Himself ope n to certain pow erful inflow ing energies, absorbing into Himself streams of spiritual force, and unde rgoi ng a dyna mic stimulation which is entirely new to Him; this cons titutes His testing for the exalted initiation which now conf ront s Him; it cons titutes also the sacrifice He is making in order to com plete His work on Earth and bring a new salvation to hum anity. The Christ is working, therefore, in very close cooperation with the Master Morya, an d also with the Manu (one of the three Heads of the Hierarchy) , and these three — the Christ, the Manu and the Master Morya — create a triangl e of energies into which (and through which) the energy of the Avatar of Synt hesis can pour , findi ng right direction u nde r Their com bined efforts. On the phys ical plane, the initiates and the disciples working in the Ashram of the Master Morya are primarily occupi ed with the expr ession of synt hesis in the world of pol itics and of gove rnment, and with offsetting wrong app roaches to synt hesis, seeking to preserve freedom in uni ty. It is a subj ective synt hesis for which they work — a synt hesis which will expr ess itself in an out er differentiation. This synt hesis will define the many aspects of the essential, basic u nity which, working out unde r the stimulation of the energy of synt hesis, will bring about eventual peace and unde rstandi ng on earth — a peace which will preserve indi vidua l and nationa l cultures, but which will subor dinate them to the good of the whol e of h umanity. We com e now to the preparatory work being done by the Master Who started what is called by you \"the labour move ment.\" This is regarded by the Hierarchy as one of the most successful attempts in all history to awaken the masses of men (in the brac kets called middl e class and low er class) to general betterment, and thus set up a mom entum which would, occultly speaking, \"swing them into light .\" Along with the developm ent of the labour move ment, mass educ ation came into being, with the result that — fr om the angl e of develope d intelligence — the entire level of cons cious awareness was uni versally raised. There is still much illiteracy, but the average citizen in all the western democracies and in the Sovi et Union is as well educ ated as the intellectual ma n in the Middl e Ages. You have, in this activity, an out standi ng instance of how the Masters work, for (to the average onl ooke r) the labour move ment arose from within the masses and the working classes; it was a spont aneous developm ent, based upon the thin king and the teaching of a mere handf ul of men who were regarded primarily as agitators and troubl e makers; they were in reality a group of disciples (many of them unc ons cious of their esoteric status) who were coope rating with the Law of Evol ution and als o with the hierarchical"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Plan. They were not particularly adva nced disciples, but they were affiliated with som e Ashram (according to their ray), and were therefore subj ect to impression. Had they been adva nced disciples or initiates, their work woul d have been futile, for their presentation of the Plan woul d not have been adapted to the level of the intelligence of the then totally une duc ated masses com pos ing labour . This Master works primarily with the intelligentsia, and He is therefore a third ray Maste r — upon the Ray of Active Intelligence. His Ashram is occupi ed with the probl ems of indus try, and the goa l of all the thinki ng, all the planni ng and all the work of impressing receptive minds is directed tow ards spiritualising the conc epts of the labour party in every count ry, and of indus trialists, thus turning them tow ards the goa l of right sharing, as a major step tow ards right hum an relations . This Master therefore coope rates with the Master R. — Who is the Head of the third ray Ashram, and Who is also one of the Triangl e of Forces which cont rols the greater Ashram of the Hierarchy Itself. The Ashram of this Master (Who has always withhe ld His name from publ ic know ledge ) is a lesser Ashram within the major third ray Ashram, just as my Ashram lies within the ring - pass - not of the Ashram of the Master K.H. This Master is necessarily an Engl ishm an, for the indus trial revol ution started nearly one hundr ed years ago in England, and the pot ency of the work done is related to its mass effect and to the re sults achieved in every land by labour and its methods . All the great labour organisations , nationa l and internationa l, are loos ely kni t toge ther subj ectively, because in each group this Master has His disciples who are working cons tantly to hold the move m ent in line with the divine Plan. It is well to bear in mind that all great move ments on earth demons trate bot h good and evil; the evil has to be subdue d and dissipated, or relegated to its right propor tiona l place, before that which is good and in line wi th hierarchical planni ng can find true expr ession. What is true of the indi vidua l is true also of groups . Before the soul can expr ess itself through the medium of the persona lity, that persona lity has to be subdue d, cont rolled, pur ified and dedicated to se rvice. It is this cont rolling, subdui ng process which is goi ng on now , and it is voc iferous ly fought by the selfish and ambitious elements. Nevertheless, the work of this Master is out standi ngly successful in preparing the intellectual principle of the ma sses for eventual right recogni tion of the Christ. A right sense of values is being develope d, and in the right direction of this pot ent labour group in every land lies the founda tion of the new civilisation. The Ashram of this Master is theref ore occupi ed with worldw ide econom ic probl ems, and also with a direct attack upon the basic materialism to be foun d in the mode rn world. The probl ems of barter and exchange , the signi ficance of mone y, the value of gol d (a basic sym bol of the third Ray of A ctive Intelligence), the produc tion of right attitude s tow ards material living, and the entire process of right distribut ion are among the many probl ems dealt with in this Ashram; the work done is enor mous and of great impor tance in preparing men's mind fo r the return of the Christ and for the New Age which He will inaugur ate. Capitalists and labour leaders, financial expe rts and thinki ng workers, and members of all the differing ideologi es which are prevalent in the world toda y are to be found actively wor king within this Ashram. Many of them are what the orthodox religious man or the hide - bound occult stude nt woul d regard as non - spiritual, yet all of them are in reality deeply spiritual in the correct sense, but they care not for labels, for school s of tho ught nor for academic, esoteric teaching. They exemplify within themselves a livingne ss which is the hallmark of discipleship. The time has com e when the first and major principle gove rning true esotericism must be grasped as condi tioni ng all hierarchical workers: Right Motive. The time has com e when the qua lity of ashramic work is recogni sed, first of all, as being: Selfless"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST Service . The time has com e when men everyw here must realise that entry into a Master's Ashram is depende nt upon Intelligence , plus right motive and service. When these three factors are present in any hum an being, the Masters know that good material is presented to Them for training. Toda y the world is full of such men and wom en, and in them lies the dom inant hope of the future. One more poi nt I woul d like to discuss. Through the work of this Master and His Ashram the \"sealing of the doo r where evil dw ells\" will com e about , because it is essentially this group which (if I dare so expr ess it) is copi ng with raw materialism and the false values which it enge nde rs. The door has to be sealed by a vast mass of coor dinated hum an forces, and not by one or two enlight ened men. This fact must be grasped by you . The energy of love - wisdom , the energy of the second ray, can and will br ing in the Kingdom of God; the energy of the divine will can and will galvanise with its dyna mic pot ency the entire hum an family to the poi nt where a group transition will take place from the fourth into the fifth kingdom . It is nevertheless this third ray energy, as wielded in the Ashram of this Engl ish Master, unde r the direction of the Mahachoha n, the Lord of Civilisation, which will force a right attitude tow ard materialism, which will bring about a balance between the material values and the spiritual, and which will eventually thrust back into futility the Forces of Evil which have for so long distracted the world of men. I am choos ing my words with care. You will not e, therefore, how the three divine aspects are uni ted in one great move ment to bring in the Kingdom of God, and that the first step tow ards this longe d - for cons um mation is the appe arance of the Masters upon the phys ical plane, and then, som ewhat later, the reappe arance of the Christ. We now com e to a cons ideration of the vast Ashram cont r olled by the Master R. He is the Lord of Civilisation and His is the task of bringing in the new civilisation for which all men wait. It is a third ray Ashram, and therefore enfolds within its ring - pass - not all the Ashrams to be found upon the third Ray of Active Intelligence, upon the fifth Ray of Conc rete Science and upon the seventh Ray of Ceremoni al Order. All these Ashrams are working unde r the general direction of the Master R. He works primarily through the Masters of these three type s of ray energy. He Himself at this time is occupi ed with seventh ray energy, which is the order - produc ing energy upon our planet. This is the Ray of Ceremoni al Order, and through the activity of its energy, when correctly directed and used, a right rhyt hm is being impos ed upon all aspects of hum an living. An effort is being cons tantly made to arrest the ugl y chaos of the present and to produc e the ordered beauty of the future. The major weapon now being used by the com bined Forces of Evil is chaos, disrupt ion, lack of established security, and cons eque nt fear. The pot ency of these evil forces is exceedingl y great because they belong to no one group of peopl e and to all the ideologi es. The chaos produc ed by indi fference, the chaos produc ed by unc ertainty, the ch aos produc ed by fear, by starvation, by insecurity, by watching others suffer innoc ently, and the chaos produc ed by the warring and conf licting ambitious elements in every nation (without exception) — these are the factors with which the Master R. is attempt ing to deal; the task is one of supr eme difficulty. The entire rhythm of internationa l thinki ng has to be altered, and that cons titutes a slow and arduous task; the evil persona lities which, in every count ry, are respons ible for the chaos and unc ertainty, have eventually to be replaced by thos e who can work in coope ration with the rhythm of the seventh ray, and thus produ ce ordered beauty. The task is further com plicated by the fact that in the subs titution of order for chaos, nationa l cultures"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST must be pre served and the out line of the new civilisation presented to the peopl e. This major Ashram is therefore conf ront ed with two elements in every land and nation: thos e peopl e who hol d on to the bad old things of the past, and thos e who work for the extreme opp osite of this poi nt of view and for that which is new. Unde r the influence of this seventh ray energy bal anc e has to be brought about and preserved, so that the \"nobl e middl e way\" of right action and of right hum an relations can be safely trodde n. The task of the Master R. is, how ever, lightened by the fact that the seventh ray is now com ing into activity and its pot ency is increasing year by year. His task is also aided by the intelligent work done by the Ashram of the Engl ish Master Who works cons istently with the awakening and the arising masses. Every Octobe r and every March, the Master R. gathers toge ther His counc il of helpers, the Masters and the senior initiates in the Ashrams of the third, the fifth and the seventh rays. Though He is the Head of the third Ray of Aspect and is in cont rol, therefore, of the two Rays of Attribut e mentione d above , He doe s not Himself wield these forces, because He is One of the three Heads of the Hierarchy and His work cannot be conf ined to the activity of an y one ray. He works through the Ashrams of these rays, but He Himself works primarily in coope ration with the Christ and the Manu. Now we com e to the work which I (D.K.), a second ray Master, am attempting to do. With what energies am I working? What is t he goa l tow ards which I am striving unde r the direction of the three great Lords of the Hierarchy? I am working with the energy of right hum an relations ; this is a definite and integral part of the energy of the second ray. It is a magne tic type of energy and draws men toge ther for betterment and for right unde rstandi ng. It is also related in a peculiar way to the energy of the first Ray of Will or Pow er. Perhaps this will be clearer to you if I poi nt out that the will - to - good is an aspect of the Ray of Wil l, but that goodw ill is an attribut e of the second Ray of Love - Wisdom , thus relating that ray to the first ray. There is no need for me to enlarge upon the work which I am doi ng in and through my Ashram; you know it well, for I have freque ntly out lined it , and my books present the goa l adequa tely for this generation. In this particular though relatively shor t cycle, my Ashram is in a key pos ition. It is closely linke d to the first ray Ashram of the Master Morya, through the work of Men of Goodw ill and thr ough all goodw ill move ments in the world at this time. Goodw ill is essentially an expr ession of the second Ray of Love - Wisdom , and is therefore an aspect of all the Ashrams in that great second ray Ashram, the Hierarchy. But all goodw ill work is toda y bein g galvanised also into violent activity through the dyna mic energy of the first ray, expr essing the will - to - good. You have, therefore, this dyna mic type of energy channe lled through the Ashram for which I am respons ible. This Ashram works also in close coop eration with that of the Master R. because the intelligent activity of the energy of goodw ill is our obj ective, and its expression through intelligence, appl ied with wisdom and with skill in action, is the task demande d of all men and wom en of goodw ill throughout the world. When the Labour Move ment is swept by the energy of goodw ill, basic change s in world affairs will take place. I woul d ask all workers for goodw ill to attempt to reach labou r in all count ries with these ideas, correctly presen ted. I have tried here to give you som e idea of the synt hesis of this hierarchical work for hum anity, and thereby give to all men and wom en of goodw ill the needed cour age to go forward. "},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST You ask me (and right ly) of what use is all this information to men and to the aspirant who is trying to serve? The one thing which hum anity needs toda y is the realisation that there IS a Plan which is definitely working out through all world happe nings, and that all that has occurred in man's historical past, and all that has happe ned lately, is assuredly in line with that Plan. Necessarily also, if such a Plan exists, it presuppos es Thos e Who are respons ible for the originating of the Plan and for its successful carrying forward. From the standpoi nt of average hum anity, w ho think in terms of earthly happi ness, the Plan shoul d be som ething joyf ul and som ething which woul d make material life easier. To the spiritual Hierarchy, the Plan invol ves thos e arrangements or circum stances which will raise and expa nd the cons cious ness of manki nd and enable men, therefore, to discove r the spiritual values for themselves and to make the needed change s of their ow n free will , and thus produc e the demande d betterment of the envi ronm ent, cons istent with the unfolding spiritual recogni tion. Nothing of true value is to be gained by any arbitrary or autocratic activity on the part of the spiritual Hierarchy. That is one of the lessons to be learnt, as the work of the totalitarian pow ers — in the past and toda y — and its effects are not e d. Unde r the totalitarian system, freedom is curtailed or abol ished, the free will of the indi vidua l is denied and prevented expr ession, the indi vidua l is regarded as the appur tenance of the all - pow erful State and held in that pos ition by police regimentat ion; indi vidua l developm ent is of value onl y in so far as the interests of the State are served, but the indi vidua l himself — as an inde pende nt divine uni t of hum anity — is non - existent, from the totalitarian poi nt of view. Woul d you , therefore, have the spiri tual Hierarchy of our planet work along totalitarian lines, enforcing peace and com fort, taking steps to arrest evil by force and working for the material well - being of men? Or woul d you have the Masters lead hum anity itself, through right unde rstandi ng, t o take the needed action, even if it invol ves trial and error and a much slow er process? Woul d you have manki nd standi ng on its ow n feet as intelligent agents of the divine Plan? Or woul d you have them treated as irrespons ible children who must be energeti cally protected against themselves? Is it not better for the rapidly awakening intelligence and activity of men (in every land) to be trained to recogni se the essential uni ty of all human beings , and so be led to take the action needed which will endor se t hat uni ty, which will work for the entire group of hum an beings in all lands everyw here, and which will also and at the same time preserve the indi vidua l and the nationa l cultures, alongs ide a uni versal civilisation and a world - wide system of divine recogn ition? It is tow ard this general freedom and the intelligent activity of the free indi vidua l that the Hierarchy is steadily and successfully working; the conc ept of uni ty and of uni ted activity for the good of all is far more widely grasped and unde rstood than you perhaps realise. The totalitarian appr oach works tow ard an impos ed uni ty and one which will include all peopl es and bind them dow n to a uni formity of belief — pol itically, econom ically and socially — and which will and doe s basically ignor e the spirit ual values, put ting the State in the place of that divine spiritual centre where spiritual reality is to be found. The method of the Hierarchy is to work through individua ls and through groups for the produc tion of such a widespread spiritual r ecogni tion that men everyw here will accept as factual the inne r gove rnm ent of the planet, and will work toge ther for the foundi ng of the Kingdom of God in obj ective manifestation on Earth — and not in som e distant time and som e vague heaven. This is no mysti cal or impos sible dream, but is simply the recogni tion and the externalisation of that which has been for ever present, which definitely took obj ective form when Christ was with us two thous and years ago, and which will proceed to uni versal recogni tion whe n He is with us again in the immediate future. Therefore, all who work and struggl e for the good of hum anity and unde r the direction of the Hierarchy, take heart and renew your cour age. The Hierarchy not onl y stands (as oft I have told you) , but It is app roaching daily and yearly closer to humanity. The pow er of the focussed, spiritual unity of"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST the Hierarchy can be felt toda y in many ways; it is largely respons ible for the patient effort of all hum anitarian workers and of all who vision uni ty in the face o f great odds , and in spite of the fatigue d lethargy and the pessimism which condi tions , too hard for hum an endur ance, have impos ed upon men's minds . The Hierarchy stands and works. The Masters are working according to Plan — a Plan which is founde d in the pa st history of the race and can there be traced; a Plan which necessitated because of hum an selfishne ss, the drastic hor ror of the war (1914 - 1945) ; a Plan which toda y can and will bridge the gul f which now exists between the uns atisfactory, selfish and mate rial past and that new future which will demons trate a large measure of world unity, and which will steadily and with skill in action subs titute the spiritual values for thos e which have hitherto held sway. The gua rantee of this is the developi ng intellig ence of men everyw here fight ing blindl y for freedom and for unde rstandi ng, and receiving ever the inne r assurance, know ledge and aid of Thos e Who are working out (as always) thos e situations and condi tions wherein manki nd can best arrive at divi ne expr ession. THE EFFECTS OF THE EXTERNALISATION September 1949 In my previous instruction upon this theme I dealt with the various energies which woul d be brought into activity or utilised when the Masters emerged from the silence in which They hav e gua rded Themselves for so many thous ands of years. The point to be grasped is that the energies with which I dealt will be used in a new and more vital manne r. These energies are ever present and ever active, but they swing into activity seque ntially and unde r law and order, and som e are more prom inent at one time than others; they act vitally and energetically in the needed programme which the plans of the Hierarchy may entail in any particular cycle. These energies bring about what we idly call the \"ev ents\" of the day; they condi tion our passing civilisations and are so much a part of the world in which we live and move and have our being that events, as expr essions of directed energies, mean little to us, except in so far as they may affect adve rsely o ur persona lities. They connot e simply a way of life in any specific time. These energies were started on their activities in the very night of time; they established — each of them — their needed cyclic rhyt hm ; they are respons ible for the activity of subs tanc e on matter or of the action of the vital or etheric body upon matter; they are the low est formulated expr ession of the creative Intelligence, embodyi ng the principle of life or livingne ss because they essentially are life itself and life in action. Forget not that dense matter is not a principle; it is onl y that which is respons ive to the creative principle. When, how ever, the externalisation of the Hierarchy begins to take place (and it will be spread ove r qui te a long period of time), the imp act of these substantial energies on matter will be radically altered because they will be — for the first time in history — directed from etheric levels, from the etheric body of the planet in the three worlds; hitherto, these energies have been directed from the buddhi c plane which is the low est of the cosmic etheric levels. Funda mentally, direction will still be from the buddhi c plane, but the detailed and focussed direction will be given from within the three worlds and upon the"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST phys ical plane; this will be the task of the externalised Ashrams, organised to func tion ope nly. It was the know ledge that this important developm ent was imminent which made the Hierarchy in the last century widen the area or the scope of its teaching activity and thus bring to the cons cious ness of mode rn man the know ledge of what occultism essentially means. The keynot es upon which the occult phi losophy is bui lt are: 1. There is naught in manifestation except organised energy 2. Energy follow s or conf orms itself to though t 3. The o ccultist works in energy and with energies. The thought of God brought the uni verse of energies into organised form upon the highe st of the seven planes, or upon the first cosmic etheric level. These energies have for unt old aeons been directed from the f our th or low est of the cosmic etheric planes, the plane which we call the buddhi c and regard as the first definitely spiritual plane, in our usually errone ous thought ; this direction has been unde r impression from Shamballa, and the Masters have \"manipul at ed these energies in conf ormity with the Plan, which is the blueprint of the Purpos e.\" In the great Appr oach of the Hierarchy to hum anity and its imminent appe arance upon the phys ical plane, the centre of direction will also necessarily appr oach still nea rer, and — as a result of the future hierarchical manifestation — centres of energy direction will be found wherever the Ashram of a Master is located in any part of the world. This is a statement of profound signi ficance; it is an indi cation of hie rarchical pol icy and a mode whereby mode rn science (working as it doe s with energies) can be brought into coope rative association and relation with an Ashram upon the phys ical plane, know ing it for what it is — an entirely new departure. Earlier I stated th at the phys ical plane areas or localities which cons titute the present mode rn exits for energies, through which directed energies can pass to carry out the creative process, are five in num ber: New York, London, Geneva, Darjeeling and Toky o. These five for m a five - poi nted star of interlocking energies, sym bol ic of the major divisions of our mode rn civilisation. I woul d have you bear in mind that all that I am here giving you anent energy is in relation to the hum an kingdom and to nothing else; I am not rela ting these energies to the other kingdo ms in nature; I am here conc erned with phys ical plane utilisation of energy through the pow er of directed thinki ng and on behalf of the evol ution and well - being of manki nd. At each one of these five centres one of the Masters will be found present, with His Ashram, and a vortex of spiritual forces will there be organised to hasten and materialise the plans of the Christ for the new and com ing world cycle. The organising of these five centres will be done slow ly and gra dua lly. A senior disciple will appe ar and will work qui etly at the founda tion work, gathering around him the needed agents, aspirants and assistants. All these workers at any particular centre will be trained to think, and the effort now present in the edu cationa l and social world to force men to think for themselves is a general part of this training process. Until a man can do his ow n thinki ng and deciding, he cannot be an intelligent, willing and unde rstandi ng coope rator, working with an ashram and cont r olling and directing the creative process. If the new heavens and the new earth are to be a fact in manifestation and in reality, it means a great recreating process must get unde r way, and this is the conc ept lying behind the teaching anent the five centr es on Earth and the part which they will play in rebui lding and reorganising the world. As the next few years bring into focus the hierarchical intention, disciples and aspirants must look for thos e men and thos e few wom en who will be working a s a group along spiritual lines in or near one or"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST other of these five localities. Initial oppos ition to the foundi ng of these centres of clear thinking men and wom en, working freely and unde rstandi ngl y with one of the Masters or senior initiates, is alrea dy unha ppi ly present; it is to be found in the narrow ness, the biassed information and the lack of freedom of the totalitarian school s of thought . This was inevitable, for the Black Lodge ever ende avour s to parallel, offset and undo the work of the White L odge , and hitherto qui te successfully. But the cycle of success is slow ly closing because the energy of goodw ill, emanated by the Will - to - Good, is rapidly becom ing effective. In London , in New York, in Geneva and Darjeeling and in Tokyo, a Master will eve ntually be found, organising a major energy centre; at the same time His Ashram will cont inue to func tion upon buddh ic levels, for the entire personne l has not been alerted for externalisation. The Ashram will therefore be working on two levels — and yet tha t is not a correct statement of fact, as there are no levels, as well you know , but onl y states of cons cious ness. Ask me not how this can be; ponde r on the relation of this dua l and simultaneous appe arance by attempting to grasp the nature of the manifeste d form of the planetary Logos in the Person of Sanat Kum ara. Sanat Kum ara is not the persona lity of the planetary Logos , for persona lity as you unde rstand it is not existent in His case. It is not the soul of the planetary Logos , because that soul is the a nima mundi and the soul of all forms in all kingdom s. Sanat Kum ara, the Eternal Yout h, can be seen by Thos e Who have the right , presiding, for instance, ove r the Counc il in Shamballa, yet at the same time He is present as the life and the informing intelli gence upon and within our planet. You have therefore five poi nts where the externalisation of the Ashrams will take place and eventually be focussed. From these poi nts, as time elapses, other Ashrams, subs idiary in nature, will be found emergin g, spons ored and founde d by disciples and initiates from these five Ashrams, and representing the three major rays and two minor rays. To start with, they will be founde d through the presence in these localities of som e senior or world disciple; it must be remembered that the forerunne r of all move ments which appe ar upon the phys ical plane is an educ ationa l propa ganda , therefore som e disciple upon the second ray will com e into action, first of all, in all these five poi nts; he will be follow ed by a disciple upon the seventh ray. All world move ments are, as well you know , externalisations of subj ective ideas and conc epts and of pha ses of formulated thinki ng; and the appe arance of the Hierarchy upon earth in tangi ble form is no exception to this rule. Disciple s in these Ashrams have been in training for nearly one hundr ed and fifty years to do this work; som e have managed to keep the originating idea and impul se clear and untainted by their ow n thinki ng, and have adhe red — even in their ow n intimate thought s — to t he hierarchical progr amme, as presented to them by their Masters or the senior initiates. Others have not pos sessed so clear a reasoni ng faculty or so active an intuitive perception and — whilst grasping certain major conc epts such as world uni ty or hierarch ical gradations and cont rol — have distorted the truth and produc ed the many ideologi es which have wracked the world dur ing the past century; even this distortion is, how ever, being turned to goo d, for it produc ed a redoubl ed effort on the part of the Hierar chy to offset it; it led to an increased forcing process by means of which many earnest and willing aspirants reached the grade of accepted disciple; it produc ed also a ferment of thought in the world which has served to awaken the mentality of the masses to pos sibilities and to hor izons hitherto only visione d by adva nced and initiate thinke rs. The man in the street toda y has absorbed ideologi es to an unf oreseen extent, and the attempt to make him an active factor in our mode rn civilisation is not too harmf ul in view of the time element, as divinely conc eived, and from the point of view of the staunc h and basic integrity of the divine hum an being. Time and divinity, events and instinctual goodne ss, will in the long run trium ph. The intermediate ag oni es are distressing but not final, and they are not trium pha nt from the angl e of the dark Forces."},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST These Forces face (as a result of the war and of the resurrecting hum an spirit) a vista of nearing and inevitable defeat. Already the centres in London and in New York are show ing signs of life, and disciples are active in bot h places and along all lines of human expr ession. The centre in Geneva is also active, but not so thor oughl y and inclusively; it waits for a greater calm and a firmer sense of security in Europe . The centre in Darjeeling is what is termed occultly \"vibrating\" , but this is in respons e to the relative nearness and propi nqui ty of the Himalayan Brotherhood; whilst in Tokyo there is small activity as yet, and what there is is of no great mom ent. The work at this centre will actually be brought into being through the work of the Triangl es. By that I do not mean that it will be a centre of the Triangl e work, but that the conc entrated meditative activity of the peopl e enga ged in the Triangl e act ivities will magne tically draw out that which must appe ar when a centre is organised. They are in fact creating the needed atmosphe re, and that is ever a preliminary step. Once the atmosphe re or the air in which to breathe and move is existent, then the li ving form can appe ar. Objectively, therefore, the second ray work of teaching is the first to be organised. Subj ectively, the first ray workers are already active, for the work of the first ray with its disturbing and destroyi ng activity prepares the way; pain and disrupt ion ever precede birth, and the agents of the first ray have been working for nearly two hund red years. The agents of the second ray started their preparation around the year 1825 and move d out ward in force soon after 1860. From that date on, great conc epts and new ideas, and the mode rn ideologies and arguments for and against aspects of the truth, have characterised mode rn thought and produc ed the present mental chaos and the many conf licting school s and ideologi es, with their a ttenda nt move ments and organisations ; out of all these, order and truth and the new civilisation will emerge. This civilisation will emerge as the result of mass thinki ng; it will no longe r be a civilisation \"impos ed\" by an oligarchy of any kind. This will be a new phe nom enon and one for which the Hierarchy has had to wait, prior to reappe aring. Had the Hierarchy com e before this era of though t and of massed discussion and the fight to further creative ideas, the tenets and the truths for which the Hierarch y stands coul d be regarded as being also \"impos ed\" upon hum anity, and therefore as infringi ng human freedom . This will not now be the case, and the Hierarchy will com e forth into exot eric manifestation because hum anity has, of its ow n free will, develope d a qua lity analogous to that of the Hierarchy and therefore magne tic to that spiritual organisation. Goodw ill will draw forth from its holy secret hiding place the Expone nts of Love , and thus the new world will com e into being. These subs idiary ashrams are already being attempted in various parts of the world. It is necessary for you to remember that the members of these ashrams will not all be on the teaching line, but will be com pos ed of disciples upon many rays; the attempt to form cohe rent and integrate d ashrams is based upon the recogni tion of the initial difficulty of the various ray aspirants to com prehend each other's poi nt of view and mode of working, and to think in the many differing terms and mode s of thought . There are, how ever, three funda menta l requi rements which must condi tion and colour all the ashrams, no matter what the ray: 1. An internal group uni ty, conduc ive to a synt hesis of unde rstandi ng between the various ashrams. There springs out of a uni fied group obj ective a sense of loya lty to the Hierarchy and a uni formly disciplined life. I said uni form , brother of mine, for the discipline is that of spiritual inclination and an inspired intention which produc es a similarity in the livingne ss of the uni ts in the ashram; this is, of cour se, diversified by the ray qua lity of the aspirants and disciples and by personal ity tradi tion . Pond er"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST on thos e last two words. 2. Similarity of obj ective. By that I mean an appr ehension and appr eciation of the hierarchical Plan and of the cont ribut i on each ashram has to make for its materialisation on earth; to this must be adde d an uni ted ashramic similarity of instinctual and intuitive telepathic rappor t with the senior Members of the ashram — the Masters and initiates of high degree, and through The m — with the Christ. I woul d here call to your attention that the mental inclination of all the esotericists in the world for the past one hundr ed years has been directed tow ards indi vidua l rappor t with a Master, and this because of the necessity of discove r ing the ashram with which the aspirant must make cont act. This attitude has now widened in its approach mentally, by the many diversified disciples in the many different ashrams, into a group move ment or a group inclination tow ards the Christ, the major a nd most impor tant factor in the implementation of the hierarchical Plan. This mental appr oach is not the same thing as the cons tant aspirationa l preoccupa tion of the earnest Christian follow er with the thought of Christ. It is som ething qui te different. I t is a unified group ende avour , generated in each ashram and fostered by all alike, to bring the entire group — as a band of world servers — into the aura of the though t currents of the Christ, as He formulates His ideas, creates the thought form needed prior t o manifestation, and makes His arrange ments for His reappe aring. This is not the same thing as establishing a telepathic rappo rt between an indi vidua l disciple and the Christ, for that is not needed or desirable. The uni ty of aim, the desire to serve, the recogni tion of the present focussed intention of the Hierarchy (unde r the gui dance of the Christ), becom e an invoc ative, magne tic state of group cons cious ness; this evoke s from the Christ and His informed Masters an identification of Their uni ted thought w ith the group aspiration. This is the highe r spiritual corresponde nce of what is called in the three worlds kam a - manas . This is not , I realise, an easy thing to unde rstand when divor ced from the usual Christian conc ept of the relation of Christ to the indi vidua l aspirant. The idea may perhaps be clarified for you by reminding your selves that som e of you who read these words know me and have found you r way into my Ashram, unde r the gui dance of your ow n soul and my ready recogni tion. Others all ov er the world, through their spiritual intuition and their desire to serve and to know , have brough t into their recogni sed area of cons cious ness the teaching which is given in my books . Their relation to me is sym bol ic of the type of relation which disciple s and aspirants can and do establish with the Christ. Though the analogy is far from perfect, it is pos sible to recogni se the corresponde nce in its many gradations of reciprocal sensitivity. 3. A funda mental and basic similarity of sym pathetic respons e by the uni ts in all ashrams to the needs of hum anity, to the qua lity of the programme for their developm ent which the obj ective demands , and to the nature of goodw ill and unde rstandi ng (intelligently appl ied); all these qua lities are not handi cappe d by undue emotiona l sensitivity. These three condi tions will be found in all the ashrams and will uni te the members within any ashram to thos e in other ashrams in a measure or rhyt hm of telepathic relation. From this uni fied and central pos ition a rapidly deepenin g telepathic relation will inevitably be established and sustained by the group , with the ashram and with the Christ, on the one hand, and with hum anity, on the other. With this as a founda tiona l and condi tioning qua lity, the work can proceed as requi red. You will not e, therefore, why I have so cons istently empha sised, dur ing the past thirty years of"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST teaching, the necessity for the developm ent of a truly spiritual and psychic sensitivity, plus the unf oldm ent of the faculty of a scientific telepathic rappor t. I have thereby laid the founda tion of the Science of Impression, with the illum ined and rightly oriented mind as the interpreter, the analyser and the transmitter. ASHRAMIC ADJU STMENT TO EXOTERIC LIVING Octobe r 1949 We now com e to anot h er poi nt in our study of this subj ect: This conc erns one of the most difficult probl ems conf ront ing the Masters at this time; it presents also an uni que probl em to the Christ. The daily phys ical life of the Masters, of the Christ, and of thos e Members of t he Hierarchy (initiates and accepted disciples) Who func tion in phys ical bodi es, has had its orientation upon the subj ective levels of life; the majority of Them, and particularly the senior Members of the Hierarchy, do not as a rule intermingl e largely wi th the publ ic or walk the streets of our great cities. They work as I do from my retreat in the Himalayas, and from there I have influenced and helped far more peopl e than I coul d pos sibly have reached had I walked daily in the midst of the noise and chaos of hum an affairs. I lead a nor mal and, I believe, useful life as the senior executive in a large lamasery, but my main work has lain elsewhere — widespread in the world of men; I reach this vast num ber of hum an beings through the medium of the books which I have written, throug h the groups which I have started and impulsed, such as Men of Goodw ill and the Triangl es, and throug h my disciples who talk and spread the truth as I have sought to present it. So it has been with the work of all the Masters, except two or three Who have unde rgone special training in order to do som e special preparatory work for the externalisation of the Hierarchy. The Engl ish Master is one of these, and anot her Master also Who works, relatively unknow n, in North America. I have refe rred to Him before as the Master P. — though that is not , in reality, His initial. This rule of solitariness or of withdr awing appl ies to all the Masters and to the Christ, for it is in the solitude of the mind, and as far as pos sible in the solitude of phy sical location, that the various branches of the great White Lodge have chos en to work ever since Atlantean days. It is not the solitude of a separative spirit, but the solitude that com es from the ability to be non - separative, and from the facu lty of identification with the soul of all beings and of all forms. This can best be accom plished in the intense qui et of thos e \"protected\" areas where the Masters in the various branches of the Brotherhoo d have chos en to dw ell. This solitude and phys ical isolation enables Them to work almost entirely from the level of the buddhi c or intuitiona l plane, perfecting the Science of Impression, influencing and working through thos e minds which are susceptible to Their mental impression. This appl ies equa lly to M asters in phys ical vehicles and to Thos e Who have \"no anchor age\" in the three worlds; it appl ies also to disciples who are in or out of the body , according to their destiny, immediate karma or form of service. St. Paul, for instance, was in the initiate st age of learning right ly to withdr aw and to work in what Patanjali calls \"isolated uni ty\" when he spoke of himself onc e as \"being caught up into the third heaven\" and there learning the unt old beauties of the divine life. The probl em, therefore, before the Masters and Their disciples is to work (when the externalisation"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST takes place) in the midst of phys ical plane existence, no longe r withdrawn, isolated and protected, but func tioni ng ope nly in the middl e of events and phy sical realities and all the diversit y of cont acts which the three worlds present. It is perhaps helpful to remember that when the Christ was in phys ical presence on earth two thous and years ago, the pop ulation of the world was relatively small com pared to that toda y; cont act between peopl es was practically nil, and where it existed was usually of a strictly military or com mercial nature, with a som ewhat exclusive interchange of schol astic ideas and personne l between the rare centres of learning. It was easy in thos e days to withdr aw into the desert and to disappe ar into the unf reque nted place and to recharge and revitalise the spirit, to touc h again closely the Sour ces of inspiration on the highe r levels of cons cious ness, and thus reorient the working instrum ent in the three worlds to the high er field of cont act and inspiration. Much of this can be not ed in the Gospel story of the life of Christ and of the Master Jesus. When the Christ reappe ars and the Hierarchy externalises itself on earth, condi tions will be totally different; th ere are toda y no empty spaces; the pop ulation of the world is enor mous ly enlarged and is grow ing from year to year; no locality is isolated or una ttainable; the jungl es are ope n territory to the expl orer and to the num erous com mercial agents; vast cities c ove r the planet and oceans are traversed by multitude s of ships; the airways of the world are travelled by millions of passenge rs annua lly; the land is divided into minut e sections by railroads, highw ays, speedw ays and myriads of lesser roads and streets. In fact, every living uni t in the world is in touc h with thous ands of other uni ts and can — through the many means of information — be in touc h with millions ; the news presses grind out the news from hour to hou r and the eyes of millions are ceaselessly glued to the printed page at all hour s of the day or night ; the ears of other millions are daily and hour ly attune d to the voi ce of the radio. Only the inne r perceptive sense remains inactive, for onl y adva nced hum anity lives cons tantly in touc h with the world o f spiritual perception and intention. The condi tions , therefore, conf ront ing the Hierarchy cons titute a serious and drastic probl em. As far as we can, we will attempt to cons ider these condi tions, for som e unde rstandi ng of the probl em is necessary if righ t work is to be done . Necessarily, the probl em is one of a change in the orientation of perception but not necessarily in mode s of living or in any definitely phys ical plane adjustments. Hierarchical orientation has for som e centuries been one of a very s trict internal cons olidation, in order that the magne tic aura of the Hierarchy may unf ailingl y respond to impression from Shamballa, and also be of so potent a nature that it can form a protective screen around the hum an family. Forget not the nature of th e protective service which the Masters have assum ed on behalf of mankind, standi ng between hum anity and the emanations and influences and the magne tic aura of the Black Lodge . This internal cons olidation has been greatly strengt hened dur ing the past one hundr ed years. Because of this, and because of the resultant clarity of impression and of the pot ent out - goi ng influence, the Plan for hum anity — as a Whol e — was imparted with empha sis to disciples in the Ashrams, and by them was formulated clearly and presented to hum anity. H.P.B. (one of the first working disciples to go forth on the externalisation impul se and with first ray energy driving him) gave the backgr ound of the Plan, unde r impression from me; the more detailed structure and the sweep of the hierarchical intention have been given by me in the books which A.A.B. has introduc ed unde r her ow n name to the publ ic (in so doi ng acting unde r my instructions ). For the first time in hum an history, the purpos e of past events — historical and psychol og ical — can be clearly not ed as the founda tion for all present happe nings , thus bringi ng the mysterious Law of Karma in an"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST easy manne r to publ ic attention. The present can also be seen, indi cating the way of the future and revealing clearly the Will - to - Good w hich is animating the entire evol utiona ry process — a process in which hum anity (again for the first time) is intelligently participating and coope rating. It is this coope rative participation, even if unc ons cious ly rende red, which has made it pos sible for th e Hierarchy to grasp the oppo rtuni ty to bring to an end the long silence which has persisted since Atlantean days; the Masters can now begin to unde rtake to renew an ancient \"sharing of the secrets,\" and to prepare hum anity for a civilisation which will be distingui shed by a cons tant intellectual perception of truth, and which will coope rate with the externalised Ashrams in the various parts of the world. The internal cons olidation is now being som ewhat loos ened, if I may use such an inadequa te expr ession, and a majority of the Members of the Hierarchy are withdrawing Their close attention from reception of impression from Shamballa and are now orienting Themselves — in an entirely new and directed manne r — to the four th kingdom in nature. At the same time, a v ery pow erful minor ity of Masters are entering into a much closer association with the Counc il of Sanat Kum ara. In this way the pot ent and dyna mic influence of Shamballa will be strengt hened instead of lessened by the reorientation of the majorit y of the Masters and initiates. These statements have, of cour se, implications which will not be unde rstood by you and which will necessarily pass unnot iced; you will respond, how ever, to the realisation that the minor ity — in renewed and closer cont act with Shamballa — have to master the techni que of relations hip; this will entail much use of the sacrificial will. The reason is that They are (on a highe r turn of the spiral) subm itting to a forcing process which will make great demands upon Them, but which will serve to release the majority to a new and more pot ent form of immediate Earth service. In other words: a few of the Masters and highe r initiates are unde rgoi ng a special and appl ied stimulation and are unde rtaking work for which the uni ted Ashrams, in th eir highe r brackets, have hitherto been respons ible. This subj ects Them to a great strain and forces Them to use the will aspect of Their divine natures in entirely new and unknow n ways. They relinqui sh much, in order to enable the entire Hierarchy to give far more in radiance, guidance, and magne tic invoc ative strengt h than has even before been the case. The majority of the Masters and initiates, in Their turn, also relinqui sh much in order to work exot erically among men. They subj ect Themselves vol unt ari ly to an active stimulation from the senior \"cont acting minor ity\" but relinqui sh the \"joy of Shamballic cont act\". Tempor arily, the training which the majority have been receiving in \"cosmic orientation, \" in the use of the will - to - be (a meaningl ess phr ase t o you) , and in the \"bliss of receptivity to the will - to - good of Sanat Kum ara\" is given up. The entire attitude of the group of Masters, initiates and disciples who are to be respons ible for the externalisation of the Hierarchy and for the preparation for t he reappe arance of the Christ is focussed upon the expe rt use of the Science of Cont act. This time, the science is used upon a wide and telepathic scale, with the soul s of men, and upon the techni que of expr essing spiritually the nature of \"isolated uni ty\" in the cities, jungl es and the massed inhabi ted areas of the earth. This invol ves, as you can well imagine, the use of an expe rt ability to remain unt ouched by the evil rampant upon the phys ical plane, and yet to remain in com plete sym pathetic and und erstandi ng cont act with all hum anity and with all events that affect hum anity. It was prophe cy which impelled the Christ to say, when last in publ ic appe arance among men, that His disciples were \"in the world and yet not of the world\"; Christ depict ed in simple yet profoundl y revealing terms the life of the Members of His Ashrams (the entire Hierarchy) when again He woul d walk with Them in the plain sight of hum anity. He pictured Them as one with the Father (the Counc il of Life in Shamballa), and yet as one with Him (as the hierarchical Head), and as one also with all that breathes and that inha bits form. I advi se all disciples who seek to coope rate with the impendi ng activity of the Hierarchy to study with care the seventeenth chapter of the Gospel o f St. John; this was written by that disciple of love, unde r the influence of the energy emanating from"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST the buddhi c vehicle of the Christ, which is also — as you have been told — identical with the buddhi c vehicle of the Buddha . The identity of the two vehicle s is sym bol ic of the entire teaching anent \"isolated uni ty\" and divine participation, which the Masters in Their Ashrams are teaching Their disciples of all grades, these days, as the first step tow ard the externalisation of Their activities. An intensive training process, therefore, is being carried out in every ashram and along identical lines, resulting in the \"isolation, \" occultly unde rstood, of certain Masters and initiates. They have been thus isolated in order that They may work more readily and eas ily with Shamballa; They can thus form a dyna mic and galvanic storehous e of energy (the energy of the divine Will) and thus make it available for the use of the other Members of the Hierarchy, as They stand in \"isolated uni ty\" upon the highw ays of Earth, a nd thus are \"in the world and yet not of the world\". The learning of this lesson calls into activity the sacrificial will of bot h the hierarchical groups ; this remains the bindi ng cord between Them and that aspect of the antahka rana along which energy can flow in a new and electric fashion from Shamballa, via the hierarchical minor ity referred to above , and into the large group of Masters and initiates and disciples to whom is com mitted the task of cons olidation. All this cons titutes — for the Memb ers of the Hierarchy — a definite process of testing out and of trial, prior to and preparatory to som e of the highe r initiations . Again, the Members of the Hierarchy are not onl y sensitive to impression from the two other planetary centres (Shamballa and H um anity), but They are acutely aware of the Forces of Evil which are fight ing furious ly against the externalisation of the spiritual work. The energy which cosmic evil generates is active along three main channe ls: 1. From the centre of cosmic evil upon t he cosmic astral plane. Of this centre you can know nothing, and its emanations and its magne tic aura can onl y be unde rstood and recogni sed or interpreted by the senior Masters and by initiates of still highe r rank. As the pot ency of the astral plane (whic h is so familiar to us all) weakens, and glamour and illusion are negated by a rapid spiritualising of hum anity, the pow er of cosmic evil will correspondi ngl y weaken and the Forces of Evil will be una ble to reach the planet with their present easy effort. It is against the impact of this emanating evil that the Hierarchy stands in protection of humanity. Hitherto it has been the task of Shamballa, working through the Hierarchy, to protect hum anity from the \"intention to destroy\" of the cosmic Forces of Evil , but — in the com ing cycle and as a result of the triumph of the Forces of Light in the world war — the pot ency of Shamballa can be com bined with that of the \"protecting Agents of Light .\" 2. From the Black Lodge which is the externalisation of the centre of cosmic evil on Earth. Just as the White Lodge is the representative or corresponde nce of the cosmic centre of light upon Sirius (the true Great White Lodge ), so the Black Lodge is also representative of ancient and cosmic evil. The Black Lodge is also far more adva nced in externalisation than is the White Lodge , because materialism and matter are, for it, the line of least resistance. The Black Lodge is therefore far more firmly anchor ed upon the phys ical plane than is the Hierarchy. It requi res a much greater effort for the White Lodge to \"clothe itself in matter and work and walk on material levels\" than for the Black Lodge . Owing, how ever, to the spiritual grow th of manki nd and to the steady, even if slow , orientation of manki nd to the spiritua l Hierarchy, the time has com e when the Hierarchy can materialise and meet the enemy of good upon an even foot ing; the Hierarchy need not be further handi cappe d by working in subs tance whilst the Forces of Evil work bot h in subs tance and in matter. Once th e reappe arance of the Christ and of the Hierarchy is an accom plished fact, these Forces of Evil face sure defeat. The reason for this is that the trend of hum an living and thought is turning steadily tow ards the subj ective spiritual values, even if these v alues are interpreted in terms of material well - being at present and of better living"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST condi tions for all — with peace and security also for all. The Black Lodge or the planetary centre of evil works almost entirely upon the astral plane, and is impressed dir ectly and gui ded in detail from the cosmic astral plane. 3. From the negative or pur ely material forces of the planet, which are not necessarily either good or bad but which have been used instinctually and oft unc ons cious ly by hum anity for purely materia l ends , and are therefore basically anti - spiritual and subj ect to the influence of hum an desire — a desire oriented tow ards selfishne ss, and therefore tow ards separateness. This form of evil is being com bated toda y by the New Group of World Servers. Of this battle you know som ething because every thinki ng man and wom an is immediately implicated. I have spoke n of the evil present in the planet in very simple terms, and there are pha ses of it to which I have not referred; the interlocking and inter - penetrating of the grades of evil are far more numerous and intricate than you surmise. In sum ming up, I woul d say that the present reorientation of the Hierarchy, in relation bot h to Shamballa and to Hum anity, ushers in the cycle of com plete defeat of co smic evil upon our planet, leaving onl y an isolated and weakened Black Lodg e to die a slow death; this permits the purification of hum an desire to such an extent that \"matter will be redeemed by the sacrificial will of Thos e Who know , by the will - to - good o f Thos e Who are, and by the goodw ill of thos e sons of men who have turned their faces to the light and who in turn reflect that light .\" As all disciples know , one of the probl ems with which they are cons tantly confront ed is an extreme sensitivity to the t hought currents of thos e with whom they are immediately in cont act. The more adva nced the disciple, the greater is his probl em. The theory that if one lives and works on a high level of cons cious ness one is immune to that which emanates from the low er leve l doe s not in practice hol d good. The occult law proclaims that the greater can always include the lesser, and just as that is true of the planetary Logos (Who is the sum total of all lesser forms within His manifested uni verse), so the same law appl ies al so to all hum an beings . The disciple, therefore, can always include that which emanates from thos e who are below him on the ladder of evol ution. The more a disciple is unde r the influence of the Law of Love , the more easily doe s he tune in and absorb the t hought s and register the desires of thos e around him, and particularly of those who are tied to him in the bonds of affection and of karmic relation. As disciples proceed from initiation to initiation, the will aspect fortifies the intellect and directs th e expr ession of the energy of love , and thus the problem lessens, for the initiate learns certain protective rules which are not available to the neophyt e. The latter must learn, first of all, how to identify himself with others, as the basis of a higher i dentification which condi tions the senior initiates in the scale of being. The preparation of the Members of the Ashrams found within the Hierarchy, Who must emerge from Their retreats and live among men in the ordinary intercour se of daily life, has nece ssitated much discussion and instituted a drastic training system within the Ashrams. Into the nature of this training I cannot enter, for it differs for disciples upon the various rays and the theme is too large at this poi nt for our pur pos e. T he probl em has been how to preserve the sym pathetic, sensitive rappor t and to lay the basis for the highe r, inclusive identification, and yet at the same time preserve a spiritual detachm ent which will enable the disciple to do his needed work, unha mpered and uni mpeded by the distress, the anxi ety or the thought activity evoke d by the minds and the desires of thos e with whom he is working. The necessary detachm ent cannot be based upon the inna te instinct of self - preservation, even when that"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST is carried into the realm of the soul ; it must be motivated by an occult absorption in the task, and implemented by the will which keeps the channe l of cont act ope n between the disciple and the ashram and between the disciple and his sphe re of activity; this channe l must be kept entirely clear of all low er identifications . This might be termed a method of eliminating all tende ncies to register anyt hing save a wise appr ehension of the poi nt in evol ution of thos e cont acted; a sound appr eciation of the probl em to be faced on their behalf, and a process of directing the needed energy of love in such a manne r that the stream of projected love not onl y aids the recipient, but protects the disciple from undue cont act; it will then evoke in the person to be helped, or the group to be aided, no reciprocal persona lity expr ession; instead, it lifts the entire qua lity of the persona lity life or the group life on the pur ificatory way on to highe r levels of awareness. A great part of the work to be done by the disciples who are emerging from the ashrams, and will cont inue thus to emerge, is of a purificatory nature at this time, and increasingl y so for the rest of this century. On the Path of Proba tion, the aspirant is taught to purify himself and his three vehicles of cont act; upon acce ptance into an ashram, a large measure of the needed pur ification has been achieved. From then on, no empha sis shoul d be laid by the disciple on the pur ification of his ow n nature, for this woul d produc e too close and intimate a self - focus and tend to an o ver - stimulation of the persona lity vehicles. But the lessons learnt upon the Proba tionary Path will be found by him to be simply the founda tion for the Science of Purification or — if I may use a word made familiar to you through the war expe rienc e — of De - cont amination. This will be brought into full expr ession by the working disciples who will be respons ible for the preparation of the world for the reappe arance. This pur ificatory process falls into the follow ing stages: 1. The stage wherein the ta inted area, the hidde n evil, or the diseased factors are recogni sed and dul y cont acted in order to ascertain the extent of the purificatory measures requi red. This is a poi nt of danger for the disciple. 2. The process of discove ring the magne tic areas, ma gne tised in past centuries, and even aeons , by Members of the Hierarchy. This is done so as to make available the transmission of energies there stored. In the cycle which is now close at hand, these magne tic centres will be largely tappe d or utilised by t he world disciples respons ible for the pur ificatory work. 3. The stage wherein the disciple withdr aws his attention from the sour ce of difficulty and conc entrates upon certain mantric usages and certain hierarchical formulas, thus setting loos e the energi es needed to destroy the germs of evil, latent or active, thus eliminating certain materialistic tende ncies, and strengt hening the soul of all that is to be pur ified and the life to be found within every form. It is wise to remember that, for instance, as the Master works with His disciples and strengt hens the life within them and evoke s their soul into pot ency from latency, every form and every atom within their various bodi es is equa lly energised and aided. It is this fundamental process which will gui de the disciples and the initiates in the com ing work of world pur ification. 4. The stage of withdr awing of the purifying energies; this is to be follow ed by a period of stabilising the pur ified form and starting the life and soul within it on a new cycle of spiritual grow th. I have worded all this in such a manne r that it will be evident that the work to be done is not confined onl y to hum anity, but also to the forms of life in the other kingdom s in nature. The study of this Science of Appl ied P urification is one which is engr ossing the attention of all the"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST ashrams at this time; disciples in the first ray ashram, in the second ray ashram and in the seventh ray ashram are peculiarly active along these lines, for the destruction of evil is the work of the first ray, and in so destroyi ng its effects pur ity is achieved; the fostering of good then becom es pos sible and is the work of the second ray, of the Builders; and the bringi ng of spiritual energy into cont act with subs tance, and cons eque ntly with matter, is the uni que work of the seventh ray because it is now in manifestation. The rays which are active and in manifestation at this time and in this cycle are there in conf ormity to the Plan and in preparation for the externalisation of the Hierarchy and the reappe arance of the Christ. These rays are particularly invol ved, and therefore the initiates and the disciples in the ashrams of the Masters are also particularly implicated. The science of Appl ied Purification is also the Science of Appl ied Ener gy , with the specific objective in view of \"eliminating the unde sirable and that which hinde rs the entrance of the light , and thus provi ding space and entry for the desired, for the good, the beautiful and the true\". In the appl ication of this science ther e is of cour se no infringe ment of the hum an preroga tive of free will. This ancient science is conc erned primarily with the purification and with the redemption of matter, and it is entirely in the hands of hum an beings , unde r the direction of the Hierarchy . This direction may be cons cious ly or unc ons cious ly registered. The Science of Redemption (to which I have several times earlier referred) is in reality the appl ied art of esotericism and of spiritual living which is already being taught to manki nd; they are steadily learning to redeem the bodi es through which they func tion. It is in reality the art or science of relations hip between the Life and the lives, as H.P.B. expr esses it. As far as the other kingdom s in nature are conc erned, the purifi cation is appl ied by the Hierarchy, through the medium of hum an beings , and this can be seen in process at this time. This present activity, carried on now largely unc ons cious ly, will be redoubl ed and carried forward cons cious ly by trained initiates and di sciples, working through and with aspirants. It is this that is now being studi ed in the various hierarchical ashrams, and when appl ied — after 1975 — will bring about great and important change s in world living. Anot her matter to which the Hierarchy is at th is time attendi ng, in view of the com ing adjustments requi red, is the discove ry of aspirants and thos e who are close to accepted discipleship in all lands , in order that the langua ge problem will present little difficulty. Having discove red such peopl e, Th eir next step is to subj ect them to a process of training in telepathic susceptibility, so that they will be sensitive to hierarchical impression. At the same time, their intuition will requi re stimulation but — as the intuition is useless and inaccessible w ithout a high grade intelligence — all these peopl e must be sough t for upon mental levels. The pos session of the abstract mind is not sufficient. It is useful, in that it gua rantees the ability of the aspirant to cons truct the antahka rana; it is nevertheless qui te pos sible to pos sess a well develope d abs tract cons cious ness and yet to be qui te devoi d of all intuitive perception. For example, this is the major limitation of Z.... He is a sound abstract thinke r and they are som ewhat rare, being usually impracti cal idealists. He is not , how ever, the least intuitive as yet. He coul d easily be — given certain needed surrende rs. Basically speaking, the intuition is not the revealer of esoteric truths. They com e along anot her line of spiritual perception. The intuitio n is essentially the organ of group perception and that which eventually elevates the persona lity to its right ful position as the agent of the Soul in the group . Z ... has a sound theory as to group attitude s and group work, and he will be excee dingl y surprised at these com ments of mine. But — as long as he insulates himself from warm group cont acts and fails to seek (in the name of service) the love of the group , and as long as he fails to recogni se error and his ow n part in"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST any current mistakes w henever they occur, and as long as he transfers respons ibility to others when he is himself to blame, he will fail to register intuitive information, because his persona lity reactions will intervene. He must not be deceived by the fact that peopl e like him on the platform; that is group work, but not essentially working with the group. He must learn that at present he is the onl ooke r at the group and as yet not a part of it, and that he is primarily focussed on \"delivering the goods \" (if I may use your Amer ican phr ase) to his persona lity and its acclaim, and not to the group . This will be hard for him to realise and he must be given time. He wants to make good, spiritually and esoterically, but needs to grasp the fact that this is done through love and under standi ng and not through the intellect. He is insulated by his ow n strong desire to make good, according to his ow n theories and to his persona lity, thus provi ng to himself the grasp his soul may have ove r that persona lity. This creates barriers, but the i nsulating and separating wall between him and his co - workers is very thin and coul d easily be \"rent in twain,\" if his pride woul d permit and if he woul d descend to a recogni tion of equa lity with all the group with whom he is associated, and with the most u nimpor tant members of that group; this he doe s not yet do — in spite of what he believes about himself. The searchlight of the Hierarchy is sweeping the planet at this time singl ing out men and wom en, here and there, from the mass of men. They indi cate esot eric pos sibility, and in their lives love of hum anity and love of the Christ is a basic and funda mental factor. The ordinary devot ed person, who cons tantly pledges and dedicates himself to the Christ or to the Masters in a spirit of ador ation, will not be chos en for this specific training. Their ow n attitude s and developm ent com e violently between them and their obj ective. The man who forgets about himself, and who is more interested in helping unha ppy human beings , but who is nevertheless staun chly convi nced of the factor of the uns een worlds, is the man for whom search is at this time being made. When these men and wom en are found, the work of the discove ring initiate is to see to it that information com es to the aspirant in som e form or anot h er anent the hierarchical Plan, conc erning the reappe arance of the Christ (unde r som e name familiar to the aspirant's religious backgr ound ), and about the funda mental and needed occult truths — with particular empha sis upon the Law of Cause and Effect, and s econda rily upon the Law of Rebirth. The Law of Cause and Effect is of far greater importance than the Law of Rebirth, because it necessitates action upon the part of the aspirant, and that action inevitably condi tions the future. There is not hing he can do about the Law of Rebirth but subm it to it and be grateful that oppo rtuni ty cont inue s to present itself. As regards the many other adjustments which Members of the Hierarchy in all Their many differing grades will have to make in what might be called Thei r persona lity lives and habits, I have naught to say. I know well the que stions which will arise in your minds , and I woul d like to touc h upon one or two of them. For instance, som e of you are asking: 1. How will these Members of the Hierarchy in Their va rious grades appe ar on earth? Will They com e through the methods of ordinary birth, of childhoo d and maturity? Som e initiates may follow this ordinary pattern, som e are already passing through it toda y and are in the stages of infancy and adol escence; to t hem will be given a large share of the preparatory work. Som e will not pass through these relatively limiting pha ses, but will pass back and forth between the out er world and the world of hierarchical ende avour ; they will be som etimes present in phys ical b odi es and som etimes not . This method of activity will not be pos sible as long as the present rules of nationa l and civilian identification, of passpor ts and of drastic airport and seapor t inspection are requi red by the author ities; such peopl e a s these \"transitting initiates\" woul d not be able to identify themselves. This form of"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST appe arance is therefore pos tpone d for som e time. Som e of the Masters will create what is called in the langua ge of the East the \"mayavirupa \" — a vehicle of expr ession whic h is bui lt of atom ic phys ical and astral subs tance and of conc rete mental subs tance. This They can create at will, use at will and cause to vanish at will; Their probl em is not , therefore, so acute in the matter of appe aring and of reappe aring as is that o f the initiate who cannot thus create to suit his pur pos e and his service. 2. Will all the Members of the Hierarchy make Their appe arance at the same time? Certainly not . The appe aring of these initiates and Masters will begin with isolated members appe ar ing and living among men, com ing forth one by one , doing the requi red work, returning through the por tals of appa rent death to the inne r subj ective Ashram, and then again appearing by one or other of the methods mentione d above . This process has been goi ng on for som e time and began around the year 1860 . The work of these disciples in the hum an cons cious ness is already being recogni sed, and already they have succeeded in changi ng the cons cious ness and the thinki ng of many millions . Their ideas are already p ermeating world thinki ng. I woul d remind you also (for your encour agement) that I myself am among this num ber of working initiates (for, in the last analysis, that is all that any Master is), and that I, from my phys ical anchor age, i.e., my phys ical body a nd my location in northern Indi a, and in collabor ating with a disciple, A.A.B., and also with F.B., have done much to bring certain conc epts (old and yet new in their presentation) to the cons cious ness of hum anity. I have also done much to stimulate from l atency to pot ency the instinctual goodw ill of men. I mention this for this is not a uni que achievement; there are many other Masters Who — with Their disciples — are to be found toda y actively func tioni ng in hum an affairs and struggl ing, unde r adve r se conditions , to change the trend of hum an thinki ng from a frank materialism to a genui ne spiritual aspiration. There are many other que stions arising in the minds of my readers, and the less adva nced they are the greater the que stioni ng and the greater the empha sis upon the materialistic, and therefore non - impor tant, aspects of this entire subj ect. With them I have no intention of dealing, though I know well what they are, and so doe s A.A.B. They are of no vitality, and will answer themselves in due time . When the task of the preparation of men's minds is further adva nced, when the know ledge of the existence of the Masters and Their hierarchical endeavour and of the uni ted Hierarchy of our planet are a com monl y recogni sed truth, and when active goo dw ill is recogni sed as a real nationa l asset in all lands , then the speed of the externalisation of the Hierarchy will be greatly increased; then the five spiritual centres will begin to take definite form, and will call also for recogni tion; the groups there wo rking will be know n, and they will also be in close touc h with each other. From that time on, the network of initiates and disciples unde r the direction of the Masters will be worldw ide, and in every field of hum an expr ession the opi nion of these men and w om en, and of the Masters presiding at the five centres and in Their affiliated groups , will be regarded as of immense value by all gove rnmental, econom ic and social organisations . Then — unde r a great wave of spiritual inspiration — the divine spirit of expe c tancy for the reappe arance of the Christ will sweep through the world; it will then be regarded as credible and creditable, and His com ing will provi de the germ for all world hope ; the reason for this will be that the most respected, enlight ened and cultur ed peopl e on the planet will be looki ng for Him. And then, my brothers, He will com e, bringi ng new energies of love and com passion and implementing the spirit of fresh enlight enm ent; to these important events must also be adde d the new revelatio n for which all men wait and to which they will be able to respond, ow ing to the needed and new stimulation. Many who are reading this section of my instructions will be disappoi nted (so futile and silly is the"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST hum an mind in so many cases) because I do no t choos e to cons ider now the means whereby the Members of the Hierarchy will adjust Themselves to mode rn living condi tions , as to what food They will eat and whether They will marry or not marry. One thing only will I say: They will take mode rn life and wh at it means and will proceed to demons trate how that life (the normal produc t of the evol utiona ry process) can be lived divinely; They will expr ess the highe st ideal of marriage (I woul d here remind you that many of the Masters are married and have raised families) and demons trate the principle which unde rlies the perpetuation of the race of men; They will also show how all life is one life, that the form nature is ever a sacrificial uni ty in the vast scheme of divine manifestation; They will show us also t hat whatever we do, whether we eat or drink, all must be done unde r correct, temperate and natural law and in a spirit of lovi ng unde rstanding, and ever to the glory of God. They will expr ess ordered, temperate living in all things , and will demons trate al so the pos sibility of the existence of peopl e on earth who have no wrong inclinations and no bad qua lities in their natures. They will stand forth as living examples of goodw ill, of true love , of intelligent appl ied wisdom , of high good nature and hum our , and of nor malcy. They may inde ed be so nor mal that recogni tion of what They are may escape not ice. They will, finally, demons trate to all around Them the signi ficance of right motive, the beauty of selfless service and a vivid intellectual perception. Thi s, my brothers, is such a platitudi nous statement, from the poi nt of view of the nice well - meaning person, that its value may escape your attention. Yet it is a statement that, any initiate will tell you, warrants your closest attention and cons ideration — a cons ideration which must be follow ed by an effort to expr ess these same qua lities upon your way tow ards the Door of Initiation. The Work of the External ised Ashram s The barest out line must here suffice. I have dealt with the propos ed work of the externalised Ashrams at som e lengt h in the foregoi ng pages and also in several of my other books , 16 Letters on Occult Meditation , Letters VIII and IX. A Treatise on Cosmic Fire , Pages 747 - 760 . A Treatise on the Seven Rays , Vol. V: (The Rays and the Ini tiations ) .* and a more detailed presentation will not be pos sible at this time. The appr oaching externalisation will bring about an increased stimulation which will necessarily affect disciples and aspirants and will invol ve a period of adjustment to this highe r vibration. Adjustment to the increased livingne ss will be facilitated by the enunc iation of certain basic statements for the gui dance of disciples, aspirants and peopl e of goodw ill. Specifically, the externalised Ashrams will be active along four m ajor lines: 1. Creating and vitalising the new world religion. 2. The gradua l reorganising of the social order — an order free from oppr ession, the persecution of minor ities, materialism and pride. 3. The publ ic inaugu ration of the system of initiation. This will invo lve the grow th and com prehension of sym bol ism. 4. The exot eric training of disciples and of hum anity in this new cycle. Meanw hile, what is it that you, my brothers, must do in this interim period? What is your work and"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"Twenty - Four Books of Esoteric Philosophy     Copyright ©1998 LUCIS TRUST your goa l? Let me emp hasise one or two points: The material goal which all who love their fellow men and serve the Hierarchy must ever have in mind and at heart is the defeat of totalitariani sm . I do not say the defeat of Com muni sm, but the defeat of that evil proce ss which invol ves the impos ition of ideas , and which can be the method of the democratic nations and of the chur ches everyw here, just as much as it is the method of the U.S.S.R. This we call totalitarianism. I woul d ask you to have this distinction clearly in you r minds . Your material goa l is the defeat of all that infringe s hum an free will and which keeps hum anity in ignor ance; it appl ies equa lly to any established system — Catholic or Protestant — which impos es its conc epts and its will upon its adhe rents. To talitarianism is the basis of evil toda y; it is found in all systems of gove rnm ent, of educ ation; it is found in the hom e and in the com munity. I refer not here to the laws which make group relations sound, pos sible and right ; such laws are essential to co mmuni ty and nationa l well - being and are not totalitarian in nature. I refer to the impos ition of the will of the few upon the total mass of the peopl e. The defeat of this unde sirable tende ncy everyw here is your definite material goa l. Your spiritual goal is the establ ishing of the Kingd om of God. One of the first steps tow ards this is to prepare men's minds to accept the fact that the reappe arance of the Christ is imminent. You must tell men everyw here that the Masters and Their groups of disciples are act ively working to bring order out of chaos. You must tell them that there IS a Plan, and that not hing can pos sibly arrest the working out of that Plan. You must tell them that the Hierarchy stands , and that It has stood for thous ands of years, and is the ex pression of the accum ulated wisdom of the ages. You must tell them above all else that God is love , that the Hierarchy is love , and that Christ is com ing because He love s hum anity. This is the message which you must give at this time. And with this respon sibility I leave you. Work , my brothers.   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 This message appe ars in th e book 8 9 Reprinted from 10 See 11 NOTE: 12 13 Since 1951 this work has been carried forward und er the title of World Goodw ill. 14 15 16 "}]
