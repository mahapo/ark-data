I live in a physical body like other men, on theborders of Tibet, and at times (from the exoteric standpoint) preside over alarge group of Tibetan lamas, when my other duties permit. It is this fact thathas caused it to be reported that I am an abbot of this particular lamasery.Those associated with me in the work of the Hierarchy (and all true disciplesare associated in this work) know me by still another name and office. A.A.B.knows who I am and recognises me by two of my names.I am a brother of yours, who has travelled a little longer upon the Path thanhas the average student, and has therefore incurred greater responsibilities. Iam one who has wrestled and fought his way into a greater measure of light thanhas the aspirant who will read this article, and I must therefore act as atransmitter of the light, no matter what the cost. I am not an old man, as agecounts among the teachers, yet I am not young or inexperienced. My work is toteach and spread the knowledge of the Ageless Wisdom wherever I can find aresponse, and I have been doing this for many years. I seek also to help theMaster M. and the Master K.H. whenever opportunity offers, for I have been longconnected with Them and with Their work. In all the above, I have told you much;yet at the same time I have told you nothing which would lead you to offer methat blind obedience and the foolish devotion which the emotional aspirantoffers to the Guru and Master Whom he is as yet unable to contact. Nor will hemake that desired contact until he has transmuted emotional devotion intounselfish service to humanity-not to the Master.The books that I have written are sent out with no claim for their acceptance.They may, or may not, be correct, true and useful. It is for you to ascertaintheir truth by right practice and by the exercise of the intuition. Neither Inor A.A.B. is the least interested in having them acclaimed as inspiredwritings, or in having anyone speak of them (with bated breath) as being thework of one of the Masters. If they present truth in such a way that it followssequentially upon that already offered in the world teachings, if theinformation given raises the aspiration and the will-to-serve from the plane ofthe emotions to that of the mind (the plane whereon the Masters can be found)then they will have served their purpose. If the teaching conveyed calls forth aresponse from the illumined mind of the worker in the world, and brings aflashing forth of his intuition, then let that teaching be accepted. But nototherwise. If the statements meet with eventual corroboration, or are deemedtrue under the test of the Law of Correspondences, then that is well and good.But should this not be so, let not the student accept what is said.August 1934"},{"pageContent":"THE GREAT INVOCATIONFrom the point of Light within the Mind of GodLet light stream forth into the minds of men.Let Light descend on Earth.From the point of Love within the Heart of GodLet love stream forth into the hearts of men.May Christ return to Earth.From the centre where the Will of God is knownLet purpose guide the little wills of men—The purpose which the Masters know and serve.From the centre which we call the race of menLet the Plan of Love and Light work out.And may it seal the door where evil dwells.Let Light and Love and Power restore the Plan on Earth.“The above Invocation or Prayer does not belong to any person or group but toall Humanity.

Theintroduction written by her in the first volume may be profitably reread inrelation to both volumes.The Master Djwhal Khul, known also as “The Tibetan,” took advantage of theopportunity of the availability of A.A.B. as a trained collaborator andinitiated an unique and pioneering experiment in new age training for groupinitiation. This involved the entry of those qualifying into His Ashram there tostay as they hastened their progress or to pass on to other Ashrams as the casemight be.For this purpose the Master selected some fifty people, most but not all of whomwere known to A.A.B., to whom this unique and transcendent opportunity wasoffered. Almost everyone accepted but some did not stay very long. It was noteasy. As was inevitable and very human, some as time went on reacted well,others not. It is hard to keep a right balance between the soul and thepersonality when the spiritual stimulant is relentlessly high. The rushing intothe personal life of soul force is like sunshine in a garden. Weeds as well asflowers emerge.It was a new age group forcing process, tested in operation by the use of thisgroup of chelas all of whom had voluntarily accepted, and any one of whom wasfree to leave at any time without blame. The values achieved were much more thanany obvious comment can display. Much of the deeper values are more subtle andslow to emerge. Individuals benefited greatly. As a group achievement it was nota success as is made abundantly clear in these pages, but the group is a livingentity on the inner planes of possible great future usefulness.[xii] Mrs. Bailey gave unsparingly of her life and strength to do this workwhich was to her an extra and a heavy burden. It was particularly distasteful toher to take the personal instructions. Indeed sometimes when certain individualsdid not like what the Tibetan said to them about themselves they blamed her.The training given to this group was not a part of Mrs. Bailey’s system oftraining in the Arcane School. The Arcane School is not a training school forinitiation and the goal is not to help the student to get into an ashram or tocontact a Master. The purpose of the Arcane School is, and always has been, tohelp the student to move forward more quickly on the Path of Discipleship. Itdoes not deal either with the problems incident to the Probationary Path nor ofthe Path of Initiation. The Master Djwhal Khul has stated that in the new agethe field of training for the disciple is in the New Group of World Servers.The decision to publish the record (or most of it) was an unexpected developmentto the Tibetan but welcomed by Him. He said that this act attracted theattention of other members of the Hierarchy. The appearance of the first volumehas already proved a major addition to the entire esoteric field, especially interms of what modern discipleship really is, and the practical realisticattitude that a Master has to his chela.This second volume brings additional teaching both in the general text and inthe remaining personal instructions which are amazingly frank and direct. A fewpersonally assigned meditations are included to show the technique of thetraining in individual cases, but the individual training was always incidentalto a planned special group achievement.It should be remembered that these meditations are dangerous to use except asprescribed by a Master and used under His watchful eye, just as there are manymedicines available to the public which are not safe except as directed by aphysician.An examination of the text will reveal many factors knowable only to a Masterwhich made these meditations safe and the breathing exercises useful while Hewas watching [xiii] the effects. For example: He knew not only the Ray qualitiesof all the vehicles but also the degree of response to Ray stimulant of anyparticular vehicle in relation to total, balanced progress. He knew also theconditioning Rays of the previous incarnation which may appear as a “hangover”not to be developed but to be transcended.He knew the astrological characteristics of the soul, a factor as yet unknown topresent day astrology but of much importance in advanced stages of discipleship.He knew the exact condition and degree of unfoldment of all the force centres inthe chela which in certain cases He stated in exact percentages. Even with thisknowledge given us we could not know which centre to stimulate next nor howmuch. Moreover Djwhal Khul has said that given a consecrated active life ofselfless service to one’s fellow man the centres will unfold naturally andsafely without attention to them.The Master also knew the basic and planned purpose of the soul for the presentincarnation, the hidden hindering karmic forces working out and the latentspiritual capacities previously achieved which could be wisely called upon.Someday we shall have occult schools of meditation giving training forinitiation. There are none such today. Those claiming to give such training arefalse teachers, often sincere but self-deluded. This also has been stated bothby the Tibetan and by A.A.B.Foster Bailey.March 1955."},{"pageContent":"SECTION ONE — TALKS TO DISCIPLESINTRODUCTORY REMARKSJanuary 1940MY BROTHER:[3] May I say that when I am able to start my instruction to this New Seed Groupwith the words “My Brothers,” you will then know that an adequate measure ofgroup-integration has been achieved and that the real group work can begin. Ihave earlier stated the wider and more important objectives (Discipleship in theNew Age, Vol. I, Pages 80-81) which are, as you saw, entirely impersonal. Iwould commit this particular objective to your intelligent consideration. Iwould have you begin your new work with this objective and goal in your definedconsciousness. I therefore stated the objective clearly, so that your minds maybe tuned to mine—as far as that may be practically possible. Let your horizon bewide, my brother, and your humility great. I am here speaking individually toyou, for you are as yet (the majority of you) individually polarised and thegroup polarisation lies ahead.I have given much thought to what I have enjoined upon you in your personalinstruction. I have attempted to gauge you and your need from the point of thenext lesson you need to learn and the next step that you can take which willrelease you, each and all, for fuller and deeper spiritual service. I have notattempted to consider you from the point of your attainment upon the Path. Ihave attempted to aid you in the instructions as a group more than asindividuals, and I will therefore ask you to read each other’s instructions withgreat care, for you will find your name and perhaps some suggestions occurringin other papers than your own. It is as a group that you work and as a group yougo forward.[4] The sense of criticism and wrong reaction to each other’s knowledge israpidly disappearing from among you. That is good. The growth of impersonalitymust be steady and sure. The faults evidenced by each and all of you are on thesurface of your lives, but the deep inner integration and the activity of thedivine nature in each of you is more definitely vital than before. I do not saythat it is as yet in full right outer expression. It can and does produce attimes a surface turmoil, but this, if rightly handled, need cause no truedisturbance.Give to each other real love in the times that lie ahead, for it is the fusingand illuminating element in the life of the disciple. Let not your love remaintheoretical, but give that true understanding which ignores mistakes, recognisesno barriers, refuses all separating thoughts, and surrounds each other with thatprotecting wall of love that meets all need wherever possible—physical,emotional and mental. It is this which blends the group into one organisedwhole, which the Masters of the Wisdom can use in the service of the Plan. Thepressure at this time is great upon Them and the urgency of humanity’s cry growsstronger in Their ears. I have given you much time and thought, and earnestly Ihave sought to aid you on the Way. My love and strength are ever yours, but notalways my time and attention. My earnest prayer is that the Light may enfold youand the Love of God transmute your lives.For many years I have been looking ahead with definite planning and intent tothe work which began in the late summer of 1936. I have sought—with theknowledge of some of you—to prepare you all as a group for an activeparticipation in this future work. As I enter upon the task of preparing you forfuture increased usefulness and for closer cooperation, I must myself perforcetake certain risks, and there must be established between us a trust which willbe based—not on secrecy and reticences—but on truth and understanding.This formation of the New Seed Group is my second attempt to be of hierarchicalassistance in inaugurating the New Age methods and technique and to train groups(for it [5] is a group age) which can express the New Age types of work. In myfirst attempt certain group limitations initiated difficulty and led to theclosing of the several individual groups. You will have noted that I assignedthe major failure to the inactivity of the heart centre in the majority of themembers; this leads necessarily to inadequate integration. I mention this nowbecause I would urge those members who have been selected to work in this newgroup to bear in mind that they may quite easily carry their earlier tendencyinto the new group. Only a fresh dedication and a renewed aspiration towardsinspiration can prevent the recurrence of a certain static tendency; only aclear vision of the nature of glamour and of its effects in the individual andgroup life can eliminate the danger of infection from that tendency; only ahumble spirit which is not occupied with the faults and failures of others canprevent the injection of an attitude of criticism and judging; and only anattentive watchfulness on the part of a certain few of the members can protectthis new vehicle from disaster based on inexperienced self-confidence.I have seriously considered what action I should rightly take. Variousalternatives presented themselves—all of them concerned with the group work perse; none of them concerned you, as individuals. I could continue with the groupsas they existed but, brother of mine, what more could I say, or do or teachthem? The constant impartation of teaching and of information, the constantpointing out of failure, and the constant individual training are no part of thetechnique of the Hierarchy—certainly not as far as the individual aspirant isconcerned. Where world values and where group consciousness are involved, theindication of needed change, the cyclic bringing about of the presentation tothe soul of the Ageless Wisdom and the training of the world disciples—such isthe definite and ordained technique of the Hierarchy. But this is not Theirmethod of work with personalities and with those whose orientation is primarilyin the three worlds of human endeavour.Their method and procedure is to try out the personalities of Their intended andindicated disciples and—should [6] these measure up with adequacy—then toproceed with the work of esoteric training. It is the same with groups; theseare tested and tried in connection with the group personality, and upon theresponse depends the future activity of both the group and its Master andTeacher. But it is the group, as you see, which decides procedure.I have endeavoured to remove out of this group those elements which mightperchance have handicapped it, and which the group members—as they are atpresent constituted and motivated—are not capable of absorbing. Group unity isnot dependent upon personal sympathy, personal liking and understanding as itmay exist between the group members, but upon capacity to absorb and assimilate,to lift, to change and to transmute those units which seem at first to beuncongenial or even unsuitable—from the limited point of view of the groupmember. This is oft overlooked, but upon the capacity to do this depends much ofgroup success. When a group cannot yet be depended upon to do this necessaryabsorption, the apparent rejection of certain people is not the fault of thosepeople, but that of the group which is not yet integrated enough or unifiedenough to assimilate certain types of character and certain tendencies. Therecognition of this should be fruitful in the preservation of much neededhumility. You are being tendered another opportunity. I would ask you toremember this and to endeavour, in relation to this new experiment, to cultivatefrom the very start a humble spirit and the priceless gift of silence.A group of disciples must be distinguished, as I already told you, by purereason which will steadily supersede motive, merging eventually into the willaspect of the Monad, its major aspect. It is, technically speaking, Shamballa indirect relation with Humanity. What, therefore, is the group will in any ashramor Master’s group? Is it present in any form vital enough to condition the grouprelations and to unite all into a band of brothers—moving forward into thelight? Is the spiritual will of the individual personalities of such strengththat it negates the personality relation and leads to spiritual recognition,spiritual interplay and spiritual relation? It is only in consideration of thesefundamental [7] effects of standing as a group in the “head’s clear light” thatit is permissible for a disciple to bring into the picture personalsensitivities of thought, and this only because of a group temporary limitation.I have pointed out along what lines there has been failure, not because I seekto put the emphasis upon failure or to enlarge upon it, but because clarity ofthought and of vision is necessary if the work is to go forward in a reorganisedand more vital manner. If this New Seed Group measures up to requirements, thenthere may again arise correspondences to the original groups as planned. Theywill arise as the spiritual result of the esoteric manifestation of the potencyof life to be found in the seed group.The work to be done by us in joint cooperation (as regards your training) wasorganised by me into seven teaching units:I. Definite planned Meditation.II. Teaching upon the subject of Initiation.III. Training in Telepathy.IV. Consideration of the Problems of Humanity.V. Teaching anent the Etheric Body.VI. Added to the above, I seek to give each of you a measure of Individual Helpand Instruction .VII. As time goes on, I will convey information anent the work of the Masters’Ashrams and their planned Externalisation.I am going to ask you to give two relatively brief periods of time each day todefinite and defined meditation. One period (the most important) must be givento the general group meditation, and the other to that meditation which I feelwill enable you to function as an integrated personality, fused and blended inconsciousness with the soul. This will lead the group as a whole to functioncorrectly, because the individual group units are aligned and rightly adjusted.Why is it necessary for the disciple to intensify his inner link with histeacher? Not because the teacher is his Master, not because the disciple issubjected to the imposition by the [8] Master of any subjective control, notbecause of any special privilege in the matter, but because if a student’s mindis in true rapport with the teacher, then that student himself can become asource of inspiration to his fellow students; if he is thinking with clarityalong the line of his chosen theme (note the word “chosen”), then he too canteach. A Master looks at each member of His group from the angle of theirusefulness in the general group service. The contribution of each may differ;one disciple may have achieved much along the lines of clear thought and animpersonal attitude; his usefulness to the group can be that, and the Masterwill seek to train him still more along these two lines.What is it therefore which prevents a disciple, as an individual, from havingdirect approach and direct contact with a Master without being dependent upon asenior disciple as an intermediary? What is it that prevents you from havingsuch direct relation to myself? One or two in this group have direct approach,and another one of you has it but knows it not; several others arewell-intentioned and hard-striving disciples but never for a second do theyforget themselves; the problem of glamour and preoccupation with spiritualambition condition some aspirants, a spiritual ambition which is working througha very small personality; some could make rapid progress but are prone toinertia—perhaps they just do not care enough. All desire to move forward, allpossess a strong inner spiritual life, but the group antahkarana is usuallystill incomplete and the aspect of pure reason, which is of the heart, does notcontrol. The evocative power of the Spiritual Triad is not, therefore, adequateto hold the personality steady and the invocative power of the personality isnonexistent—speaking from the angle of the group personalities which make up thepersonality aspect of the Ashram. This is a factor which can only become potentif certain personality relations are adjusted and inertia is overcome. Then, andonly then, can the “group stand.”I propose to give you personality instructions only once a year, at the time ofthe Full Moon of May. I shall then indicate to you any needed changes in yourindividual meditation [9] or in the group meditation. At this time I will giveto this new seed group a meditation intended to produce coherent relations and aconscious group interplay. I will give each member also a meditation which willserve to integrate his personality more completely but will also serve, aboveall else, to fuse it with his soul. I shall enlarge later upon this when givingeach of you his personal instructions. As I am to instruct you individually onlyonce a year, I shall handle you with directness, and shall pay small attentionto your personal reactions. Those are essentially your own business and notmine.~August 1940Some of you have really studied my previous instructions; others have given thema definitely cursory and perfunctory reading and have, in the last analysis,given no real thought to what I have said. Hence the need of reminding you of mymajor points prior to continuing with the next phase of the teaching. I wouldhave you demonstrate your grasp of the subject and also your response to theeffort I am making to instruct you. The best paper turned in was by W.D.S.because it was the most esoteric and touched upon the spiritual techniques ofapproach, insight and vision.Incidentally, the question arises in your minds as to the method whereby Iascertain the content of your papers. Do I read them? Does A.A.B. read them andconvey to me her impressions? Do I psychometrise them? None of these expressesmy method or conveys the true mode of ascertaining. I do not read them;candidly, my brother, they do not warrant my taking the time. Does A.A.B. readthem and then convey their significance to me? No, because as they filterthrough her mind and brain they would take on the powerful colouring of herthought, and from this she has ever carefully protected the group and all workshe does as an intermediary between you and me. I do not psychometrise them. Letme endeavour to explain.All detailed, outer forms are expressions of some subjective significance whichis the cause of their appearance [10] and which can be discovered by those whocan function in the world of meaning. These “foci of significance” carry a note,a vibration and a symbolic aspect which conveys to the trained mind of theesotericist far more than does the outer form of words convey meaning to thetrained mind of the exoteric reader. One glance in the direction of the disciplewith the thought in mind of ascertaining the value of his contribution in words,serves to bring into my line of vision the symbol which is the product of hiswritten thought. This symbol may be and probably is distorted—a symbol withouttrue balance; it will find its place upon some level of consciousness—astral,mental or spiritual—and its vibratory note will depend upon its “occultlocation.” Forget not that the world of meaning and the world of outer formsexpress in essentiality the world in which multiplicity is reduced tosimplicity, though this does not connote synthesis.I wonder if any of you really grasp the extent of the effort which I have tomake in order to reach your minds and teach you? When, for instance, I seek tosend out these instructions I have to make the following preparation. First, Iseek to ascertain the mental state and preparedness of the amanuensis, A.A.B.,and whether the press of the other work upon which she is engaged in connectionwith the Plan of the spiritual Hierarchy permits of her right reception; for ifthe work is exerting extreme pressure and if she is occupied with urgentproblems, it may be needful for me to wait until such time as circumstances giveher the needed leeway both of time and strength, and of mental detachment. Myown sphere of occult work must also come under consideration. Then, havingestablished a rapport with her, I have three things to do.First, I must gather the group of disciples as a whole into my aura and so gaugeits general condition of receptivity—for that must determine the scope of theintended communication. Do you realise, my brothers, that as you extend yourpower to grasp the needed lessons and learn to train your minds to think in everwider and more abstract terms, you draw from me a correspondingly adequateinstruction? [11] The limitation to the imparted truth lies on your side and noton mine.Second, I must isolate in my own consciousness the extent of the instruction,detaching myself from all other concerns and formulating the needed materialinto a thoughtform which will be comprehensive, clear-cut, sequential in itsrelation to that which has already been imparted and which will lay the groundfor the next instruction in due time.Then third, I have to enter into that meditative condition, and that extravertedattitude which will enable me to pour out in a steady stream of constructivesentences which will express, to the mind of the amanuensis, the thoughtform asI see it and build it. Putting it otherwise, I become creative with deliberationand endeavour to convey to the vision, to the mind and to the intellectualperception of A.A.B. an ordered presentation of the thoughtform which embodiesthe lesson I desire the students to learn.All this necessitates an expenditure of force and of time on my part which Ifeel is well warranted if the students—on their side—will prepare their minds,give the needed time, respond to the few requests I may make, and eventuallycooperate with the work of bringing the edited instructions to the attention ofaspirants and disciples everywhere and later to a wider public.And let me here clarify also the question which is in your minds concerning thebasis of the rapport between A.A.B. and myself. Earlier, I explained that aneophyte in an ashram is under the guidance of a more advanced chela and that“the Master is receiving regular reports (based on certain charts) from thesenior disciple who has the neophyte in charge. It is in this way that manyhierarchical relationships are established.” (Discipleship in the New Age, Vol.I, page 723). Several lives ago I was thus responsible for A.A.B. and hence theclose link between us and the basic understanding and hence, therefore, the workwe have been able to do together, even though I am not her Master. I explainthis so that you can get some understanding of the interrelation [12] inashramic work. We both belong to the Ashram of the Master K.H. I should like toadd a further point: Reception such as that by A.A.B. is very rare indeed, notonly because of the subject matter, but also because of the delicate sequence ofideas and the good choice of words; through this, she has made my books unique.She provides a standard which has no competition.I assured you that I would deal with directness when teaching this group, owingto the urgency of the time and the need for the intelligent work of the traineddisciple. Will you bear this in mind, and apply my suggestions to yourself andnot to your group brothers? One of the most needed things for all disciples isto apply the teaching I may give to the idea of promoting and increasing theirworld service, thus rendering practical and effective in the world the teachingreceived and the stimulation to which they have been subjected.In your personal instructions I will give you information as to the nature ofyour prevailing glamour. You may ask, what do I really mean by that phrase? Imean that aspect of thought, that quality of feeling, or that innatepredisposition, which stands between you and the light of life and truth. Thereis in the life of every aspirant some outstanding tendency which acts as alimitation. This should receive due attention, leading to its eventualeradication. Most disciples and aspirants are too general in their handling ofthemselves and of their respective characters. Less diffused attention to themultiplicity of inherited habits and a more concentrated attention to a main, orat least a major, issue would result in a more rapid progress. What I shalltherefore reveal to you as needing correction, adjustment or eradication shouldoccupy your attention and be consciously dealt with during the coming year.Small notice need be paid to less important faults and errors; so oft faultsthat seem to you of paramount importance are of no moment in the eyes of theMasters. So much of the thought life of a disciple is occupied with a ceaselessinterrogation and consideration of himself. What I shall say may be very briefand very scant. I am only seeking to indicate and not to direct; [13] I intendto point out, but not dictate to you, modes of eradication.The times are serious and the world disciples are hard pressed. The Hierarchyand its affiliated groups are seeking active help and cooperation in the work ofsalvage. All disciples and aspirants are needed, and all can give much if thedesire, the loving heart and the consecrated mind are united in service. I askaid in the task of reconstruction. I ask for your consecrated help. I ask you todiscipline yourselves anew, to hold back nothing, either objective orsubjective. I ask for your wholehearted cooperation in the work of worldsalvage.~GROUP INSTRUCTIONMY BROTHERS: December 1941I would like to start off this instruction with the simple statement as to thetask which all disciples of the Masters throughout the world are engaged inundertaking and which you also should consciously consider. It is the task ofconfronting the Dweller on the Threshold in your own life and also in the grouplife, and then—from that vantage point of strength—face that Dweller on behalfof humanity and thus aid humanity to vanquish this ancient evil. To do thispresupposes crisis in your life and in the life of humanity. The handling ofcrises is the hallmark of the disciple, and every crisis met and rightly handledprovides (once the difficulty is occultly “under the feet”) the place from whichan extended vision can be gained, fresh knowledge can flow in and thetransmuting light can shine from the Angel of the Presence and thus produceresults.Each of you has passed through a cycle of real difficulty and strain. This istrue of all disciples. The past eighteen months have been months ofprecipitation, producing a chemicalisation, an interior process of upheaval andprobably outer behaviour which may have caused concern to the Observer within.This however is but the reaction of the [14] personality to undue pressure andstrain, to world conditions and clearer vision. Vision reveals both the lightand the dark, a thing which is oft forgotten. Disciples are fortunate if themajor results work out in the physical body. The reactions of the physical bodyare the least important and do the least harm to others. Where they work out inan emotional or mental condition they are then apt to become a problem of fellowdisciples, adding to their strain and necessitating an effort upon their part tocarry the brother through with the least damage to the group.In this group work you need to remember that increasingly there will be noindividual life. This is as it should be. Increasingly disciples should be awareof each other and tune in with ease on each other; increasingly the bonds ofillumined loyalty should control; increasingly you will participate in eachother’s attitudes and conditions and thus learn the basic lesson ofunderstanding. Understanding is the secret behind all power to achieveidentification with any form of divine expression; understanding is one of theprime factors in producing revelation, and this is one of the paradoxes ofoccultism. In the world of human thought, understanding follows the prescribedroutine, it follows the presented fact. In the life of the spirit, understandingis a necessary predisposing cause of revelation . I would ask you to ponder onthis, bracing yourself for revelation, through a deep understanding of theinitiator in yourself. Each of you has to initiate your own individual crises;there is no one else who is responsible. Each of you together initiates theactivity for which the group is responsible and for which you have been broughttogether; each of you initiates himself into the Presence, through the medium ofthe Angel, and into the shadow of the Dweller on the Threshold. Through thisprocess, full consciousness is achieved.The work of this group, and of other groups similarly motivated, is to achievethese undertakings together: Together to face the Dweller and triumph; togetherto arrive at understanding; together to stand before the Presence because theAngel’s light reveals “that which the eye has never seen;” together to walk thePath of Revelation; together to [15] serve and together to aid the falteringsteps of humanity, the world aspirant; together to stand with your backs to thelight because you comprehend the ancient aphorism which states:“He who faces the light and stands within its radiance is blinded to the issuesof the world of men; he passes on the lighted way to the great Centre ofAbsorption. But he who feels the urge to pass that way, yet loves his brother onthe darkened path, revolves upon the pedestal of light and turns the other way.“He faces towards the dark and then the seven points of light within himselftransmit the outward streaming light, and lo! the face of those upon thedarkened way receives that light. For them, the way is not so dark. Behind thewarriors—twixt the light and dark—blazes the light of Hierarchy.”I have been thinking of you all with tenderness and love. The struggle is sohard and oft you feel alone. There is strength in all of you or I would not havechosen you to serve your fellowmen with me; there is weakness in all of youwhich can evoke your brothers’ strength and thus you will be strong; there islove in all of you but it needs expression, and for that the group exists; thereis light in all of you and with that light you serve. As the Hierarchy stands asa centre of light and strength to humanity, so do your souls stand to you,and—as your Master—I blend my light with yours and thus increase the efficiencyof your service; I blend my love with the love which pours forth from the soultowards each of you, and thus I deepen the relation of love between each and allof you. It is not often that I speak to you in this manner, but in the processof freeing you for increased service I have drawn nearer to you and my lovesurrounds you. Learn, my brothers, the meaning of words, their transmittingpotency and their spiritual significance.I am going to take the time and spare the needed energy to get in touch with thegroup during the coming full moons, prior to that of May. I ask you, at nomatter what hour the [16] full moon each month may fall, to endeavour to keephalf an hour free so that you can attempt to enter into my consciousness. Irealise that it may not always be possible for you in your busy Western lives tokeep the exact minute free, but you can attempt to find some time, as near tothe full moon period as is reasonably possible in your own particularcircumstances. This, my brother, is to be a group effort, and not an individualone, and it is as a group that I shall seek to contact you. Therefore it isnecessary for you to have this in your mind as you prepare for that moment. Youmust link up first with all the group members, pouring yourself out in love toeach of them, and to all collectively, and associating yourself with them as apart with the whole. Then in united effort attempt the following procedure:1. Having linked up with all your group brothers, and having raised yourconsciousness as high as you possibly can, endeavour then to hold steady,holding the mind unwaveringly “in the light,” and letting the brainconsciousness and its registration drop below the level of consciousness.2. Then initiate a new effort. Realise that, on my side, I also stand steady,pouring out upon you my love and strength and endeavouring to lift you up into ahigher state of consciousness.3. Visualise ahead of you (if I may use so inadequate a word) a disk or sphereof indigo blue, a deep electric blue. In the centre of that disk imagine that I,your Tibetan brother, am standing. My appearance and personality matter not.4. When you have visualised me thus standing waiting, then endeavour tosee—stretching between yourself, the group and me—a band of golden light andknow this to be the symbol of the Path which we are all treading. See this pathgradually shortening, thus bringing us closer together, slowly and steadily,until you enter into the heart of the blue disk.Whilst doing this, hold the mind positive and attentive, using simultaneouslythe faculties of imagination and of [17] visualisation. This triple activitywill test and tax your powers but will be good training in active esoteric work.Regard this always as a united group effort and remember that in doing it youaid each other, and may facilitate the work to be done at the time of the Wesakmoon. I would like to add that the results of this work will not become apparentto you until the full moon of May, and even then you will only (through thesynthesis of the two years’ work) begin to comprehend the fusing and blendingand awakening that your own souls are bringing about.I would ask you also to make a careful record every full moon—from two daysbefore until two days after the full moon—of all experiences and visions. Thenin June turn in your full moon records along with your other work, for thehelping and informing of the group members. Turn them in, my brother, even ifthere is naught to relate but failure to register anything.I think that there is a certain vagueness in your minds as to the processeswhich I shall follow in dealing with this group of disciples and in the workingout of the experiment hinted at earlier—the experiment of group initiation. Iwould like, therefore, to make the whole plan clearer and indicate anew thelines along which the training given will go. This might be called the exotericaspect of the esoteric training, for much must and will transpire upon the innerplanes in the inner Ashram about which nothing can be said and which will beindividual as well as group expansion. I will outline the outer processes in theorder of their present importance, and this in its turn is determined by thegroup condition—for which you are one and all responsible.I. Definite and planned Meditation . The theme, if I might so call it, of thework will be threefold:a. The interior interrelation of the seven centres in the body will be theobjective of the meditation, basing the work upon the occult maxim that “energyfollows thought.” We have started upon one formula which relates the heart, thehigher head centre, and the solar plexus. [18]b. The subsequent relation of the centres in any one individual to the remainderof the group members, regarding the centres as radiating transmitters of energyto the centres of the other group members. This will result in the forming ofseven great centres of energy which will constitute the group centres, fed andenlightened by the energy transmitted by each individual.c. The fusion (consciously undertaken) of the individual soul with the groupsoul and consequently a conscious rapport with the Hierarchy, which isinherently the kingdom of souls.The first meditation affects the three centres in the individual disciple andalso, and consequently, his astral body. They can—when related, awakened andfunctioning, and when the two points in the solar plexus are balanced and“enlightened,” a word which I shall frequently use in connection with thecentres—evoke response from the love-petals of the egoic lotus. This must happenautomatically and need not be regarded as a complicated technicality. Do therequired meditation faithfully and correctly and the results will followspontaneously.II. Unfold to you and reveal the techniques of work, preparatory to initiation .I referred to this earlier (in Vol. I, Page 99) : “As time goes on, I shallbridge between the old techniques and the newer modes of training by using apart of the ancient technique, now becoming somewhat obsolete, and give youhints as to the nature and methods of educating accepted disciples in theprocesses of initiation.”You will note, therefore, that it is my intention to give you such hints. This Ishall do from the angle of initiation and in preparation for the second or thethird initiation. Bear this in mind. Hitherto I have not taught you from thatparticular angle, but I have instructed you as accepted disciples in trainingfor preparation —a much earlier stage. These hints I will convey to you in theancient symbolic formulas which will require much deep reflection on your partand an effort to evoke the intuition and thus arrive at [19] the three meaningswhich they hold for you, and for disciples like you. There are literally sevenmeanings, but I would advise you to confine yourself to the comprehension of thefirst three. There will be one meaning for your personality, indicating certainbrain and mind realisations which are essential for the right transmission offorce upon the physical plane—one of the first things an initiate has to master.There will be the soul meaning which will indicate relation to the Hierarchy, inthe same way that the personality significance will indicate relationship tohumanity. Then there will be a still higher meaning which will be exceedinglydifficult for you to grasp, but for which you must strive and which willnecessitate the consciously acquired use of the antahkarana. You willunderstand, therefore, why the study of the Science of the Antahkarana formspart of my instruction to this group. No major initiation can be taken untilthere is some measure of conscious use of the antahkarana.The accepted disciple never receives any detailed information or instruction; heis given no list of rules which must govern his daily life and no minuteinstructions as to what he must do to “take initiation.” He receives—at specific“points in time”—according to his success in expanding his consciousness,certain definite hints. These hints have, in the past, been given withoutcalling attention to the fact that they are hints. The disciple eitherrecognised them for what they were and profited thereby, or else he failed tosense their import and so delayed his moving forward. In this group experimentwhich I am undertaking, I propose to change this somewhat and I shall let youknow which are the hints I give, so that together the group may profit by them,stimulated by each presented idea and thus evoke together the overshadowingsoul. This will result, eventually, in an inflow of light from the SpiritualTriad via the group antahkarana, constructed of the “rainbow bridge” of eachdisciple.III. Develop in each of you some measure of telepathic rapport —to each other,to me, your Master, and the hierarchical Plan. A Master can give no realteaching (by means of stimulation) to His group until there is established bythe disciples—as individuals—a proper relation to each other, [20] free from allcriticism (which always severs telepathic interplay) and based on lovingunderstanding in which they—again as individuals—ask nothing for the separatedself but only seek to give to each other and to the group.The above concerns and applies to your relation to me, to the Hierarchy (whichis “entered” through the process of initiation) and to each other. Thisrelation, which indicates ability to touch the sources of power, love and light,carries with it the implications of service and work for humanity.IV. I shall, therefore, endeavour to interpret humanity to you (and to discipleseverywhere) so that its present problems and its immediate opportunity mayemerge clearly in your minds, and you will be able consequently to workintelligently and understandingly. The Science of Service needs elucidating andthe Path of Man needs understanding. The attitude of the initiate consciousnessto human problems is not identical with that of the ordinary human being. I donot desire to deal with problems already considered by us in the variouspamphlets and in my books. It is the new world which we shall start to study,the new opportunities and the new complexities, as well as the new and comingsimplifications in life and being. They concern primarily the service of theinitiate; hitherto we have only considered the service which disciples,aspirants and men of goodwill can render.V. I shall give you some clear and definite instructions anent the uses of theetheric body. This vehicle of vitality or energy is the ultimate conditioningfactor in the activity of the physical body. It is an initiator, for there is nophysical activity as we understand it unless impulsed by some energy emanatingfrom the etheric body. An understanding of some of the processes of initiationwill come from an understanding of the body of vitality. The etheric body is theorgan whereby personality or soul expression becomes evidenced upon the physicalplane. Its potency is that which evokes the physical form. Most of the vehicleshave a dual capacity—invocation and evocation. They also have a third function:they ground or focus energy, thus producing a point of tension, of crisis and aninterlude, prior to a process of transmission. [21] Ponder on these words. Thephysical body can be evoked into manifestation and subsequent activity, but ithas no power of invocation. Hence it is not a principle (as H.P.B. tells us inThe Secret Doctrine ) but is basically an automaton. The etheric body invokesand evokes; but it also, in relation to the physical plane, precipitates energythrough a process of appropriation. A study of these things will bring to ourattention the entire subject of the centres and this we will approach from theangle of invocation and evocation.The teaching upon the etheric body naturally follows upon any instructions whichI may give anent telepathic communication and the manipulation of energy by theinitiate-disciple, via the centres, via the group centres and—when of very highdevelopment and initiate degree—via the planetary centres. I have not yet givenyou much on this theme but there is much that will later be said. I shall,however, have to deal with it only briefly and tentatively, as the majority ofaspirants and disciples are not yet ready for this particular study.VI. I shall, once a year, give to each of you a measure of individual help,personal instruction and individual meditation . The clue to your next steptowards the door of initiation and towards the Presence will also be indicatedby me. This I will do at the time of the Full Moon of May (Taurus) each year.This may involve at times an analysis of your group relation, of the effect thatyour national and racial thoughtforms have upon you, and also the assets and theliabilities of your personality and egoic rays. I shall endeavour to bring toyour attention your personal point in evolution. I would remind you at thispoint that these seven rays are sharply different as to colouring and phenomenaleffect and, at the same time, I would remark that—under the Law of OccultParadox—the seven Lords of Being (the seven Rays) are widely different butremain non-separative.VII. We are also trying the experiment of externalising the Ashram . This is aneffort which, if successful, will be the prelude to the manifestations of theHierarchy upon Earth. This is one of the next intended undertakings, if and whenthe Forces of Light have driven the forces of evil and of [22] aggression backto their “dark habitation.” As time goes on I will convey information anent thework of the Masters’ Ashrams, their planned externalisation and, eventually, theexternalisation of the Hierarchy.Such, brother of mine, is our appointed task. Out of all that might be said orwritten by me will eventually emerge a Treatise on Discipleship which will beuseful in the New Age. You are accustomed to the teaching of the Piscean Ageupon this subject and also to the Piscean interpretation. It is part of my workto begin to indicate the methods and processes and the modes of instructionwhich will distinguish the Aquarian Age. This will only be possible to aspirantswith an open mind. For this you must strive.This programme is an ambitious one, my brothers; it will call forth your utmostcapacity and staying power but, if persisted in, it will hasten yourdevelopment; this will also entail obedience. We are basically occupied, littleas you may realise it, in compiling an elementary manual for initiation. Ponderon this. Much antagonism will be evoked and an uprising of scepticism will benaturally aroused; those who see no need or possibility for any changing ofhierarchical methods, and who are the fundamentalists of the theosophicalmovement and the narrow theologians among the esotericists, will make an outcry.They will be annoyed and bewildered, but they can make no further progress thislife unless they widen their point of view; they must learn that the pastmethods and techniques were devoted to bringing the personality into relationwith the soul, with character building, integration and alignment processes, aswell as with laying the foundation for what could be given out when humanityreached its present stage.Now the preparatory work has been done and has proved effective; it will becontinued for those who need its aid, but the more advanced work can be madeexoteric. This planned externalising of the teaching must go on all the time. Itis the testimony of the Hierarchy that the points of crisis in the evolutionaryprocess have accomplished their intent and have demonstrated success. Thesepoints of crisis are ever [23] succeeded by “points of revelation” and it iswith such points of revelation that we are at this time occupied.~MY BROTHERS: August 1942I would like first to remind you briefly of three points which I made in my lastinstruction.1. This is my last effort to bring you each in this incarnation up to the pointin your spiritual development which would be entirely possible, if you sodesired . Success or failure in conforming to requirements is entirely yourpersonal affair. Each of you can be active or inactive as it seems best to you,but I would remind you that whatever you do affects your group—eitherconstructively or adversely.2. There are outer processes at work which are effects of inner happenings inyour own souls, in the Ashram and in the Hierarchy itself. My task is to aid youin fusing the inner and the outer events so as to bring about a true expressionof the facts as they are in your life, in the Ashram life and in the Hierarchy.Your task is to develop sensitivity in these three classes of spiritual events.3. The group is the factor of importance and, as I said, increasingly theindividual life of the disciple lessens and his group awareness and sensitivityincreases. Bear this in mind as you master the hard lesson of impersonality—animpersonality shown to you by me, by A.A.B. and (so difficult a thing to learn!)by your own souls. It is an impersonality which you yourselves must develop andapply, once you love enough. Love is the basis of impersonality.This is, as I have repeatedly told you, an experiment in group initiation. Thismeans that though each of you takes various steps in line with your particularpoint of development, there is also being developed by the Hierarchy a newtechnique which—when perfected and understood—will initiate [24] entire groupunits into the Light and into the “Labour of the Plan.” Such a group must itselfbe composed of people who have taken initiation. As one of your group memberswill only take the first initiation next life, it is obvious that the groupinitiation to which I refer will not be taken in this immediate cycle. The restof the group have to wait for him.In any case, they are not yet ready and there is much preparatory work to bedone, much unfolding of awareness and developing of sensitivity before there canbe a going forward together as the situation desired demands. The time equationis one of great difficulty to the average disciple. He is either workingconstantly under a sense of pressure and of haste or he is “strolling along thepath of life,” feeling that evolution is long and why, therefore, the need tomake speed? Only a very few work from that point of balance which inhibits thespasmodic rushing activity of the intense devotee or the lazy moving forward ofthe awakened aspirant. I would ask you to study time in relation to your ownsouls, having in mind the peculiar opportunities of the present cycle and theoutstanding need of humanity. Many are still too preoccupied with what they areattempting to do, with their own development and with their own capacity ornon-capacity to help; but at the same time they are inadequately handling theproblem of self-effacement and complete dedication to their fellowmen. “What canI do ?” is of less importance to them than “What am I learning, and is theMaster satisfied with me?” I shall be satisfied with you when you have forgottenboth yourself and me in your strenuous service for mankind.Service, I would remind you, is a scientific process, calling forth all the soulpowers into full expression on the physical plane. It is service which causes adivine manifestation or what you call a divine incarnation. If a man is trulyserving, he will perforce draw upon all the resources of spiritual strength andlight and all the wisdom and directing power of his soul, because the task to bedone is always too big for the personality. Some of the world’s greatest serversare men and women who are very close to the spiritual Hierarchy and workingunder its direction, inspiration and impression, [25] but who know naught ofesotericism so-called, do not recognise the Hierarchy and (in their brainconsciousness) remain unaware of its Personnel, the Masters of the Wisdom. Oneof the tragedies today of the esoteric world is the vast amount of facts in thepossession of esoteric students, and the piling up of knowledge anent theHierarchy and its Personnel. In the minds of disciples this knowledge and thisaspiration obliterates the need of their fellowmen. This constitutes one of theproblems with which the Hierarchy is faced. The problem of balance and of dualorientation is a very real one. As regards the impartation of spiritualknowledge, the Masters Who take pupils are faced with two problems:1. The problem of the unawakened aspirant.2. The problem of the learned disciple.Ignorance and knowledge must both give place to understanding and wisdom.I particularly wish to speak about the work that I desire you should do at thetime of the full moon during the coming year. This aspect of your work shouldbecome increasingly potent and interesting. I regard it as of major importancein the group endeavour, and if I, your teacher and friend (under the pressure ofthe present world opportunity), can spare the time to aid the group in thisparticular way, it is surely not too much to ask that I receive reciprocalattention.Perhaps some of you may get increased light upon the usefulness of the attemptif I tell you the interesting fact that—at the time of the full moon—it isalmost as if a door suddenly opened wide, which at other times stands closed.Through that door, ingress is possible; through that door or opening, energiescan be contacted which are otherwise shut off; and through that door approachescan be made to the planetary Hierarchy and to reality which are at other timesnot possible. In this statement, you have the rude outlines of a Science ofApproach which has been little known up to the present time, even to advanceddisciples, but which it is intended [26] during the New Age to develop. It is apart of the true and emerging technique of the Path.I would like somewhat to change your work in connection with your full mooncontact. Two days before the time of the full moon, I will ask you to begin tocultivate that inner attitude of poised re-collectedness which will lay theright foundation for further work and which will help to shift the focus of theattention from the objective to the subjective work. It is an attitude more thanan activity. Ponder on this phrase. It is a state of consciousness which can becarried forward, no matter what may be the outer activity or interests, and itinvolves no outer silence, or cessation of normal behaviour. It is part of thetraining which has for its goal the living (by the disciple) of a dual life—alife of active participation in world affairs and a life of intense mental andspiritual preoccupation.Make a most definite effort during these two days to step up your consciousnessa little higher at each of the three spiritual points in each day: at the earlymorning meditation, at the noonday recollection, and at the sunset hour ofcontact. This means—if you follow instructions correctly—that you subject yoursubtle bodies to six equal points of spiritual stimulation and that you do itconsciously. Then at some hour in the day of the full moon, but prior to theexact hour if that hour is not possible, follow the procedure outlined below:1. Centre the consciousness in the head.2. Imagine yourself as retreating even more consciously within towards thatpoint of contact where personality-soul and the teacher in the world of soulscan meet and become as one.3. Then hold yourself as poised and steady as possible, preserving that detachedpoise as fully as may be during the following process which is carried forwardsilently by the creative activity of the imagination.a. Imagine or visualise yourself as standing before a golden or ivory door. [27]b. See that door slowly open, revealing a long low room with three windows—onelooking east, one looking west and one looking north. Seated before the easternwindow on a low carved chair (but looking towards you, and therefore sittingwith his back to the window) you may visualise your Tibetan brother, in deepmeditation, seeking to contact you and all for whom he is, as a teacher,responsible.c. Then picture yourself as advancing slowly up the long room (which is hisstudy and work room) and then standing before him. See also your group brothersstanding with you. Then each of you can constitute himself, in imagination, asspokesman for his group and offer the group in service and deep consecration tothe service of the Plan.d. When you have accomplished this, imagine that you see me rising from mychair. Then as a group we face the East and say together the Great Invocation.Endeavour consciously to follow my lead as we say the words, and listen withcare, using the imagination. This will involve intense concentration.Do this until the time of the full moon of May, for it is a preparatory exercisein order to train you all in esoteric participation.Make a careful analysis each month of your success or failure to carry out thisdiscipline, and note with exactitude all reactions, results and phenomena.Success will depend upon your ability to achieve a strong mental reorientationand focus, to keep detached from brain activity, and yet at the same time topreserve the waking brain attentiveness. The resultant effects, reactions, andthe registering of any realisation must be noted for the two days succeeding thetime of the full moon, for the seeping through of information and knowledge isoften a slow process, owing to the inadequate alignment of the bodies. The Mayfull moon will inaugurate the first real united effort to synthesisesubjectively [28] the present existing groups. This synthesis and corporateeffort will become an annual endeavour as time goes on, and will take placeregularly each Wesak Festival.Of the original twenty-four members of the new (reorganised) seed group onlyeighteen now remain working on the physical plane. Two of them have passed intowhat we in Tibet call “the clear cold light”; they have gone over to the otherside of the veil but are still actively cooperating with the group, andreceiving the same instructions from me. I can, however, approach them moredirectly, as the limitations imposed by the physical brain no longer exist.P.D.W., though the latest to pass over, was held by the handicap of the astralbody for an exceedingly brief time; he is now focussed and working in connectionwith my Ashram, upon the mental plane. C.D.P. is now in process of freeingherself from astral limitations, and by the time the sun moves northward she toowill be working entirely mentally. They are both of them of real service to meat this time of world need, one owing to her understanding heart and utterselflessness, the other because of his outstanding wisdom.Three of the original members (C.A.C., S.C.P., and W.O.I.) could not stand thespiritual pressure, and their personalities forced their withdrawal (probablyfor this incarnation) from the group work. The tests of discipleship are severe,as you well know, and only the pure heart, true love and mental activity canserve to pull the disciple through them; this is always possible, however, wherethese exist and where there is also a determined orientation towards the light.It is this determined orientation which has enabled W.D.S. to stand steadythrough his tests. There is a stage of discipleship which is described as thatof “light fluctuation.” The Stanzas for Disciples , which I have at times quotedto you, speak of this stage as follows:“In and out of the light, as a moth around a candle, flicker the sparks. Thesesparks are men, awakened to the light, but men who know not that the greaterLight puts out their little light and draws the sparks unto itself. They cannotface the light. They fear its utter truth. [29] They come; they go; again dothey return, only again to leave.”Hold these brothers, who still remain your group brothers though temporarily inpralaya, warmly in your hearts. Hold them in love. Seek not to bring them aid ordraw them back again within the circle of your service. They are at the pointwhere their own souls alone and I, their Master, know the right timing ofapproach.Finally, my brothers, one parting word as I close this instruction. The worldtension increases and will increase; anxiety grows and there is no sign of itsimmediate lessening; the darkest hour of human life is upon us and it frequentlybrings to the earnest disciple the experience—terrible yet beautiful—to whichhas been given the name of the “dark night of the soul.” This dark night takesdifferent forms and different degrees of intensity, according to the ray, thetype and the point in evolution of the disciple. From it you cannot escape. Butone error emerges if careful thought is given to this dark night as pictured bythe mystics down the ages. Their emphasis has, in the past, been laid upon thesuffering which the personality experiences and the agony through which thepersonality goes. But in reality and from the angle of the facts, that is notthe true dark night. The real “dark night” is that of the soul as itparticipates in the pain of humanity as a whole, in the agony of humanity’sseparation from God (a separation based upon illusion but not on actuality) andupon the desperation of humanity’s reaching forth towards what appears to be anunresponsive God. Personality pain, agony and desperation are very differentthings and are not concerned with the totality of pain and suffering to whichmankind is subjected.I would therefore ask you to steel your souls to endurance, knowing that theHierarchy Stands ; I would ask you to love blindly and unchangingly in spite ofall that may happen, knowing that Love Stands unmoved amid the wreckage of allaround and eternally loves; I would ask you to put your hand into that of theMaster and move forward with Him and in the strength of your group, irradiatedby [30] the life and light of the Hierarchy; I would ask you to be a strong handin the dark to your fellowmen because you are affiliated with the Hierarchy andthe love and strength of the Hierarchy can flow through you, if you so permit.I would remind you in this time of trial that I, your Master, love and guardyou, for your soul and my soul are one soul. Be not unduly disturbed. There isno light or dark to the soul but only existence and love. Rest back on that.There is no separation but only identification with the heart of all love; themore you love the more love can reach out through you to others. The chains oflove unite the world of men and the world of forms and they constitute the greatchain of Hierarchy . The spiritual effort you are asked to make is that ofdeveloping yourself into a vibrant and powerful centre of that fundamental,universal Love.~MY BROTHERS: September 1943The New Seed Group has now been in existence for several years. During thistime, I have only been in communication with you annually. Those who are inpreparation for initiation must inevitably work alone. I would have you rememberthis. There are, as you know, three sources of inspiration which indicate to thedisciple—struggling on the physical plane—his goal:1. His own soul through direct contact, as the result of alignment. 2. TheMaster through impression, as a result of sensitivity. 3. The Ashram groupthrough service, as a result of interplay.Later, as the initiate-disciple makes progress and as he builds the antahkarana,the energy of the one Life, emanating from the Monad, brings in the fourth typeof inspiration. To these spiritual sources of inspiration must be added lesserones, such as mental impression, telepathically registered and coming [31] froma multitude of thinkers and minds. These work both as individuals and as membersof a group. There is also emotional inspiration to which—in its most easilyrecognisable appearance—we give the name of aspiration. All these are,esoterically considered, evocative of desire, to be transmuted into will if (andonly if) “the energy of the will-to-good is the emanating principle and theactuating result of the inspired impulse; it must constitute the motivatingimpulse at the centre of the disciple’s being.” Thus spoke one of the Mastersnot long ago to a disciple who sought to grasp the synthetic effect ofinspiration. It is the Will and its immediate evocation which is the major needof this particular group of my disciples. The hierarchical Plan is the objectiveof that will; the purpose of Sanat Kumara is the revelation which comes to thosewho demonstrate that will, and it is the strength of the divine Power whichmakes that will possible. Strength is to Power what desire is to aspiration, orwhat the personality is to the soul. It is the revelation of quality.I have started this communication with this note of Will because the use of thatwill (under instruction) is the objective of your next year’s work; as weproceed with the various phases of our study which I have earlier outlined, myuse of this theme will emerge clearly in your consciousness.It has seemed to me necessary to open this instruction with a brief resume ofthe past teaching. The pressure of life these days is very great; everybody istired; you will therefore approach this fresh addition to the teaching withrenewed zest if the past teaching is clearly apprehended and is clearlyillumined in your minds.What is the task which confronts you, both as individuals and as a group? It isa fivefold task:1. To confront and deal adequately with your own personal Dweller on theThreshold.2. To share—as a group—in humanity’s effort to confront the group Dweller on theThreshold; this “Dweller” is constructed of the evil desires of all mankind, ofhumanity’s mistakes and weaknesses, thoughts, [32] distorted strengths andperverse motives. This confronting is one of the objectives of the present worldwar.3. To arrive at that understanding which is the foundation of wisdom, which isthe result of a developed intuition, and which is also an intelligentapplication of the truths apprehended.4. To stand—as a group—before the Angel of the Presence.5. To take initiation yourself, as an individual, and also as a coherent unit inthe group effort towards initiation.Other goals will emerge as you strive, study and serve; the simplicity, however,of the above statement will convey to you your immediate objectives. Theseobjectives must be thought through together and their import must be grasped asa group. The contribution which each of you can make to the cause of clearthinking, ardent aspiration and determined application may sound easy and quitefamiliar. The moment, nevertheless, these goals become techniques and areexpressed factually, their simplicity seems to vanish and the propositionappears extremely hard.Since my last communication to you, certain changes have taken place in thepersonnel of the group. L.U.T. has been dropped (temporarily and for thisparticular incarnation) out of the group, and therefore out of my Ashram. Theconstant condition of irritation in which he lived was the result of theceaseless conflict between his aspiring soul nature and his inert andessentially selfish personality; that is now over and for the rest of this lifeit can be assumed that he has reached his high water mark and is passing througha period—definitely temporary—of retrogression or of recession. Next life willsee him pass triumphantly his present point of attainment, leaving himstabilised upon the Way. He remains, therefore, tenuously linked with the NewSeed Group—a linking which is stronger upon the subjective side than upon theouter.Three of your comrades in the earlier groups have rejoined [33] the group; thedemand of their souls for reinstatement has been recognised by me and has evokedfrom me due response. Their linking with the group was not tenuous but was astrongly knit cable. H.S.D. has again taken her place among you, having learntsome measure of inner calm and mental poise. L.T.S-K., I felt, needed theprotection of the group against his constantly recurring glamours and his innateglamour-making tendency; I, therefore, reinstated him for his own protection sothat in a coming life he can start earlier, and move forward with greaterprecision. R.V.B., having learnt the lessons which an interlude of completealoneness can give to the ardent disciple (who craves and rests back uponcompanionship) is now ready to prove what he essentially has ever been—astrength and a centre of poised peace to his group brothers. He is a definiteasset in the group work and has reached a point in his unfoldment where it willnot hurt him to know this.So, my brothers, we face a new cycle of work and one in which C.D.P. andP.D.W.—working on the inner side of life—are definitely sharing. The latter hasmoved on into the Ashram of his Master, the Master Morya. He is now preoccupiedwith the work of breaking up—along with other trusted first ray disciples—thecrystallisation which is the disastrous condition of France. His pastincarnation in the French nation has well fitted him for this task; his heart oflove and his very profound development will also enable him greatly to assist,thus offsetting the destructive tendencies of the first ray worker. He has neverbeen destructive in his application of truth.C.D.P. is working continuously with the children of the world (including thosewho died victims of the horrors of war), preserving inviolate her affiliationwith my Ashram but working in a group composed of disciples upon all the raysand whose personalities—in their last incarnation—were upon all the manynationalities; they are doing what they can and must be done to salvage theconsciousness of the children and to preserve them from complete disintegration.K.E.S., who died prior to the reorganisation of the New Seed Group, is nowsubjectively affiliated with the group [34] and must be regarded by you as afellow worker. His work is very largely with those who pass over to the innerside from the British and American Armed Forces; for this he is eminently wellequipped, being English by birth but having spent long years in the UnitedStates; he has also worked for many years in the spiritualistic movement.I am giving you information anent your group brothers who are not in physicalbodies because I seek to have you realise the unity of all life, the identity ofpurpose and the close sense of relationship which characterises an Ashram. AMaster’s Ashram has people working both on the outer and on the inner planes andin this work, the Master sees no difference, being released from the concepts oftime and space. This has relation to the “double life pattern of the disciple”to which I referred when I last communicated with you.At that time, I gave you no explicit instruction or individual meditations. Igave each of you six statements upon which to ponder. Through the closeconsideration of these statements you can create fresh aspiration and a renewedtendency to creative living. Statements such as these are formulations of truthand are also voiced concepts of spiritual import. They are potent in theirtransforming effect, if rightly used. I have not been too satisfied with theresults of my past requests to you. The pressure of life has been great thesedays; to that pressure many of you have succumbed. You might have carriedthrough and been more effective had you given careful attention to your thoughtlife.One of the problems confronting disciples in times of world stress is that ofthe preservation of a right sense of proportion. This leads to right parallelingactivity—the activity of the inner disciple and the work of the outer man. Aperfect balance is the goal and this is not at all easy of achievement. In alltimes of world agony and catastrophe (such as we are at this time experiencing)a third and paralleling aspect of life appears and complicates the problem withwhich the disciple is faced and which he already regards as most difficult andchallenging. There is (within the man) the inner disciple, oriented consciouslytowards the Hierarchy [35] and the life of the Kingdom of God; there is the busyouter man, preoccupied with various activities, playing the part of theintelligent citizen and seeking always to shoulder his share of national andgroup responsibility; there is also a suffering emotional human being,bewildered oft by world agony, reacting painfully to the sorrows and distressesof his fellowmen, horrified by the appalling psychological results of world war,by the psychological impacts and complexities, aghast at the present andoverwhelmed by fear of the future. The greater his power to include, the greaterhis strain and pain; the further on he is upon the Way, the more keen are hisreactions and the more he thinks and plans for the future, and the greater alsothe clarity with which he can view the imminent possibilities. I would not haveit otherwise; this threefold position which inevitably you have to take andwhich you cannot avoid if you are true disciples, gives opportunity for plannedintegration and also proffers an invitation for you to shoulder an individualshare of hierarchical responsibility and comprehension.The only thing that I would ask is that you accept the implications of thistriple situation and that you do not use it as an alibi; this, some of you havedefinitely done; you have regarded your complex problems as so strenuous anddifficult that it makes your work in the group (which is a definite part of myAshram) entirely out of the question. You have—many of you—not done the workwhich I requested; only a few—a very few—endeavoured to fulfil requirements. Hadyou managed to carry them out, you might have found your entire path in lifemore simple and easy and your service more effective.Certain things anent the group aura, or rather anent its generalcharacteristics, might prove of interest to you. A Master, when studying a groupconsiders, first of all, the various lines of force which relate the individualsin the group to Him, to the inner Ashram and to each other. He looks for theconstancy of the interplay, for the brilliance of the group light, as a whole,and for its emanatory influence, its radiation and its magnetic effect in theworld. Changes constantly occur. In the past, the lines of force between the[36] group and myself were strong, and the relationship between the groupmembers was definitely weak. Today, the lines of energy, carried by thought anddirected towards me, are steady but not so brilliantly fluctuating; the linesbetween the group members are strengthened by mental determination, but not byemotional or embryonic love. This indicates, on the whole, improvement, becausethe tide of devotion, poured out to me was not something which guaranteed to methat the group had staying power. There is a more wholesome attitude. Therelation between you as an individual and your co-disciples is one of a relativeindifference, but of a mental recognition of your joint group affiliation. Themagnetic radiation of the group is the weakest point in the entire presentationwhich you make to the world. As yet, from the angle of service, you do notcount, for the group is doing nothing as a group . That is serious, my brothers.As individuals, many of you are serving in some way or another, but it is adetached and personal service and has no relation to a fused group endeavour.You might here ask: What can we as a group accomplish? What is it that we cando? You can, for one thing, begin to work as an Ashram works, using the power ofthought, originating pressures, directing thought currents along specified linesout into the world, creating thoughtforms which will make clear-cut contact withother minds and which will bring about definite changes in the consciousness ofhumanity. This you do not as yet do, nor have you evidenced any desire so towork. I have waited to see if the initiating impulse would come from you withoutany prompting by me. I have waited in vain.I told you elsewhere that “an Ashram is an emanating source of hierarchicalimpression upon the world. Its `impulsive energies’ and its inciting forces aredirected towards the expansion of the human consciousness, through the magneticlives of the group members as they carry on their duties, obligations andresponsibilities in the outer world; it is aided also by the steady vibratoryactivity of the members of the Ashram who are not in physical incarnation and[37] by the united clear thinking and convinced awareness of the entire Ashram.”I have thus explained the need because you require clear understanding as weconsider our first point, meditation, and begin to plan the work to be done byyou during the coming year. Will you accept my words that you need areorientation and a greatly lessened preoccupation with the Ashram, its Master,its personnel and its life? If you will do this, and thus mentally freeyourselves, you can and will go on to a fuller life of service, with your eyeson human need and not upon your co-disciples, their activities, my plans and thepurpose at this time of your preparation for initiation.I would like now to try an experiment. Continue with your group work with me atthe time of the full moon, exactly as outlined in your group instructions, butto that work I want to add another activity.Each month I will speak three words, forming one consecutive sentence. Will yousee if you can, in the silence of intensity, record these words? To help you inyour task, I am giving a list from which I will choose each month a phrase. Sendin what you think you registered each month on your full moon report. I willsignify to A.A.B. the correctness, or otherwise, of your choice, by letting herknow what I said.This is the list from which I will choose:1. Go in peace. 2. Faith, hope and charity. 3. God keep you. 4. God bless you.5. Enter within thyself. 6. Love thy brother. 7. Stand in light. 8. Om TatSat. 9. Where art thou? 10. Tread the Path. 11. God guard thee. 12. Enter intopeace. 13. Lift up thine eyes. 14. Speak low, brother. 15. Give love always. 16.The open gate.The work to be done is now outlined and you enter upon a fresh period of study,of effort, and of training. May I, in order to stir you to fresh decisiveliving, remind you that: [38]1. You are in training for initiation. Therefore, face the future with clearervision.2. You are pledged disciples, therefore take up your task and move forward.3. You are members of the New Group of World Servers, and have therefore, notime to be idle.4. You are not alone, but your group brothers stand with you, and I stand alsoby your side.5. That there is no task which is insuperable, and no way that is too long foryou to tread it. You are a soul with all the powers of the soul and—as you arelinked with the Hierarchy—you are facing toward success.As I earlier said, I at this time shall not deal with certain points connectedwith the growth of the human family and its stabilisation into a newcivilisation. I shall begin to do so as soon as the war is over. When the needsof humanity are changed, and they will then be radically different to theconditions and demands prior to the war, then I will consider them. With theperiod of reconstruction, in which the New Group of World Servers will beactive, we shall later deal in detail, and I will give two series ofinstructions which can act as a guide for all your reconstruction work. Oneinstruction will be for my disciples, and through them for the New Group ofWorld Servers, of which they are a part; another will be for the men and womenof goodwill, and through them for the world of thinking men. However, I mightstate that the background or groundwork of all that you may be asked to do isthe Triangle work . In the subjective work, the New Group of World Servers willbe peculiarly active, creating the network of light; in the objective work, themen and women of goodwill will bestir themselves, creating the network ofgoodwill. The function of the New Group of World Servers is dynamically to“force” the energy of the will-to-good into the world; the average man andwoman, responding unconsciously, will express goodwill. Disciples, such as youare, must perforce work in both fields, creating and building both types ofnetwork. This you can do now, and you can form thus the nucleus of that greatinterwoven [39] pattern of light and of goodwill which must underlie or“substand” all exoteric work of renovation, renewal, rehabilitation andreconstruction. I ask you and other disciples, therefore, again to work withrenewed interest at the forming of triangles, reaching people who are alreadyactive, and seek to aid them in forming new triangles. This is a work of majorimportance and has the endorsement of the Hierarchy.As regards our sixth subject, my personal instructions to each of you, you willfind them as usual after this group instruction and after the teaching which Ishall give you on the building of the antahkarana. (Education in the New Age; ATreatise on the Seven Rays, Vol V) Your personal instructions are fuller thistime and I would ask you to accept them as instructions to be followed .Constant reading and consciousness of instructions and teaching which are notcarried through into action upon the outer plane, simply present a way of escapefrom reality. Unless a Master’s instructions meet with an experimental response,they loosen the ashramic tie and eventually the disciple slips into an interlude(sometimes of great length and involving several lives) of drifting, of readingand thinking and not working, of the pleasure of attention without the pain ofaccomplishment. This has happened in the case of several who have beentemporarily suspended from active work in my Ashram. See that it happens not toyou.May I remind you that your brothers’ instructions may be interesting to you andshould be read by you in an endeavour to understand him and work with him, butthat they may convey to him a meaning which is not open to you at all and that,therefore, your conclusions may prove entirely erroneous. These personalinstructions are, as you may realise, exoteric instructions within the field ofesoteric relationships. They can be read and studied by all of you. However, Ialso deal with you in a purely esoteric and subjective manner, and this is apoint upon which few of you, if any, ponder. Do you at any time register suchteaching or recognise its source? You need to learn to make careful distinctionbetween: [40]1. Teaching which comes to you directly from your own soul, via your mind.2. Instruction given by me to you in my inner Ashram, at which time you are alsosubjected to the stimulation of disciples senior to you.3. Impression which comes to you from the great aggregate of all Ashrams, theHierarchy.Later I will give you some training on this matter, but you are not yet readyfor it.The final point, which concerns the externalising of the Ashrams, will be givento you when the Ashram of which you are a part is more real to you than it is atpresent.I would have you remember that when the war ends two great conditions willemerge for which you must be prepared and for which you should now begin toprepare others. These are:1. There will be a great settling back by mankind in an effort to find security,to obliterate the effects of war from their troubled minds, to forget that whichhas happened, to return to the familiar, and to re-establish the old ways oflife. Human beings forget easily, and besides this ancient habit, humanity isvery tired. Get ready to deal with this, for it must not happen if it can in anyway be prevented.2. There will also come the cessation of the “great sounds of the materialaspects”—the sounds of war, the noise of explosion, and the cry of sufferinghumanity. This will create a curious false peace, but it will at the same timecreate a channel of approach for new spiritual forces and energieswhich—directed by the Hierarchy—will pour into the human family, causingspiritual stimulation, spiritual receptivity, spiritual aspiration and a greatreadiness for that which is new. You will therefore have two opposing conditionsto consider, with which to deal, and you will need much wisdom. You will have toassist in the task of preventing the relapse of a tired humanity into the stateof mind of [41] which inertia, a reverting to the old, and a demand for theancient ways are characteristic. You will also have to aid in the directing ofthe registered spiritual energies into avenues and channels of usefulness wherethey can accomplish the greatest good. Ponder on this.I have given you much in this instruction. I seek to make my Ashram useful atthis time of crisis. We have had a great crisis of materialism and the powers ofdarkness have very nearly assumed control. But we are seeing the slow dominationof the good. Humanity has been the battleground for a major conflict between thetwo great Lodges—the great White Lodge and the Black Lodge. The former is nowgradually gaining control.The withdrawal (quite imminent in time, my brothers) of the evil group willleave humanity relieved but bewildered, beaten to the ground, but with enoughstrength to rise to greater heights than ever before. For this withdrawal I askyou to prepare—with intelligence, wise understanding and deep love.The work to be done by the world disciples, the world aspirants, the New Groupof World Servers and the men and women of goodwill can be a determining factorin the New Age and can tip the scales between a static and retrogressiveactivity and a steadily planned moving forward into light. You can play yourpart in this determination, if you so will.That you will do so, and that you will have the opened eye which will see thedawning light and the fading darkness is my earnest wish for you.~TO MY GROUP OF AFFILIATED DISCIPLES: November 1944It is more than a year since you received your last set of instructions fromme—a year of momentous happenings upon earth and of significant changes in thehierarchical relation to humanity. There is, as a result of the war, a muchcloser rapport and spiritual confidence apparent between those pledged discipleswho have been faithful to their assignments [42] and Those of Us Who are seekingto use them in the service of world betterment; there is a more definiterecognition of emerging spiritual values among aspirants everywhere and agreater readiness to relinquish hindrances to service; the plans of the Christfor humanity’s release are more matured for these had to wait until such timethat the trend of human aspiration became more clearly emphatic; the new era,with its latent possibilities, can be seen upon the horizon, stripped of theveils of glamour and wishful thinking which obscured it ten years ago.The significant spiritual effects of the war can now be clearly seen, and I canbegin to consider with you (earlier than I had anticipated) some of the problemswith which you—as potential servers of the race and pledged disciples—can nowdeal. I could wish, as far as the immediate present is concerned, that you wereall younger and had availed yourselves more definitely of the teaching I havesought to give you these past years. Above everything else, I wish you were morecourageous. Does that word surprise you, my brothers? In considering this yearas a whole, I question not your devotion or your steadfastness; I haveconfidence in the depth of your aspiration and your desire for the will-to-good;I know that naught will turn you for any length of time from the pursuit of yourgoal.I do, however, question your courage. It takes courage to make spiritualdecisions and to abide by them; it takes courage to adjust your lives—daily andin all relations—to the need of the hour and to the service of mankind; it takescourage to demonstrate to those around you that the present world catastrophe isof more importance to you than the petty affairs of your individual lives andyour humdrum contacts; it takes courage to discard the alibis which haveprevented you from participating to date in the all-out effort whichcharacterises today the activities of the Hierarchy; it takes courage to makesacrifices, to refuse time to nonessential activities and to deal with thephysical body as if it were free from all impediments; it takes courage toignore frailties which may be present, the tiredness incident to a long life,the physical tendencies which handicap and limit your [43] service, thesleeplessness which comes from world pressures or from a badly regulated lifeprogramme, and the nervousness and strain which are the common lot today; ittakes courage to attack life on behalf of others, and to obliterate your ownwishes in the emergency and need.One of the points which disciples need to grasp more clearly is thewell-recognised fact (and thus easily overlooked from very familiarity) that theassertion of one’s determination to function as a server and as a disciplebrings about a refocussing of all the forces of the personality and the soul (inunison); it is, symbolically speaking, a recurrence of the ancient event ofindividualisation upon a higher turn of the spiral, this time entered into withfull conscious cooperation. This refocussing brings its own difficulties. Itleads often to a distressing consciousness of one’s own nature, one’s aims,one’s life theme, one’s aspirations and one’s handicaps, of one’s equipment andexperience, plus the various aspects and vehicles through which the soul hasperforce to work. All this produces an intensification ofttimes of self-interestand of concentration upon one’s self, always with the best of intentions andaspiration. One’s limitations, physical or otherwise, look unduly large; one’sfaults are exaggerated in one’s consciousness, though not so oft in expression;the extent of the service needed and demanded by the soul appears so great thatthe disciple at times refuses cooperation for fear of failure or from undueconsciousness of himself; excuses for non-service or for only partial serviceare easily found and appropriated; postponement of all-out help today, pluscomplete dedication to human need, is easily condoned on the basis of health,time, home limitations, fear of one kind or another, age, or a belief that thislife is preparatory to full service in the next; alibis are easy to discover,some of them even taking the form of believing that the demands of the Masterand the programme of the Ashram with which the disciple is affiliated areunreasonable or—as is the case with two of you in this group—that the Orientaldoes not understand the demands upon the Occidental disciple.I have for years endeavoured to arouse all of you, and through you the thousandsyou can as a group reach, to the [44] urgency of the times, but hitherto withonly partial or temporary results and as yet (for some of you, though not forall) the work to be done in response to the demands of the Ashram is secondaryto your daily life pattern, to the requirements of your business or your home orto what you believe to be the physical limitations, the emotional liabilitiesand the mental handicaps of your equipment.My brothers, let me repeat: The disciple has to take himself as he is at anygiven time, with any given equipment, and under any given circumstances; then heproceeds to subordinate himself, his affairs and his time to the need of thehour, particularly during a phase of group, national or world crisis. When hedoes this within his own consciousness, and is therefore thinking along lines ofthe true values, he will discover that his own private affairs are taken careof, his capacities are increased and his limitations are forgotten.Until this is your experience, a closer relation to my Ashram will not bepossible because the heavy and lethargic quality of your group life would entailundue effort on the part of the other disciples in the Ashram (and particularlyin the inner Ashram) in order to offset it. I am putting this to you withfrankness as we together face the end of the war, and a period of renewed anddifferent opportunity opens before all world servers. It is for you to decidewhether your contribution during the war period measured up to your opportunity;it is for you to decide what part you will play, as individuals and as a group,in the coming cycle—a cycle wherein the new ideas and ideals must be stressed,and for which a fight must be made, wherein the wider plans must be understood,endorsed and preached, the new and clearer vision for human living must begrasped and finally brought into being, and a cycle wherein the effort of allmembers of the New Group of World Servers (and surely you are that!) must begiven to the lifting of humanity’s heavy load.No definite assignments were given in the last instruction, as I felt I wouldlike to see whether the rhythm of the past—reporting on the meditation work andon the Full Moon Approach which has been carried on now for many years—was sostrongly established that, for the sake of the [45] group, it would be carriedon, even if not specifically demanded. Only a few have kept the groupmeditation; the work of interpreting the Formula, as outlined earlier and notspecifically discontinued by me, has received no attention, and the group is theloser thereby. I point out these factors because I would have you realise thatthis is group work, and that it is the group which is the teacher of the group,under inspiration from me, when you—as individuals—reach me, and under theinspiration of your own souls and of the Spiritual Triad when these contacts aremade and utilised.In my previous instruction I stressed three points to which I would like againto refer in the light of the emerging opportunity. My task is not to change youor to give you orders and commands. I have only one task, and that is to findand test out those who can serve the race under inspiration from the Ashrams ofthe Masters. I referred at that time to the loneliness which is one of the firstthings that indicates to a disciple that he is being prepared for initiation. Itwill be apparent, therefore, that the loneliness to which I refer is not thatwhich is incident to those weaknesses of character which repel one’s fellowmen,to an aloof or disagreeable nature, or to any form of self-interest which is soemphasised that it antagonises other people. There is much loneliness in adisciple’s life which is entirely his own fault and which is subject to cure ifhe employs the right measure of self-discipline. With these he must dealhimself, for they concern the personality, and with your personalities I have noaffair. I refer to the loneliness which comes when the accepting disciplebecomes the pledged disciple and steps out of a life of physical planeconcentration, and of identification with the forms of existence in the threeworlds, and finds himself in the midway place, between the world of outeraffairs and the inner world of meaning. His first reaction then is that he isalone; he has broken with the past; he is hopeful but not sure of the future;the tangible world to which he is accustomed must, he knows, be superseded bythe intangible world of values, involving a new sense of proportion, a new rangeof values and new responsibilities. This world he believes [46] exists, and hesteps forward bravely and theoretically, but it remains for a while whollyintangible; he finds few who think and feel as he does and the mechanism of surecontact only exists within him in embryo. He is breaking loose from the massconsciousness with which he has been merged hitherto, but has not yet found hisgroup, into which he will eventually be consciously absorbed. Therefore, he islonely and feels deserted and bereft. Some of you feel this loneliness; few ofyou have, for instance, reached the point where you feel yourselves to be adefinite, integral part of the group; only two or three of you realise—brieflyand fleetingly at times—the close link with the Ashram; your attitude is largelyone of hope, coupled with the idea that it is your physical limitations whichprevent your realising all that truly is , in connection with your inneraffiliations. But, my brothers, such a sense of loneliness is only another formof self-consciousness, of undue self-interest, and (as you make progress uponthe Path) you will find it disappearing. If you therefore feel lonely, you mustlearn to look upon it as a glamour or illusion and as a limitation which must beovercome. You must begin to act as if it were not. If only more disciples wouldlearn the value of acting “as if.” There is no time for any of you to be lonelythese days, for there is no time for you to think about yourselves.The second point I made was the need for you to emphasise and develop the Will .Presumably, you have all been working at the task of building the antahkarana,the channel of communication between the brain and the spiritual will, or theMonad, working through the medium of the Spiritual Triad. If you have beensuccessful, it will be beginning to dawn upon you that there is a greatdistinction between goodwill which the masses can and often do grasp, and thewill-to-good which is the goal of the disciple. Goodwill is relatively simple ofexpression and all of you know much about it and express much of it. For that,no commendation is required, for it is a human attribute lying very near thesurface of expression in all men. But the will-to-good is far more difficult toexpress, for it involves the ability not only to use the spiritual will, but toknow somewhat the nature of [47] the “good.” The will-to-good is the basicquality of divine purpose, involving planned activity and a definite goal to beachieved . It necessitates the ability to think in terms of the whole, anappreciation of the next step which humanity must take in the imminent GreatApproach (for this must be a reciprocal Approach), an understanding of thelessons of the past and a vision, based—not on love or on soul-sight—but on aconviction as to the immediate purpose of Sanat Kumara, as He works it outthrough the Christ and the planetary Hierarchy. This conviction is based, as faras the Hierarchy is concerned, on pure reason; it is based, as far as humanityis concerned, through its disciples, on intuitive perception, implemented bylove and expressed intelligently. Upon this I would ask you to ponder, and asyou ponder, make the needed changes in your personal approach to the problem.The third point grows out of the above. You are all pledged disciples, and assuch your immediate personal problem (in which I may not and therefore cannothelp you) is to overcome and destroy the hold which the Dweller on the Thresholdmay have upon you. We are back, therefore, to our starting point, and a questionnow arises in your minds: “How can I overcome this Dweller and yet at the sametime refuse to concentrate upon myself and my problems? This I am told by younot to do, and yet the Dweller is the sum total of all personality holds anddefects, all potencies—emotional, mental and physical—which limit my expressionas a soul. What can I therefore do?”My answer would be: You must first of all accept the fact of the Dweller, andthen relegate that Dweller to its rightful place as part of the Great Illusion,the great phantasmagoria of existence and as an integral part of the life of thethree worlds. You must then proceed upon your planned life service (Whatdefinite plan or plans have you, my brother?) and act as if the Dweller existednot, thus freeing yourself from all personality influence in due time andleaving your mind free for the task in hand. I could perhaps word it anotherway. When your interest in hierarchical work and the programme of the Ashramwith which you are [48] connected is adequately strong, it will then dominateall your actions, and all your thoughts (waking or sleeping); you will then findthat the grip of the Dweller will be broken, that its life has been destroyed bythe force of attrition and its form destroyed in the fires of sacrifice. Such,briefly, is the story; I waste no time with elaborations, for there is much Iseek to give you in this instruction.I desire to give you the help you need for the coming year which faces you.Above all, however, I am endeavouring to make clear to future generationscertain basic principles and certain aspects of hierarchical truth which must inthe New Age govern those who seek to tread the Path of Discipleship and who arewilling to be prepared for initiation. Changes in curriculum and in techniquesare being made by the Hierarchy; the adaptation of old methods to modern needsand to more highly developed men is under way. I write not for you in reality.You have already had more than you have used. I write for the coming disciplesand initiates of the next two generations.It is essential that disciples in all Ashrams consider these days whathumanity’s problems are, what they mean and what their solution entails; theymust know what the Masters of the Wisdom want done and then they must talk andwrite, act and live so that others too may understand.Humanity has never really lived up to the teaching given to it. Spiritualimpression, whether conveyed by the Christ, by Krishna or by Buddha (and passedon to the masses by Their disciples) has not yet been expressed as it was hoped.Men do not live up to what they already know; they fail to make practical theirinformation; they short-circuit the light; they do not discipline themselves;greedy desire and unlawful ambition control and not the inner knowledge. To putit scientifically and from the esoteric angle: Spiritual impression has beeninterrupted and there has been interference with the divine circulatory flow. Itis the task of the disciples of the world to restore this flow and to stop thisinterference. This is the major problem facing the Ashrams at this time.This year, I will make clear to you what work is asked of the group in relationto the planned group work, the group [49] meditation and the group thinking; therules then laid down will hold good for all future years, though theirfulfilment is necessarily optional, as you are free disciples, working under thenew rules, and are adult aspirants.Your full moon work remains unchanged and I will again send a phrase chosen outof the set of phrases already given. I will change my technique somewhat and inspeaking the phrase each month at our full moon contact, I will do it the daybefore, on the day of the full moon, and on the following day, and will also laythe emphasis upon the leading word in the phrases. If this leading word isrecorded by you, the effort can be regarded as successful.I suggest that you continue with the work, as hitherto given and undertaken, butI will give you a fuller picture of the full moon activity and purpose with someof the implications which may enable you to work with greater interest andunderstanding.The first time, my brothers, that I outlined for you the work I sought to haveyou do at the time of the full moon, I undertook to work with you along theselines for a preliminary period of three years, each year expanding the worksomewhat until the full moon of May of the third year. This period of time isnow nearly completed, and today I ask you two questions:1. What has this work meant to you?2. Have you grasped the importance of the work to be done?There has been a purpose behind all this effort which I have made, and anexperiment of importance has been carried forward in preparation for the comingNew Age activity.In some of the earlier instructions (A Treatise on the Seven Rays (EsotericPsychology), Vol II, page 701) I indicated that the coming world religion wouldbe based upon a new Science of Approach and that this would, in time, supersedethe present world religious formulas and ceremonials. Hence the importance ofthe efforts now being made by disciples in these new seed groups. They are inreality occupied with the [50] process of anchoring upon earth a new religiousidea or concept, a seed thought or germ of a new activity which (at some laterdate) will bear fruit and inaugurate a new method of drawing nearer to God.It might be of value to all disciples if I here analysed the three years’ workintended to be done during the full moon periods as outlined to you by me. Eachyear saw an addition to or expansion of the work and an enlargement of theconcept. I seek now to make it all clearer to you, thus laying the foundationfor the work to be done during the coming years, if you desire to continue withthe work. Let us get these instructions into tabular form for the sake ofclarity.I1. The first thing which I emphasised to you was that this was a groupendeavour, and that its success depended upon the group fusion, the group loveand the group understanding. The success of the desired inner contact was basedupon a realised group relation. It was intended to be an endeavour which wouldbe the outgrowth of a love, stabilised in and accentuated by all the groupmembers. Hence my constant reiteration of the need of love between the groupmembers. Towards the establishing of this loving relationship, I have beenworking for years with all of you. You may perhaps have believed that I did soin order that your group work in relation to your individual endeavour might besuccessful. That was not the major intent. The forming of units for specialservice in organising the life forces, processes and forms for the new techniqueof Approach to God or to the Hierarchy (which is the intermediary betweenspiritual reality and human life) was and is the major objective. Upon thisstatement I would ask you to ponder with renewed interest. Your interpretationsare so often motivated by an unrealised spiritual selfishness and an undueemphasis upon your specific group importance. The groups are simply the fieldfor hierarchical expression, and we are not yet convinced that the expenditureof force on our part is warranted by the results achieved. The group membershave been primarily [51] occupied with the registering of the more phenomenalresults and with what they, as individuals, sensed, and have neglected to paydue attention to the inner group relation which is the only thing of majorimportance. It is the only thing which will release the stored up energy on thesubjective side.2. The second factor of importance is deep recognition of the subjective realityof the spiritual world. I, in myself, as you thought of me, am only the symbolof that world, as are other Masters, focussed—as channels of contact andservice—in the Hierarchy. You, as a group, unitedly and together, were asked toapproach me and to contact me just as, in the coming New Age, the churches ofthe future will (at the full moon period) make a definite approach to theHierarchy in order toa. Intensify their spiritual life by the bringing in of spiritual force, withdeliberation and consciously.b. Achieve spiritual illumination through contact with the powerhouse of light,the Hierarchy.c. Store up strength for increased dynamic activity for an ensuing period ofservice.d. Bring about a fusion between the objective and subjective life of humanity.3. This leads to a Technique of Approach, based upon the realisation of theabove objectives, to an effort to see me (as I symbolise for you the spiritualvision), and to the establishing of a pathway of Approach, symbolised in theritual I gave you as a golden band of light. This you were to visualise asextending between yourselves, as a group, to your Tibetan brother. This pathwayof Approach is the Path which it is planned should constitute a more familiarsymbol than has hitherto been the case in the religious life of the race.4. This pathway of light leads to the heart of a dark blue disk at the verycentre of which you were told I could be contacted. Those of you who are in anyway adept at meditation work know well that the light in the head—when seen and[52] recognised—passes usually through three stages of intensification:a. It is, first of all, a diffused light, surrounding the head, discovered laterwithin the head and producing an inner radiance, which is the rudimentary halo.b. This diffused light then consolidates and becomes an inner radiant sun.c. Finally, at the centre of that sun, a point of dark blue, or a small indigodisk, appears. This is, in reality, the exit in the head through which the soulpasses out of the world of phenomenal existence, and it is the symbol of thepath or the door into the kingdom of God. This is the symbolical interpretationof the phenomena.As the group approaches nearer and nearer to reality, the pathway or the band oflight shortens (symbolically) and in time, when you are expert in this work andwhen your spiritual nature is truly intensified, you will enter almostimmediately into, or through, the disk of blue and become aware of the higherconsciousness, or divinity.5. Three things are, at this stage, essential to success:a. The mind must be “held steady in the light,” and for this receptiveexperience all the previous work in meditation has been essential. Its positive,attentive activity has been an essential factor in producing the desired mindcontrol.b. The creative imagination, involving as it does the power to visualise, hasalso to be developed and consciously used in obedience to instruction in theearly stages. This obedience has to be rendered voluntarily, even thoughblindly, before the true objectives can be grasped.c. Results must be expected and an inner sensitivity developed which willeventually obviate surprise and lead to a conscious recognition of achievement.This sensitivity may differ according to ray and [53] type, but the generalindications will be in the field of similarity and of group value.All this was the objective of the work I outlined. Much remained to be done, andeach year I have expanded the concept and laid the foundation for future work tobe carried forward with steadfastness over a long period of time. A beginninghas been made.IIIn the second stage of the work outlined by me when you had worked for a year atthis full moon activity, I began to widen the teaching and I added to theearlier technique. In the religion of the future, three years will always begiven to training the youth of the period (from the ages of fifteen to eighteen)in a preparatory technique of Approach.The stages in the second year’s activity were as follows:1. The recognition by the group members of the necessity for a closer grouprelation within the circle of the group and with me. This is symbolic of therecognition of the world need of love, as exemplified by an attitude of goodwilland understanding, and a closer approach by humanity to the Hierarchy. In thepast, the religious emphasis upon the esoteric side of instruction has been theapproach of the individual man to the God within, to his own higher self, thesoul, the first Master. In the future, the emphasis will be upon the unitedapproach of humanity (as represented by an increasing number of groups ofaspirants and disciples) to the Hierarchy. According to the status of the groupsand their awareness and condition of illumination, so will be the grade ofhierarchical Worker with Whom they will be in touch.2. The recognition that in this work, true occult obedience or the intelligentresponse to the urge of the group soul and to the “pull” of the Hierarchy, isthe next major requirement. This will produce the right carrying out of therequired assigned technique and a complete refraining from [54] any interest inphenomenal results or an analysis (at this stage) of any reactions experienced.Individual analysis hinders group recognition and true realisation. This is apoint to be considered and remembered.3. The next step which I indicated to you was that in which I pointed out thatthese Full Moon Approaches required one entire week of inner activity, dividedas follows:a. The three days prior to the full moon were to be dedicated to preparation.This preparation involved confidence , which swept the brain (the focus of thephysical plane expression) into the right condition; aspiration , which held theastral body in the right attitude; and dedication , which was the intelligentprocess, motivated by free will and involving mental concentration, whichenabled the confident aspirant to “hold the mind steady in the light.”b. Then, there were the twelve hours on the day of the full moon, wherein aconsciously achieved contact (dependent upon the success of the previous threedays’ work by the group ) became a definitely proven possibility. By trainingyou in these early stages in the attempt to contact me, I was laying the groundfor two eventualities: your future contact with your Master, prior toinitiation, and a contact with the Hierarchy. This was intended to be symbolicof humanity’s future contact.c. The three days succeeding the full moon period then were considered. In thesedays, it was pointed out, the personality could become conscious of the successof the previous work done and the subsequent contact. That realisation would befacilitated by an inner attitude of registration (by the mind) of that which thesoul has sought to impress upon it at the moment of attempted or achievedcontact; by the sense of expectancy which the emotional nature would be trainedto express and experience; and by the acknowledged attitude of the physicalbrain as it held [55] to the belief of true success, when the requirements hadbeen duly met.It will be apparent to you, if you have followed the above in the right spirit,that from the very start I have been working towards objectives unrealised byyou. I am trusting that the importance of this full moon work will becomeincreasingly clear to you and make you more eager to work as requested by me.IIIThe third stage, outlined by me during the past year’s work, brought in a farmore complicated activity than heretofore. I explained to you, if you willremember, that at the time of the full moon it was as if a door was openedbetween the Sun and Moon, making certain events of a spiritual nature possible.The band of golden light, extending between the Sun and the Moon, completely“irradiated the lunar surface” (to use the ancient formula) and made possiblecertain revelations. To students such as you, the symbolism should be apparentand can be seen as inviting a dual interpretation:1. It concerns the relation of the Solar Angel to the lunar forces, of the Sunand the Moon and their work in synthesis.2. It concerns the relation of the Hierarchy to humanity and consequently, ofthe subjective world to the objective worlds, of the realm of causes to therealm of effects. Ponder on this.Individual approach must be merged into group approach, and the approach ofgroups will some day be superseded by the organised approach of humanity as awhole. This third stage can (like the two previous ones) be divided into thefollowing activities, which require to be mentally grasped by the group:1. That certain realisations become possible. These are two in number: [56]a. Realisation one : That entrance upon the Path of Approach is possible forindividuals, for groups, and for humanity as a whole, as a unit.b. Realisation two : That energies, not usually or normally contacted, can betouched, grasped and utilised at the time of these Approaches, provided thatthey are contacted in group formation . Thus the individual, the group andhumanity are enriched and vitalised.2. That the spiritual Hierarchy can, at these times, be approached, verified andknown, thus leading to active conscious cooperation with the Plan which theHierarchy serves. It must be remembered that, on the side of the Hierarchy, aTechnique of Approach to humanity will also be employed, and thus we have anessential dual activity. The first stage of this dual activity took placemillions of years ago at the time of Individualisation , and produced theemergence of the fourth kingdom in nature, the human family. The second stage isbeing rapidly worked out today, and will produce the emergence of Initiation .The intermediate stage is that of Integration . We have therefore the germ of anew scientific religion, called (as I have earlier pointed out) the Science ofApproach. It is one in which humanity can now consciously share, for their stagein evolution warrants it. Men can today grasp the objective, share in the unitedaspiration, and carry out the needed requirements.3. The time to be given, at this stage of the training, to the Full MoonApproach was shortened, but tremendously intensified , and the objective was toproduce a far more dynamic activity . A state of tension had to be achieved,which would eventually release dynamic energy from—if possible—levels higherthan that of the soul. Hence the need for group integration and work. Thisperiod was divided as follows:a. There were two days of intensive preparation. This involved the achieving ofa right attitude of a dual kind: The group member fused his outer activity and[57] his inner orientation into one blended concentrated spiritual activity. Heproceeded with his usual avocations, but at no time—whilst so occupied—was he tolose sight of the inner orientation and specific recollection. All the time hewas outwardly busy, he was simultaneously occupied with a constant realisationof a retreat inward, a heightening of his vibration, and a raising of hisconsciousness.b. On the day of the full moon, you were asked to go through a symbolicperformance in the realm of the creative imagination, and through the medium ofits agent, visualisation. This performance involved the following steps:1. The recognition that in the blue disk, at the end of the golden pathway, wasan ivory door which was slowly opening into a room with three windows.2. The recognition that the group, as a unit, was advancing into that room andthere, united in an act of solemn dedication, stands ready for revelation.3. The recognition, by the group, of me, your teacher and Tibetan brother, andthe saying by all of us together of the Great Invocation. This produces fusionand releases something from “that which lies above to that which lies below,”speaking in the words of symbolism.It will be obvious to you that in this symbolic ritual there is typified, firstof all the Path, the goal, the kingdom of God, distinguished by spiritual mind,spiritual love and spiritual will (the three windows, atma-buddhi-manas, or thethree aspects of the soul). Secondly, the focussing of the consciousness in thatof the soul, followed by a group dedication; and, finally, that humanity(symbolised by the group) and the Hierarchy (symbolised by me) and thesubsequent voicing by me of certain Words of Power were all intended to producethe fusion of the objective and subjective worlds, and the consequent emergenceof the fifth kingdom in nature. Thus the skeleton structure of the new religiousceremonial [58] can be dimly seen and inadequately sensed. This stage isfollowed by:4. Two days of intensive recollection by the group in their brain consciousness.This involves:a. The development of the power to recall the Words of Power which had beenspoken by me, and later, the listening for a Word of Power. This recognition ofthe Words will be one of the major objectives of the new world religion, andhence our effort (not particularly successful hitherto) to do somethingsymbolically analogous in our group activity.b. A subsequent definite intensification of the life processes, and a spiritualdemonstration upon the physical plane as a result.The above elucidation should give you a new and more intelligent grasp of thesymbolic significances of the work we are now attempting.I am going to ask you to go over the whole process in these first three majorstages, studying with care my interpretation.1. During the months of January and February, please study what I have said,reading and rereading it until it is clear and fixed in your minds.2. During March take the first stage and work faithfully at it.3. During April take the second stage.4. During May, take the third stage. Then for the remainder of the time, untilOctober, work at this third stage. In October, if you have faithfully fulfilledrequirement, I will outline the work next to be done. May I ask for your realinterest, service and cooperation?Your personal instructions I have placed at the end to indicate to you itsrelative importance and so impress upon you the necessity for your individualteaching taking a secondary [59] place; it is of less importance than the groupdevelopment and the service of humanity. You will all awaken some day to therealisation that the Science of Service is of greater importance than theScience of Meditation, because it is the effort and the strenuous activity ofthe serving disciple which evokes the soul powers, makes meditation an essentialrequirement, and is the mode—ahead of all others—which invokes the SpiritualTriad, brings about the intensification of the spiritual life, forces thebuilding of the antahkarana, and leads in a graded series of renunciations tothe Great Renunciation, which sets the disciple free for all eternity.I am giving you here certain needed hints and much upon which to ponder. I giveyou of my time and of my love, of my interest and my understanding. Let ustogether serve.~TO MY GROUP OF AFFILIATED DISCIPLES: January 1946Since I last communicated with you the outer aspects of the world war, thecarnage and the slaughter are over, except in a few sporadic instances. Thestruggle now being waged is to reach a point of stabilisation in human thinkingand understanding from which a true and reliable peace can emerge. On theemotional plane, there is as yet no peace. On the mental plane, a great anddeep-seated cleavage is going on and the occult significance of certain words,enunciated by the Christ when in Palestine, is being worked out. He gave them asthe keynote for the particular subjective happening which is taking place atthis time. He said: “He that is not with Me is against Me.” This refers to theafter effects of the conflict between the Forces of Light and the Forces ofEvil. Great decisions have to be made all over the world, as to whether humanitymoves forward into a New Age of cooperation and of right human relations orwhether the materialistic groups will reassert their control and succeed inwinning the day. This great cleavage is now in process of settlement.On the other hand, a deeply spiritual division is also taking place. In apeculiar sense, and speaking largely symbolically, [60] the first phase of theGreat Judgment is asserting itself. The sheep and the goats are forming into twodistinct groups. The judgment being given is not the generally assumed one ofassigning penalties or rewards; it is not the negation of all effort as theresult of decisive moves, nor will it result in the emergence of major dividinglines. Such interpretations are man-made and are not true interpretations of theparable or word picture which Christ gave to His disciples nearly two thousandyears ago.The judgment referred to has relation to a mysterious process which is going onin the thinking (if one dare use such a word for such a comprehensive process)of the planetary Logos. He is deciding at this time the mode by which amomentous event or happening within the Hierarchy shall take shape; He is timingthe process of its externalisation; He is deciding which Ashrams shall beexternalised and Who, within those Ashrams, should and must proceed with thepurely inner and subjective work, and Who should be chosen to work—consciouslyand openly—in the outer world of men, thus duplicating in Their numbers whatChrist experienced when He “descended into Hell.” Many things have to beconsidered; the objectives in view of the Masters concerned, the rays inmanifestation, and many astrological relationships.In this deciding judgment Sanat Kumara is being aided by certain Members of theGreat Council at Shamballa, by the Christ and by the seven Masters Who areresponsible for the seven groups of Ashrams. He is also reaching certainconclusions as to the groups of disciples who have hitherto been under trainingduring the final stages of the Path of Discipleship. This decision has to takeunder advisement the rapidity with which the entrance of men and women into theAshrams can take place; it is also dependent upon the members of the Ashrammoving forward according to their degree, and upon the power of the Ashrams toabsorb and assimilate the much larger numbers, without upsetting ashramicstability. He has also to consider the ability of the neophyte under training totake and hold the far greater tension necessarily incident to true ashramic lifein the New Age. [61]These points are all being most carefully considered, because a major expansionof the Hierarchy as a whole, and the consequent reaction upon humanity, again asa whole, is not a thing lightly to be undertaken. Expansion—if it is to besafely undertaken—must proceed hand in hand with consolidation. The expansionnow contemplated in the highest quarters will greatly alter the potency of therelation of the Hierarchy to Humanity, and therefore of the second divine aspectto the third. Can Humanity take this increased potency correctly and safely?Will the aspirants of the world—if given opportunity to pass off theProbationary Path on to the Path of Discipleship—be stable enough to standsteady under the impact of hitherto undiscerned spiritual energy? Can theMasters, under the pressure of Their enormous task of world reconstruction, findthe needed time to increase Their training of Their disciples? For They arestill governed by the time equation where Their disciples are concerned. Can thesenior members in any Ashram relieve to some extent the pressures upon theMasters as well as upon the incoming and junior, and therefore inexperienced,disciples? If, however, the relation between the Hierarchy and Humanity is thusstrengthened and there is freer access in both directions, there will clearlyemerge the invocational pull or the magnetic potency of these blending centres:the pull will be upon Shamballa, which is the highest centre of all.Is the etheric web of the planet sufficiently stable and balanced so that it canadequately respond to the new and potent forces which could and will pourthrough it into objective expression? I would remind you that the release ofatomic energy has had a far more potent effect in the etheric web than in thedense physical vehicle of the planet. Three times the atomic bomb was used, andthat fact is itself significant. It was used twice in Japan, thereby disruptingthe etheric web in what you erroneously call the Far East; it was used once inwhat is also universally called the Far West, and each time a great area ofdisruption was formed which will have future potent, and at present unsuspected,results.The formation of the Triangles of Light and of Goodwill [62] —essentially themanipulation of energy into a desired thought pattern—has a definite relation tothis area of disruption. It will in due time be found that the Japanese people,with their peculiar knowledge of thought power (used along wrong lines in thewar period), will respond more intelligently to this type of work than many ofthe Western peoples. An effort should therefore be made to reach the Japanesealong the lines of the Triangle work.I would like to point out that the distinction between the “sheep and the goats”is mainly hierarchical. The term “goats” is esoterically applied to initiateddisciples and to those who have climbed the mountain of initiation. The term“sheep” is applied to those who are following blindly the inner urge of theirsouls and who are groping their way (in relatively large numbers) toward theHierarchy. For them still has to come the great revelation that the “kingdom ofGod is within you.” Such is the word for them at this stage in humanity’shistory. Once they have realised that, they are already being absorbed into theHierarchy. Life will now for them simplify. For the “goats” must come theimpelling call from the highest aspect of the Spiritual Triad, “Seek the way ofAscension”—ascension out of even triadal life into that of pure Being and ofmonadic existence.In this Great Judgment all decision lies in the conclusive thinking of SanatKumara. It is His judgment; neither the sheep nor the goats, nor the great massof men from among whom they have emerged, can affect that decision in theslightest degree. Any moment or climax of decision on the part of the Lord ofthe World institutes new law and brings into play new energies. Laws are onlythe unalterable conditions brought about by the activity, the orientation andthe emanated decisive thoughts of the One in Whom we live and move and have ourbeing, just as the activities, the orientation and the thinking of a human beingcarry the cells and the atoms of his body along the line of his wishes. Energiesare but the rhythm of His breathing and the results of the systolic and thediastolic action of His heart. From these energies we cannot escape, but—in amysterious and peculiar [63] manner—the planetary Logos directs them orwithholds them to suit the recognised planetary needs of the period.At this time the “eye of His direction” is turned towards a needy and waitingworld, and particularly towards the large number of waiting people who holdwithin themselves the potencies of discipleship. They are the hope of the world.This outpouring of directed energy means a great stimulation of all sensitiveand responsive aspirants; the result is not an easy one for them. Everything inthem is raised to the surface of consciousness, and whilst they are faced with avital and beneficent opportunity, they are also faced with the problem ofabsorbing more “punishment” (is not that the word I want, my brother?) than theywould normally take. Will they break under the impact of self-discovery and theopportunity to eliminate personality? Or will they rise triumphant from theashes of their dead selves into living power and beauty?Though Sanat Kumara is naturally unaware of the individual disciple or aspirant,He is not unaware of their massed effect, quality or status. Contact andrelationship are based upon vibratory reaction, and the potency of the unitedvibration of the disciples and aspirants of the world is today—for the firsttime in human history—strong enough to reach Shamballa. This is a new and veryinteresting fact.The Hierarchy therefore is:1. In a position of extreme tension.2. In a condition of quiescent waiting. It awaits:a. The decision which is on the verge of emanating from the judgment seat ofSanat Kumara.b. Notification as to the period and mode of the coming externalisation.c. The proposed influx into its ranks of disciples and aspirants.d. The reaction, later to be sensed by Them, of the massed use of the GreatInvocation.e. The clear sounding of the invocative, though inchoate, [64] cry of the massesof those who are not yet even upon the Probationary Path.3. Passing through a process of reorganisation. This involves the following:a. Senior disciples in the major Ashrams are now beginning to form subsidiaryAshrams, as I began to do in the year 1925.b. Owing to the war and the intensive efforts of the world disciples, morepeople along many and varied lines are being reached.c. The mode, methods and techniques of training (as I have earlier told you) arebeing remodelled and rearranged in order to suit the modern mind and needs.d. Senior disciples are undergoing a forcing process to enable them more rapidlyto take the initiation immediately ahead of them. This necessarily brings addedstrains and risks, sometimes even to the point of death, but also greaterspiritual light and life.4. At the entrance to the Way of the Higher Evolution, which is now more easilyto be found, owing to the rapid construction of the antahkarana by enlightenedsouls functioning upon the physical plane and working desperately to aidhumanity. Their spiritual desperation is what is needed to provide the required“point of tension” from whence the antahkarana can be built. There is a basicdistinction between desperation and pessimism. Desperation is related to thetime element and to a correct and discriminative perception of the need.Pessimism is related more to an unjust appraisement of the quality of humanity.All these things are at this time characteristic of the Hierarchy. I wouldremind you that when you think of the Hierarchy you think in terms of theMasters (as most people do) or of the higher initiates. This is not correct.Every accepted disciple is within the periphery of the Hierarchy and of itsinfluence, and—as I have frequently pointed out—all have in some past life takenthe first initiation. Every disciple has [65] been to Bethlehem and has seen theStar in the East—that star which shines forth in fuller splendour each timeanother initiation is taken.The difference between such disciples as you and the more advanced initiates isthat your basic orientation is different to that of the Masters. They areoriented to Shamballa; They are relatively unaffected by affairs and happeningsin the three worlds, even though that is the sphere wherein Their work lies;there is nothing within Them to react to these phases of planetary livingness.Disciples and all initiates below the third initiation are oriented to theHierarchy. Not the Council Chamber at Shamballa or the Way to the HigherEvolution engrosses their attention, but the life of the Ashram with which theyare affiliated and the Way of Initiation. This is a useful point to bear inmind. There is much in them which can and will react to qualities and eventswithin the three worlds, and—from the angle of the human consciousness—life forthem is very difficult because the dualism of existence is apt to produceviolent strain.The extreme psychical tension affecting the Hierarchy puts an undue strain uponthe emotions and the mental mechanism of the disciple because he is, as yet,unable to achieve that “quiescent waiting” which distinguishes the higherinitiates. The Will of God is not yet adequately factual in his consciousness;he is preoccupied with the attempt to make his personal will synchronise withthe spiritual will of the soul—a very different matter. The reorganisation beingplanned at this time by the Hierarchy and by the ashramic groups affects thepersonal lives of disciples and their efforts at accepting training; with theproposed changes and with the results of the outer ashramic work they must fallin line and they must accept the changing curriculum. Forget not that disciplesin this particular period have to make adjustments which are not easy. They havebeen taught in terms of the old tradition, perpetuated and summarised by theTheosophical, Rosicrucian and other occult groups; they have had, since 1900, toaccept and work with the newer modes of training and the changing forms ofteaching applied by the Masters Who take pupils. This has created temporary [66]difficulties which will not be present when the newer modes and methods are moregenerally established. The problem, therefore, of the modern disciple ispeculiarly hard, and the Masters bear this ever in mind. Also the strain of theworld cataclysm has increased these difficulties, and that strain is far morewide-reaching than is generally believed. Do you realise wherein the strainconsists, apart from the physical disasters and chaos, with its agony, despair,anxiety, and its demand for a poised and efficient exterior to be presented tothe world? Do you appreciate the keen ability of the trained disciple to reactto the harrowing conditions of human suffering and to penetrate the controlledresponse which has to be given?There are also other factors of a more subjective nature to which the discipleis sensitive, and among them are the following:1. The astral or emotional vortex which humanity has inevitably set up as aresult of registered pain and through which the observing disciple must move.2. The glamour induced upon the astral plane as the result of threeintermingling and inflowing streams of energy:a. The energies set in motion by the uprising cry of humanity itself, whichinevitably shapes and moulds astral substance.b. The new inflowing spiritual energies which the planetary Logos is steadilybringing to bear upon human life and upon all forms of physical existence. Thesemust traverse or cut across the astral realm in reaching the physical plane.c. The retreating forces of evil which are endeavouring to make a last desperatestand upon the astral plane.These three types of force (when brought into relation with each other) areproducing an unparalleled vortex of energy of which all disciples arenecessarily aware, particularly those (and they are a large number) who arepreparing for the second initiation. All disciples, working among theirfellowmen, [67] are brought into contact with this astral whirlpool. (I wouldcall the attention of D.E.I. to this fact because it accounts for his reactionduring the past two years and has led him to relinquish his position in my outerwork and to retire into a phase of living which will provide him with no truescope for his pledged experience and his years of training; this present phaseis in the nature of a cul-de-sac. Eventually he will have to retrace his stepsand admit the reality of the time lost—lost in the moment of humanity’s greatestneed. Yet he will retrace his steps. I mention this as it is a typical instanceof the effects of this glamour.)3. The stimulation to which the lower vehicles of a disciple are unavoidablysubjected. This evokes a full expression of all his inherent qualities, bothgood and bad. Everything in his nature is intensified, and the more mental hemay be, the more he is consciously aware of these revelations. If hisorientation is towards his life expression in the three worlds, a phase ofdepression, of self-accusation and frequently of doubt may have to be endured,thus handicapping his general usefulness.4. The evocation of a strong sense of the soul within the personality. Anemphasis upon the attitude of the soul to the personality life may also beinduced and may prove very misleading. It would appear from the (apparently)voiced expression of soul comment, criticism, encouragement and planning thatthe main interest of the soul is with the dedicated personality. Such is not thecase. The soul is very little aware of the personality nature, its dispositionand ideas. The soul can be conscious of the limitations within the personalityand of the barriers opposed to the inflow of soul energy, but the details are ofno interest to the soul. The soul is occupied with recognising hierarchicalplanning, with registering world need, and with responding (faintly, veryfaintly at first) to the developing monadic inflow. These attitudes andreactions of the soul (upon its own plane of being) affect profoundly andfundamentally the personality life and produce those basic changes which evokethe vocation of the disciple. The disciple is occupied with vocation and not somuch with evocation. (I would call this to the attention of [68] D.H.B. Thistype of evoked response is in the nature of illusion. He will know to what I amreferring.)5. The danger of “Imperil,” as the Master Morya has called it. This is somewhaterroneously interpreted as irritation by the neophyte, but it is not in factirritation in the ordinary connotation of the word. The surface ripples ofordinary irritation and the evanescent angers to which all disciples are proneare relatively of small importance. They pass and, in the sum total of thesoul’s attitudes to the personality, evoke no response or registrationwhatsoever. What is referred to is the reaction of the disciple to world evil.This produces uncertainty as to the future, annoyance at what is being donethroughout the planet by non-disciples, criticism of national and internationalplanning and a general atmosphere of unhappiness, plus a sense of superiorknowledge. All this is expressed in a negative, unconstructive manner. To thismany disciples are today prone; they need to realise that world affairs are notand cannot be moulded or determined by any hierarchical knowledge in thepossession of the disciple. World affairs and conditions have necessarily to bebased upon the demand and the point in evolution of the mass of humanity,working through their representatives, chosen or imposed, in every country. Thisdemand can be and is affected, modified and spiritualised by the attitude andthe teaching of disciples everywhere who are vocal and of humanitarian instinct.If, however, the will and knowledge of disciples in all nations were tocondition world affairs and control entirely the political, economic and sociallife of the people, it would produce a far more serious cleavage than nowexists, for instance between the rich and the poor, or between the classes andthe castes. It would produce a pronounced line of demarcation between theKingdom of God and the kingdom of men. This would run counter to hierarchicalintention, which is rapidly healing the existent breach, and thus offset thework which Christ set out to do on Earth. This point is often overlooked bywell-intentioned disciples. It is humanity which determines its own destiny.Disciples point the way, indicate the vision, set a needed example and emphasisethe ancient landmarks.[69] A realisation of these few points which I have chosen to enumerate out ofmany, will indicate to you the difficulties with which disciples are todayconfronted—each of you among the many who are also struggling to meet human needin a modern world.As a group of ashramic affiliates, you (together with disciples everywhere) areall reacting to this inflow of energies, and with consequent conflict; with someof you it has produced a definite crisis and one that you have not yet resolved;with one or two of you in this group, it has led to a seething inner turmoilaccompanied by an overemphasised introspection. This will be apt (if tooprotracted) to hinder your exoteric service. It is needless to remark that allof you need to become so sensitive to the quality of my Ashram, and sopreoccupied with the opportunity to serve which confronts every disciple thesedays, that your own personal development, your unique problem (so regarded byyou) and your reactions should be forgotten. You need to remember that you arenot as interesting to your soul as you may think.From the angle of the Master, it is the ability of the soul to control itsinstrument, the personality, and to work through it, that is of interest; it isfor these types of ability that He looks, and not at the reaction of thepersonality. This is hard, if not humiliating, for the disciple to remember. Themore engrossed he is with his personal responsiveness and capacities, the moreimpenetrable the barriers he is setting up between himself (upon the physicalplane) and his soul; as a result of this, barriers are then being set up betweenthe disciple and the life of the Ashram of which he is intended to form a part.Have this in mind and be, therefore, so occupied with the life of the soul thatyou have no time for personality introspection. The pure life of the soul willgalvanise the centres above the diaphragm into activity, and your lives willbecome simple and uncomplicated expressions of the second aspect of divinity—ofwhich all Ashrams are focal points.As you know, it is not my intention to give you any more personal instructions;you no longer need them during the rest of this life, because if you carry outthose already given [70] there will be nothing to hinder your taking theinitiation which is for you the next step forward. Do you realise the import ofwhat I am saying? This initiation which confronts you can be taken either duringthe remaining years which are left to you; this, in the majority of cases is notprobable, though a small minority—a very small minority—may achieve the goal. Orinitiation may be taken in the interim period between incarnations, or elseimmediately upon return to physical plane life. This latter is the most probablefor those who are not taking initiations higher than the third; and, at present,for that initiation I am not preparing disciples. It is usually regarded asessential that disciples who are taking the second or third initiations shouldregister them in their brain consciousness. As I have often told you, theinitiate consciousness is not the factor which requires to be thus recorded; itis seldom so. Recognition of it comes when the candidate is participating in the“esoteric installation” of a candidate into the ranks of the Great White Lodge.What the disciple undergoing initiation (and I choose the word “undergoing” withdeliberation) must and eventually does record are the crises which brought abouthis fitness to take initiation, as it is erroneously called in theosophicalcircles. These, correctly handled and surmounted, will result in his being aninitiate—a very different interpretation to the current theosophical one. As Ioften told you, a man is an initiate, prior to any initiation ceremony. Theceremony concerns hierarchical recognition of the disciple and does not concernthe candidate’s fitness. I find it needful to reiterate this fact.The planetary crises through which the planetary Logos is at this time passingshould result in the emergence of many initiates; no true disciple is exemptfrom the effects of this planetary situation. Inevitably, changes are wrought bythe soul in the personal life. When these changes are focussed through the lowercentres and the lower bodies, the general result is purification and characterbuilding. The aspirant is then still upon the Probationary Path. When thedisciple is in the position where he can pass through the first threeinitiations, then the inflowing energies work through the heart, [71] the throatand the ajna centres; when the highest head centre and the lowest spinal centreare simultaneously involved, the disciple is then able to take the higher majorinitiations. Much of this has been given you in the earlier teaching you havereceived, but I repeat these statements, so that with clarity you may proceed.One of you asked a question concerning divine intervention as a result ofprayer, and I would point out that there is a distinction between DivineIntervention and Answered Prayer. One admits of reciprocal energies, the otherpredicates action from above only. The measure of success in either case isdependent upon humanity as a whole. Classically the body is not equipped toreceive the fire, until consciousness is importuned to racial need. This issecondary to Divine Intervention which isolates the few and uses their organismto fuse and free the energies of dispersion. This is sudden death to thephysical vehicle if unprepared. Think upon this and know the consequences ofemotional fanaticism.There are three ways whereby the inception may come:1. Disciples aware of their charge, relinquish all personal ambition and arewilling to meet the test and be used. For, be not surprised my brother, adisciple can meet the test if he will . Accepted discipleship is in itself aguarantee of a certain amount of preparedness administered through rightdevotion, pure purpose and rigid discipline.2. The focussed intent of the hard pressed peoples of the world clamouring forpeace, forms a nucleus of unregenerate energy which can and will be used. It isless potent in effect, but in these days of crisis everything must be used.3. Every kingdom on earth is encumbered with shock —animal, vegetable, mineral,as well as human. This disturbance is a phase of promotion. There are crashedareas of released energy, causing forces to be freed which again can and will beused in the reconstruction.[72] The responsibility of this group is purpose . It is will fused and blendedand dispersed. I charge you to waste no time in idle speculation, but to carryyour responsibility as it should be carried, remembering that your only value isgroup determined. Placement determines effort (I suggest that you analyse thisstatement). Consequences are hierarchical. There is lowered vitality in theworld today due to a fear psychosis.Command your forces, stand in the Light, and the suspended mental link willrecharge the magnetic field for which you, as a group, are responsible. Thefusion exists in a small degree now, but Purpose is the magnetised line alongwhich the fire may travel.You have preserved your interest and effort for many years now. Can you continuewith this enterprise? It is for you a task of perseverance and of faith. You maynot in your various lifetimes see the world results. That I frankly tell you.You can undoubtedly realise and reap the benefit of the group results, for yourfusion into one close bond of brotherhood and devotion, into one united bandtreading the Path together is adequate reward. It will offset the usualloneliness of the disciple’s way and enable him to realise that he travels notalone.Above and beyond your personal compensation (which some of you know already tobe your group relation and its persistence) will be the building of an aspect ofthe mechanism of contact and of approach which can be known and seen by Us fromthe other side of life, but which has to be largely taken on faith by you. Itmight be regarded as the mechanism of inspiration, for—in the last analysis—itis individual and world inspiration which is the goal of all our work. Thismechanism is a subjective fact, and is slowly built as disciples aspire andserve and obey. It is an individual mechanism, and a group mechanism, and willeventually form part of the mechanism of humanity, viewing it as a whole and asthe fourth kingdom in nature. This kingdom is destined to act as a transmitterof force, of energy and life and of inspiration to the three subhuman kingdoms.It is this mechanism which [73] will constitute the bridge between the fourthand fifth kingdoms. It is the individual and the group antahkarana.I am going to change your full moon work a little. Proceed as heretofore, but asyou stand with me before the “open window” and prior to the attempt to hear mespeak the words which I may have for you, imagine yourselves as bathed in avivid butter-coloured living light which is pouring through the open window andenveloping the group. Note, as this happens, which centre responds or registersthe vibration and stimulation or any phenomena of any kind, and then record thisupon your monthly reports. I am also going to change the words spoken and amchoosing phrases which will convey a pictorial connotation to your minds; inthis way the power of visualisation will be evoked and aid you in registeringwhat I say. Here are the phrases among which I shall choose one for each fullmoon contact.1. The golden lotus of the heart. 7. The triangle of fire. 2. The burning groundof fiery red. 8. The golden way to God. 3. The mountain top, bathed in themorning sunrise. 9. The ocean and the rocky shore. 4. The uplifted hand. 10. Thesilver torch. 5. The equal four-armed cross. 11. The iridescent cube. 6. Theopen door. 12. The burning bush.I shall picture these to you and name them in your hearing. Note whether you canboth see and hear.My blessing rests upon you and together we go forward into the future.~MY BROTHERS: June 1946The papers which I am at this time sending out to you are perhaps the mostimportant which you have ever received. [74] This is so—not from the teachingangle—but from the angle of the Ashram with which you are affiliated.I would like to start by emphasising the fact of your affiliation, because it isa subjective relation with which nothing can permanently interfere. There maycome these interludes (where neophytes are concerned) when the relationshipseems severed, and others wherein the disciple appears to be making no progressat all and has nothing to contribute to the life of the Ashram. But—in theturning of the wheel of life—lessons are learnt, and usefulness returns.I would like to ask you to read this with care, with detachment, with undimmedaspiration, and with the realisation that this present life is but a minute inthe life of the soul. This life is, however, of major importance in the life ofsome of you; it is of focussing importance in the life of a few; it is oftesting importance for some.I have now definitely decided to disband the New Seed Group. My experiment inreorganising the earlier groups into one large group has not succeeded. I havetold you frequently that the Hierarchy itself does not know what decisionshumanity will make in world affairs, or if mankind will profit from profferedopportunity. Equally so, the Master of an Ashram does not know what “discipleson the periphery” of an Ashram will do, because their training and testing isonly in process. He does know what the accepted disciple, admitted freely intoashramic intimacy, will do in any given circumstance, because he has been testedand tried and the Master knows that there are certain things which he will notdo.This experiment with the New Seed Group has lasted five years. The earlierexperiment with the groups lasted ten years. These experiments were undertakenin the most difficult period of the world’s history and during a particular timeof stress and strain. Of this I am not unmindful.I am disbanding this group exoterically on four counts:1. (Deleted by A.A.B.)2. In spite of many years of work with me, the group is not yet integrated andhas produced no particular spiritual [75] enterprise. I have indicated manyspiritual enterprises which called for your full measure of enthusiasm, time,money and interest. Many of you in this group are doing less for the Trianglework, the Goodwill work and the distribution of the Invocation than the averageSchool student, and it is you to whom I should look for aid in what I amattempting to do. Why not aid me where I have asked for aid? Why search forsomething unique and special and different from that of the rest of thestudents?The spiritual enterprise into which I hoped to see you all throw yourselves wasthe work I have outlined, the distribution of the Problems of Humanity, thespread of the Invocation, the Triangles and the Goodwill work. I am notinterested in some particularly occult work which you will evolve in meditationor in discussion. F.C.D. is entering upon his life work along the lines of myenterprises; it will be a hard one, growing out of the Problems, presented by meto you. Forget not that these Problems were part of your instructions releasedfor the general public. I have no criticism of F.C.D., who has come through deepwaters to heights from which he can do most effective work. I am happy to beassociated with him and have asked the Master K.H. to leave him a little longerin my group. I have no criticism of J.W.K-P., who has handled a profoundlydifficult task for me with beauty, understanding, judgment and courtesy.3. My next reason for disbanding the group is the failure in occult obedience ofmany of you. Voluntarily and willingly you joined the groups for training,discipline and expansion. This involved the following of certain suggestions,meditations and instructions. For years, quite a number of you have doneabsolutely nothing about your personal instructions. I refer here not only toexoteric exactitude but (above all else) to esoteric understanding. When, mybrothers, I assign meditation work and make suggestion over the years, I have adefinite purpose in view and a plan worked out [76] which is adapted to theparticular student. When the work is not done, I—owing to the freewill of thedisciple—am helpless.4. Another reason upon which I must very briefly touch, and which is a factor inmy decision, is A.A.B.’s integrity in the work. Among some of you, if what Iwrite is agreeable to you, expresses your own ideas and is in line with yourgroup thinking, then it is I who write it. When what I dictate runs counter tothe ideas of the disciples, or places a finger on a weakness, or makes astatement which runs counter to the lower mind, then it is written by A.A.B.This situation has existed for some time.For these main reasons, and because I seek no further to burden A.A.B. with yourpersonal instructions, I am closing this aspect of my work. A.A.B. has much todo for me in finishing the Instructions as outlined. Her own Master (and mine)also requests that she no longer do this work, and with Him I am in fullagreement. A.A.B. has also to conclude the Ashram papers (A Treatise on theSeven rays, Vol. V.) and finish the papers on Healing. (A Treatise on the Sevenrays (Esoteric Healing), Vol. IV.) Then her task for me will be accomplished.D.E.I. is no longer in this group, and for this life and probably the next, hewill be learning the lessons of adaptability, of impersonality and renunciation.He made one serious and irretrievable move prior to the outbreak of the war, andhe did this against the advice of senior disciples and of his own inner monitor.I would here again remind you that the inner link remains unbroken. You arestill members—each and all of you—on the periphery of my Ashram . Nothing canalter this. Some of you warrant no criticism from me and are not responsible forwhat has happened.Let me reiterate: The ashramic link remains unbroken, but the outer relation isended for this incarnation. You can still reach me individually, if you fulfilthe requirements and seek to serve the Plan outlined to you by me.With this general letter I am sending very full personal [77] instructions—thelast you will receive from me this life on the outer plane. I would ask you toread with extreme care what I have to say and suggest, because of the effect itmay have on your outer life of service.I use not words lightly. A.A.B. has taken me down with accuracy during thesemany years, including the past nine years of illness. She has never been too illto take my dictation and send it out to you and to the world exactly as I gaveit. Please read not only your own instructions but those given to the othermembers of the group, and you will then understand more clearly the reasons forthe disbanding of this group. The personal instructions will be full and conciseand will give you enough work, coupled with all your previous instructions overthe years, to occupy your attention for the remainder of your lives and lead youinto a closer association with the Ashram. You have the instructions, coveringmany years and given to each of you, preserved for you in Discipleship in theNew Age (Vol. I) . You have much intensified and concentrated individualteaching, much indication of opportunity and of the work which you areindividually asked to do, a great deal of help in dealing with personalitylimitations, and much inspiration.Read now my personal instructions to you in the light of our long personalrelations. We have worked together for many years and I know you all well. Ihave told you that in the light of the Ashram there is naught concealed. Theseinstructions are bridging instructions which will suffice until the day comeswhen you will step into a closer relation and will have overcome the personalityto such an extent that there will be no fear of your making any seriousmistakes; you can then be depended upon, as are all true accepted servingdisciples.The teaching—along special lines—of the New Age presentation of esoteric truth,necessary in preparation for initiation, will continue; it is essential that thesecond volume of Discipleship in the New Age should reach the public. This newteaching (or rather this new sequence of teaching) in its timed presentationconsists, as you already know, of six themes or subjects: [78]Instruction on Meditation.Teaching on Initiation.Training in Telepathy.Teaching anent the Etheric Body.The Problems of Humanity.The Externalisation of the Ashrams.You will continue to receive these papers, not as an affiliated member of myAshram, but only as an intelligent, trained aspirant who is privileged to beused in building up the needed thoughtforms anent the correct aspects of theteaching so that the seed or germ may be truly implanted in the humanconsciousness and thus truly grow and influence the coming age. Forget this not.~MY BROTHERS: March 1947You will by now have recovered from the shock of the cessation of our outercommunication. As you may well realise (or do you?), my inner relation to youremains an entirely private and individual matter, known only to the aspiringdisciple and myself. Such it must remain for this immediate life cycle. Thestrength of your radiance, your potential as a light bearer, and your ability toserve your fellowmen will demonstrate to your co-disciples in my Ashram or onits periphery the fact of that relationship; it will prove that you, thepersonality, the soul, and the Master of the Ashram, are in contact. The supremeMaster, the Christ, said when last on Earth: “By their fruits ye shall knowthem.” In so saying, He indicated a definite line of guidance for all of us.A Master has to know and gauge the disciple by the work which he does in thefurthering of the Plan, and not by the disciple’s reaction to his aspiration.The attentive world has also to gauge the existent phase of divine expression inthe disciple’s daily life. By what else can the onlooker gauge it? The discipleis therefore under constant dual investigation; to this test, he must perforcehimself add a third: his own position as the Observer. He is thus exposed tocriticism and [79] judgment from three angles, and upon this fact I would askyou carefully to ponder.A review at night along these three lines would be of value to all disciples,using the imagination as far as possible as an instrument of spiritualperception; learn to “imagine,” as far as you can, how a Master would view yourday’s endeavour, how your watching environment would have reacted to your lifeand words, and how you yourself regard the day’s accomplishments. I wouldrecommend this to all disciples and all of you in training for my Ashram; andwhat I have here suggested might well be used also by the Arcane School for thesenior students.~MY BROTHERS: March 1948Another year has gone by and it is again time for me to extend the teachingalready given still a little further. You are still functioning as a group withclosely interrelated links with the Ashram, with me and with each other. Thesituation is not, however, the same as it was last year, and there are certaindifferences and distinctions. These are due to the reorganisation which has goneon within the Hierarchy itself, necessitated by the imminent reappearance of theChrist. This has produced certain basic changes.As you know, I have for years (with the assistance of A.A.B.) been endeavouringto help and aid many disciples who belong to other Ashrams than the second rayAshram of K.H. or my own. I have given to them the basic teaching which theywould have received from their own Masters and—because my Ashram is a second rayAshram—they have had an imperative stimulus given to their love nature, andtheir sense of universality has been developed, in order to fit them for thework of the coming cycle. In the cycle now so near at hand, the Lord of Lovewill seek to organise the new era along the new or Aquarian lines. In the seriesof papers on the externalisation of the Ashrams or of the Hierarchy, (TheExternalisation of the Hierarchy) we are in reality considering the goal orsupreme expression of [80] the teaching given to many disciples anent that greatevent—teaching intended to evoke their intelligent cooperation.In your preceding series of instructions I dealt specifically with the Return ofthe Christ, and that message was sent out on a large scale to the generalpublic. Since then I have written two other papers, entitled: The Work of theChrist and The Teaching of the Christ. These have been added to the originalinstruction anent Christ’s reappearance, so as to reach a larger public thanjust this handful of disciples. These instructions are now available to all ofyou in book form, entitled The Reappearance of the Christ .The point which I am seeking to make is that this book is primarily yourcontribution to the effort which the Hierarchy is making to reach and arouse meneverywhere to the imminence and the inevitability of Christ’s emergence; it isin the nature of a seal set upon your faithfulness and steadfast faith over theyears in which we have worked together. More important still, you have (as agroup) provided the pool of thought that could be stirred into activity, andthus make possible the giving out of this terrific proclamation—for that is whatit is. Thus you have served and helped at this critical time—critical not onlyamong men and in connection with world affairs but critical also in theHierarchy itself.In your thinking, reflection and activities carried on henceforth, this major,presented hierarchical intention must constitute the very groundwork of yourlife pattern. As members of an Ashram, you are part and parcel of the presentcrisis within the Hierarchy, and you cannot avoid it.One of the effects of the reorientation is that four or five of you will beworking more actively, and eventually more consciously, in the Ashram of yourown Master and less actively in mine; you must remember, however, that the linkis by no means severed. Another effect is that several disciples from otherAshrams will be working in my group, and one of the Master K.H.’s disciples isnow to function as senior disciple in my Ashram, because A.A.B. is no longeravailable in that capacity as she has been since 1932; she resumed her ownactivities in the Ashram of the Master K.H. over three [81] years ago. Thecompletion of my books is practically all that she is now doing for me.This reorientation and this “outward movement” of the Hierarchy requires theassuming of a certain attitude on the part of all of us, and the development ofcertain mental habits, which I will proceed to discuss with you as part of theusual first theme in all these instructions, that of meditation.~MY BROTHERS: January 1949This new year of 1949 is a peculiarly momentous one from the angle of spiritualvalues. Last year was one of decision—as public affairs havedemonstrated—decisions which were not always sound and which infringed theprinciple of right human relations. It was a year of decision for the Hierarchyas well as for many world leaders, both secular and spiritual. The disciples ofthe world were under great and peculiar strain, many of them working off andhandling severe personal karma, and some of them descending into the very depthsof realisation—depths where world iniquity and world sorrow confronted them andworld issues were made very clear to them. It was therefore a year of peculiartesting and trial, and the more advanced the disciple the greater has been hisproblem, involving as it has done both personal and world problems. The loadupon them has been heavy.To this condition the members of the New Seed Group and those affiliated withthem and with my Ashram have been no exception. This new year holds in it greatpotentialities for expansion and growth and for the progress of all movements,particularly those oriented to the work of the spiritual Hierarchy of ourplanet. The inflowing force is beneficently potent and the destructive forceswhich have prevailed during the last few years are not so dynamic. This shouldbe a year of moving forward and of expansion (implemented and directed by theHierarchy). The spiritual vortex of force which is moving nearer tomanifestation will [82] make possible certain moves and will clear away some(though not all) of those forces which have held back the proposed expansion andwhich have limited the work that disciples all over the world have sought to do.Every disciple has been tested; unsuspected weaknesses have emerged andcharacteristics which should be straightened out have come to the surface; afew—a very few—have fallen by the way, but a large majority have passed thetest.Weaknesses of motivation, of purpose, of technique and of personality faultshave been exposed and recognised by truly earnest disciples; this has beennecessary, for the incoming energies will render excessive the weaknesses (ifthey are recognised for what they are) and will enhance the contribution toworld service of those disciples who can stand the strain and face themselveswith truth and sincerity.The call is going out from every Ashram to all workers to close their ranks andto stand together in the closest comradeship of loyalty and understanding; thechallenge is for them to subject themselves (and by that I mean theirpersonalities) to a drastically applied self-discipline, to a purifying process,and to effect those reforms within their own natures which will make them moreeffective instruments in service. I am impressing the minds of those members ofmy Ashram of whom you have never heard with these same ideas in connection withthe work that they may be doing for the Hierarchy.It was the knowledge of this coming inflow and opportunity for increasedusefulness which prompted A.A.B. to put through the reorganisation of the ArcaneSchool, to close its ranks and to deepen the proposed trend of the teaching andthus to take those steps which will make the work more effective and potent. Shehas also taken and will in the near future take the needed steps for theeffective functioning of the Arcane School after she passes to the inner side ofservice.The organising and work of the Arcane School is the spiritual project of A.A.B.and with it I have nothing whatsoever to do, nor shall I ever in the futureguide or take any part in the affairs of the Arcane School. That is the task ofthose whom A.A.B. will choose to carry on. It is a living organism [83] whichwill grow of its own inherent potentialities and under the spiritual inspirationof the energy coming from the Ashram of the Master K.H. in which A.A.B. is aworker and disciple.I seek now to make a few comments anent the work for which A.A.B. has beenresponsible and for which F.B. will be responsible when she passes over.During the years in which I have been in touch with all of you, much world workhas been started, and the influence of the group of workers whom A.A.B. and F.B.have gathered around them has spread all over the world. I refer here to whatthey stand for internationally and—as a result of the spread of the teaching forwhich I am responsible—to the change which has been wrought in the generalconsciousness. That is far greater than you know. The world-wide spiritualferment which has been consequently set up has been due to two main causes:1. The Arcane School as members have adhered to it in every land and have eachin turn become distributors of light.2. The publication and distribution of my books everywhere; they are far morewidely read than you have any idea.Out of the apprehension of truth by many thousands in many lands and the needfor it to be put to practical use in these days of dire world need, two othermodes of work were initiated: the Triangles and the Goodwill work. There is hereno need for me to go into details anent these two spiritual enterprises. Youknow them well, though only a few of you have been truly interested or thrownyourselves, heart and soul, into assisting.The Arcane School is not one of my activities or enterprises, and has never been. In view of the condition of esoteric schools (so called) in the world, whenA.A.B. organised the Arcane School she deliberately refused to let me haveanything to do with it, and I fully concurred in her decision. The extent of myconnection with the School lies in the fact [84] that I outlined for her thedegrees of the School, and once or twice—in my instructions used in theDisciples Degree—I appealed to the students for cooperation in some matter.Forget not that these instructions were not School instructions, but were theearly form of my books and went out unchanged to the general public. Also, ithas only been within the last five years that any correspondence course for theSchool has been arranged around one or other of my books.The policy of the School, its principles, curriculum and techniques, have beenentirely those of A.A.B., working in conjunction with F.B. and afterconsultation with one or two senior students living in or around New York or inEurope.There has necessarily been questioning among senior students and in this groupas to what will happen when A.A.B. passes on. The past record of this group ineffective and steady work would not incite A.A.B. to have much confidence inyour leadership. You have shown no organised group ability to take a piece ofwork embodying some one or other of my suggested spiritual enterprises andeffectively work together for its furtherance. What have you done as a group toaid the Triangle work or the Goodwill work, or to throw yourselves successfullybehind the work of the School? There are many outside the New Seed Group whohave done a more consecrated and selfless task than have you, though there are afew exceptions. But, my brothers, out of fifty-one, how few!!When A.A.B. passes on she will leave the Arcane School and, with my fullapproval, all the other activities in the hands of F.B. She will leave also, inthe departments, dedicated men who will continue to assume, as far as in themlies, the direction of the work, in consultation with F.B.There will be no need whatsoever for any reorganisation. Why should there be?A.A.B. has been interested in and has initiated, with F.B., all departments. Shehas never been a worker in any of them, which may be a new idea to you. When shefinishes her job there is no gap in any department. So why reorganisation? Thework will go on with the same workers, and new ones will be added as needarises. Young workers must be chosen who may not see things as all of [85] yousee them, and in that lies the hope of the work’s persistence, for most of youare too old for the work of reconstruction and too crystallised; you can,however, form a strong foundation and give courage to the young ones. Most ofyou are too anxious to see the old methods and modes of work perpetuated. I andA.A.B. are more interested in seeing that the need of the youth of the world ismet. The principles of the Ageless Wisdom must be preserved, but all outwornforms must go.The success and growth of the work will depend upon the smooth transition whichcan be made between the past and the coming new world; it will be dependent uponthe determination of the workers to continue with what they are doing, to renewtheir dedication and above all, their vision; to eliminate all desire forprominence in the work and all ambition, and with a will to meet the need in thenew ways, with the expanded truths and with no dogmatism.I am looking for no new “stenographers” to take the place of A.A.B. and shalldictate to none of you. You have masses of undigested material with which towork, and enough teaching to express and make available to the public fortwenty-five years to come. You have enough information from me to enable you tomake your individual contact with me if you follow the rules and live the outerlife of a disciple.It is the books which bring people into the various phases of the work; you canaid in keeping them in constant circulation, and you can also hold togethersubjectively so that the relation of the group to the Ashram is still preservedand externalisation later can still be possible. Those are the two majorundertakings with which I present you; and these with your intensifiedindividual approach and the work of the Triangles and Goodwill, will provide youwith much to do.Throw yourselves behind those who have made themselves responsible—underF.B.—for the Triangles and Goodwill work. Make their work possible and avoidinterference; they will make mistakes, and these you will be prompt to note;your sole duty is to stand by. Mistakes do not matter if clarity of vision,spiritual persistence and love accompany them. Keep the personnel of the work asfar as possible masculine [86] and put no sixth ray people in positions ofinfluence; they know not how to cooperate and are frequently points ofdissension and dislike.You see, my brothers, I am making no startling plans for handling the work inthe event of the death of A.A.B. I suggest no changes. I would like to see thework left in the hands of those who are already doing it; I suggest the additionof young people to the group of workers as need arises and place occurs. Isuggest that the work be kept fluid, as A.A.B. has always kept it.Above all else, remember that the work of the Triangles, the Goodwill work andthe Arcane School is that of an organism and not an organisation, and it willgrow through its own inherent life and not through planning. If this is borne inmind, you will see where some of you have been in error, both in criticism andin planning the future of the various aspects of the work. The work will go onin the strength of its own inherent life; it will be damaged by planning,interference and organisation. Let the work alone, giving it assiduous attentionand meeting its needs as they arise. The Triangle work and the Goodwill work arein the hands of young people who must be strengthened, trusted and encouraged.The Invocation work, tied in with the Goodwill work, the Triangles and theSchool, is moving steadily forward and is the responsibility of all three. Ifrightly handled, its distribution will be automatic, mechanical and momentous.The various phases of the work will proceed as desired if all talk of executiveheads, of assumed responsibility, and of the need for the New Seed Group isended. The thought of reorganisation must be dropped; it would immediatelydisrupt the present smoothly working organism. A transition carried forwardwithout any change or difficulty will greatly reassure all groups. Young peopleshould be found and trained—trained in the principles . There should be nodoctrinal teaching given. If it is, inevitably the School will die. The newtruths are being fast recognised, but it is youth which is recognising them.Those who have for twenty years absorbed a system of thought are apt to be soabsorbed by it [87] that it is hard for them to recognise the new and vitalincoming truth, and the sad part is that they are often sure they do. The newtruths are overshadowing us today; if the Invocation means anything, it is whatmust be expected.The principles to be emphasised are:1. The Arcane School trains disciples. Its curriculum is therefore eliminative.Its standard cannot be lowered. It is not a school for probationers. It willconsequently always remain relatively small.2. It is a school for adults wherein occult obedience is developed. This is notobedience to man-made rules or school obediences, but involves soul obedience.3. This is a school wherein belief in the Hierarchy is scientifically taught,not as a doctrine but as an existent and provable natural kingdom; the rules ofthe Ashram and the dual life of the disciple are emphasised.4. This is a school wherein the student is taught that “the souls of men areone.”5. No claim for place or power is made, and the claim of being an initiate isnever heard. The Headquarters Group and the workers in the School are therebecause of spiritual inclination.6. The Arcane School is non-sectarian, non-political and international in itsthinking. Service is its keynote. Its members can work in any sect and in anypolitical party, provided they remember that all paths lead to God and that “theOne Humanity” governs all their thinking.7. The fundamental doctrines of the Ageless Wisdom, recognised all over theworld and as expounded in my books, constitute the foundational teaching of theArcane School. This is so, not because they are my books but because they arepart of the continuity of the Ageless Wisdom and constitute the latest emanationof the Ageless Wisdom issued by the Hierarchy. They must not be permitted tobecome a Bible of a sect, as has been the case with The Secret Doctrine and the[88] Theosophical Society. This incidentally has been a profound disappointmentto the Hierarchy. A.A.B. must not be turned into an occult authority. Thoseconnected with the Great White Lodge favour no Bibles or authorities—only thefreedom of the human soul. The teaching matters, not the source or the form.Let me reiterate for the sake of clarity: None of you has any responsibility forthe Arcane School or for the service activities though you can work helpfully,with humbleness and pure motive in any or all of them, under the direction ofA.A.B. or of those into whose hands she has put responsibility.... It is inthese relationships that you will develop the humility and pure motives whichare the outstanding hallmarks of the disciple.One thing I would however like you clearly to grasp and that is the patternwhich underlies the various aspects of the work now in process of expansion. Abrief diagram should make the relationship clear, and these relationships arefactual today:THE SPIRITUAL HIERARCHY OF THE PLANETworking through/THE NEW GROUP OF WORLD SERVERSusing many agencies, among them/THE ARCANE SCHOOLworking through/THE SERVICE ACTIVITIESthe Triangles, the Goodwill work, the Invocation workallied with/THE LUCIS PUBLISHING COMPANYThe energy of the New Group of World Servers could be likened to the antahkaranawhich connects humanity with the Hierarchy and provides a channel of contactwith the Ashrams of the Masters. The Arcane School can be considered [89] as oneof the results of the activity of the New Group of World Servers. There are manyothers scattered all over the world. The same holds true of the ServiceActivities. No esoteric group is soundly handled and correctly motivated unlessthe spiritual energies which are available to it and the knowledge and thewisdom unfolded find expression in definite service. The service activities are,therefore, an expression of the livingness of the Arcane School and thatrelationship must be valued and preserved.As disciples, your place is in the senior ranks of the New Group of WorldServers and your responsibility, as a group, is to aid a phase of the work to bedone which is strictly the project of the Hierarchy as a whole. I ask you tothrow your efforts into the work of preparation for the reappearance of theChrist, to further in all possible ways the distribution both of the pamphlet soentitled and the book which deals with His reappearance. The world must beflooded with the information and through the hope and expectancy thus engenderedmay move forward into greater light, better human relations and a newerhappiness. The results of your activities along this line should enhance theusefulness of the service activities of the Arcane School and swell the ranks ofthose who are working on mental levels in the Triangles and for right humanrelations through the medium of the Goodwill work.Begin, my brothers, to do your own work, leaving others to shoulder theirassigned responsibilities and waste no time in interfering in any phase of workwhich does not call for your attention. You are in my Ashram . The Arcane Schoolis not a project of my Ashram and is, therefore, no responsibility of yours. Ithas been the means of giving you a greatly needed esoteric training and willcontinue to do so if you so desire, but the work of the Christ (to which allAshrams are pledged) calls for your cooperation; it is this responsibility whichI lay upon your shoulders.That the years may see developed in all of you a firmer dedication, aself-sacrificing service and a deepened humility, is the hope and prayer of yourfriend, collaborator and Master. [90]~MY BROTHERS: March 1949I have no group instructions for you now. Nor shall I have again. When theinstructions on the designated themes are completed, I will write an instructionupon group work which will close all that I have to say on the subject in thetwo volumes of the book Discipleship in the New Age . The major intention ofthis book is to awaken the aspirational public to the opportunity for trainingwhich is theirs if they so choose; it should make them think with greaterclarity of the Hierarchy and its functions; much good may come of sending forthits teachings and a new era in the field of spiritual instructions may result.My present objective is now to help A.A.B. conclude the important teaching whichI have—with her aid—been giving to the group over a long period of years; itwill then be available to the general public, after certain specific deletions,about which she knows and which are similar to those in the first volume. Youhave had more, much more, than you can assimilate; of the original group ofstudents only a few are left; of the more than fifty original members who havebeen affiliated with my Ashram, only sixteen remain, and of these only eight aretruly active; and of these eight, two are causing me some questioning.You might at this point appropriately ask the following questions: Wherein liesthe fault, and was there error in the choices I made? Where does the blame liefor what—on the surface—appears to be such an outstanding failure? It mayperhaps interest you to have some of the reasons presented to you:1. A Master, in choosing the personnel of His Ashram, is Himself governed bycertain unavoidable factors:a. The fact that the aspiration and the development of a disciple (usuallystimulated by some senior disciple) has enabled him in thought and consciousnessto reach the periphery of the Ashram; sometimes the spiritual forcing processbrings him to that [91] point prematurely. The disciple is, however, there ; thenext move is (as you say) up to the Master; He must then give the disciple theopportunity to move closer, if the capacity for such a step lies in him.b. The fact of karmic relationship. Many of those who have been given theopportunity to work with me have had some relationship with me over past livesand—because of certain activities—have warranted the opportunity to work in astill closer relationship. This they prove by working off karma. Such wereH.S.D. and S.S.P., neither of whom has completely failed.c. The fact of the need—existent in the world today—for workers. The Masters areperforce driven to use people to carry out certain phases of the exoteric workof service for which they may be fitted but for which they, from other angles,are not ready. Such a one was W.D.B. All these factors necessarily governed my choice, for I too (even though Imay be a Master) am controlled by esoteric Law and must proffer opportunity.Among those chosen there has been much failure, but because consecration anddevotion to either the Hierarchy or Humanity are still to be found in them, theaffiliation with my Ashram still persists, even though in so few cases canpermission to move closer be granted; they are not yet ready to reach a “moreenlightened ashramic position,” as it is called.2. Affiliation with an Ashram subjects the aspirant to intensified stimulation;in many cases it proved impossible for some chelas to handle it. Spiritualenergy pouring into the personality, via the aspirant’s own soul, fostered theemergence of that which was good but also of that which could not be takencloser into the Ashram itself. The undesirable qualities had to be eliminated.(Such were S.C.P. and L.U.T.) This stimulation cannot be avoided and is one ofthe tests of an accepted disciple’s fitness for “ashramic sharing.” Perfection[92] is not looked for or expected, but certain personality faults of pride,temper and an undisciplined nature must at least be controlled.3. A dislike of criticism eliminated others from the group. They could not standthe exposure of their faults, either to themselves or to the group. They knewcertain tendencies existed but not how serious they were; when I attempted tohelp them along these lines, resentment only was evoked. In many cases (as Ihave elsewhere told you) the position was taken that praise, commendation andinteresting personal instructions were written by me, but should any criticismbe involved—then A.A.B. was responsible. This was never once the case. In fact,several times I have modified my criticism (or analysis, as I prefer to callit), and once or twice eliminated it altogether at the request of A.A.B., whoknows the Western mind better perhaps than I do. (Such members were I.S.G-L. andD.E.I.)4. Several of the students did not spiritually appreciate the opportunity withwhich they were faced. It was in reality a case of non-recognition, of whichthey were practically unconscious; they remain in this condition, awaitinganother incarnation. (L.D.N-C. was a striking instance of this attitude; anotherwas J.A.C. though he would greatly like to be reinstated. This is not possible;however, had the tenure of life by A.A.B. been better, it might have beenaccomplished. Another of these types was B.S.D.)5. Certain other students regarded “occult obedience” as an infringement oftheir freewill, as did D.A.O. Quite a number of you simply suffered frominertia, and though pleased and excited over the material received from me, inthe group or personal instructions, were too lazy to avail yourselves to thefull of that which was given, and consistently failed to comply with myrequests.It is valuable to note a most significant point of interest: All those whopassed through the gates of death passed to a [93] definitely closerrelationship; they had earned this reward and have availed themselves of thatwhich I had taught them. They are, as you know, C.D.P., K.E.S., D.P.R. Twoothers are today rapidly fitting themselves to follow these three disciples intothe Ashram. They are: B.S.W., who was temporarily side-tracked for a few yearsprior to his death, and G.S.S., whose personality vehicles could not carry thestimulation which reached her via the group. This sensitivity to unduestimulation is a matter easily rectified now; it does not constitute a fault,but only a karmic liability.I have taken the time to say these things so as to make clear to you certainreasons for what may look to you as failure. I am greatly pleased with the workbeing done by some of the eight members who remain truly active. Two of you havefought through great tests and are today very much better servers. They areD.H.B. and R.S.U. One of you, R.S.W., is in danger of side-tracking heractivities but will, I believe, come through the test; it will take her two moreyears to fight through to clarity of vision. To the other eight remaining of theoriginal group I have no comment to make but that of encouragement. They areholding steady, but have enough teaching whereon to work and can take no morestimulation. The majority of them will not be kept waiting for admission to adefinitely more positive penetrating in the Ashram when they pass through thegates of death. H.S.D. for the remainder of her life should work at theattainment of a quiet spirit, and she should also stand by A.A.B. as long asA.A.B. needs her. L.D.O. must attain to a broader point of view in place of herlimited approach to humanity’s problems; she must give up her assurance that thepalliatives and solutions which she suggests are completely right. F.C.D. isdoing well, but he is an old and trained disciple, and about him no anxiety hasbeen needed. The same is true of J.W.K-P.I have not, as you will note, covered the whole ground. I have, however,indicated enough to show my reasons why there is so poor an exoteric showing ofa truly esoteric, inner movement—an inner movement which remains intact eventhough the outer form does not hold together, owing to the weaknesses of itsmembers and the pressure of daily life upon [94] the outer group. All ofyou—from the first admitted to the last who joined the group—are still within myaura or within the aura of the greater Ashram of the Master K.H., and will, I amconfident, remain so. I would remind you also that there are many members of myAshram of whom you know nothing and who came into my Ashram without the help ofA.A.B. You are not the group of major importance. Forget not these otherco-disciples. Some day, when you have established continuity of consciousness,you will know them, for you will consciously meet with them within thering-pass-not of my Ashram. You will know also and discover the reasons for theexperiment with these outer groups which is now being tried by the Hierarchy, ifyou will read with care the teaching upon the externalisation of the Ashram ofSanat Kumara, the Hierarchy.~BROTHERS, AS OF OLD: August-September, 1949The thought constantly enters my mind as to what I can say in order to make thegroup work, group relationships, group identification and group initiation asound, active and factual reality in your minds and in the minds of otheraspirants and disciples. I seek with profound earnestness to make this theme orsubject true and vital, because it is an essentially new esoteric concept and agerm thought which the many aspirants of the world must grasp. At the same timethe aspirant must realise that the ideas are of no real importance to him as anindividual—to you, therefore, as an individual and pledged disciple. As long asyour state of awareness lays emphasis upon the fact of your individuality, thegroup idea cannot take form as a group ideal . The sense of separativeness isstill present. It is a sense which has been laboriously developed—underevolutionary law—from the moment when your soul decided to experiment, toexperience, and to express divinity. Separative effort, separative emotionalreactions and separative materialistic endeavour have been (if I may sounfortunately express it) the spiritual essentials which must perforce precedegroup effort and conscious group relations. [95] The factor entailed, therefore,is a definite “break with the past,” and the entering into a new state ofawareness—an awareness which is fundamentally inclusive and not exclusive.This is a primary platitude of which you are well aware. In most of you thisplatitude remains a mental proposition. You hope some day to arrive at thisbasic sense of inclusiveness which is characteristic of the Hierarchy. Atpresent you do not feel fused, blended and incorporated into the mental, astraland etheric auras of those who form the group of which you know yourself to be apart. I would ask you to study what I have just said with care. Do you like, forinstance, to penetrate into the mental atmosphere of a fellow member, or do youcare to have him penetrate into yours and thus find out what is the content ofyour thought? A major test is here involved, and it is one which you will havesome day to face. Do you, again, like to share your emotional reactions with aco-disciple? Are you interested in his? If so, why? Some day this respondinginterest must prove itself effective, and this must necessarily connoteself-sacrifice in both directions. Do you want or deem it appropriate to have afellow-worker come under the influence of your etheric body and, therefore, ofthe energies which flow through it? And do you want his energies to flow throughyou?These are some of the implications of group work, and for these you must beprepared. The realisation of the inevitability of these necessities will leadyou eventually to a careful scrutiny of your thinking, of your emotionalreactions and of the energies to which you give entrance all the time because(for the first time in your soul’s history) you feel the need to guard yourbrother from the results of your personality reactions; consequently, scientificservice supersedes your hitherto thoughtless and undisciplined activity. I wouldhere point out that at no time do you ever attempt to guard yourself from thepersonality reactions of a co-disciple; you welcome them and absorb themand—whilst dealing with them—you aid the cause of liberation in his life as wellas in your own.The entire subject of group interplay is far deeper and [96] more significantthan you suspect or appreciate; it can be summed up in the words of St. Paul:“No man liveth unto himself.” Feeling, thinking and absorbing the many actuatingand incentive energies constitute a vast process of many interrelations andthis, most aspirants are apt to forget.I suggest that during the coming year you go over your individual instructionsand then—during the course of the year—answer six questions which I willdictate. The purpose of this task (shall I call it this?) is to clarify yourminds as to your problems and opportunity and latent knowledge, gained as theresult of years of work under my tuition; the replies will give to your groupbrothers a sense of relationship with you, a feeling of shared responsibility, arecognition of group assets and group richness (again using a peculiar word) anda realisation of possibility which may greatly strengthen each and all of you.This will close our cycle of instruction. If you avail yourselves of theopportunity for this personal research work, coincident with the post-warperiod, you may find a sudden spiritual deepening and strengthening of yourlife, your spiritual contacts and your group relation; you may also findyourselves in closer rapport with the Ashram, its programme and potency, and youmay likewise discover yourselves being presented with the opportunity to learnin a new and subjective manner, of which I may not speak, until you haveregistered it yourselves. You will thus greatly increase your usefulness tohumanity, to the Ashram, and to me.The Science of Impression (Telepathy and the Etheric Vehicle, Pages 41-57) is ofmajor importance to the group. The time for close attention to yourselves and toyour individual characters is past; group activity should take its place. Bythis I mean the activity of this particular group of disciples in relation to myAshram and in relation to world service.I would like you to do some further thinking upon the theme of our seventhpoint, the externalisation of the Masters’ Ashrams, so that what I hope to sayin the next instruction may mean more to you.Take your group papers and the book Discipleship in the [97] New Age (Vol. I)and run quickly through these two sources of information and then write down:1. Any definitions of an Ashram you may find. There are many.2. A short, tabulated statement as to the unique work which every Ashram carrieson in the outer world through its initiates and disciples and through affiliateddisciples, such as the majority of you. Two or three of you are beyond the stageof affiliation.This assignment need not take you long.My brothers, I am spiritually ambitious for you. I have gathered you into myashramic group and, therefore, into my aura for vitalising, for training and forprotection. My love goes ever out to you and my unifying desire. Will you notaid me in my task? Will you stand with me in the hierarchical endeavour to whichI am pledged and which I have undertaken in consort with the other Masters?There is much that you can do by speech, by pen and by example. Will you not doit—with a simple heart and a single eye for the helping of a deeply sufferingand overburdened humanity.The six questions are intended to summarise and make deeply personal andsignificant in your consciousness the instructions, given during the past fewyears to this group of affiliated disciples. They can be regarded as being putto the disciple by his own soul and will mark—if correctly and creativelyused—the closing of a preliminary cycle and the beginning of a new cycle ofspiritual usefulness and of fresh growth and development.These questions should receive most careful consideration and much seriousreflection, prior to answering. The answers should convey the truth , as thedisciple sees it today and not in the light of his wishful thinking and of hisaspiration; the answers should be written down (so as to focus that truth) withno thought or fear of what other members of the group may think. In an Ashram,my brothers, a man is known as he is ; for this clear knowledge, the members ofthis group (affiliated with my Ashram) should prepare themselves. [98]One suggestion I will make: There are six questions, providing one question,therefore, for consideration each two months during the coming year. Give twomonths to careful consideration, reflection and interior investigation and then,at the end of the second month, formulate your reply.Question 1. From a study of the instructions given by me on your fiveconditioning rays and from a study of yourself in connection with theinformation given:a. Which of your five conditioning rays controls you or which is the mostdominant?b. Which ray should control you and how can you strengthen that control?The answering of this question will require a truthful consideration of yourgood and bad qualities, of your assets as well as your limitations.Question 2. Looking back over the years of instruction, do you feel that youhave definitely advanced upon the Path? If so, upon what grounds do you basethis belief? Could you have made more progress under the circumstances and ifyou have not, what was the reason or reasons?Question 3. In what do you personally feel that your work in the future shouldconsist in the following three relations:a. With your personality, in its particular circumstances and environment, so asto make your daily life more spiritually effective?b. In order to establish a closer contact with your soul, with the sameobjective of effective spiritual living?c. In order to bring about soul and personality at-one-ment and clearlydemonstrate the fact. What do you regard as the present [99] greatest hindranceto this accomplishment?Question 4 . Are you satisfied with the relationship you have established withyour group brothers?a. Do you know them better and love them more than you earlier did? This meansall of them, as a group.b. Along what lines do you feel that you have failed them, if you have, and whatdo you propose to do to rectify the situation?c. In what way do you feel that you have been an asset to the group?These four questions concern largely your ability to live as a soul in yourlittle outer world and have reference primarily to your objective expression.The next two questions concern your subjective relationships.Question 5. What is your attitude towards your Master, Djwhal Khul, as a resultof years of training under His instruction?a. Can you sense my vibration at any time? How do you know the differencebetween my vibration, that of your own soul or the group?b. What effect has the work of the full moon had upon you? Have there been anyresults of that attempted contact and, if so, what are they?c. What should now govern your efforts in relation to your work as my discipleduring the coming remainder of your life?Question 6 . What part in my plans and in the task assigned to my Ashram are youprepared to take? This question concerns both your outer and your inner work ofa practical nature. [100]a. Have you any definite schedule of work outlined in your mind as yourcontribution to the activity of my Ashram?b. If so, what is it and how do you propose to implement it and make iteffective?c. What is the main task of the Ashram at this time? Do you know the type ofassistance—subjective or objective or both—that you could give?This last question goes deeply into your ability to react to impression from meand from the Ashram. I would have you answer it, to the best of your ability,from that angle.Pass on, my disciples, into a closer relation to the Ashram of which I am thefocal point; aim at a closer rapport with your fellow-workers and with me. I amthe director of your work. That this relationship may prove the signalachievement of the coming year for each and all of you is my earnest wish.~MY BROTHERS OF LONG ASSOCIATION: November-December 1949In my last instruction to you I gave you only a very little teaching anent groupwork, though there were several significant hints if you had the intuition tograsp them. I have, however, given you much over the years; yet, when I lookback over those years, I am forced to realise how relatively little you haveprofited by this teaching upon group work, though many of you have profited muchby the personal instructions I gave you. Only sixteen of you are left out of anoriginal fifty aspirants to discipleship; I think you yourselves would be thefirst to admit that there is little group interplay and no group enterpriseanimating those few of you who remain steadfast.Certain of you (F.C.D., J.W.K-P., R.V.B., P.G.C., R.S.U., and R.S.W.) areactively working in relation to my plans, though those plans are not in realitymine, but simply the required cooperation in hierarchical endeavour. The rest of[101] you are engulfed in the processes of daily living or else too tired to bemore active than you already are, and for that condition of the personality Ihave no criticism.It is necessary for you to remember that this group effort which I initiatedwith the assistance of some of the older and more experienced Masters, is by nomeans completed; it may be (and probably is) an experiment in this particularlife for you, but next life may evoke from you a new attitude and a deepercomprehension of what is subjectively going on. It has been your lack ofcomprehension and of understood opportunity which has distressed me andbewildered A.A.B. Like all disciples, she had at first to work in the dark; sheknew nothing in her physical brain consciousness of the Masters or the Hierarchywhen she started to serve, but she continued to serve for many years tilldiscovery rewarded her or (should I perhaps say?) recovery of ancient links andknowledge clarified her vision and her position in regard to truth. Slowly shenow withdraws into that service which will (within the Ashram) enable K.H. to domore deeply spiritual work in collaboration with the Christ. It was to train herand thus enable her to do this that she undertook, alone and without my help ,to found and organise the Arcane School; it gave her much needed training andexperience and enabled her to demonstrate the quality of the teaching and thatesoteric psychology which is the major task in each Ashram and particularly inthe second ray Ashram.I would like to say at this point to all of you who have remained steadfast,even if perforce inactive, that I would ask you as life proceeds and you faceeventually and inevitably the discarding of the vehicle, to hold increasingly onto your knowledge of the Hierarchy and thus to pass over to the other side withcomplete dedication to the hierarchical Plan. This is not simply a suggestion onmy part; it is an attempt on my part to call to your attention the concept of aspiritual continuity of knowledge and of a rightly oriented attitude. Thus timewill not be lost; you can—if you so choose, each and all of you—attain a truecontinuity of consciousness and it is one of the factors which will serve tohold this group of disciples together. [102]There are some things which I must say to you as this will be my lastinstruction on the theme of group work. It is not necessary for me to say muchmore upon the subject. I would start with some questions. Do you ever think withrecognition of those who are no longer working with us? For instance, is D.A.O.ever in your minds? Do you ever think of S.C.P., of W.D.B., of J.A.C., or ofthat expert worker for the Hierarchy, L.D.N-C? I would guarantee that theyseldom enter your mind. Yet they are still an integral part of this group whichhad the task and the responsibility of being one of the first groups (not by anymeans the only one, however) to attempt to make the first steps towards theexternalisation of the Ashrams of the Hierarchy.One of the major recognitions which is essential to the spiritual aspirant isthat the Hierarchy is completely unable—under the law of the freedom of thehuman soul—to work in the world of men without those representative groups whichcan “step down” the hierarchical quality of energy so that the average man (withhis average vibration and quality) can find in himself a point of response. Itwas for this specific reason that I engineered this experiment in group workwith all of you in order to test out the human capacity in its higher bracketsto respond to this much higher quality. It has not worked out as I had hoped,but owing to the fact that all of you are—from our point of view—of the samespiritual generation and that the difference in age was in no case more thantwenty-five years at the outside (and believe me, my brother, I forget physicalplane ages!) you will all return together to continue with this inevitableexperience.In the coming cycle of service, however, you will not have the association thatyou have had during this life with A.A.B. and F.B., who will then be working inthe Ashrams of their own Masters, as will also F.C.D. and R.S.U. Do not inferfrom the above statement that contact and mutual interplay in world service willnot then be present; it will. The union of all the Ashrams under the spiritualPlan is complete and the interlocking relationships will be increasinglypresent. But neither of these four people will be working in my Ashram and forthis I would have you prepare. Remember nevertheless [103] that personal karmashave been established and are based upon many unexpected relationships, andthere is much personal karma in this group of over fifty people; this wasnecessarily so; otherwise little personal relationships would have beenpossible, which may present a difficult point for you to understand.I would like to arrest any tendency to consider one Ashram as superior toanother. The forty-nine Ashrams which constitute the Hierarchy in this planetaryperiod are some of them fully active; some are in process of formation, and someare, as yet, in a totally embryonic condition, awaiting the “focussing ability”of some initiate who is today preparing for the fifth initiation. Essentiallyand potentially all the Ashrams are equal, and their quality is not competitive;all of them differ as to their planned activity—an activity which is all part ofa carefully formulated hierarchical activity. This you need most carefully toremember. The devotion of a disciple to some particular Master is of noimportance to that Master or to His ashramic group. It is not devotion orpredilection or any personality choice which governs the formation of a Master’sgroup. It is ancient relationships, the ability to demonstrate certain aspectsof life to demanding humanity and a definite ray expression of quality whichdetermine the hierarchical placement of aspirants in an Ashram. This willperhaps be a new thought to you and is responsible for the reason why A.A.B. hasnever emphasised concentration on some one of the known Masters. She has alwaysbeen aware that each central Ashram has associated with it six other Ashramswhich are steadily and constantly being organised to meet planetary need. Youwill note that I did not say “human need,” for the needs of the planet which theHierarchy has to meet embrace more than those of the fourth kingdom in nature. Iwould have you ponder on these points.It would be of benefit to you also to consider the Masters’ Ashrams asexpressions of the highest type of constructively functioning groups. Thereexists amongst its personnel a complete unity of purpose and an utter dedication(without any reservations, as far as the disciple involved is concerned) to thefurthering of the immediate ashramic enterprise. The [104] position of theMaster at the centre of the group has no relation to that of a teacher at thecentre of a group of learners and devotees, such as we have learned to recognisein this Piscean Age. He is the centre simply because through the quality of Hisvibration, through karmic ancient relationship and through the invocative demandof disciples, initiates and some aspirants, He has gathered them together inorder to further the ends of His ashramic enterprise; He has not gathered themtogether in order to teach them or to prepare them for initiation as hashitherto been taught. Aspirants and disciples prepare themselves for theprocesses of initiation by becoming initiated into the mysteries of divinitythrough discipline, meditation and service . You need to bear in mind that aMaster of an Ashram may, for instance, attract to Him other Masters of equalrank as His Own. I have five Masters working with me in my Ashram. It would beof value to you if you considered the factors which hold an Ashram together andwhich establish its unity. The major ones, and those which you can understand,are as follows:1. The most important capacity of a Master of an Ashram is that He has earnedthe right to communicate directly with the Council at Shamballa and thus toascertain at first hand the immediate evolutionary task which the Hierarchy isundertaking. He is not called Master by the initiates in His Ashram; He isregarded as the Custodian of the Plan, and this is based on His ability to “facethe greater Light which shines in Shamballa.” It is the Plan which gives thekeynote to the activities of any Ashram at any particular time, during anyparticular cycle.2. This unanimity of purpose produces a very close subjective relationship, andeach member of the Ashram is occupied with making his fullest possiblecontribution to the task in hand. Personalities do not enter in. You willremember how some years ago I told you that the personality vehicles are everleft outside the Ashram—speaking symbolically. This means that the subtlerbodies of the personality have perforce to follow the same rules as the physicalbody—they are left outside. Remember also that [105] the Ashrams exist upon theplane of buddhi or of the intuition. The joint undertaking and the unitedadhering to the desired and arranged cyclic technique binds all members of theAshram into one synthetic whole; there is therefore no possible controversy orany emphasis upon individual ideas, because no personality vibratory quality canpenetrate in the periphery or the aura of an Ashram.3. The planning and the assignment of tasks connected with the enterprise inhand is carried forward through the medium of an ashramic, reflectivemeditation, initiated by the Custodian of the Plan. The Master of an Ashram doesnot say: “Do this” or “Do that.” Together, in unison and in deep reflection theplans unfold, and each disciple and initiate sees occultly where he is neededand where—at any given moment—he must place his cooperative energy. Note mywording here. The members of an Ashram, however, do not sit down for a jointmeditation. One of the qualities, developed through ashramic contact, is theability to live always within the field of intuitive perception—a field whichhas been created, or a sphere of energy which has been generated, by the unitedpurpose, the combined planning and the concentrated energy of the Hierarchy. Ananalogy (but only an analogy, however) would be to regard this field ofreflecting, reflective and reflected energies as resembling the brain of a humanbeing; this brain reflects the impacts of telepathic activity, the sensoryperceptions and the knowledges gained in the three worlds; reflection then setsin in relation to the mental processes which are synchronised with the brain,and then follows the impartation of these reflections to the outside world. Theashramic reflective meditation is an integral part of the constantly developingperception of the disciple-initiate, and it (in its turn) is a part of the wholehierarchical reflective meditation. This latter is based upon inspiration (inthe occult sense) from Shamballa. The moment a disciple can share in thisconstant unremitting meditation or reflection without its interfering with hisservice and his other lines of thought, he becomes what is called “a disciplewho shall no more go out.” [106]4. Another factor productive of group unity and synchronous precision in workingis the complete freedom of the Ashram from any spirit of criticism. There is notendency among its personnel to be critical and no interest whatsoever in theouter, personal lives of the members, should they be amongst those functioningin the three worlds. Criticism, as seen among men, simply is a mode ofemphasising the lower self and deflects the attitude to the material aspects ofa person’s life. There is necessarily clear vision among the members of anAshram; they know each other’s capacities and limitations and they know,therefore, where they can complement each other and together create and presenta perfect team in world service.5. One other factor I will mention among the many possible: The members of anAshram are all in the process of demonstrating love and pure reason, and theyare—at the same time—focussing themselves in the Will aspect of divinity. Thisstatement may mean little to you at present but it is fundamentally the factorwhich creates the higher antahkarana, uniting the Hierarchy and Shamballa. Thismakes the planetary purpose of so much importance.These are the major factors which produce group unity; they have, as results,telepathic rapport and intuitive perception; but these are effects and notcauses and are the product of the measure of the attained group unity.You can see, therefore, the scientific reason I had when I urged you in pastyears to have a group enterprise, for it is a major unifying factor, and theinner Ashram with which you are affiliated stands to you (at your particularpoint of development) as Shamballa stands to the Hierarchy—from the angle ofdynamic inspiration. Had you done this (which you did not) the group would nothave fallen apart—as it has done. Had you eliminated criticism, the essentialunity would have been strengthened. One of the reasons I had for the completefrankness and so-called exposure of your individual weakness and limitations tothe group as a whole was to train you in the light of pure perception whichknows the reason [107] why and sees with clarity the ends in view. Where trueperception exists, criticism is automatically eliminated.Modern groups (and groups form a large part of every field of thought andactivity) are usually composed of people possessing some basic idea upon whichthey are all agreed and which they are trying to express through the medium oftheir clashing personalities and, frequently, in obedience to some leader orperson of more powerful mentality than that of the majority, and in order toexploit and use the methods which they regard as essential to success. There istherefore little true unity, and often what there is is based on expediency orgood manners.Everywhere, however, the newer type of groups are slowly being gatheredtogether. Have you ever realised (I seek here to make you think and reason) thata group composed entirely of people upon the same ray, and who were also atexactly the same point in evolution, would be relatively futile and useless?Such a group would lack dynamic—the dynamic which comes into expression whenmany and different ray qualities meet and combine. When you speak of an Ashrambeing a first or a second ray Ashram—to mention only two out of the seven—it isessential that you bear in mind that though its members may have the same basicsoul ray, they are apt to be found on one or other of the six subsidiarysub-rays; there is also a constant shifting of people as they make true progressfrom a minor ray to a major ray or (for service reasons) on to a differentsub-ray of their own ray; this is a point which is very apt to be forgotten. Itis wise to realise that an Ashram is composed of disciples and initiates of alldegrees. It is this interplay of diverse elements that enriches an Ashram andtends inevitably to successful service in the three worlds.I am anxious to see the group, with which I have been undertaking an occultexperiment for the Hierarchy, hold together. When I say this, I refer not onlyto the few of you who are now active (and perhaps patting yourselves on the backfor your steadfastness!), but also to the inactive members, to those likewisewho of their own freewill dropped out, those whom perforce I myself had to drop,and those also [108] who are functioning upon the other side of the veil. I haveasked A.A.B. to send each of you a complete list of all who were in the earliergroups as well as those who were or are in the reorganised group. The names willbe sent to you without comment and without addresses. I would ask you on one dayeach month—the day of the full moon—to sit down and mention each of these namesof your co-disciples in the light, sending out light and love to one and all.This will strengthen the relation of you all to each other and it will alsocreate an energy body—an etheric body—for the entire subjective group and willintegrate them closely as time goes on, restoring those who broke away andstrengthening those who unfortunately proved themselves to be weak.This entire problem of group integrity and personnel-synthesis (if I may coinsuch a phrase) is at this time presenting a major problem to the Hierarchy. Itis based, as you see, on the point in evolution which humanity has reached.There are many millions today—and this may surprise you—who have alreadyachieved a definite measure of permanent personality integration. They arepeople in the fullest sense of the term although they may yet be lacking anycontact with the soul or any desire for such contact. This means that they arerelatively dominant men and women in their own setting, environment or milieu;they therefore constitute a problem in this preparatory cyclic era because theyrefuse—usually quite unconsciously—to form part of any group; they seek ever theposition of leader. This is true of spiritual aspirants just as much as it istrue of workers and group leaders in any other phase of human thought andprocedure.Therefore we ask: How can we create extra-ashramic groups out of aspirants anddisciples who primarily value spiritual status, kudos or an elevated position?We cannot. All we can do is to train aspirants in recognised group requirements.We must also point out to them the dangers of mental pride, detail to them theirpersonality limitations and the difficulties of true spiritual leadership, andthen plead with them to mind their own business where each other is concernedand ask them to serve the human race; this of course means, incidentally,serving the Hierarchy and thus [109] demonstrate their ability to work within anAshram. Disciples—in the earlier stages—are apt to be didactic; they like toexpress in words their profound understanding of occult truth and thereby, inreality, establish their superiority over non-esoteric students, and in so doing(again incidentally) antagonise those they otherwise could help. They like toshow their unique familiarity with hierarchical principles but, as they are notyet living those principles, they hinder more than they can help; at the sametime, through self-discovery, they learn much thereby. They believe that inexpressing their knowledge of petty and unimportant details anent the lives andmethods of the Masters, a high point of spiritual understanding and developmentis thereby indicated. This is not by any means the case. In the last analysis,it indicates a superficial sense of false values, and seventy per cent of theirinformation is wrong and of no importance.I feel it necessary to emphasise the unimportance of their claims to informationbecause the work of the Masters and Their freedom to serve humanity as Theydesire have been greatly hindered by these foolish thoughtforms and by thepreconceived ideas of well-intentioned aspirants. The Masters very seldomresemble the theories, the pictures and the information which is so frequentlycirculated by the average aspirant. This whole business of occult gossip and ofmisinformation governs the majority of the many little occult groups.Until groups are formed which consist of disciples and senior aspirants whopossess self-ascertained knowledge and who are capable of correct interpretationof the occult facts, and who are also endowed with the rare group virtue ofsilence, we shall not have the desired externalisation of the Ashrams. I wouldhave you think on these matters and prepare yourselves for a better and sounderappreciation, plus a more adequate meeting of hierarchical requirements in yournext incarnation.And now, my brothers and co-workers, I leave you to work, serve and study; bythat last word, I mean reflect and think. I would commend to your consideration(because you cannot as yet think truly constructively, but only imaginatively)[110] the place in this hierarchical planning, adjusting and aligning that myAshram should take and of your part in it, as an individual and as a group,above all. I ask your aid so that one of the newest Ashrams may play a good partin the group of Ashrams, gathered around that of the One Who was my Master, theChohan K.H.There has been much pressure on you this year; I have seen and noted it; thegroup—as a group—has done better this year than for some years past; and I haveseen a deepening of devotion and a strengthening of conviction. Failures, wherethey may be found, need not persist, for the group love can offset them all;personality weaknesses, mistakes and faults are overlooked and forgotten in theurgency of human need; they do not even penetrate into the Ashram. I would askyou to remember this, and with humility in your hearts, persistence in yourefforts and love to all men, pass on your way.Let love play its part in all your lives and all your inter-relations as it mustand does in the Hierarchy; look upon the Ashram to which you are affiliated as aminiature Hierarchy and model your efforts upon what you have learned anent theHierarchy; count all things but loss unless they are productive along the lineof service to humanity, and become increasingly factual in your attitude to alldisciples and to the Hierarchy. The coming cycle is momentous in its offering ofopportunity, and I would have you—again as individuals and as a group—measure upto this chance. Fix your eyes on human need and your hand in mine (if I mayspeak thus to you in symbols) and go forward with me to greater influence anddeeper usefulness."},{"pageContent":"SECTION TWO — TEACHINGS ON MEDITATIONPART I[113] In continuing the instructions on the Science of Meditation, I wouldremind you that we are building upon the same fundamental truths which have beenearlier laid down (in Discipleship in the New Age, Vol. I ), and that our goalsand objectives likewise remain the same. Our immediate concern is the bringingabout a group unity rooted in love, and this requires the awakening of the heartcentre into greater potency. In this connection, let me repeat what I earliersaid, for it makes a fitting preface to what I shall ask you to do:“Only from the heart centre can stream, in reality, those lines of energy whichlink and bind together. For this reason, I shall give you for your groupmeditation a form which will stimulate the heart into action, linking the heartcentre (between the shoulder blades) to the head centre through the medium ofthe heart centre which is found within the head centre (the thousand-petalledlotus). This heart centre, when adequately radiatory and magnetic will relateyou afresh to each other and to all the world. This again—when connected by anact of the spiritual will to the solar plexus centre—will help to produce thattelepathic interplay which is so much to be desired and which is soconstructively useful to the spiritual Hierarchy—provided it is establishedwithin a group of pledged disciples, dedicated to the service of humanity. Theycan then be trusted.” (Page 87)The activity of the heart centre never demonstrates in connection withindividuals. This is a basic fact. What devastates most disciples is the solarplexus ability (when purified [114] and consecrated) to identify itself withindividuals. The heart centre cannot react, except under group impetus, grouphappiness or unhappiness, and other group relations.The following diagrammatic form illustrates the procedure which I suggest thatyou follow:[Image00004.jpg]There are two points of vital light within the solar plexus centre, which makesthis centre of dominant importance and a clearing house for the centres belowthe diaphragm to those above it. One of these points of light is connected withthe lower psychic and astral life, and the other is brought into livingness bythe inflow from the head centre. I would here remind you that the centres abovethe diaphragm have only one vital point of energy, whilst the centres below thesolar plexus also have only one, but that the solar plexus itself has two pointsof dynamic energy—one most ancient and awakened, being expressive of the life ofthe astral or lower psychic body, and the other waiting to be brought intoconscious activity by the soul. When this has happened, the awakening to thehigher issues of life makes the disciple sensitive to the higher “psychic giftwaves” (as the Tibetan occultists call them) of the spiritual world.All this is a somewhat new concept for the average esotericist and theosophist,and is one of the new items of information which disciples (in preparation forinitiation) are [115] told. This truth lies behind the method of meditationwhich I shall seek to give you, and which is divided into two parts—one aspector technique will cover approximately the first six months, and the other thesecond six months. This dual meditation is a group meditation and will haveprimarily a group effect. This fact must be most carefully recognised by eachdisciple.I would have you ponder most earnestly upon this imparted information. Themeditation which I wish to assign will be divided into two parts:Stage I. A stage wherein there is a lifting of the energy of the heart centre tothe head by means of directed, controlled aspiration—deliberately stimulated,mentally appreciated, and emotionally propelled. I am here choosing my wordswith care for their symbolic import.Stage II. Next, the deliberate dispatch of spiritual energy to the solar plexus,through an act of the will; this will result in the awakening of the hithertoquiescent point of force which lies behind (or rather within) the active andawakened centre.It will be apparent to you that the first stage is occupied with what isregarded esoterically as the “withdrawal to the centre of inspiration” and it isto this withdrawal that I call you all today, prior to the definite and detailedgroup work—later to be outlined. Under cyclic law there are periods of outgoingand of withdrawing, of progressing in service towards the periphery of activityand also of a conscious abstraction of the consciousness from the outer circleand its centring again at the very heart of life. It is to this retreatingwithin that I summon you—a retreat which must be continued and consciously helduntil the next Full Moon of May. You might regard it as the individual phase ofalignment and of preparation to which each of you is called, and called prior toparticipation in the group meditation with which you will [116] be occupied forthe remainder of the year, after May. Stage II and its successful issue will belargely dependent upon the success achieved during Stage I.Stage I itself is divided into two parts, and to these I now call yourattention. The first part of Stage I is a short dynamic meditation, carried outevery morning with the greatest regularity. The second part is a reflectiveprocess or cultivated recognition which will serve to condition your day’sactivity. This conditioning attitude should be one of a constant recollection ofpurpose and objective, and a process of what has been called “intentionalliving.” It connotes the effort to live consciously at the centre and then towork outward from there in radiatory, magnetic activity. I am not here speakingsymbolically but literally for it is all a question of the focus ofconsciousness. If this attitude can be constantly held until the Full Moon ofMay, the individual seeds within the group periphery (could we symbolically callit the seed pod or sheath?) will become living and potent units of energy(spiritual energy) and the succeeding period of group interrelation and groupactivity will be correspondingly potent. In the furtherance of this process,leading to radiatory and magnetic living, the method suggested is as follows:STAGE I1. Reflective alignment of soul and personality, using the creative imaginationin the process. This is a “feeling” or astral activity.2. Assumed relation of solar plexus, heart and head, and the focus of theassuming consciousness to be in the region of the ajna centre. This is donementally.3. When this has been achieved and realised, there follows next theconcentration of aspiration and of thought in the heart centre, imagining it tobe just between the shoulder blades. It must be recognised that theconcentration of thought energy is definitely there.4. Then follows the conscious and pictorial (or imaginative) withdrawal of theheart’s aspiration, life and [117] devotion into the centre above the head (thethousand-petalled lotus), and its conscious focussing there.5. When this stage has been reached, and the conscious recognition of place andactivity is being gently yet surely held, then sound the Sacred Word, OM, verysoftly three times, breathing out and towards:a. The Soul.b. The Hierarchy.c. Humanity.These three recognised factors now constitute a definite and linked triangle offorce.6. Then say with heartfelt intent (consider the significance of those two words)the invocation which I gave you in my communication in September, 1939:The sons of men are one and I am one with them.I seek to love, not hate;I seek to serve and not exact due service;I seek to heal, not hurt.~Let pain bring due reward of light and love.Let the soul control the outer form and life and all events,And bring to light the love which underlies the happenings of the time.~Let vision come and insight.Let the future stand revealed.Let inner union demonstrate and outer cleavages be gone.Let love prevail.Let all men love.7. Endeavour throughout the day to continue holding this recollection steady andwork always in due remembrance of the morning’s meditation.This activity should take only a few minutes, but if it is carried out with afully awakened consciousness and with the [118] most carefully focussedattention, the results may be most potent and effective—far more so than you maythink. The meditation should take less than ten minutes, after you havesucceeded in familiarising yourself with the process; firm foundations will thusbe laid for the group work and the group meditation, which I intend to give youin May, when I will give you your personal and group instructions.At the time of the Full Moon each month—dating from the time that you receivethese instructions and until further notice—I would ask you to work as follows:1. Group yourselves, all twenty-four of you, symbolically, pictorially andimaginatively around your Teacher, and—with Him—face the East, standing in asemi-circle slightly behind Him.2. Then stretching out your hands in blessing, say together with solemn, voicedintent the formula or Mantram of Unification, beginning “The sons of men areone,” which you have been using each morning in your personal meditation. Throwthe power of your focussed thought and will into and behind the words.3. Stand then together in the light which streams ever from the East and see itpouring through the Master to each of you, entering by the head centre, passingfrom thence to the heart centre, and then from the heart it is directed by anact of the focussed will— expressed and propelled forth consciously—to thequiescent point of dim light within the solar plexus.4. Then, withdrawing again to the head centre, endeavour consciously to see thethree centres (head, heart and solar plexus) linked together so that the headsof all the group members are thinking as one and the hearts of the group membersare loving as one. Your aspiration also (through the spiritual awakening of thesolar plexus) will then surge upwards as one spontaneous movement. This will indue time create a magnetic field of light and life, within which the New Groupof World Servers will live, mature and come to fruition.[119] Keep the whole process, my brother, very simple and uncomplicated in yourmind. If you will follow the above instructions with the simplicity of a littlechild, you will bring about a situation wherein work will be possible. Look notfor results. Yours is to do the outlined work and this, when rightly done, makesthe due result inevitable. But as I told you before, “it is the inner life ofreflection and the outer life of expressed love which will determine the successof the needed group relation and the potency of its future work” in the serviceof humanity.PART IIIn the last instruction, I started you on the first part of the new meditation.The completed meditation involves the process of relating heart and head andthen—by an act of the will—linking up both with the quiescent point within thesolar plexus—that point of which nothing has as yet been taught (though thenecessity for such a point was obvious in the work of transferring energy) butwhich is of vital significance in all preparation for initiation.That is as far as I took you in the last meditation but to it must be added theindividual meditation which will aid in group integration and in the unfoldmentof the individual disciple.You will have noted, I am sure, that in the meditation assigned for daily use, Idid not carry it forward to where the will is exerted and the energy in the headis driven to the quiescent centre in the solar plexus. You will have noted alsothat at the time of the Full Moon and in group formation, plus direct contactwith myself, you were permitted together to link heart, head and solar plexus.Once a month and then only through the protective magnetic field of the grouplife can you complete the meditation.The Full Moon work will remain as already assigned for the remainder of theyear, but we will complete the meditation and I will now outline for you StageII in the group meditation. The first half should now be so familiar to you thatit will be automatic in its doing and should take only a [120] few minutes tocomplete. It is in the nature of a preface to the one I am now seeking toassign. It should leave each of you (if carrying it forward to a rightconclusion) with the consciousness and heart energy focussed in the head. Theactivity of the true spiritual man has not been aroused, and when it is, theeffect on the downflow of energy from the head centre will be threefold:1. The awakened point in the solar plexus will become extremely active and—ifthe work is correctly done—it will make that point also exceedingly magnetic,gathering all the energies of all the centres below the diaphragm (except theone at the base of the spine), and this involves the sacral centre and otherlittle focal points of energy, up into the solar plexus. There they must be heldsteady until such time as the man is ready to deal with them occultly.2. The unawakened or quiescent point of light in the solar plexus comes slowlyto life and to a state of new vibratory activity. Its magnetic field steadilyincreases and widens until it contacts the periphery of the magnetic fieldsurrounding the heart centre.3. When the two above stages are completed, then comes a lengthy process oftransference. The solar plexus is the clearing house between the lower energiesand the higher. This process is in itself dual:a. The two points within the solar plexus field of activity become definitelyrelated to each other, and the lower sacral and material energies aretransferred into the hitherto quiescent point of light, now awakened andintensifying in quality and potency.b. The concentrated energies in the new centre within the periphery of the solarplexus are then lifted by an act of the will into the heart centre and fromthence to the head.In this triple transference of the lower energies to the solar plexus, to theheart and finally to the head, we have a [121] pictorial and symbolicpresentation within the life experience of the disciple of the interrelation andeventual transference of energy from the personality (symbolised by the solarplexus) to the soul (symbolised by the heart centre) and from the soul to theMonad (symbolised by the head centre). These correspondences are of value asthey are an argument for the factual nature of the process and they also enablethe aspirant to grasp somewhat the nature of the undertaking to which he iscommitted. Certain aspects of relationship, therefore, emerge into theconsciousness of the disciple and at this point in his training the followingfour relations are of major importance:1. The relation of the energies, found below the diaphragm and corresponding tothe personality life (motivated by desire), and the higher energies found abovethe diaphragm and motivated by the soul. These are as yet in the case of theaverage aspirant, practically entirely quiescent and only become a realisedactivity as the soul establishes increasing control over the disciple.2. The relation between the two points within the solar plexus itself. These aresymbolic also of the personality-soul relationship. One point is awakened, as tothe lower life of man; the other point is awakening, as in the case of theaspirant, or is totally awakened as is the case of the pledged disciple, priorto the second initiation.3. The relation between the solar plexus and the heart. This is of greatimportance and serves to clarify the mind of the aspirant because it is symbolicagain of the immediate present problem of the personality and the soul.4. The relation between the ajna centre (between the eyebrows) and thethousand-petalled lotus. When these two centres are correctly related to eachother, then the man can take the third initiation at which time the potency ofthe Monad can begin to make its presence felt, linking heart and head and solarplexus.[122] There is an intermediate stage in which the heart and the ajna centrebecome aligned and related. This stage is omitted from the enumeration givenabove owing to the fact that it is of a sevenfold nature and the method oftransition and of transference is dependent upon the ray quality. One new itemof information comes naturally here. The throat centre is not included in theserelationships between centres above the diaphragm as it is to them what thesacral centre is to the solar plexus—a point of pure creative activity, set inmotion by the interplay of the other centres but particularly is the throatcentre energised and actuated eventually by the sacral centre itself. It is aneffect or result of relation more than anything else.Three other items of interest might here be mentioned. First, the throat centreis brought into real activity by the direct action of the soul, via the headcentre, in conjunction with the raising of the energy of the sacral centresimultaneously. This is analogous to the fact that the solar plexus is broughtinto real constructive usefulness by the direct action of the soul, via theheart centre. That is why people who work creatively usually have first raypersonalities at the time that the throat centre becomes dynamically active forthe first time. Secondly, the solar plexus centre is awakened by the inflow ofenergy of a dual nature—the energies of the heart and the head, workingsynchronously. This is a correspondence to the dual energy which constitutes theessential nature of the soul—atma-buddhi, or spiritual will and spiritual love.The third soul energy, manas or mental energy is related more directly to thethroat centre. Thirdly, it might be stated that the awakening of the centre atthe base of the spine is the result of an act of the will directed from the headand resulting in the elevation of all the energies to the head, just as thesolar plexus was awakened and energy was carried to the heart—also by an act ofthe will. The energy of the solar plexus, that great clearing house forpersonality energy, must be carried always to the heart.Here I would again caution you and call attention to my earlier statement thatall stimulation of the solar plexus and all focus upon that centre carries withit definite danger, and [123] disciples are enjoined to exercise wise controlover the emotional nature. A decentralised attitude as regards personalityreactions and a steadily deepening love of humanity will safeguard disciples atthis stage—the stage of seeking to fit themselves for the first or the secondinitiation.We will now continue with the second phase of the meditation. It was carried tothe point wherein you were asked to say as a soul the great Mantram ofUnification.STAGE II1. Repeat rapidly Stage I, taking not more than five minutes in so doing. Liftyour consciousness and relate the head and the heart. Repeat thoughtfully themantram which eventually leads to the realisation of unity.2. With the focus of the consciousness then in the head, summon the Will to youraid and by an act of the will carry the energy focussed in the head to the solarplexus. To facilitate this process, you can use the following formula:a. I am the soul. And also love I am. Above all else I am both will and fixeddesign.b. My will is now to lift the lower self into the light divine. This light I am.c. Therefore, I must descend to where the lower self awaits my coming. Thatwhich desires to lift and that which cries aloud for lifting are now at-one.Such is my will.Whilst saying these mantric words (taken from a very ancient disciples’ manual)vision pictorially the process of focussing—demanding—descending and at-one-ing.3. Pause here and endeavour to feel and sense the initiatory vibration orembryonic interplay which is being established between the awakened and theawakening points within the solar plexus. This can be done, but it involves anact of slow concentration.4. Then sound the OM twice from the head centre, [124] knowing yourself to bethe soul which is breathing it forth. Believe this sound, carried on the breathof will and love, as capable of stimulating the solar plexus in the right wayand able to transmute the lower energies so that they will be pure enough to becarried first of all to the awakening point and from that point eventually tothe heart centre.5. As you vision the energies of the solar plexus being carried up the spine tothe heart centre (situated, as you know, between the shoulder blades) I wouldask you to breathe out the OM again into the solar plexus but this time, havingdone so, draw the focussed energy up the spine towards the head. The vibrationthus established will carry the energy to the heart, for it has to pass throughthat centre in the spine on its way to the head. In the early stages that is asfar as it may go, but later it will pass through the heart, leaving its duequota of energy, and finally reach the head centre.6. Then focus yourself in the heart, believing that a triangle of energy hasbeen formed between the head, the heart and the solar plexus. Vision it then ascomposed of the energy of light, something resembling a triangle of neon light.The colour of this neon light so-called will be dependent upon the ray of thesoul.7. Then again repeat the Mantram of Unification, beginning “The sons of men areone . . .”8. Standing, therefore, in the centre of the heart see the energy of your groupbrothers as the radiating spokes of a great wheel of light. This wheel hastwenty-four spokes and at the centre of the wheel, like the hub of the wheel,can be found your Master (D.K.). Then slowly with love, mention aloud the namesof each of your group brothers, not omitting yourself.9. Then see this wheel as actively moving and scintillating, and thus servinghumanity through its focussed radiation. This radiation is the radiation oflove. All the above is purely symbolic but carried out as a [125] visualisationprocess for some months—consistently and consciously—it will create a state ofmind and of awareness which will be enduring because “as a man thinketh, so ishe.”10. Then close with the new Invocation and also with the Gayatri, with itsemphasis upon one’s duty.OM . . . .OM . . . . OMThis meditation process is relatively simple if you familiarise yourself withits stages for a few weeks. Much of the above is explanatory in nature and canbe dispensed with when you can follow the process automatically.I will now proceed to give you each your personal instructions and individualmeditation. This meditation should be done at some time of the day which is notthe time chosen for the group meditation. I do not want the two meditations donetogether at the same time, for I do not want your personality problems and yourpossible glamours to be interjected into the group consciousness. Beware ofdoing this because the task of each of you is hard enough without beingcomplicated by the personal problems of some distressed brother in the group. Ingiving you your personal instructions, I shall speak with complete frankness andshall not spare you either praise or blame. If you resent what I may say, thenit will simply indicate the power of your personality to react unfavourably tothe truth and will consequently point out to you an area of blindness and ofweakness in your consciousness. You will be thereby the gainer and will be ableto grasp somewhat more clearly the nature of the battle which you have to fight.PART IIIAs individuals, many of you have used regularly (and profited thereby) themeditation which I gave you thus far in this series of instructions. Butspeaking generally, the group as a whole has not given as much attention andthought to the processes outlined in the two parts of the one [126] meditation,as I had hoped and asked. I would ask you, therefore, to renew your activityalong this line from now until May, when—if you work with tension and achieveresults—I can give you another meditation which will climax the work done andbring another centre into activity. There is little that I can do with you untilthis meditation work has been patiently and regularly done and producedeffective results—from my point of view. I shall not be able to give you anothermeditation unless you strive afresh, and together, at the daily process outlinedby me.This meditation is one of the most important of the steps I shall ever ask youto take in these early preparatory stages of your work. It must precede the moredefinite training which may be possible if you persevere in the work outlined. Iwould remind you that this is my last effort with you in this incarnation and onthe physical plane. You have put your hand to the plough and there is no turningback for any of you, but the time factor is determined by each of you and not byme. There may be times in the process of training you and preparing you forinitiation when you may temporarily fail to understand the reasons for therequests I may make and for the requirements presented to you. Forget not thatthe aspirant to the Mysteries proceeds blindly in the early stages; only afterthe third initiation do the scales fall from his eyes. Therefore, followobediently (though voluntarily) my requests as I endeavour to teach you theancient rules.Will you also, at this point, study anew the teaching I gave in the earlierinstructions on the theme of Visualisation and explained why it is the secret ofall true meditation work in its earlier stages? I seek not to repeat, but thatteaching is needed by you at this stage. (Discipleship in the New Age, Vol. I.Pages 89-91.)In connection with your Full Moon work, I seek to change the process which hasbeen followed by you for so long—the process of entering my study and therecontacting me. I will give you another symbolic process which will follow fivestages: [127]1. At the time of the Full Moon (covering five days) picture to yourselves anocean of blue and upon the horizon can be seen slowly rising a blazing sun.2. Picture yourself as throwing yourself into the ocean, free of allencumbrances, worries, anxieties and cares, and as swimming towards a rowboat,lying midway between you and the rising Sun. As you swim, you become aware ofyour group brothers, also swimming in the same direction. You recognise, knowand love each other.3. Then visualise yourself as climbing into the boat. When all of the group arein, then see yourselves as each grasping an oar, and together, rhythmically andsteadily, rowing towards the rising Sun. There is harmony of stroke, of purposeand of direction.4. Then see—between you and the rising Sun—a figure moving toward you. It willbe myself (the Master D.K.), coming from the light, in your direction. In theclear pathway of the light you can see me distinctly. You see me together .5. Then say, inaudibly, yet as a group:“Into the light we move, beckoned thereto by thee. Out of the dark we come,driven thereto by the soul of all. Up from the earth we spring and into theocean of light we plunge. Together we come. Together we move, guided and led bythe soul we serve and by thee, the Master we know. The Master within and theMaster without are One . That One are we. The One is all—my soul, thy soul, theMaster and the soul of all.”If you will each of you do this on the five days of the Full Moon (as earlierdetailed), you will produce a group fusion of purpose which is for you the nextdesired step. You have worked at a group fusion in love; some success isapparent. Now work at the united evocation of the will.Each month send in your Full Moon report. I would ask you to do this each month,embodying your Full Moon report [128] and your meditation report into one unitbecause the activity of reporting is of real service in centralising yourthought and therefore your life within the group life. It is simply in thenature of a symbolic happening—a symbol of your progress, your purpose, yourcontribution and your cooperation, and all from the group angle. Therein liesits value. The so-called informative aspect of these reports is relativelynegligible as such to groups like this. But the symbolic usefulness is great andhas a definite group usefulness.One suggestion I will make. At the time of your Full Moon Approach to me,endeavour to have in your consciousness the words from Formula One (given inSection Three): “Upon the stream, between the two extremes, there floats the eyeof vision.” You need to remember that from one point of view these symbols arerelated to the antahkarana, that line between two points, and that as you buildthe antahkarana in your own lives so will be the growth of your understanding ofthe formula. As you progress upon the “way of the chela,” so will grow yourpower. Use the formula actively as far as you can and do not rest satisfied withjust attempting to understand some of its significances. It has a magicalimport, and when understanding is coupled with the use of the will, this formulaconstitutes a Word of Power of magical service.PART IVAs I have studied the meditation work of each of you (and both you and I knowwhether it has been faithfully followed or not), I have become aware of a basicneed and that is the need for Alignment. You need a more direct contact betweenheart-head-soul. This, necessarily, in preparation for a still higher contact.The two parts of the exercise you have been following since the new seed groupwas organised have not done what was intended and only three of you haveprofited adequately from that work. I am, therefore, giving you a very simplealignment exercise which I would ask you to follow together until furthernotice. I emphasise the word together and shall continue so doing in the hopethat the group [129] will move forward with a uniform procedure for this willproduce the greatest and most rapid results. It is good for you to have in mindthat the better you do this exercise and the quicker and closer your alignment,the better will be the group alignment. The exercise is so short and simple thatyou may regard it as too elementary. I assure you that it will reward anyconstant effort. It had been my intention to give another meditation, involvinganother centre, but the results of the work done do not warrant this. Perhaps abetter alignment may lead to a more constant application and a more direct andunderstanding occult obedience. I would ask you, therefore, to do this simplealignment exercise every day.I. Start with the point of soul focus of which you know much theoretically andcan know more practically. This falls into three stages:1. Raise the consciousness into the head.2. Carry the thought or consciousness upward through the astral body and themind to the soul.3. Identify the personality consciousness with the soul consciousness, andrealise that they are one.II. From that point, definitely and consciously, assume the attitude of theObserver. This also involves three stages:1. Observe the personality and consider it from the angle of the etheric body.2. Consciously throw soul energy down into the centre at the base of the spine.Then raise it slowly, via the five centres and the two head centres (ajna andhighest head centre), up into the soul body. This produces, when correctly done,a vivifying of the sutratma and links the personality and soul into one blendedunit. It is what might be called the acme of alignment.3. Then endeavour to throw the attention of the united soul-personality towardthe Spiritual Triad. [130]III. Reflect upon the antahkarana and its relation to soul-personality and theMonad.In your personal instructions this year, I am not going to be explicit nor am Igoing to give you each an individual meditation. The time for that is past. Youhave had much along that line. I am going to revert to an aspect of the oldsystem of training and give you hints and brief injunctions, leaving you to doyour own interpreting, to make right application and to profit or fail to profitas seems best to you.These injunctions will take the form of six statements, sentences or aphorismswhich will contain for you a particular message at which you can arrive if youwill take each of them into your daily meditation. You have a year in which todo this and can, therefore, make the six statements into six seed thoughts formeditation, or reflective brooding—one for each month for six months. Thenrepeat with the thought in view that during the second six months you will dowhat you can to make the effects of the previous period of reflection, a dynamicfactor in your life. Thus you will externalise the results of the precedingcycle of spiritual and mental brooding. In this way, your subjective realisationcan become an objective happening. Do this exercise each morning at the close ofthe alignment work, endeavouring to hold the mind steady in the light and toachieve as far as you can the brooding quality of the soul when in deepmeditation. This will not be easy at first, but if you adhere faithfully toinstructions, you will consciously realise sure gain. I suggest ten minutes’brooding each day (with pencil in hand if you so prefer) and then—during theday—keep the seed thought or statement in what is called “the back of the mind.”There it can gestate. In this way you will not only arrive at the meaning ofyour personal injunctions, hints or instructions (for that is what they mayprove to be when you arrive at their intended meaning), but you will at the sametime learn to cultivate the “double life pattern” of the pledged disciple. Hecarries on with the lower mind and the higher mind simultaneously, and thestream of spiritual [131] thought and activity consciously flows whilst theouter pattern of his life proceeds with increasing usefulness.Here are the six statements (These appear in the Personal instructions datedAugust 1942) for each of you, and I will take you alphabetically as usual. Oneword I would add: Seek not to interpret and understand your brother’sinstructions. Telepathic interplay, unrealised, naturally exists among you andyour thought and interpretations (based on insufficient knowledge) wouldundoubtedly impinge upon your brother’s mind. This could not fail to haveeffects. You might interpret wrongly and in any case you know not my intentionswhere your brother is concerned. Your thought might emphasise a concrete meaningwhereas I might have in view a totally different application. Keep your mind,therefore, off your brother’s instructions. Your duty lies in the dailyreleasing of steady illumined love, free from all criticism. It is not your dutyto aid your brother to become a better occultist and disciple. That is hisconcern, his soul’s concern and mine.Many of the hints given and the sentences in which they are embodied are takenfrom an old Book of Rules for disciples. Some are directly from me, your Master,and are applicable to your problems or your duty.PART VThe meditation work assigned to you thus far falls into three parts:a. The stage of raising the energy of the heart centre into the head centre.b. The stage of sending energy from the head centre to the solar plexus centre.c. A definite and planned process of alignment.I found, as you know, that the great need of the group was to develop therelatively simple attitude of instantaneous relation to or contact with thesoul, and through the soul [132] with the Master and His Ashram. I thereforeassigned an alignment exercise when I last communicated with you, and this I didin lieu of more abstruse meditation practices.This meditation is intended to bring about three most definite results:a. The interrelation of the seven centres, and therefore an uninterrupted flowof energy.b. The interplay of energy between the members of this group in my Ashram, viathe seven centres. The group thoughtform will have in it seven points ofenergetic life, the energies of which will be contributed by the group members.This etheric form of the group life will be an expression of the sum total ofthe seven types of energy as each individual member utilises them.c. The fusion, consciously and deliberately engineered, of the individual soulwith the group soul, and later with the Hierarchy—via my Ashram.To do this work correctly, we will start with the premise that “energy followsthought.” This is the first and most fundamental, as well as the most ancient,premise of the esotericist. The second is related to the first and will have aplace in our considerations. It states that “the eye, opened by thought, directsthe energy in motion.”Disciples, during the early stages of their training, are apt to regard energyas a pool or a reservoir upon which they can learn to draw, thus appropriating aquota of that energy for their need, their service and their use. But energy isfluid and in motion; we live in a veritable sea of moving forces, qualified incountless ways, conditioned by countless minds, misdirected oft, directed wiselysometimes, yet all of them perforce finding place in the mind content of the Onein Whom we live and move and have our being, and outside Whose range ofinfluence naught can be. Disciples have, for aeons, been using the energies andforces found in the three worlds for personality ends and for the furthering oftheir major interests, whatever those may be. They have [133] learnt somewhat tolay hold and use a measure of soul energy, thereby enlightening their way,improving their spiritual expression in the three worlds and serving a little.They are also beginning to grasp the significance of intention and of purpose,whilst an inner programme is slowly conditioning their daily lives. There comes,however, a point—a point which it is now your duty and privilege tograsp—wherein another source of energy, of inspiration and of light can be madeavailable to disciples and can be used for service. That is the energy of theForces of Light, originating in the Ashram and emanating thence; you stand asyet upon the periphery of the Ashram but can avail yourselves of these energies.The force of the Ashram must be “routed” through the soul (if such a word ispermissible). The disciple has therefore to learn the esoteric significance of amost familiar symbol—that of the Triangle and the Square.This has hitherto signified to him the threefold soul and the fourfoldpersonality, or if he is advanced enough in knowledge, the Spiritual Triad andthe fourfold personality □. Now he must view it in another light and learn toknow it as the triplicity of the Ashram, the soul and the disciple himself, withthe square representing humanity, the fourth kingdom in nature. This isconsequently a great decentralising symbol, and around it your new meditationwill be built. This meditation, if carefully followed, can and will bring aboutbasic changes in your lives. The symbol is capable of being arranged in severalways, and all of them have to be mastered factually by thedisciple—theoretically, visually, practically, intuitionally and factually. Eachof these words will convey a specific meaning, and rightly apprehended willbring about changes in the disciple’s life, in his service, and therefore in hiseffect within the Ashram.[Image00005.jpg][134] Let me now, brother of mine, outline for you the line of thinking whichshould be pursued by you as you seek to penetrate into the true significance ofthis symbol which is the theme of your meditation. It constitutes a normaldevelopment from the work already done. In the first two meditations given, youdealt with the centres of the etheric body, and were therefore dealing with thepersonality, the “city which stands foursquare.” You were next enjoined topractise alignment, thereby arriving at the recognition, and in some cases thecontact, with the spiritual triplicity, which is that which “hovers over thesquare and radiates the energy of light into this waiting field of activethought.”You will note that the entire process is therefore kept in the realm of thenon-material and that the physical brain is not, at this stage, at all involved.You, as you seek to meditate, are thinking on planes of mental perception; youare focussed there, and the brain is held throughout this period in a state ofwaiting and attentive quiescence. The disciple has—as oft I have told you—tomaster the process of carrying on a dual thinking process, wherein he ispreserving a continuity of mental impression and a constant activity connectedwith daily living and service. This is registered in due course by the brain.This is of major importance and one of the objectives which should provide youwith ample opportunity for effort during the coming year’s work.This threefold spiritual reality (which is the “impressing agent”) is the goalof the presented meditation work. It is not in this case the soul, whoseimpression upon the mind is that of love, its manifestation and its place in thePlan of the Hierarchy. The source of the impression to which you now seek to besensitive is the Spiritual Triad, and the quality of the impression is the will,as it implements divine purpose. I am therefore indicating a far more advancedstage, and I do so for two reasons: One is that for years the effort of all ofyou has been towards the registering of soul contact and the expression ofloving understanding; you are familiar with what the Hierarchy (of which myAshram is a part) seeks to accomplish, and there is nothing to be gained by aconstant reiteration of the familiar. I am, secondly, [135] outliningprocedures, meditations and objectives which will be of use to those who comeafter you and who will be the hierarchy of workers at the close of this centuryand during the first quarter of the coming century.I stated that one significance of this symbol is that it stands for thetriplicity of1. The Ashram,2. The soul on its own plane,3. The disciple upon the physical plane,whilst the square represents humanity; that this is frequently spoken of as the“city which stands foursquare,” and is familiarly referred to in modernliterature and discussions as the “city of man.”In considering the higher point of the triangle, which is the Ashram, I wouldremind you that radiation from Shamballa enters the triangle at that point andthat, through the Ashram, will, purpose and strength can pour. This is arelatively new achievement within the Ashrams of the Masters. In the major groupAshram (which is the Hierarchy itself) this reaction to impression fromShamballa is arrived at as the energy pours in, via the two Great Lords, theManu and the Christ. It is also registered by Their senior disciples, theChohans and initiates of the sixth initiation, such as the Masters Morya andKoot Hoomi. Lately the Master R. has taken the position of Mahachohan, and thatachievement has carried the entering force down into the ranks of those MastersWho have taken the fifth initiation thus enabling Them to step down thisShamballa force to Their individual Ashrams. This happening has produced atremendous stimulation with all the attendant opportunities, manifestations, anddangers. Masters such as myself have had to learn to handle this great potency,and at the same time to make as much of it as we can (safely and wisely)available to our senior disciples.It might be said symbolically that “the point of the triangle is based in thecourts of Heaven (Shamballa) and from that point two streams of power pour forthinto the [136] realm of soul and into the heart of the disciple. Thus is theTriad formed; then are the energies related unto the world of men; thus can thewill of God appear, and thus can the Great Lord Who guards the Council Chamberof this sphere of solar Life carry His purpose to the holy groups (the Ashrams.A.A.B.), and thence into the minds of men, and this because their hearts aresafeguarded by the fire of love.” Ponder upon this ancient writing: It refers tothe cycle immediately confronting us, of which the work I am at this timeseeking to do is but a tiny living part.Therefore, as you prepare for the meditation process which you will undertakeduring this coming year, start by a consideration of the Ashram of the Hierarchyitself, of its relation to Shamballa, of its constitution, formed as it is ofmany Ashrams. Some of these are working under the Chohans; others are workingunder the Masters, and some are embryonic as yet, being gathered slowly togetherby Adepts of the fourth initiation. Will you endeavour to realise the factualnature of this great, living, spiritual organism? It constantly “substands” orunderlies the world organisation. See it as a growing, vital reality, of suchlife and potency that it can break through or break up all limiting outerorganisations and, by the very force of its interior life, eventuallyexternalise itself.This coming externalisation of the groups which constitute the Ashrams of theMasters (not yet of the Chohans, because they are still basically too potent)will be a gradual process, but it will in time restore the Mysteries, bring thefirst two initiations into a relative prominence as integral parts of the comingworld religion, familiarise the whole of mankind with the fact of the subjectiveworld, and finally bring the most developed of the sons of men into a faintglimmer of understanding of the essential Reality underlying all phenomena, andgive some grasp of the purpose of Shamballa and the will of the Lord of theWorld. Humanity has now reached a point of development where there is a definitegrasp of the Plan of the Hierarchy—call it brotherhood, sharing,internationalism, unity or what you will. This is a growing and factualapprehension and is a general recognition [137] by the thinkers and esotericistsof the world, by the religious people of enlightenment, by broad mindedstatesmen, and even today by the man in the street; divine purpose, however,implemented or engineered by the divine will, eludes as yet the most advanced.The work of the next few centuries will bring about changes in this respect, andthese changes will be brought about by the work done in the Ashrams of theMasters, guided by the Ashrams of the Chohans, welded together in the greatAshram of the Hierarchy itself, and moving ever into closer relation with thegreat Council Chamber of Sanat Kumara, the Lord of the World, in Shamballa. Thishas to be brought about on Earth by disciples, acting under instructions such asI now give you and by their prompt collaboration with their Masters. The doingof this will invoke the creative imagination of the disciple, and this, in itsturn, will be conditioned and controlled by the illumined mind.A second stage comes when the disciple, having considered the Ashram as outlinedabove, and having thereby imaginatively “fixed” the fact of Shamballa in hisconsciousness, turns his thoughts to the Hierarchy or to the soul. Rememberalways that the Hierarchy is simply the world of souls , that it is consciouslyaware of the Plan, sensitive to the purpose, and creatively and constantlyimpressing humanity with the aim in view of expanding the human consciousness.Of this your soul—in its pure nature—is a part. You will therefore think of theHierarchy; you will attempt to vision its work, and you will endeavour to relateyourself to my Ashram by an act of faith and of will which is, in this case, thesublimation of the personal self-will; you will also take your position as aconscious, integral part of my Ashram, and consequently of the Hierarchy. Suchis the duty of all disciples. You have had much instruction as to the Ashram andI need not further enlarge.The third point of the triangle (as far as your work in this meditation isconcerned) comes into the light of your reflective consideration. You will nowturn your attention to yourself, the soul, the conscious disciple in preparationfor that expansion of consciousness which is the next step in [138] yourspiritual unfoldment, leading eventually to initiation. This reflectiveconsideration you do, not from the angle of the consciousness of yourimperfections, qualifications or capacities, your failures or your successes,but entirely from the angle of cooperation with the Plan, with the divine Willand Purpose. It is with these highest aspects that the disciple is asked tocooperate.It is not possible for the individual disciple in any Ashram to cooperate in allphases of the Master’s work, and it is not possible for you, for instance, tocooperate in every phase of the work in my Ashram which I have outlined in mypamphlets (and which has been summarised in the one entitled My Work ). But itis possible for you to choose some phase of that plan and give it your paramountattention.... These activities can—if adequately and strongly carriedforward—aid in the esoteric work of the world and the exoteric rehabilitation ofright human relations. . . .The fourth stage of the meditation work is concerned with the square which—forthe purposes of our work—we will simply regard as the field of service and ofexperience—experience in work and not individual life experience.You will note that this description of the meditation work, which I am askingyou to carry forward for a year at least, is based upon the three previousmeditations; these sought to bring the etheric body with its various forcecentres into such a condition that it could become receptive to impression, andcooperate thereafter actively; through the alignment exercise you endeavoured tobring that organised instrument of service into contact with the source ofinspiration and the source of impression, i.e., the Ashram and the soul. Now weare in a position (theoretically at least and dependent individually upon thesuccessful action of all work previously done) to begin the task of bringingthrough the inspiration and impression consciously, by determined contact withtheir sources. I will therefore briefly outline the work, asking you to do itafter close study of all that I have written above: [139]I. The Stage of Recognition.1. Recognition of your pledged discipleship.2. Recognition of your equipment, gratefully rendered.3. Recognition of your achieved alignment.4. Recognition of the soul, the source of love-wisdom.5. Recognition of the Hierarchy.All this should be done very rapidly, holding the consciousness steadily in themind, and not in the head. It presupposes an immediate mental focussing of thedisciple at the very beginning of his meditation work.II. The Stage of Consideration.1. Of the Ashram as a whole, i.e., of the Hierarchy as the Ashram of SanatKumara. You will see, through the use of the creative imagination, all theAshrams in close contact with Shamballa as:a. Responsive to the Purpose, implemented by the Ashrams of the Chohans.b. Impressed by the energy of Will as the great Ashram energises its componentparts—the various Ashrams within its periphery of influence.c. Vitalising the initiates and disciples who are affiliated with the Mastersand working in Their Ashrams.d. Reaching out, through the accepted and pledged disciples, into the world ofmen.Then you will say with purpose and determination:“I strive towards comprehension. Thy will, not mine, be done.”All the above section of your meditation work concerns purpose, will and the“destiny” of Shamballa, to use an old occult phrase.2. Of the world of souls which is the Hierarchy in relation to this world ofmen, and of in relation [140] to Shamballa as in the first part. This involves:a. A study of the nature of the hierarchical effort, as it is expressed throughlove.b. A conscious identification with the Plan.c. Dedication to the work originating in the Ashram with which you know yourselfto be in touch, seeing it all as an integral part of the hierarchical work.Then you will say with love and aspiration:“I strive towards understanding. Let wisdom take the place of knowledge in mylife.”3. Of yourself as a unit in my Ashram. This will involve:a. Recognising which aspect of my planned work you are equipped to do.b. Determining how to do it.c. Considering the factor of preparation for eventual initiation, as a means ofincreasing your capacity for hierarchical cooperation.d. Energising by light, faith, love and power, the spiritual centre within whichyou serve and the ashramic projects for which you accept responsibility. In thisinstance it can be the Arcane School and the Service Activities. You will thensay:“I strive towards cooperation. Let the Master of my life, the soul, and likewisethe One I seek to serve, throw light through me on others.”III. The Stage of Fixed Determination .1. A reflection upon the distinction between Purpose, Will and Intention.2. A period of complete focussed silence as you seek to present an unobstructedchannel for the inflow of light, love and strength from the Hierarchy.A statement made by you, the soul, the disciple, to the personality:[141]“In the centre of the will of God I stand.Naught shall deflect my will from His.I implement that will by love.I turn towards the field of service.I, the Triangle divine, work out that willWithin the square and serve my fellowmen.”If you can do this work correctly, you will not only greatly increase your ownrealisation, service and understanding, but you will definitely be cooperatingin the task of externalising the Ashram and furthering the work of the Hierarchy(from the foundation angle in relation to the New Age), and so aid in bringingin the new civilisation, the new world attitudes and the new world religion.PART VIThe meditation given you in your last instruction had several objectives inview. It was a preliminary meditation to a wide scheme for a particular kind ofdeveloping meditation, greatly needed by disciples, prior to unfolding a uniquekind of ashramic sensitivity.It was intended, first of all, to give you (if you worked with faithfulness) agrowing sense of planetary relationship, from the subjective angle, and aboveall, from the angle of “intelligent supervision”—a phrase which will mean moreto you later. A true grasp of the implications and intentions behind thismeditation would develop in the disciple’s consciousness a realisation of aliving world of Intelligences, linked together from Sanat Kumara downwards untilthe chain of Hierarchy reaches the individual disciple, leading him to a laterrealisation that he too is but a link, and that there are those whom he alsomust reach and relate to the world of realities and awaken to theirresponsibilities. In the training of all disciples, one of the goals is to makethe world of phenomena recede into the background of consciousness whilst theworld of meaning becomes more vital and real. This world, in its turn, is theantechamber to the world of causes, where conscious relationship can beestablished with the Initiator. [142]The second purpose of the meditation was to bring to light the fact that thedisciple (as an outpost of the Ashram as a functioning soul) must be oriented tohumanity in a more definite manner; the purpose of such orientation is that the“life of the triangles may penetrate the area of the square and produce theinevitable consequence, the germinating of ideas and the flowering of the newcivilisation and culture.” So has one of the Masters expressed the purpose ofcertain phases of the ashramic work, particularly that connected withmeditation. Another Master has explained the purpose of the hierarchical intentas the “merging of the higher with the lower triangle and their fusion in thesquare.” The Masters view the work of Their disciples from this symbolic angle.The disciple who reaps the benefit of this last suggested meditationbecomes—through an enlargement of his consciousness and the greater scope of hisvision—”a sower of the seed within the world of men”; he distributes ideas,living and potential, in the field of the world, and these he receives from twosources:1. His own soul, as his intuition awakens.2. The Ashram, as he grasps more of its purposes and becomes accustomed toassimilating its teachings. This takes time.Still another objective of this meditation was to bring the disciple to thepoint where his interest (evoked through the stages of recognition andconsideration) would lead him to a realisation of the need for the evocation ofthe Will, the first faint indications of which I called that of “fixeddetermination.” In the above statements you have the goals which I had in mindwhen assigning the meditation last year.It is hard, I know, for the neophyte at any stage along the Path to grasp thenecessity for engendering (to use an unusual word in this connection) amagnetised area of thought upon which the higher impressions can play, yetpersistence in the daily recognition and consideration, accompanied by a fixeddetermination to bring the life and service into conformity with the revealingrelations will [143] (almost unexpectedly) produce great and transformingresults. The Masters waste not Their time or yours in assigning needlessexercises; the disciple who faithfully and with a definitely unbroken rhythmfollows his instructions, can expect to see effects of a surprising and lastingnature within himself, and consequently within his environment. It is not uponthe results, however, that you are asked to focus, but simply upon the themespresented for your use and consideration.In the earlier stages of your training the emphasis was laid upon the form side,upon the achieving of alignment (still most necessary), upon the sounding of theOM, with its power to clarify the aura and the atmosphere, and upon theprocesses to be followed. In the meditation which you should now be doing,alignment should be instantaneous and easy and the following of a set formunnecessary, because you start as a centre of focussed thought, as the readyrecipient of awaited impression, as the trained analyser of ideas, and finallyas a transmitter of that which has been received from the higher sources ofinspiration. This involves also the power to distinguish the sources from whichthe impression comes. It is these aspects of yourself in action which will formthe basis of the suggested meditation to be followed by all of you during thecoming twelve months.The basic intention of the meditation is to train you to be intelligently awareof what Patanjali calls “the raincloud of knowable things,” of the intentions,purposes and ideas which, at any given period, motivate the hierarchical workand condition the quality of the inspiration which can be received from theAshram to which you may be attached. By “attached” I mean the sense ofrelationship and not devotion or affection. Attachment, in reality, is anexpression of the freewill of the subject, choosing and recognising itsrelationships and adhering thereto. In the spiritual sense, the motivation willbe loving responsibility; in the personality sense, it will be sentient emotion.As an aid to your concentration and receptivity, I will give you twelve wordswhich will be the theme for twelve months’ work, and which could—as you gain thepower to [144] meditate, relate, receive and transmit—provide the seed thoughtsfor twelve years’ work instead of twelve months. Words are living things,possessing form, soul and spirit or life; this you should ever bear in mind asyou use them to open the door to a month’s realisation and inspiration, plus theconsequent service. Here are twelve words. Use one each month in your dailymeditation.1. Recipient 2. Impression 3. Recognition 4. Relationship 5. Source 6. Ashram 7.Transmitter 8. Expression 9. Determination 10. Seed 11. Idea 12. AttachmentYou will notice how the meditation now to be outlined is a natural sequence tothe one which presumably you followed all last year.STAGE ONE . . . Preliminary.Pass rapidly through the steps of recognition, consideration and fixeddetermination. These, if correctly followed, will bring you to the point atwhich this new meditation starts.Then proceed as follows:STAGE TWO . . . The Centre of Focussed Thought .1. Polarise yourself consciously upon the mental plane, tuning out all lowervibrations and reactions.2. Then orient yourself to the Spiritual Triad, through an act of the will andthe imaginative use of the antahkarana.3. Next, take your theme word under consideration and ponder deeply upon it forat least five minutes. Endeavour to extract its quality and life, thus liftingit and your thought to as high a plane as possible.4. Then sound the OM, and wait silently, holding the mind steady. This is “thepause of reception.”STAGE THREE . . . The Recipient of Impression.1. Assuming an attitude of the highest expectancy, you [145] will now express inyour own words the highest truth of the monthly word-theme that you have beenable to reach.2. You then relate that theme to the present world opportunity, thusuniversalising the concept, seeing its relationship to world affairs, itsusefulness and spiritual value to humanity as a whole .3. Holding the mind in the light, you will then write down the first thought (nomatter what it is) that enters into your waiting mind in connection with thetheme of your meditation. The ability to do this will grow with practice, andwill eventually evoke the intuition and thus fertilise your mind.4. Again sound the OM, with the intent of refocussing yourself upon the mentalplane. If your work has been successful, your original focus will have shiftedto intuitional levels or to the levels of the higher, abstract mind, via theantahkarana. This must happen, in time, if your work has been faithfullyfollowed. But bear ever in your thought that you must work as a mind , and notas an aspirant or from the angle of memory. Think on this.STAGE FOUR . . . The Analyser of Ideas.1. You now analyse or think over with clarity the work you have done, and theideas now in your mind, seeing them in a true perspective in relation to thewhole problem of the day.2. Then, choosing one of the ideas which your theme-word has evoked, you thinkabout it, analyse it and relate it to life, getting all you can out of it. Thisevoked idea may and should vary from day to day but will always remain relatedto the monthly theme.3. Then study the idea in connection with yourself, the disciple, active inservice and the Master’s work, but not in connection with the personality. Thisyou will find an interesting distinction. Make the idea practical, enabling itto “qualify” you or enrich you.4. Again sound the OM, with the intent of making the sensed idea a part of yourvery nature. [146]STAGE FIVE . . . The Transmitter of Ideas .1. As the disciple, you have realised that a knowledge of truth and thereception of ideas lays on you the responsibility to be a transmitter to others.Ponder on this.2. Now take the idea which the theme has engendered, or take the theme-worditself if no ideas have come to you, and in imagination formulate it in such away that it can be presented to others, to your friends, to those you seek tohelp and to humanity—when opportunity offers. Think the idea through mentally,emotionally, and practically, thus precipitating it outwards into the world ofthought.3. Then (using the creative imagination and seeing yourself as a responsibletransmitter, doing the work of the Ashram) breathe out the idea as a formulated,living thoughtform into the great stream of mental substance which is everplaying upon the human consciousness.4. Sound the OM, thus “closing the episode.”Close the above meditation with a daily dedication of yourself to the service ofhumanity; renew your pledge to your Master and say the Mantram of Unification Igave you some years ago:The sons of men are one and I am one with them.I seek to love, not hate;I seek to serve and not exact due service;I seek to heal, not hurt.~Let pain bring due reward of light and love.Let the soul control the outer form, and life and all events,And bring to light the love that underlies the happenings of the time.~Let vision come and insight. [147]Let the future stand revealed.Let inner union demonstrate and outer cleavages be gone.Let love prevail.Let all men love.I have given you this meditation in some detail, as I am anxious to have youcomprehend what it is you will be doing. A shortened form of the meditationfollows at the close of this general instruction.At the end of each month, go through the ideas you have jotted down in yourdaily work and from them pick three which seem to carry the most inspiration andwhich you judge could be a seed for useful distribution or transmission. At theclose of the year send in your thirty-six seed thoughts. As you will all havebeen using the same theme-words, much help can be accorded to the entire groupby each of you. You will find this work most interesting. It is, in a way, atiny reflection of the technique of the Hierarchy and the way the Masters work(though on a much higher turn of the spiral) in times of crisis, or when thereis need for all the groups or Ashrams—as there is today—to unite in someendeavour, necessitated by the need of humanity or by some planetary emergency.The Masters, starting Their work on one of the planes of the Spiritual Triad,instead of the mental plane as do Their disciples, concentrate on the “theme”under Their consideration, during the period of three Full Moons. They then meetin conclave and each makes His contribution to the joint problem, as also doesthe Christ and, at critical times, Members of the Council Chamber of SanatKumara. On the basis of the proposals, and after due analysis and discussion,the united decision is transmitted by impression to the initiates and disciplesin the Ashrams, and from them to the world. If you study the above statement youwill see the importance of the meditation which I have outlined; it is toprepare you for closer work—along correct hierarchical lines—in the Ashrams andwith the Master.

For each ofyou this indicates a renewed time of service and of activity. I send youherewith the final stanza of the Great Invocation, as per my promise. I gave youthe first about nine years ago and the second during the course of the war. Iwould ask you to use it daily and as many times a day as you can remember to doso; you will thus create a seed thought or a clear-cut thoughtform [149] whichwill make the launching of this Invocation among the masses of men a successfulventure when the right time comes. That time is not yet.This Great Invocation can be expressed in the following words:From the point of Light within the Mind of GodLet light stream forth into the minds of men.Let Light descend on Earth.From the point of Love within the Heart of GodLet love stream forth into the hearts of men.May Christ return to Earth.From the centre where the Will of God is knownLet purpose guide the little wills of men—The purpose which the Masters know and serve.From the centre which we call the race of menLet the Plan of Love and Light work out.And may it seal the door where evil dwells.Let Light and Love and Power restore the Plan on Earth.It has been difficult to translate into understandable and adequate phrases thevery ancient word-forms which the Christ will employ. These word-forms are onlyseven in number, and they will constitute His complete, new utterance. I haveonly been able to give their general significance. Nothing else was possible.But even in this longer form, they will be potent in their invocative appeal, ifsaid with mental intensity and ardent purpose. The points of emphasis upon whichI would ask you to dwell (once it is permissible to use the phrases) are two innumber:1. May Christ return to Earth. This return must not be understood in its usualconnotation and its well-known mystical Christian sense. Christ has never leftthe Earth. What is referred to is the externalisation of the Hierarchy and itsexoteric appearance on Earth. The Hierarchy will eventually, under its Head, theChrist, function openly and visibly on Earth. This will happen when the purposeof the divine Will, and the plan which will implement it, are better [150]understood and the period of adjustment, of world enlightenment and ofreconstruction has made real headway. This period begins at the San FranciscoConference (hence its major importance), and will move very slowly at first. Itwill take time, but the Hierarchy thinks not in terms of years and of briefcycles (though long to humanity), but in terms of events and the expansion ofconsciousness.2. May it seal the door where evil dwells . The sealing up of the evil forces,released during this war, will take place within the immediate future. It willbe soon. The evil referred to has nothing to do with the evil inclinations, theselfish instincts and the separativeness found in the hearts and minds of humanbeings. These they must overcome and eliminate for themselves. But the reductionto impotency of the loosed forces of evil which took advantage of the worldsituation, which obsessed the German people and directed the Japanese people,and which worked through barbarity, murder, sadism, lying propaganda, and whichprostituted science to achieve their ends, requires the imposition of a powerbeyond the human. This must be invoked, and the invocation will meet with speedyresponse. These evil potencies will be occultly “sealed” within their own place;what this exactly means has naught to do with humanity. Men today must learn thelessons of the past, profit from the discipline of the war, and deal—each in hisown life and community—with the weaknesses and errors to which he may findhimself prone.I would here recall to you what I said last year to . . . anent this finalstanza of the Invocation:“I am preparing to present to you for wide distribution throughout the world,the last stanza of the Great Invocation. It is by no means easy to translate thewords of this stanza in terms which will make it of general appeal and notsimply of importance to convinced esotericists.... It can be so presented thatthe masses everywhere, the general public, will be prompted to take it up andwill use it widely; they will do this on a relatively larger scale than theintuitional, the spiritually minded or even the men of [151 ] goodwill. A farwider public will comprehend it. I will give A.A.B. this stanza at the earliestpossible moment; this will be conditioned by world affairs and by myunderstanding of a certain esoteric appropriateness in the setting of a timecycle. If plans mature as desired by the Hierarchy, the new stanza can receivedistribution at the time of the Full Moon of June 1945, as far as the Occidentis concerned, and considerably later for the Orient. Prior to these set pointsin time, the stanza can be used by all esoteric school members, after being usedfor one clear month by my group, dating that month from the time that the mostdistant members of the group receive it.”I seek to have this Invocation go forth on the power generated by my Ashram andby all of you affiliated with my Ashram: the Ashrams of the Master K.H. and theMaster M. are likewise deeply committed to participation in this work.I would ask you also to read and reread the two Instructions—one dealing withthe Cycle of Conferences, (The Externalisation of the Hierarchy) and the otherwith the work of the Christ. (The Reappearance of the Christ) Master theircontents and let the blueprint of the hierarchical plan take shape in yourminds. Then you can do your share in implementing it and will be able torecognise those who, in other groups and in different lands, are also a vitalpart of hierarchical effort.PART VIIIBefore we proceed further with this subject of meditation, I would like to callyour attention to the fact that the type of work I am now giving you is formlessin comparison with the earlier meditations outlined. I have already given youfive meditations which, as a group, you have been asked to follow. I would liketo summarise their objectives for you so that (again) you may intelligently goforward.The first meditation was concerned with the transfer of energy from the solarplexus centre to the heart centre, so [152] that the great dividing barrier (ofwhich the diaphragm is the exoteric symbol) could be bridged and the emotionalpersonality be controlled by the heart. By this means, the selfish individualityof the average man could be transmuted into the group awareness of the dedicateddisciple. I sought to help you set up a facility of transference which would beof primary importance to you in your daily lives.The second meditation was concerned with the impartation of a major concept. Iwonder if it was so registered by you? The idea behind that meditation was thefree flow of directed energy. You need ever to bear in mind that the initiate iseternally occupied with energies and forces which he directs and manipulates inaccordance with hierarchical intent. Before, however, he can do this, he must bein control to some extent of the seven types of energy to which the humanmechanism responds. He must be able to direct the flow of energy to anyparticular centre, to focus certain types of force in certain centres—at willand with understanding—and to institute a free flow and interchange throughouthis own little microcosm. The meditation given was not intended to bring thisabout; it had only one objective: the impartation of an idea and thepresentation of a possibility.The third meditation was closely allied to these two, even if this is notimmediately apparent to you. It concerned alignment. You have been apt to thinkof alignment in terms of the process whereby the personality is brought intorelation with the soul. This is entirely accurate, yet alignment is a term whichin reality covers four processes:1. The alignment of soul and personality, resulting in a conscious relation tothe Kingdom of God.2. The alignment of soul and personality with the Ashram, resulting in aconscious relation with the Master of the Ashram.3. The alignment of the initiate of higher degree with the spiritual Triad andthe consequent result of a recognition of monadic energy.4. The alignment of all the centres in the etheric body [153] of the disciple.This results in the ability of these centres to register and transfer energieswhich enter into the lower mechanism as a consequence of the three higheralignments—listed above.I would ask you to study the above tabulation with care.The fourth meditation was definitely directed towards bringing about a closerrelation to the Hierarchy, via the Ashram and its life of pledged service. Thisstatement is of importance to you at this time. This meditation was divided intothree stages: Recognition, Consideration, Determination. Disciples need to buildinto their brain consciousness recognitions of relation and of attitude. Thesemust eventually and automatically condition the personality, and this, notthrough a forced effort, but through a positive receptivity. This receptivity isbrought about by a stabilised orientation. Disciples need constantly to reflectupon the life of the Ashram as it makes its impact upon their consciousness.What impact, my brother, are you individually aware of? Upon this reflectionmust succeed a planned determination to form a constructive part of the ashramiclife to which their thinking and their service have admitted them. The firstfaint efforts of the emergence of the spiritual will can be seen in the workingout of this determination.This was followed by the fifth meditation , which has been the subject of yourattention during this past year. You will have noted how the meditations havebecome increasingly abstract until—in this last one—you have been occupied withthe consideration of ideas and with what those ideas can reveal when they areregarded as seed ideas , shielding or containing a flowering—as yet unseen andrecorded.I have been working, as you can now realise, upon a definite plan and (if youhave done your work regularly and conscientiously) you are now ready for thenext phase in this abstract work. I would like at this point to refer to twoconcepts which I have already presented to you; they are related to the factthat the initiate has two things to do: [154]1. Become sensitive to impressions coming to him from various levels of thedivine consciousness and awareness.2. Become aware of the “raincloud of knowable things” to which Patanjali refers.(The Light of the Soul, Pages 38, 424-426)Both of these will become clearer to you as we proceed with our consideration ofour third point in these instructions—the point which deals with telepathy.(Telepathy and the Etheric Vehicle) Each of these possible registrationsinvolves a certain and specific phase of alignment, a conscious use of the mindas a contact agent, and a receptive activity of the brain.Putting the objective of all this into its highest possible terms, the discipleand the initiate are learning the technique (through meditation) whereby theMind of God, the Universal Mind, or the thinking process of the planetary Logos,can be recorded and registered. For the majority, at present, the knowledge ofthe divine thought (as registered by disciples, as it works out in the emergingPlan, and as it gives livingness to life purpose) is reached through the Ashram.The Master imparts the nature of the Plan or the Purpose—according to the statusof the initiate—and that is accepted by him under the Law of Free OccultObedience. But the disciple or the initiate must not remain forever dependentupon the transmission of the divine thought to him by Those more advanced thanhe. He must learn to make his own contacts and to tap the “raincloud” forhimself. He must—unaided—penetrate into the thinking processes (by permittedspiritual telepathy or impressibility) of Sanat Kumara. I have theresponsibility at this time to give you those meditations which will enable youto take the first steps towards this knowledge; it is for me to give to you theA B C of the later greatly simplified, yet exceedingly abstruse, techniques.Have these thoughts in mind as you study this résumé of the meditations alreadygiven, and then go forward with that to be suggested in this series ofinstructions. [155] On the basis of what I have here said, I would ask you alsoto write a clear statement:1. Of your understanding of the progressive synthesis of the six meditationswhich you will have received and of their purpose in connection with your movingforward towards initiation.a. What have these meditations done to you?b. What were they supposed to do?2. A clear definition of the phrases:a. The Science of Impression, referring here to the mechanism of impression andstating what you know about the technique of impression.b. The “raincloud of knowable things.” What is the nature of these things? Whythe symbol of the raincloud?You will endeavour to bear in mind that the source of these impressions shiftssteadily higher or deeper, as the case may be, and that for average disciples,such as you, the impressions to be recorded until such time as you have takenthe third initiation concern:1. The ideas, purposes and intentions which motivate the Hierarchy and which aretransmitted to you by the Master of your ray and therefore of the Ashram withwhich you are affiliated.2. The quality of the inspiration which you can receive and register and whichemanates from the Ashram in which you find yourself. This again will have theoutstanding characteristics of your ray, though those of the other six rays willalso be present, implied and inherent.3. The nature of the hierarchical mode of work and the methods to be employed inany particular world period, such as the present difficult and transitional era.[156]You will see from the above how diverse, spiritually speaking, are theimpressions to be received by the attentive disciple. The word “diverse” hereemployed is not of a separative connotation; it signifies the basic unity indiversity and the vastness of the inclusive thinking of the planetary Logos.Achievement for the disciple, consists (along this line) in a sequential andgrowing capacity to include in his thinking more and more of the divineconclusions . I use this word in its esoteric significance.It is my intention this year to have you concentrate upon the new Invocationfrom the point of view that it embodies the divine intent and summarises theconclusions of the thinking of the planetary Logos. It is the most abstract formof meditation with which you have yet been presented. The meaning of thisInvocation has been expressed in terms which are understandable, in a measure,to the average person because of its familiar wording, based on many Scripturalterms. But the true inner implications and significances are of very deep importand are not superficially apparent. I challenge you to penetrate, throughmeditation, more deeply into the vital meaning of these words, these amazingwords. They embody, as far as is possible in modern language, a formula whichhas been in possession of the Hierarchy ever since it was founded on Earth, butwhich is only now available for use, owing to the point in evolution reached bymankind. The wonder of these mantric stanzas is that they are comprehensible tomembers of the human family and to members of the Kingdom of God. They mean onething to the ordinary man, and that meaning is good, powerful and useful; theymean another thing to the man upon the Probationary Path, for he attaches to thewords a deeper and more esoteric meaning than is possible to the man who isentirely polarised in his lower nature; these words mean still another thing tothe disciple affiliated with and functioning consciously in an Ashram: toinitiates and to the senior Members of the Hierarchy, they convey a still higherand more inclusive significance.I am anxious to ascertain your reaction to these words, and am asking you forone entire year to concentrate your [157] meditative thinking and yourreflective power upon them. At the same time, they provide, in an almostsingular manner, the next developing stage in the series of meditations I haveplanned for you; they should also (in a peculiar manner) enable you to moveforward in your thinking and in your ability to grasp abstractions. Look for theunderlying abstract idea in this Invocation. It is there. From your reaction tothis Invocation, and your ability to use its phrases as “stepping-stones” tocertain levels of abstract thought not hitherto attained, I shall be able tojudge your readiness, as individuals, for certain specific preparatory work forthe initiation which you (again as an individual disciple) should take.The final stanza of the “Invocation for Power and Light,” as it is called in theArchives of the Masters, is apparently simple. It has, in these Archives, anindicatory symbol beside it which indicates the era or period in human historyduring which it can and should be used. It is interesting to us to note that theevolution of humanity is in line with the indicated timing. This Invocation willhave a potent appeal to mankind. My considered advice is that in itspresentation to a definitely Christian public (as for instance to theecclesiastics of all denominations) the third verse in the stanza be changed andthat its last line should read: “The Purpose which the Master knows and serves,”or perhaps “which disciples know and serve.” The word “disciple” is an inclusiveword, in the hierarchical sense; it is, at the same time, one easily recognisedby the orthodox but offers no limitation to the esotericist. It covers everygrade of human aspirant from the newly accepted disciple up to and inclusive ofthe Christ Himself. Let me here quote the Invocation:From the point of Light within the Mind of GodLet light stream forth into the minds of men.Let Light descend on Earth.From the point of Love within the Heart of GodLet love stream forth into the hearts of men.May Christ return to Earth.From the centre where the Will of God is knownLet purpose guide the little wills of men—The purpose which the Masters know and serve.From the centre which we call the race of menLet the Plan of Love and Light work out.And may it seal the door where evil dwells.Let Light and Love and Power restore the Plan on Earth.[158] Each of the four stanzas refers to one or other of the three aspects ofdivine energy, plus a reference to humanity itself in which the three meet, arepotentiality in latency, and finally develop into the full flower of divinity,with all three lines perfectly expressed. Hence, my brothers, the intensity ofthe human conflict—a conflict unparalleled in any other differentiation of thedivine Life. In humanity all lines and aspects meet. This is a fundamental ofthe occult teaching. The subhuman kingdoms find their consummation in humanity,and the superhuman kingdoms their opportunity, and through the human kingdom allsuperhuman lives have at some time passed. This you well know.In the first three lines you have reference to the Mind of God as a focal pointfor the divine light. This refers to the soul of all things. The term “soul,”with its major attribute of enlightenment, includes the anima mundi, the animalsoul, the human soul, and that consummating point of light which we regard asthe “overshadowing” soul of humanity. It is an aspect of the divinemanifestation to which that great Son of God refers when (as Shri Krishna) Heremarks, “Having pervaded this entire universe with a fragment of Myself, Iremain.” That fragment is the soul of all things. That soul brings light andspreads enlightenment.In the second three lines , the Heart of God is evoked and the focal point oflove is considered. This “heart” of the manifested world is the Hierarchy—thatgreat transmitting agency of love to every form in the divine manifestation.Upon the essentially “loving nature” of the Hierarchy I need not dwell; too muchhas been written about it; too little understood; too much has been talked aboutlove and not enough has been realised as to the task confronting the Hierarchy[159] as it transmits love. Love is an energy which must reach the hearts of menand which must fecundate humanity with the duality of loving-understanding—thatis what is expressed when love and intelligence are brought together.In the third three lines , we find reference to Shamballa—”the Centre where theWill of God is known”—the centre from whence the Hierarchy draws its life, as itdraws its impulse towards service from humanity. You well know that there isindication in these lines that humanity itself cannot as yet grasp the purposeof Sanat Kumara. Only advanced Members of the Hierarchy and initiates of atleast the third degree (the first degree of the Lodge on Sirius) have any ideaas to the nature of the purpose which underlies the Plan. Ponder on thatphrasing.Having invoked the three aspects or potencies of Mind, Love, and Will, in thefourth three lines we have indication of the anchoring of all these powers inhumanity itself, in “the centre which we call the race of men.” Here and herealone lies the promise of the future and its hope and opportunity. Here and herealone can all the divine qualities—in time and space—express themselves and findfulfilment: here and here alone can love be truly born, intelligence correctlyfunction, and the Will of God demonstrate its effective goodwill. Throughhumanity, alone and unaided (except by the divine Spirit in every human being),can the “door where evil dwells be sealed.” It is not Sanat Kumara who sealsthat door; it is not the Hierarchy which forces evil back into the place fromwhence it comes. It is struggling, aspiring and suffering humanity to whom thetask is committed and, my brother, humanity is adequate to the task.This statement is borne ever in mind by Those most potent in using theInvocation; it serves to focus and anchor the invoked energies in the humankingdom. That is Their task. From that point, humanity takes over theundertaking.This Invocation is also unique in the sense that it invokes all the three divineaspects. It is synthetic in its approach. This is the first time in humanhistory that this has been done. Hitherto the development of mankind did notwarrant such an utterance.[160] In Lemurian times, the third divine aspect, that of Intelligence, wasinvoked by the mass appeal of instinctual animal-man; he little knew what thatalmost inchoate appeal would invoke. Light appeared on Earth and trueprogressive enlightenment became possible. I am not here referring to physicallight, but to the light of the intellect.In Atlantean days, as a result of the strife between the Lords of Light or ofthe Shining Countenance and the Lords of the Dark Face (as they are called inthe ancient Scriptures and in The Secret Doctrine ) another “era of invocation”occurred and the second divine aspect of Love became a possible unfoldment,though still only an embryonic quality of mankind. The mass appeal was then moreintelligently voiced, though the instinctual appeal still persisted. It was notintelligence, however, as we understand the term.In our Aryan cycle, another great invocative cry is issuing forth. It is thistime a threefold cry. It is the cry for light upon our way and for light to flowinto the dark places of the Earth; it is also a cry for more love in the worldas voiced by the men of goodwill and of humanitarian attitudes: it is, finally,the intuitive appeal of the aspirants and the disciples of the world for thefull expression in time and space of the will-to-good—the Will of God. Averageinstinctual humanity, the men and women of goodwill, and the disciples of theworld are all concerned in this invocation, bringing in the attributes ofinstinct, intelligence and intuition. All three are blended in this greatInvocation. Have also constantly in mind this basic fusion, now finding voicedexpression, and take courage from the massed approach to the Source of all Life,Love and Light. Nothing can withstand the united demand of men everywhere intheir graded and their serried ranks.This entire Invocation refers esoterically to the “raincloud of knowable things”to which Patanjali refers. It is that impending, overshadowing and revelatorystorehouse of energy which is the immediate cause of all events on Earth andwhich indicates the emergence of that which is new and better and progressivelyright . The events and happenings thus precipitated demonstrate the movingonward into [161] greater light of the human consciousness. These “knowablethings” are the sources of all revelation and of all human realisations—culturaland leading to what we call civilisation. Their “condensation” (if I may usesuch a word) is brought about by the massed invocative appeal of the entirehuman family at any one period. This appeal has been, on the whole, projectedunconsciously, but more and more it will be consciously voiced. Results,therefore, can be expected more rapidly and prove more effective. This raincloudis formed through the joint action of the Central Spiritual Sun, working throughShamballa, and humanity itself, working hitherto through appeal to theHierarchy, but increasingly making its own direct appeal.There is necessarily a subtle indirect appeal going forth continuously from thethree subhuman kingdoms in nature, but that appeal focusses itself in the humankingdom, for that kingdom is the receiving and the transmitting agent for thesekingdoms, just as the Hierarchy has been and is the receiving and thetransmitting agent for every human appeal. Note here the beautiful interlockingand the fine interrelation which has been established by our planetary Logos.This new Invocation expresses this complete interdependence in an unique manner.Precipitation of the new and long awaited energies is brought about in threeways:1. By the direct action of the Hierarchy as its Members train Their disciples totap this source of inspiration, to become sensitive to the awaited impression,and to bring down that which is needed for the enlightenment and restoration ofmankind to its original high spiritual state. There is a higher condensationawaiting precipitation, but to humanity that will form a “raincloud ofunknowable things” and necessitates not, therefore, your consideration.2. By the disciples and aspirants of the world who provide a channel by means ofwhich the energies and the fructifying forces can reach mankind. This they bringabout by: [162]a. The deepening of man’s spiritual realisation through reflective meditation,aspiration and devotion. These in time give place to conviction and mentalknowing.b. Receptiveness to spiritual impression. This entails the awakening of anintelligent use of the intuition, plus the capacity to hold the mind steady inthe light whilst the brain is quiescently ready to record that “descendingknowledge.”c. Practical ability to relate the idea to the ideal and to take those stepswhich will create the form of that ideal upon the physical plane.3. By the steady progress of humanity, en masse, towards the light. This in timeproduces in humanity itself a quality and a vibration which make themselvesfelt. This quality and this vibration are essentially evocative.Today this “raincloud of knowable things” has condensed or brought togetherenergies which have been made available by the Spirits of Restoration,Reconstruction and Resurrection. These now available energies are—on a largerscale and of a higher nature—similar to those which the individual soul(paradoxical term) makes available to the personality when that personality isready for the Path of Probation or of Discipleship. These energies are far morepotent because they are, in their turn, a precipitation of energies which havebeen placed at the disposal of Shamballa, plus energies and forces generated bythe Hierarchy. Extra-planetary forces can now be utilised on Earth, owing to theforward progress of our planet and its relation to the solar system as a whole.There has never been a period in our planetary history in which opportunity hasloomed so large or when so much spiritual light and force could be contacted andutilised by humanity.The first indication of this massed and available energy produced coordinationof the New Group of World Servers upon the physical plane.[163] The second indication produced a pronounced cleavage between the forces ofevil and the Forces of Light; this cleavage resulted in the world war(1914-1945) and initiated the seething emotional and psychic turmoil in whichhumanity today finds itself.The third indication was the release of atomic energy and the discovery of howto transmute energy into matter and matter into energy.The spiritual energies have, therefore, impersonally and with a “vivid directiveof pure intent,” penetrated from the highest point of spiritual purpose to thelowest aspect of matter, the atom; they have thus proved the truth of thestatement that matter is spirit at its lowest point and spirit is matter at itshighest, and that the apparent duality is but an essential unity.A concentration of spiritual forces in and through the New Group of WorldServers, the production of a world conflict with its disrupting and at the sametime its unifying result, and the release of certain impressive energies inmatter itself for the benefit of all created things on Earth—these are theimmediate results of the pressure of the overshadowing spiritual resources.These forces have affected the spiritual and the humanitarian people of theworld, blending them into one group upon the inner planes (even if this stillremains outwardly unrealised), and have thus given a death blow to the greatheresy of separateness. This will later make itself invincibly apparent. Theybrought pure evil to the surface in such a manner that the issues between goodand evil became apparent in a clearer light and the causes of human miseryreceived fresh and keener recognition; the knowledge and the responsibility ofmankind everywhere cannot now be denied. They also made possible the use ofenergy locked up in substance itself; this, if rightly used, can and willcompletely alter and change man’s attitude to life, his sense of values and hisuse of time.All this has been brought about by what we might call with exactitude the firstprecipitation. Its effects have been mass effects to a very large extent. Theyhave affected the [164] spiritual workers and the men of goodwill, producing thepurifying fires of pain and agony through the medium of war, and makingavailable also the essence of the material world. I have endeavoured to expressthe majesty of the recent happenings in various ways in order to impress uponyou all the stupendous nature of what has occurred.The second precipitation must be more consciously brought about by humanityitself, and it is to facilitate this that the new Invocation has been given, andfor this reason it must be widely distributed.This precipitation is to be brought about by the gradual engendering of thedivine idea in the human consciousness. Above everything else required at thistime is a recognition of the world of meaning, a recognition of Those Whoimplement world affairs and Who engineer those steps which lead mankind onwardtowards its destined goal, plus a steadily increased recognition of the Plan onthe part of the masses. These three recognitions must be evidenced by humanityand affect human thinking and action if the total destruction of mankind is tobe averted. They must form the theme of all the propaganda work to be doneduring the next few decades—until the year 2025—a brief space of time indeed toproduce fundamental changes in human thought, awareness, and direction, but—atthe same time— a quite possible achievement, provided the New Group of WorldServers and the men and women of goodwill perform a conscientious task. Evil isnot yet sealed. The spread of the Christ consciousness and His recognisedPresence with us is not yet attained. The Plan is not yet so developed that itsstructure is universally admitted. Evil has been driven back; there are enoughpeople aware of the possibility of divine enlightenment and of theinterdependence (which is the basis of love) to form a potent nucleus, providedagain that the inertia so prevalent among spiritual people is overcome. There isdivine indication of coming events and a planned progress towards them, and thisis already arousing interest among thinkers in many lands. However, thenecessary responsive planning is still lacking.This new Invocation, if given widespread distribution, [165] can be to the newworld religion what the Lord’s prayer has been to Christianity and theTwenty-Third Psalm has been to the spiritually minded Jew.I would like to indicate to you three approaches to the subject of thisInvocation. I will do so briefly, as time lacks. It is for you toarrive—according to your evolutionary status and the depth of your reflection—atwhat I may leave unsaid. These three approaches are:1. That of the general public.2. That of the esotericists, that is, of aspirants and disciples.3. That of the more advanced disciple (as far as I can) and of the Hierarchy.First, the general public will regard it as a prayer to God transcendent. Theywill not recognise Him yet as immanent in His creation; they will send it forthon the wings of hope—hope for light and love and peace, for which theyceaselessly long. They will also regard it as a prayer for enlightenment of allrulers and leaders in all groups who are handling world matters; as a prayer forthe inflow of love and understanding among men so that they may live in peacewith one another; as a demand for the working out of the will of God—a will ofwhich they can know nothing (this is, after all, quite true for all exceptinitiates) and which ever seems to them so inscrutable and so all-inclusive thattheir normal reaction should be patience and a willingness to refrain fromquestioning; as a prayer for the strengthening of human responsibility, in orderthat the recognised evils of today which so distress and trouble mankind may bedone away with and some vague source of evil may be harnessed; they will regardit finally as a prayer that some equally vague primeval condition of blissfulhappiness may be restored and all unhappiness and pain disappear from the Earth.This is, for them, entirely good and helpful and all that is immediatelypossible. I have so worded and rendered the Invocation that the Christian world,through its churches, may not find it impossible to use.[166] Second, esotericists and aspirants of the world will have a deeper andmore understanding approach. To them it will convey the recognition of the worldof causes and of Those Who stand subjectively behind world affairs, thespiritual Directors of our life. They stand ready to strengthen those with truevision, ready to indicate not only the reason for events in the variousdepartments of human living, but also to make those revelations which willenable humanity to move forward out of darkness into light. With thisfundamental attitude, the necessity for widespread expression of theseunderlying facts will be apparent and an era of hierarchical propaganda,engineered by disciples and carried forward by esotericists, will mature. Thisera began in 1875 when H.P.B.’s proclamation of the fact of the existence of theMasters of the Wisdom was made. It has been carried forward in spite ofmisrepresentation, attack upon the concept and scorn; recognition of thesubstantial nature of the available evidence, and an appearance of an intuitiveresponse by occult students and many of the intelligentsia throughout the worldhave been present.A new type of mystic is coming to be recognised; he differs from the mystics ofthe past (except in a few outstanding instances) by his practical interest incurrent world affairs and not in religious and church matters only; he isdistinguished by his lack of interest in his own personal development, by hisability to see God immanent in all faiths and not just in his own particularbrand of religious belief, and also by his capacity to live his life in thelight of the divine Presence. All mystics have been able to do this to a greateror less degree, but he differs from those in the past in that he is able clearlyto indicate to others the techniques of the Path; he combines both head andheart, intelligence and feeling, plus an intuitive perception, hitherto lacking.The clear cold light of the Spiritual Triad now illumines the way of the modernmystic, and not simply the light of the soul, and this will be increasingly thecase.Both of these groups—the general public and the world aspirants in their varyingdegrees—have among them those who stand out from the general average aspossessing a [167] deeper insight and understanding; they occupy ano-man’s-land, intermediate in the one case between the masses and theesotericists, and on the other between the esotericists and the Members of theHierarchy. Forget not that They also use this great Invocation and that not aday goes by that the Christ himself does not sound it forth. As you read thenext few pages, you may find some clue to the attitudes and points of view ofthese spiritual Intelligences.On the surface, the beauty and the strength of this Invocation lies in itssimplicity, and in its expression of certain central truths which all men,innately and normally, accept—the truth of the existence of a basic Intelligenceto Whom we vaguely give the name of God ; the truth that, behind all outerseeming, the motivating power of the universe is Love ; the truth that a greatIndividuality came to Earth, called by Christians the Christ , and embodied thatlove so that we could understand; the truth that both love and intelligence areeffects of what is called the Will of God, and finally the self-evident truththat only through Humanity itself can the divine Plan work out.This Plan calls mankind to the expression of Love and challenges men to “lettheir light shine.” Then comes the final solemn demand that this Plan of Loveand Light, working through mankind, may “seal the door where evil dwells.” Thefinal line then contains the idea of restoration , indicating the keynote forthe future and that the day will come when God’s original idea and His initialintention will no longer be frustrated by human freewill and evil—purematerialism and selfishness; the divine purpose will then, through the changedhearts and goals of humanity, be achieved.This is the obvious and simple meaning and it ties in with the spiritualaspiration of all men everywhere.There are deeper implications and upon them I will later touch, but the clarityof spiritual desire and aspiration is expressed in these words in such a formthat its use offers no barrier to the different types of mind which may receiveit. Only those who recognise no subjective or inner world, and who reject theconcept of an inner world of causes being responsible for the outer world ofeffects, will deny its truth [168] and usefulness; such people are fortunatelyfew and far between.It is apparent, therefore, that the first three stanzas or verses invoke, callfor or appeal to the three aspects of divine life which are universallyrecognised—the mind of God, the love of God, and the will or purpose of God; thefourth stanza points out the relation of humanity to these three energies ofintelligence, love and will, and mankind’s deep responsibility to implement thespread of love and light on Earth.Right here the work of the Triangles—so close to the heart of the Hierarchy atthis time—becomes obvious. Through the network which the Triangles are creating,light or illumination is invoked by the daily work and attitude of the Trianglemembers; thus light can indeed “descend on earth” and goodwill, which is thelove of God and basically, the will-to-good, can also stream forth in fullerlivingness into the hearts of men; thus they are transformed in their lives andthe era of right human relations cannot be stopped. This is an era hitherto onlydimly sensed and which only the forward-thinking people of the world havedesired. Thus through the “centre which we call the race of men” the Plan oflove and light works out and strikes the death blow to evil, selfishness andseparateness, sealing it into the tomb of death forever; thus also the purposeof the Creator of all things will be fulfilled.No one can use this Invocation or prayer for illumination and for love withoutcausing powerful changes in his own attitudes; his life intention, character andgoals will be changed and his life will be altered and made spiritually useful.“As a man thinketh in his heart so is he” is a basic law in nature; the constantturning of the mind to the need for light and the prospect of illuminationcannot and will not be ineffectual. Also, as the work of the Triangles grows andthe network spreads all over the Earth, the idea of a downpouring of light andgoodwill (which is the immediate aspect of love required today among men) can belooked for; nothing can prevent the appearance of the expected results, for theeternal law holds good. The illumination of men’s [169] minds, so that they cansee things as they are, can apprehend right motives and the way to bring aboutright human relations, is now a major need; the motivating power of goodwill isan essential to right action; given these two—light and love—it will not be manydecades before the idea of right human relations will have become the ideal ofthe masses and will be rapidly taking form in all national, public and communityaffairs. The history of humanity has been that of the apprehension and the useof ideas as applied to human living and as expressing forward moving concepts;today the two ideas needed are light upon our way and practical goodwill.I would like now to touch upon some of the deeper meanings for you who aredisciples or who are in training for discipleship. If I can do this, yourmeditation work may be useful in linking hierarchical intent with humanaspiration; such should be the work of all disciples.You will already have noted—as you have studied the Invocation—that the threemajor centres in our planet are linked up: Shamballa, “where the Will of God isknown,” the Hierarchy, where Christ rules and from whence He seeks closercontact among men, and the centre which we call Humanity. There is a closerelation between the first stanza and the final one; humanity’s destiny is, asyou know, to be the exponent of the mind of God, thus expressing activeintelligence, motivated by love and implemented by will. That time has not yetcome, but if human timing is correct and right desire is potent enough, for thefirst time in human history this destiny can be publicly recognised and peoplecan be swept increasingly and voluntarily into an activity which is particularlytheir own destiny. That again is one of the primary objectives of theInvocation; its steady use will bring about an inclusive view of spiritualdevelopment and impart a synthesis to human thinking which has hitherto beenlacking. As “light streams forth into the minds of men” the divine plan will bemore widely sensed and the will-to-good will be more widely desired and invoked.It is necessary always to remember that light is active energy and that love isalso an energy. It is useful also to bear in mind that light and matter aresynonymous terms scientifically [170] and that the network of light is veritablysubstance, and therefore the carrier of goodwill. That is why, consequently, itis necessary to realise that it is one network, composed of two types of energy. For this reason, the work of creating Triangles falls into two categories;some people work more easily with one type of energy than another; it isinteresting also to note that the Triangles of Light are basically more materialthan the Triangles of Goodwill because they are related to substance, to theenergy which mankind wields familiarly, and to etheric matter. The Triangles ofGoodwill are hierarchical in origin. I would ask you to ponder on this.However, in this world crisis, the origin of the network in both its aspects ishierarchical; the Masters work in substance (i.e., light) though not withmatter; the work to be done by Triangle members is consequently purely mentaland hence exceedingly powerful—this of course when rightly done. “Energy followsthought” and the work of the Triangles is that of directing thought. The worktherefore falls into two categories: that of invoking divine aid (to useChristian phraseology) and then—through faith and acceptance—directing theenergies of light and love (which have been invoked) to all men everywhere. Theywill, from the popular attitude, be registered as illumination and goodwill. Itis a deeply scientific work but fundamentally simple. Invocation, prayer oraspiration, meditation—it matters not what word you use—by means of these threemethods spiritual energies are tapped and brought into activity. By clearthinking, directed thought and mental perception, they can be made objects ofhuman desire. Ideas are simply channels for new and desired divine energies;ideals are these ideas changed or reduced into thoughtforms, and thus presentedto the public. Ideas telepathically become ideals, which is another phrasing ofthe old law, “energy follows thought.”The work of the network of light and goodwill, focussed on the plane of mind, isthe utilisation of this knowledge in order to affect the public consciousness.These are points which should be simplified and gradually taught, and in theclearest language, to all Triangle members. The work of the [171] Triangles isto work with the minds of men, and with a factor which is used and exploited byleaders everywhere; the effort is to impress these minds with certain ideaswhich are necessary to human progress. People recognise the present darkness andmisery, and consequently welcome light; men are tired of hating and fighting,and therefore welcome goodwill.Let me touch for a moment upon another point of view. Just as stanzas one andfour are related, so stanza two and the final line are also related. The Planwill be restored on Earth through illumination and goodwill, and when that takesplace Christ will return to Earth. I would ask you not to misunderstand thisphrase. Christ has never left the Earth and He said when bidding farewell to Hisdisciples: “Lo, I am with you always, even until the end of the days.” HisPresence, however, is not recognised by the masses of men, and is only sensedand dimly hoped for by the orthodox religionist of all the world faiths.As I have earlier pointed out, the return of Christ will be expressed, in thefirst place, by an upsurging of the Christ consciousness in the hearts of meneverywhere; its first expression will be goodwill.In the second place, disciples everywhere will find themselves increasinglysensitive to His quality, His voice and His teaching; they will be“overshadowed” by Him in many cases, just as before, He overshadowed Hisdisciple Jesus; through this overshadowing of disciples in all lands, He willduplicate Himself repeatedly. The effectiveness and the potency of theovershadowed disciple will be amazing.One of the first experiments He made as He prepared for this form of activitywas in connection with Krishnamurti. It was only partially successful. The powerused by Him was distorted and misapplied by the devotee type of which theTheosophical Society is largely composed, and the experiment was brought to anend: it served, however, a most useful purpose. As a result of the war, mankindhas been disillusioned; devotion is no longer regarded as adequate or necessaryto the spiritual life or its effectiveness. The war was won, not throughdevotion or the attachment of millions [172] of men to some prized ideal; it waswon by the simple performance of duty, and the desire to safeguard human rights.Few men were heroes, as the newspapers stupidly proclaim. They were drafted andtaught to fight and had to fight. It was a group recognition of duty. WhenChrist again seeks to overshadow His disciples, a different reaction will belooked for. It is because of this that A.A.B. has so consistently belittleddevotion and advocated spiritual independence. No devotee is independent; he isa prisoner of an idea or a person.When Christ comes, there will be a flowering in great activity of His type ofconsciousness among men; when disciples are working under the recognition of theChrist, there will then come the time when He can again move among men in apublic manner; He can be publicly recognised and thus do His work on the outerlevels of living as well as upon the inner. For these three events, which areconnected with the inherent divinity in man, the Hierarchy is working andpreparing, and it will essentially register another of the results of thesuccessful use of the new Invocation to aid in this task of preparation.Those of you who are disciples will easily see the significance of the thirdstanza. Its meaning is that the Invocation as used by the Hierarchy (note this)will help to bring about the evocation of the spiritual will in humanity and therecognition of the divine will by the Hierarchy. There is little that can besaid to the general public anent this third stanza. They will interpret it inall simplicity as a prayer that the human will can be brought into conformitywith the divine will, even though that may not be understood. Even from theangle of the Hierarchy, the divine will as it is essentially remains the greatmystery, but in spite of that They can and do “know and serve” the purpose; thepurpose is that aspect of the divine will which seeks immediate expression onEarth. The Hierarchy is the distributor of energy—the energy of love. Therefore,as the purpose of the will of God (known and understood in the Council Chamberof Shamballa) seeks to influence human will, it is an expression in hierarchicalterms as the will-to-good and in human terms as [173] goodwill, as lovingdetermination or as a fixed intention to bring about right human relations.Even Christ Himself struggled with the problem of the divine will, and addressedHimself to the Monad at the moment when He first realised the extent and thecomplexity of His mission as World Saviour. He then cried aloud: “Father, not Mywill but Thine be done.” Those words marked the relinquishing of the vehiclesthrough which He had been attempting to salvage humanity; it indicated to Himwhat might at that time have appeared to be an apparent failure and that Hismission was not accomplished. For nearly two thousand years He has waited tobring that mission to fruition; it has marked also for Him the entrance into anew cycle of activity; this cycle will culminate during the next three hundredyears in success if this Invocation—as used by all of you and by theHierarchy—proves its effectiveness. He cannot proceed with His assigned missionwithout reciprocal action by humanity.This mantram is peculiarly and essentially Christ’s Own mantram and its “soundhas gone forth” to the entire world through the medium of His enunciation of itand through its use by the Hierarchy. Now its words must go out throughout theentire world by means of its enunciation by men everywhere, and its meaning mustbe expressed by the masses in due time. Then Christ can again “return to Earth”and “see of the travail of His soul and be satisfied.”The final line of the last stanza is also perhaps in need of explanation. Itspeaks of the task of the Plan as implemented by humanity to “seal the doorwhere evil dwells.” This is (needless to say) a symbolic way of expressing theidea of rendering evil purposes both inactive and ineffectual. There is noparticular location where evil dwells; the New Testament in the Book ofRevelations speaks of evil and of the destruction of the devil and of therendering of Satan impotent. Those passages all refer to the same time cyclewith which this Invocation deals and which it seeks to bring about.The “door where evil dwells” is kept open by humanity through its selfishdesire, its hatreds and its separateness, by [174] its greed and its racial andnational barriers, its low personal ambitions and its love of power and cruelty.As goodwill and light stream forth into the minds and hearts of men, these evilqualities and these directed energies which keep the door of evil open will giveplace to a longing for right human relations, to a determination to create abetter and more peaceful world and to a worldwide expression of thewill-to-good. As these qualities supersede the old and undesirable ones, thedoor where evil dwells will symbolically slowly close through the sheer weightof public opinion and through right human desire. Nothing can possibly stop it.Thus the original Plan will be restored on Earth; this is symbolically referredto in the Bible as the Garden of Eden; the Angel with the Flaming Sword will nolonger guard the Door of Initiation into the Kingdom of God, but will betransformed into the Angel of the Presence. Simultaneously, the door into theworld of spiritual reality will open before mankind, and the door where evildwells will be closed. These few thoughts may serve to make this Invocation liveafresh in your minds and take on a new and vital livingness. It is uniquelyrelated to all true and ancient beliefs: it holds out hope for the future, andit is of present import and of practical importance.Your meditation work should be confined exclusively to a deep understanding ofthis stanza* of the Great Invocation, and of the production within yourself ofthe invocative spirit.* Here the Tibetan refers to this Invocation in its entirety as one stanza, thethird and final of three “stanzas” or Invocations. He gave out the first one,beginning with the line, “let the Forces of light bring illumination tomankind”, in 1935, and the second in 1940, beginning, “Let the Lords ofLiberation issue forth.”I am going to give you today a very ancient mantram which is called theAffirmation of a Disciple . It has been used by disciples in the Masters’Ashrams for thousands of years and is today given out by me to all truedisciples; it can now be used by them upon the outer plane and incorporateddaily in their meditation. During this coming year I would like you to follow ameditation procedure as outlined below, the intention of which is to strengthenyour pledge through [175] affirmation, stabilise your orientation and give youintuitive insight into this new Invocation.1. The Stage of Alignment and Recollection . This produces recognition ofspiritual status and objectives. It involves recognition also of the Ashram anddedication to the Master, under two symbols: the soul and the central Point inthe Ashram.2. The Stage of Affirmation . Say with your whole heart as a soul the followingancient mantram:“I am a point of light within a greater Light.I am a strand of loving energy within the stream of love divine.I am a point of sacrificial Fire, focussed within the fiery Will of God.And thus I stand.~I am a way by which men may achieve.I am a source of strength, enabling them to stand.I am a beam of light, shining upon their way.And thus I stand.~And standing thus revolveAnd tread this way the ways of men,And know the ways of God.And thus I stand.”This, brother of mine, is the best I can do with words and phrases as I attemptto transcribe into language words so ancient that they antedate both Sanskritand Senza. But the meaning is clear and that is the point of importance.3. The Stage of Orientation . This is a period of quiet thought upon thesignificance of the affirmation.4. The Stage of Meditation. This is concerned with the four stanzas of the newInvocation. I am going to leave you free to consider this Invocation in your ownway and to approach this most important and significant mantram from the highestpossible point of your individual intuitive perception. I would ask you tomeditate [176] on what appear to you to be the planetary implications, but wouldalso remind you to consider the individual parallels. All that is invoked onbehalf of humanity is also susceptible of interpretation in a personal sense,regarding the personality as the microcosm of the Macrocosm and as the field forthe circulation of light and love, for the expression of the Christ Life and ofthe sacrificial Will, plus the instrument of service and an area in which evilis sealed, frustrated and rendered futile. At the end of the year, I would askyou to embody your understanding of the Invocation and your interpretation of it(both macrocosmically and microcosmically approached) in a paper. These papers,if truly the result of intuitive perception, could constitute a useful book,giving the general public a truer comprehension of words which will conditionthe thinking of spiritually-minded people for many decades.5. The Stage of Fixed Determination.a. A reflection upon the distinction between Purpose, Will and Intention.b. A period of complete, focussed silence as you seek to present an unobstructedchannel for the inflow of light, love and strength from the Hierarchy.c. A statement to the personality, made by you the soul, the disciple:“In the centre of the will of God I stand.Naught shall deflect my will from His.I implement that will by love.I turn towards the field of service.I, the Triangle divine, work out that willWithin the square and serve my fellowmen.”PART IXSix meditations have already been given to you, culminating in the meditation onthe Great Invocation. How closely you have followed this last meditation I knownot. My attention [177] has been occupied with many vital matters and also withthe effort to render futile a series of attacks upon the Hierarchy; these arebeing engineered in various parts of the world by spurious claimants to worlddiscipleship. They were mainly aimed at A.A.B., and she could have absorbedthem, as she has frequently done in the past, had it not been for the directline of attack on my Ashram.... As I have told you, my Ashram, and to a lesserextent that of K.H., have felt some of the repercussions, and A.A.B. has beenunable to deflect all of it. I have had, therefore, to do some protective work;that is now finished, and I am somewhat freer.I plan to give you the seventh and last meditation, and with these sevenoutlined meditations you will have plenty of work to do for the remainder ofthis incarnation. The ones hitherto given are all planned and sequentiallyrelated to each other. The first one started with the heart, as must all divineexpression and all true creative work. Next the factor of energy was consideredand the seven points of energy reception were noted. Then followed an exerciseon alignment, so that the structure or the “set-up” (if I may use such a word)of the inner spiritual man might be correctly oriented and aligned, and thuspresent no obstacle to the inflow of divine energy. These three meditations areof major importance, but quite elementary. They had, however, to precede anymeditation (and its subsequent effects) that was in any way related to my Ashramas was the next. A meditation on certain theme words, as they embodied an idea,was then given; the meditation was totally different to the preceding three inits emphasis, which now has no relation to the disciple—as had the earlierthree; they related almost entirely to preparatory work for ashramic service.The first definite act of this type of service was embodied for you in the sixthmeditation, in which the group was given the task (or rather the spiritualenterprise) of launching the great Invocation. The magnitude of this task youhave never realised and you have done little of a truly objective nature tobring this Invocation to the attention of the public. Three of you have done agreat deal; the rest little or nothing at all.[178] Now I will outline for you a meditation which is not easy for you to do,but which symbolises both the vertical and the horizontal life of the disciple;this meditation is, again, built up around certain words esotericallyunderstood.1. Affirm earnestly your discipleship and endeavour to link up with me, as theMaster of the Ashram.2. Say the Great Invocation, emphasising one of the four stanzas during each ofthe four weeks of the month, and dwelling on its significance longer than theothers.3. Your meditation must then be built up around eight words which you canarrange within your consciousness in the following manner:[Image00006.jpg]This Cross concerns your VERTICAL life[Image00007.jpg]This Cross concerns your HORIZONTAL lifeThe mode of your application of all this must be related to your daily lifeexpression, and at some point you (the incarnated soul) must realise the factualnature of your dual life as a disciple. This the superimposed Crosses show.[179][Image00008.jpg]4. Give ten or fifteen minutes to the consideration of the Vertical-Horizontallife and note how one vertical line supports the other lines in many cases, butthat no horizontal lines do this.5. Taking your stand at the point where all the lines meet, endeavour to realiseyourself as the one at the centre, radiating throughout your most definitelydefined ring-pass-not.6. Then sound the OM seven times inaudibly.One of the formulas, brother of old, is related to this meditation. You wouldfind it of value to contrast what is said.PART XIn the last set of papers I gave you a group meditation; this completed a unitof seven meditations, all of which were sequential and all of which wereintended to bring about creative results in your lives.I would like to repeat at this time some of the ideas which I earlier gave you;I would like also to show you the synthesis of the entire seven meditations anddemonstrate to you how they can lead the aspirant on, step by step, fromknowledge into wisdom; I would like you to grasp the fact that if thesemeditations are carefully followed by you they can change you from aheart-focussed aspirant to an ashramic worker, implementing the GreatInvocation. This Invocation, which I have lately given to you, is the groupprayer of all humanity in the Aquarian Age; therefore it is essential that everydisciple (aspiring to the service of humanity) should make its distribution aswell as its daily use a major duty and obligation. This I have earlier impressedupon you and would ask you now if you are doing so?Meditation I . . . Heart Control . . . TransferenceYou have here a technique whereby you create a line of related energy betweenthe solar plexus centre and the heart centre. This is in reality a reflection ora symbolic activity [180] (within the physical man, or rather, his ethericcentres) of the building of the antahkarana. Bear in mind here, as always, thatthe etheric body is a physical mechanism.It was this meditation which started the rhythm which made possible thepresentation of the new Invocation to the world; I refer not solely to its useby you but to its use by many disciples in many Ashrams. The exhaustion ofemotion and its transference—as a force—into the heart, there to be transmutedinto the energy of love, was symbolically undertaken during the time thathumanity was developing certain new recognitions. Humanity, through theexhaustion of emotional energy (incidental to the war agony) is today far moreheart-conscious than at any other time in its history. Had you realised that andthe opportunity with which you were presented?The world of men has been subjected to such strain and suffering that hundredsof thousands in nearly every land—either factually or imaginatively—could “feel”no more; the solar plexus centre could take or absorb no more. Nothing was leftto the sufferer but the realisation that all men everywhere were in a similarplight and that this community of shared agony brought all men together,irrespective of nation, religion or class.Therefore, for the first time in their history, humanity began to recognise adefinite phase of universality: mankind as a whole began to “share in theheart’s reaction.” This happened so generally and so acutely that the heart—as amotivating radiance—became a point of human focus. One of the first fruits ofsuffering, as universally shared, has appeared on Earth, and in its appearingall future suffering will be greatly lessened.I seek to give this first meditation an added importance in your eyes. Much thatI have given you has significance far beyond your crediting; these significanceswill appear if you follow instructions and do these meditations carefully,regularly and sincerely. It would profit you much in the years to come if youfollowed this meditation formula each day for two months, doing so withintensity. You should also endeavour to realise not only your individualreaction, but to [181] recognise also the symbolic import of what you are doing.Those of you also who know with certainty that you are being specificallyprepared for the second initiation would do well to follow this meditation forone week in each month of the year.Meditation II . . . Directed Energy . . . CirculationThis meditation constitutes the second stage of the first one given. That firstmeditation was in the nature of a foundational exercise, related to the controland the direction of energy; it was so planned that it could enable you to enterinto the field of energies and from there—choosing the needed energy—direct aparticular type of energy through some particular centre to a particular point.I gave you only the preliminary idea, for all physical plane demonstrations arefounded on an ideal. Do not forget that “as a man thinketh in his heart, so ishe.” There is therefore a direct relation between Meditation I and MeditationII; the first makes the second possible and eventually effective.This meditation, when practised, understood and perfected, prepares the disciplefor the work which he will later do as a Master or an initiate. He willmanipulate energies in line with the Plan; he will then direct such energiesfrom his own place within the Ashram, using his own etheric body as theimplementing factor. He has consequently to begin with the energies workingthrough his own centres before he can proceed to direct ashramic force throughthem from what is referred to as the heart centre of the Hierarchy. There is,symbolically speaking, a heart centre in every major and every secondary Ashram,and these heart centres pour their energy through the central centre in theHierarchy; it is used as a reservoir of energy. Disciples have to learn to workwith this pure energy of love as it blends with the forces of the disciple’s ownray: that, in turn, colours somewhat the Ashram with which he is affiliated.It is necessary, therefore, for you to extend your thinking about themeditation, as given above, so that it may become Ashramic in nature and effect.Thereby you are trained to [182] use the heart and to work with and throughheart centres wherever they are found in manifestation. I have here given you amost valuable hint and item of information. In this connection it is valuable tobear in mind that the first meditation has relation to the heart centre in thespine, and that this second meditation is only effective when the disciple canwork with the heart centre in the head. As soon as this becomes possible, thedisciple realises three things:1. The relation of the heart centre to the twelve-petalled lotus in the head.2. The necessity of directing the energy of love (the product of the activity ofthe heart centre) to the service of humanity via the ajna centre.3. The establishing of a triangle in the etheric body, composed of a line ofenergy between:a. The twelve-petalled lotus in the head.b. This lotus and the ajna centre.c. The ajna centre and the heart centre. This creates a peculiar triangle:[Image00009.jpg]This is in reality more in the nature of a funnel of reception than a triangle.This is also the first esoteric triangle of energy which the disciple creates.Later comes the creation of a spiritual triangle in the head between:a. The ajna centre and the thousand-petalled lotus. This becomes effectivephysically through the medium of the pineal gland and the pituitary body. [183]b. The thousand-petalled lotus and that focal point or junction of energies tobe found in the medulla oblongata, and which is called the alta major centre.This centre becomes physically effective through the carotid gland.c. The alta major centre and the ajna centre.You have, therefore, another triangle, of the following nature:[Image00010.jpg]Here you have, therefore, some of the concepts which are implicit in this secondmeditation; they indicate a free, flexible and fluid interplay between all thecentres involved.Meditation III . . . Alignment . . . Mode of ContactThis deeply esoteric alignment exercise is preparatory for a state of moreoccult and general alignment; of this alignment, the effective use of the newGreat Invocation will be an expression. In this third meditation you have man,the spiritual man, grounded in the soul, entering into a close contact (leadingeventually to fusion) with the Spiritual Triad, the reflection of the Monad.This is done through the alignment of heart, mind and will. Thus is a worldserver created. This alignment exercise (when correctly and persistentlyfollowed) will find expression as a Master upon the physical plane. It mustinevitably produce the initiate. It “seals to him the door where evil dwells,”in the personality sense. The Invocation, when rightly used by humanity and whenit becomes a world prayer, will enable humanity—as a whole—to express Light andLove and Power and also to seal the door where evil dwells, using the word“evil” here in a very much wider and larger sense than when individually [184]used. All these results—individual and general—are brought about by rightalignment.Nine is, as you know, my brother, the number of initiation. It presupposes thealignment of three different triplicities;1. The threefold Personality.2. The three aspects of the Soul.3. The Spiritual Triad.When these have been correctly aligned and the resultant integrity has beenstabilised and fully accepted, the disciple then becomes a Master; He is nowready to tread the Way of the Higher Evolution. There is then a direct channelof contact—whenever needed and desired for service—with the physical brain andalso an alignment or unimpeded relation between:1. The disciple and Humanity The throat or creative centre in the planetarysense. 2. The disciple and the Hierarchy The heart centre of the planetaryLogos. 3. The disciple and Shamballa The head centre of the planetary Logos.These are great and abstruse esoteric facts. The use of the Invocation willlikewise relate human beings within the ring-pass-not of humanity itself; itwill bring the human centre en rapport with the Hierarchy, creating a freeinterplay between the two of them and thus making possible the appearance of theKingdom of God on Earth.Meditation IV . . . Spiritual Livingness . . . Ashramic RelationIn assigning this meditation I made a remark of major importance. I said thatthis meditation was the first one given by me which carries the disciple intothe true world of esotericism. It concerns his relation to that vortex ofspecial [185] energies which we call an Ashram. It is therefore intended toteach the disciple how to absorb energy and what to contribute of energy to thewhole; it does this not by indicating the modes and acceptances of transference,but by establishing a constant habit of spiritual livingness . One sentence wasparticularly a key to my comments. “Disciples need to build into their brainconsciousness a stable recognition of relationship and of attitude.” So much ofthe life of a disciple, even when he has been admitted into an Ashram as anearned right, remains esoteric, below the surface and almost entirelysubjective. Of this the iceberg is by far the best symbol. His knowledge andcapacities and his spiritual abilities do not become a practical demonstrationin daily life, as they should. Esoteric knowledge is not intended to drive yourspiritual life into greater and increasing subjectivity; the goal is not a moreinward life and a training which will make of you a true introspective andconsequently a pure mystic. Exactly the reverse is intended; all that thedisciple essentially is upon the inner planes has to become objective; thus hisspiritual livingness becomes an everyday affair.It is here that the dual life of discipleship starts and at the same timedemonstrates its essential unity. The disciple becomes outwardly effective. HisAshramic consciousness and his power to function as a disciple or an initiatemust be blended with his transformed personality life, until gradually “the twobecome the One.” In the last analysis, discipleship is the recognition by theMaster of a certain stage (elementary, at first) of fusion, and then a traininggiven and a process instituted which create a still greater fusion. It is thisthat the meditation here given is intended to facilitate.Meditation V . . . Precipitation . . . ReceptionEach of these meditations carries the practising disciple on to greater insight,or should do so, if properly approached and correctly employed. One of theprinciple tasks of the combined Hierarchy is the presentation to humanity of thebasic divine ideas; in this manner They mould human ideals and consequently intime create its current civilisation, thus [186] providing a field for itsculture. The culture approximates the ideal closer than does its civilisation.Disciples must be taught this work of presentation and the relation of time andthe event. A right sense of timing is something that every worker for theHierarchy must cultivate. Before, however, he can do this, he has to recogniseand work with ideas himself, learn the mode of approach and the consequent useof that “raincloud of knowable things” (to which Patanjali refers) and later howto translate these contacted ideas into practical ideals. As time proceeds, this“raincloud” will become more generally recognised; scientists will begin torealise that it is the true source or fount of all ideas and of the inspirationwhich makes their work possible; they will develop a technique of directedconcentration which will enable them to attain that source of ideas and toprofit by its existence.Such ideas are contacted usually at first in the form of vague perceptions orremote prophecies; when contacted by churchmen of any of the world religions,these ideas normally receive a far too literal, and therefore misleading,interpretation. This has been responsible for much misery in the world. Thescientific method safeguards the scientist from this type of error.Part of my task within my Ashram is to train disciples to recognise the new,emerging ideas and translate them into the concepts which will condition humanthinking in the cycle just ahead. The second stage of this training involves thecultivation of a correct sense of timing . This will prevent the disciple fromtaking precipitate or premature action; it will give him the key to the realmeaning of the Eternal Now —the synthesis of Past, Present and Future. He willnext be taught the art of precipitation, or the mode of conveying these ideas tothe minds of the intellectuals in the world. Through these concrete andreceptive minds the presented ideas are transformed into ideals and then arebrought to the attention of humanity. The place and the responsibility of theintelligentsia is not yet fully appreciated, nor have they truly shoulderedtheir task or recognised its defined [187] importance. Their work and theirpresentation of the ideal to the masses of men everywhere does not concern thedisciple. His work lies primarily with the advanced, pioneering thinker and notwith the demanding masses. I would ask you to remember this.Therefore, when I gave you the fifth meditation I gave you also twelve words forconsideration in meditation. They were intended to evoke your abstract mind andtheir obvious meaning and significance was not intended to form a part of yourthinking. As you later review these words, I would have you consider them:1. As embodying the viewpoint of the Spiritual Triad.2. As part of the work assigned to you in leading humanity forward. These wordshave new and prophetic meanings and you must discover for yourselves what theyare.This you have not yet done, and in neither of these two ways have you trulymeditated on the given words. It is essential that there be a reorganisation ofyour meditation technique in these two directions. Your entire meditation workis too concrete. There are the twelve words which I earlier gave you (Page 144).Please use one each month in your meditation work.Meditation VI . . . The New Invocation . . . Spiritual InflowI wonder, brother of mine, if you have grasped the momentous significance ofthis presentation of a cosmic, planetary and individual alignment exercise,prayer or invocation? It provides, as a result of its correct use, a spiritualinflow—right to the very heart of humanity and from the highest sources. For thereception of this last part or final stanza of the great hierarchical“Invocation for Power and Light,” all previous teaching you have received andall your earlier meditation work was simply an elementary prelude. In receivingthis Invocation, in its use and distribution, you have [188] been participatingin a cosmic event of tremendous importance. The intention—connected with thisInvocation—is as follows:1. To focus the inchoate mass demand of humanity on to the highest possiblelevel.2. To initiate a great invocative cycle wherein invocation will unify, blend andbring together the two methods (hitherto in use) of prayer and meditation.3. To give to the world a new prayer.This meditation or invocation is essentially a prayer. It can, however, be usedwith profound effectiveness, primarily by those who know something ofmeditation; they have a special and peculiar advantage over the average man whois accustomed to pray, because the technique of meditation brings in the factorof mental concentration and an intense focussing. The trained disciple cantherefore use this Invocation on several levels simultaneously.This Invocation is no t, however, a meditation exercise; it is essentially aprayer, synthesising the highest desire, aspiration and spiritual demand of thevery soul of humanity itself. It must be used in that way. When the traineddisciple or the aspirant in training uses it, he will assume the attitude ofmeditation—that is, an attitude of concentration, spiritual direction andreceptivity. Then he will pray . The attitude of the occult student who hasthrown over in disgust all old religious practices, and believes that he has nofurther need or use for prayer, or that he has passed to a higher phase, that ofmeditation, is not a correct one. The true position is that he uses both at willand at need. In connection with the Invocation he assumes the attitude ofmeditation (an inner mental attitude and firm assumption), but employs themethod of prayer which—when divorced from all relation to the separated self—isa potent means of establishing and maintaining right spiritual and humanrelations. When in the attitude of meditation and using the implement of prayer(by means of the Invocation), he attains a relationship with the mass ofhumanity not otherwise possible, he can implement [189] their recognised thoughunvoiced need, and he also allies himself with the Hierarchy, Who work from thecosmic astral plane but—through the use of the planetary antahkarana—work alsoon buddhic-mental levels and are evoked by the desire of the mass of men.I do not intend to deal further here with the Invocation, because I did so fullyin the earlier meditation instructions. I earnestly beg you, however, to rereadwhat I there wrote.Meditation VII . . . The Cross . . . Spiritual PositionIt is an occult truism to say that the disciple is crucified upon the FixedCross of the Heavens. This he is prepared always to accept, for he knows frombitter experience how true it is; he lives in the recognition that the life ofthe disciple is hard and its exigencies are inescapable. Curiously enough, agood deal of this recognition is based upon an unconscious and unrealisedself-pity. To offset this unrecognised habit of thought, this meditation isintended to teach the disciple to create—with deliberate intention—his owncross, and in this manner do away with his idea (again unrealised) that thecross is the result of his point in evolution, that it is imposed upon him byastrological conditions, and that through it the Lords of Karma work, exactingfrom him the full price for all past misdeeds. This, in reality, is not so.By the time a man is admitted into an Ashram he has already worked off a verygreat deal of his karma, both good and bad, and is now ready to build his owncross upon which he takes his stand—with his hands stretched out in blessing .That is the idea underlying this seventh meditation on the vertical and thehorizontal position of the practising disciple. In this meditation you thereforehave:The Vertical Life1. God , or the divine Reality, veiled by all forms.2. The polar opposite to this, i.e., the matter in which this divine nature isexpressed.3. The method , based on ray tendencies, of this revelation. [190]4. The polar opposite, i.e., achievement . The trained disciple works alwaysfrom the angle of achievement, of attained success. This attitude he assumes asregards himself, the serving disciple, and the work to be done.The Horizontal Life1. Unity . As a result of his successful vertical life, the disciple feelshimself at-one with all life in all forms and with humanity in particular.2. This works out naturally in understanding . Because there are absolutely nobarriers present, and there is also no realisation of difference, the disciplecan “tune in” on the life in all forms, and therefore enter into a full measureof inclusiveness, with all that that word implies.3. His motivation is that of goodwill , which is a growing potency as thewill-to-good (which he contacts indirectly in the Ashramic life) begins toaffect him. Ponder on this statement. The goodwill of the masses is based oninnate divine tendency; that of the disciple is based on knowledge andreceptivity to certain energies from Shamballa.4. This goodwill—as it is released—produces a normal expression upon thephysical plane.You have, consequently, the crosses (+ x) which—when superimposed, provide amost interesting chart for the disciple’s life. This meditation, therefore,provides a complete and rounded-out form for the disciple to follow: it willsuffice him for many years to come. I have given you only a few hints in theabove analysis, but you can arrive at much greater light on the matter if youwill definitely realise that your daily life is based on a vertical attitude anda horizontal effectiveness.In these seven meditations, my brothers, you have all you need in order to makeprogress in your own life and also in the group life—functioning subjectively atpresent. If you [191] follow these meditations with care in the years to come,you will find that they will lead to an extension of your service, which (as faras the majority of you are concerned) has not been of great importance.These seven meditations make a perfect synthesis of recognitions, of unfoldmentand of spiritual direction; if they are followed with care, they will eliminateselfishness and build in ashramic quality.PART XIIn our last series of instructions I summed up or summarised all the meditations(seven in number) which I have given to the group. I tried to show you thesequence of critical points in the life of the man in training for initiation.The last of these meditations was called The Cross as the Expression of theVertical and the Horizontal Life. This was portrayed by the two crosses:[Image00011.jpg]To these two symbols of the life of the disciple I seek at this time to addanother one, which is a symbol of the attitude you should hold during the cycleinto which you are now entering.You will see that I have combined the two crosses of the vertical and horizontallife with the cross of Humanity [192] and have also added a circle at the summitof all three. What, my brother, does this mean? It signifies the following:[Image00012.jpg]1. That the vertical life of spiritual contact with the Ashram is constantlypreserved by meditation, prayer and concentration.2. That the horizontal life of service is preserved with equal care and thatthere is a constant stream of planned energy going out to all those who needhelp.3. The long limb of the triple cross symbolises to the disciple that he must godown into the very depths of human life in order to prepare the masses for thereappearance of the Christ and for the externalisation of the Hierarchy.4. The sphere at the summit of the cross portrays the “place of the disciple’sconsciousness.” His life of reflection, of constant awareness, and the steadyfocus of his attention is higher than the vertical life of the aspirant, thanhis horizontal life of service, and indicates the measure of his consciousactivity in the Ashram. Forget not that an Ashram in the Hierarchy is on ahigher plane than that of the soul.He is therefore alive and active on three levels of activity simultaneously, andis in the process of demonstrating—as far as in him lies and his degree ofdiscipleship permits—the three divine aspects: the Will aspect, governing hiswork within the Hierarchy in relation to the coming great movement; the Loveaspect, governing his vertical life and producing [193] spiritual steadfastnessin form; the Intelligence aspect, governing his horizontal life and making him awise server of his fellowmen. Finally, the long line from the point of radiantspiritual focus symbolises the Path from the highest point attained by thedisciple to the lowest point of service.You will notice also, in this symbol, that the secondary point of focus appearswhere all the lines meet and cross each other. This point represents thedisciple’s personality, into which the higher radiance must pour and from whichspiritual energy reaches out on all sides. Also, if you will study and think fora while, it will be apparent to you that this cross is only correctlyappropriated by (or is symbolic of) the man who has built (or is in process ofbuilding) the antahkarana. Where that bridge is not created the consciousness ofthe aspirant cannot focus in the Ashram or upon the intuitional levels ofconsciousness.You can see, therefore, why I have given out the teaching upon the Antahkarana.It was done in order that the completion of the antahkarana could besystematically and scientifically carried out by you. I shall not, therefore,repeat the instructions here; you have them and should follow them carefully,bearing in mind that you have at least bridged the gap between the personalityand the Spiritual Triad to a certain extent, and that for you the need is tocomplete and strengthen the Rainbow Bridge and then to use it with facility.The symbology of the antahkarana tends badly to complicate the grasp of its realnature. May I remind you that, just as the soul is not a twelve-petalled lotusfloating around in mental substance, but is in reality a vortex of force ortwelve energies held together by the will of the spiritual entity (the Monad onits own plane), so the antahkarana is not a series of energy threads, slowlywoven by the soul-infused personality, and met by corresponding threadsprojected by the Spiritual Triad, but is in reality a state of awareness. Thesesymbols are true and living forms, created through the power of thought by thedisciple, but—in time and space—they have no true existence. The only trueexistence [194] is the Monad on its own plane, active, expressive Will inemergence, and in turn, active Love in establishing relationships and equallyactive Intelligence in the use of the two higher energies. It must not beforgotten that the energy of intelligence, focussed in the mind, is theinstrument or implementing agency of the other two monadic energies.H.P.B. taught that the antahkarana was primarily the channel of energy relatingforms and their forces to their originating sources and that across the mentalplane (with its three aspects of mind) the life thread necessarily passed,linking Monad, soul and personality into one living whole. Technically speaking,therefore, there is no need for the so-called bridge, except for one importantfactor: there is, on the part of the soul-infused personality, a definite breakin consciousness between the lower mind and the abstract mind. The higher mind(being the lowest aspect of the Spiritual Triad) can be regarded as a dooradmitting the consciousness of the soul-infused personality into a higher realmof contact and awareness. But again—as you can well see—there is nothing herebut symbolism; there is no door, but simply a symbol indicating means of access.In the total evolution of the spiritual man through physical incarnation duringuntold hundreds of lives, the entire process is simply one of expandingconsciousness and of attaining—sequentially and stage by stage—an ever moreinclusive awareness. This is good to bear in mind, for eventually all thissymbolic picturing will give place to reality. The task—and it is a real one—ofbuilding the antahkarana and creating that which will bridge the gap is in truththe planned and conscious effort to project the focussed thought of thespiritual man from the lower mental plane into areas of awareness which havebeen sensed but not contacted ; it entails using the totality of the awarenessalready developed and already “enlightened” by the soul, and (with deliberation)making it increasingly sensitive to the focussed activity of the world of thehigher spiritual realities; it is directing the stream of conscious thoughttowards the sensed and theoretically recognised world of the Masters, of theSpiritual Triad and, finally, of Shamballa. Disciples should remember [195] thatthe Higher Way of Evolution is far simpler than the lower way, and thattherefore the teaching on the significance and the meaning of theantahkarana—which is the first creation of the soul-infused personality actingas a unitary being—is far simpler than that relating to the personality in thethree worlds of human evolution.I would ask you to ponder on these matters, because out of the practice of groupmeditation should grow that conscious, focussed attitude which can be regardedas reflection —an act of reflection which, because the consciousness is heldsteady in the light, because the antahkarana is a realisation to the disciple,and because the mind is oriented towards the Spiritual Triad, is a definitefactual experience.It is a reflection carried on throughout all the vicissitudes of life andautomatically registers these events; it therefore builds or creates that streamof ascending energy which is tinctured by the life qualities and the developedray characteristics. Along that stream, the life qualities and the developed raycharacteristics can pass at will; the disciple will increasingly register the“things of the spirit,” as it is called in the New Testament; he willconsequently acquire the facility to penetrate into the world of the Hierarchy,and to reach eventually the door to the Way of the Higher Evolution. He will atthe same time function in the three worlds as a serving disciple.With this simple presentation of the antahkarana, you may find it easier to workduring the coming year. As this thought-projection process or exercise becomes apart of your normal state of mind, it will serve also to focus you upon themental plane, thus withdrawing your attention from the world of the emotions andof desire or aspiration and placing you “upon the lighted point upon the lightedway, where light may shine and show a star which shines above the brow of theInitiator.”I suggest to you that you take the seven meditations and work regularly withthem. I suggested this to you a year ago. Few of you took my advice or haveadhered to the process or followed the rhythm set up by the sequence ofmeditations. I suggest that you give two months to each of the meditations,[196] thus covering a period of fourteen months; then, I suggest that you makeMeditation VII your major meditation, to be followed for one year. If this isdone by you as directed and with no questioning as to effectiveness, you willunderstand far more clearly the projection—realistic and energising—which thepersonal consciousness will register.I shall give you no more meditation outlines. The careful following of thosegiven will do much for you during the remainder of your lives. You need no more.PART XIII would like today to extend the teaching given in the preceding instructionanent the antahkarana and expound to you—from the group angle —a paragraph theregiven; I will here rephrase it.It is a reflection—a conscious focussed attitude—carried forward in all lifecircumstances, which automatically registers the events conditioning the life ofhumanity. It therefore creates a stream of ascending energy which is tincturedby the life quality and the ray characteristics of the group personnel. Alongthis stream both the ascending and the descending life quality and raycharacteristics can pass at will and the disciple will increasingly register the“things of the spirit”; he will consequently acquire the facility to penetrateinto the world of the Hierarchy and reach eventually the door to the Way of theHigher Evolution. He will, again consequently, function efficiently in the threeworlds as the serving disciple .In this paragraph you have indicated the spiritual, meditative way of life ofthe individual disciple in relation to his own soul, and later to the Ashram;you have the group way of life, as it penetrates into the Hierarchy, and youhave also the hierarchical technique which enables that great Group to penetrateinto a still higher spiritual centre and bring down from Shamballa thatunderstanding of divine Purpose [197] which will precipitate as the hierarchicalPlan; this will enable the Hierarchy to form a great serving group. No matterhow high you may go in the scale of being, you will find—from the fourth kingdomof nature onward—that the technique of meditation governs all expansions ofconsciousness, all registration of Plan or Purpose and, in fact, the entireprocess of evolutionary unfoldment. It is a technique of spiritual apprehension,of focussing attention on some level of consciousness or other, and also oforiginating modes of contact.The entire Science of Invocation and Evocation is contained in the word“meditation”; this science ranges from the subjective, unconscious appeal of theinchoate, voiceless masses, through many phases, until it attains that high modeof scientific invocation which governs the contact made in the Council Chamberof Shamballa with extra-planetary sources of spiritual inflow. It is throughmeditation in some form or another that contact is made; this again isprogressive in nature. The formulated idea of the unspiritual man to make acontact with that which will later condition his life and lead to a bettermentof his daily life in a material sense, or which will make living possible, isperhaps the lowest aspect; the brooding, experimental thinking of the scientistor artist is another form of meditation and higher in purpose and in intention,and this meditative process is better formulated and has (if you thinkcorrectly) definite group implications. The mode whereby the Members ofHierarchy and the personnel of Their Ashrams arrive at an intense spiritualperception, and arrive also at a selfless formulation of the divine Plan whichwill implement divine Purpose in the world, is likewise an expansion of allprevious meditations; whilst the concentrated clear and dynamic invocation ofthe spiritual Beings Who have created—or more accurately—have formed Shamballa,is the highest form of meditation possible upon our planet.It might also be stated that it is meditation which is responsible fortransforming the desire of the ordinary human being upon our planet into thespiritual will, which is ever the agent of the Purpose. It is thereforemeditation which [198] produces individual, group and planetary alignment, andthis alignment is always the first stage of the meditation objective and thefinal or permanent stage attained. Think on this.Meditation is also eliminative in its effects and (if I may use such a term)ejects out of the individual and out of the group that which is undesirable—fromthe angle of the immediate spiritual goal.Meditation is essentially the highest instrument and the perfected consummationof the third divine aspect, that of intelligent activity, and—as I have earlierpointed out—is from every possible angle carried on within the ring-pass-not ofthe Universal Mind. It is the essential, divine Prompter, the predominantcreative agent, and the factor which fuses and blends every aspect in the greatHierarchy of Being which is related to the basic spiritual nature of our planet;this was our major inheritance from the previous solar system—the Mind or ActiveIntellect.Meditation brings into creative alignment instinct, intellect and the intuition,as well as conscious Identification. It relates (in an indissoluble unity) theso-called lower or concrete mind, the group mind, the hierarchical mind and theuniversal Mind; it leads to a conscious alignment of the disciple’s centres andalso of the three planetary Centres; it is invocative, demanding, fusing,receptive and distributory in nature. In the disciple it is the agent whichcreates or builds the antahkarana, controls—via the soul or the SpiritualTriad—the head centre, which is the point of focus, of spiritual appeal and ofspiritual reception; it controls also the ajna centre (the centre between theeyebrows) which, in the disciple, is the prime agent for the distribution ofspiritual energy.In the group, meditation leads to the fusion of the group personnel, to theirunited invocative appeal, and—when invocation has evoked response—it leads togroup receptivity to that which has been spiritually demanded, and thus to thespiritual service of the group.In the Hierarchy, meditation takes two major forms, and [199] (you mustremember) in that great spiritual Centre meditation is an instinctual habit andneeds no forced process:1. Meditation is that which sets in motion hierarchical response to theinvocative appeal rising from the three worlds, and mainly to the invocativeappeal carried forward consciously by all who pray, all who make mystical appealand all who employ the method of occult meditation and direct invocation.2. Meditation is the instinctual mode whereby the Hierarchy—in response to theinvocation from the three worlds—approaches the higher Centre, Shamballa; thenthe Hierarchy evokes the energies, the Beings and the spiritual inflow whichhierarchical service in the immediate future requires. It is also—in a uniquesense—the technique whereby the Masters Themselves prepare for the sixthinitiation, thus conditioning the Path of Life upon which They will eventuallyfind Themselves and pass thence to higher cosmic undertakings.You can see, therefore, why I have laid such emphasis upon your individualmeditation, but have also laid a still greater emphasis upon group meditation.Nevertheless, I have only been endeavouring to turn your instinct towardsspiritual expression into scientific lines; I have sought also to initiate youinto a planetary technique which all planetary beings must and do master.Meditation, in its most rudimentary form, is the instinct which leads torecognition of the physical Sun and governs, for instance, the turning ofplanetary vegetable life towards the Sun as its dominant source of life. In itsintermediate form, it is that which reveals to the aspirant and to the Hierarchythe Heart of the Sun, and—in its highest form—it is the mode of contact whichrelates the highest Beings on our planet to the Central Spiritual Sun. In everycase, I would like to point out that this capacity to meditate (the spiritualexpression of the mental processes) [200] focusses itself in certain groupformations which it would profit us briefly to consider.It might be said that, intermediate between the great planetary centres, a groupof those who can meditate creatively can be found; they are chosen out of eachof the larger centres and from among those who are already accustomed tomeditation. I would like to pause at this point and ask you to remember that Irefer not here to religious meditation, strictly understood, or to thoseinvocative appeals for help and aid which are so closely associated in the mindof the western Christian thinker. I refer to all who—in quiet reflection,focussed appeal and with a true background of knowledge—are able to “thinkthrough” into a higher state of consciousness than the one of which they arenormally aware; in that higher state they arrive at those intuitional andspiritual “discoveries” which can produce the seed of a new creation, or whichcan open up (for those unable thus to meditate) a new field of possibleawareness. The motive of all such group meditation must be selfless service; thekeynote of all such groups is creativity; they are all of them demonstrations ofthe perfected third aspect of active intelligence, plus other developingaspects; all of them are in direct relation or alignment with one of the Buddhasof Activity, Who embody within Themselves the essence of the third Ray of ActiveIntelligence, through which the third aspect can successfully project andexpress itself. It is these three Buddhas Who were instrumental in the amazingand occult process of implementing the mental principle upon our planet, andWho—through Their creative meditation—brought our planet, the Earth, and theplanet Venus into direct alignment. This made possible the comings of the Sonsof Mind and the formation of the fourth kingdom in nature, Humanity. They areEmbodiments of the intuition, and control the inflow of intuitional energy intothe minds of men.The point which I would have you bear in mind is that these intermediate groupsof Workers Who know the power of meditation are primarily creative, and that theefficacy of Their work is demonstrated in the larger group whose behests [201]They are carrying out and in the group which is creatively influenced by themeditation work accomplished.Curiously enough, in view of the fact that the principle of Mind is the fifthprinciple, there are five major groups which function primarily through“creative and sustaining” meditation. These are:1. The New Group of World Servers.2. The Ashram, with which disciples in the New Group of World Servers may beaffiliated.3. The Hierarchy itself, the Ashram of Sanat Kumara.4. The Nirmanakayas or the “inspired Contemplatives.”5. The higher correspondence of the Nirmanakayas Who find Their place inrelation to Shamballa; this is analogous to that of the Nirmanakayas to theHierarchy.The personnel of these groups is supplied from the larger groups to which theyare intermediate:1. The New Group of World Servers gathers its personnel out of the greatplanetary centre called Humanity.a. The more advanced members of the group are affiliated with some Ashram withinthe ring-pass-not of the Hierarchy.b. The greater Ashram, composed of many Ashrams, is the fulfilled production ofthe New Group of World Servers, down the ages. This is a statement full ofimportant implications.2. The Nirmanakayas gather Their personnel out of the Hierarchy, the secondgreat planetary centre. Their relation to Shamballa is not one of affiliation,nor is it the same as that of the New Group of World Servers to the Hierarchy.Their major relationship is with the Triangle of the Buddhas of Activity, and itis under Their creative inspiration that They work. This stream of inspirationor of “energy flooded with creative light” is made available to the Hierarchy atall [202] times and when needed for Their creative work; it is a part of thatdynamic, galvanising energy which feeds the enthusiasm of the New Group of WorldServers, binds them together in the One Work, and enables them to workintelligently and with creative ability.3. A mysterious body of what have been called “Reflecting Lights”; the Membersof this group are to a certain extent extra-planetary. They are affiliated withShamballa and focus cosmic creative energy, thus making it available (on demand)to the Members of the Council Chamber at Shamballa. There is little that we needconsider about Them; They are the “Helpers of the Lord of the World,” andimplement His purposes as they are formulated by Him on the cosmic mental plane.The point which I seek to emphasise, and which I hope will remain in your minds,is that this technique of meditation is the outstanding creative agent on ourplanet . When you, as an individual, are endeavouring to “build the new man inChrist” which will be an expression of your true spiritual self, meditation is,as you well know, your best agent; but the meditation process must beaccompanied by creative work, or else it is purely mystical, and though notfutile, is nevertheless negative in creative results.Members of the New Group of World Servers are gathered from all branches ofhuman enterprise, of which organised religion is only one. There are scientistswho, repudiating violently the unproven, yet are giving all they have ofscientific ability and knowledge to the service of humanity—each in his chosenscientific field; there are men of financial stature who regard money as aresponsibility to be dispensed wisely in the service of others, yet the mysticalor occult terminology may mean nothing whatsoever to them; there are educators,preoccupied with wise formulations of knowledge and with an encyclopedicunderstanding of the garnered wisdom of the ages, which they seek to utilise infitting the younger generation to live beautifully, constructively andcreatively; there are churchmen and religious leaders (in [203] some one orother of the world religions) who are not tied or handicapped by the form; thespirit of light is in them and they intelligently love their fellowmen. All ofthese people, if they are members of the New Group of World Servers, mustinevitably be reflecting thinkers, must have creative objectives, must be trulyintelligent, and must have added expanding love to their intelligence.These men and women have a dual relationship: to the rest of humanity whom theyseek to serve, and also to the Hierarchy, via some Ashram—an Ashram which is thesource of their inspiration and of their creative efforts to think and to work.The accepted disciple in this group work is in conscious rapport with bothplanetary centres (that of Humanity and that of the Hierarchy) and theircreative thinking largely conditions the group. Many, however, in this group areconscious of their relation to humanity and of their planned service, but aretotally unaware of the unseen source of their inspiration. This matters not,for—if their motive is pure, their intelligence keen and their meditationalcapacity adequate—they receive the inspiration and develop the intuition in anycase. It is those in the New Group of World Servers who can and do meditate whoare the real agents of the relation existing between the Hierarchy and Humanity.Such a relation has, of course, always existed, and always there have been manymystics and a few occultists who have served as channels of relationships;today, the group is newly organised and the task of invocation and evocation isfor the first time in history evenly balanced, or is upon what you might call afifty-fifty basis.Again, the New Group of World Servers is composed of widely diverse men andwomen, gathered out of all nations, holding many different points of view andfollowing the many different professions and ideologies; it is therefore moretruly representative of humanity and more truly potent than ever before.When the work of the Invocation reaches a high stage of development and theclimaxing year of 1952 is over, it will then be wise to bring to the attentionof the general public, [204] and on a worldwide scale, the factual nature of theNew Group of World Servers.This New Group of World Servers is an aspect of the world antahkarana and itgives students of the antahkarana a sound example of the intent and purpose ofthe Rainbow Bridge which each disciple is endeavouring consciously to build. Itis composed of those who have penetrated in consciousness upward to such anextent and height that their ascension has become invocative and has produced adescent from the Hierarchy which meets and merges with the energies of theascending group reflection. Words here are apt to hinder, but the visualisationindicated will prove helpful. In the case of the New Group of World Servers, itis not simply ascending energy which must be considered; there is also afocussing of consciousness and a receptivity which can develop into fixedintention; this can be followed later by a recognition in the physical brainconsciousness of what has transpired. Forget not that—in detail—the New Group ofWorld Servers is composed of the following groups:1. Initiates and disciples who are consciously a part of the Great White Lodge.2. Aspirants and lesser disciples who are affiliated with the Hierarchy, but whodo not usually possess that continuity of consciousness which will come later.3. Those upon the Probationary Path who are not yet affiliated with theHierarchy; they are, however, subject to hierarchical impression and aredetermined to serve their fellowmen.4. An increasing number of people who respond to the idealism and the purpose ofthe New Group of World Servers and who will rapidly join the group.The main requirement is Meditation but—as you know—it is not necessarily the setmeditation of occult schools and churches; membership in the group, however,requires the development of the reflective spirit along some line of humanunderstanding; it requires also the power to focus attention [205] upon thatwhich can serve humanity and a compassionate recognition of human need. Theunthinking man or woman, or those engrossed entirely in business, political andfamily ties, cannot form a part of the New Group of World Servers, because thegroup demands a definite measure of decentralisation; to this, habits ofmeditation rapidly contribute.As the members of this group meditate and serve, they will gradually find thatthey are becoming aware of an inner group—the Ashram of the Master on Whose raythe individual server is to be found. This will necessarily vary according tothe ray; the ray—it must be remembered—determines the quality and the nature ofthe service to be rendered. Gradually the neophyte swings into the rhythm of theAshram, and gradually his meditation changes and falls into line with theinstinctual and constant ashramic meditation. It must be remembered thatashramic meditation is entirely devoid of personality elements. It is in thenature of a constant and uninterrupted group meditation upon the Plan, andparticularly upon that aspect of the Plan which must immediately be put intooperation; this is the apportioned duty of the Ashram or the Ashrams inquestion. This constant attitude of reflective meditation in no way impairs theefficiency of the Ashram or of the individual disciple, because two or morelines of thought and several lines of activity are simultaneously possible. Thisis another lesson which the disciple learns.Later again, the disciple in the Ashram becomes aware of the meditationproceeding all the time within the greater Ashram, the Hierarchy. This is theAshram (if I might repeat the statement) of Sanat Kumara, the Lord of the World.This great Ashram is headed and controlled by the Christ. The aspiring disciplebecomes conscious of a vast meditational rhythm which is like the action of thehuman heart in its beat; it is both receiving and distributing, invocative andevocative; as he becomes habituated in this meditation rhythm, he learns toswing his own individual meditation into the set rhythm of the Hierarchy; thisis a definite [206] step forward, for the hierarchical rhythm is one oftremendous potency—a potency so great that it penetrates beyond the hierarchicalring-pass-not.The effect of that reflective vibration is both vertical and horizontal, andthis wide diffusion has led to the formation of that major group ofcontemplatives, the Nirmanakayas; They focus the hierarchical invocative appealand (to quote the Old Commentary ) “put it into the musical form which willplease the ear of the One Who dwells in the highest plane.” They then transferthe focussed received energies—after due reflection and contemplation—toShamballa. One of Their functions is to relate the invocative appeal of theHierarchy to karmic law, and thus determine “in the deep silence of Their unitedwork” what can be possible because it does not infringe upon karmic intention,and what is not yet possible in time and space—those two major factors which aregoverned by karmic law. They have to bear in mind that the time has not yet comeand “the karmic era cannot yet demand that demanded good become accomplishedgood.”The members of this group are also transmitters to the Hierarchy of the responseevoked from Shamballa. They are constantly in touch with the Council Chamber atShamballa. Just as the Hierarchy—in this present cycle of world endeavour—isworking through the New Group of World Servers, so Shamballa is carrying out itsintentions (as far as humanity is concerned) through this group of Nirmanakayas.This all connotes a great centralisation of the work in connection with thereappearance of the Christ.You can see, therefore, that a gigantic group meditation is going on in manydiffering phases upon our planet. All the meditating units and the reflectivegroups are related to each other through unity of spiritual motive; they areseeking closer cooperation and endeavouring to bring their meditationwork—consciously or unconsciously—in to a state of positive universal quiet, sothat the formulation of spiritual desire can be carried successfully forward,and the reception of spiritual energy can be a united reception.Therefore, brother of mine, a great effort towards alignment is going on, andwhen the individual aspirant can so [207] meditate that his voice can reach theNew Group of World Servers, that group can then impress the individual; throughhim humanity can be reached. It can also impress the Hierarchy; then theContemplatives Who are in touch with Shamballa can contact the Hierarchy, andthrough the Hierarchy can impress the New Group of World Servers; then, and onlythen, the moment will arrive when the Christ will come.Already upon the mountains of initiation the sound of His feet can be heard. Heworks now with His initiates within the Hierarchy; Their united meditation ishastening the preparatory work and is also leading to the initiation ofcountless disciples, thus rendering them far more useful than would otherwise bethe case.The united meditation of these disciples is collaborating with that of theChrist and of the Masters, and senior initiates will impress the members of theNew Group of World Servers; those in this latter group who are, as disciples,members of the Hierarchy, become the agents of this impression. The meditationof the New Group of World Servers, in conjunction with the hierarchicalmeditation, will inevitably impress the sons of men who are seeking and longingfor liberation; thus a great channel or Path of Light is created by cooperativemeditation, and along that Path—speaking symbolically—the Christ will come.PART XIIIIn my last instruction I made the statement that meditation was the majorcreative agent in the universe. There are other universes that are ahead of usin development and, in them, the emphasis may not be upon creation by use ofmental energies; others may not be so advanced and, in them, mental energy maybe in process of unfolding or expressing itself—in the evolutionary sense. Thereare also universes and solar systems where the quality and the conditions of themanifesting universe, solar system or planet are unknown to us. It must be bornein mind that though in all manifestations the three aspects (of purpose or will,attraction, [208] magnetic love or plan, and appearance as manifestation of bothof these) are necessarily present, the manifesting Entity (responsible for theseexpressions of divinity) may work through and “occultly declare” conditions andqualities of which we have no experience or knowledge. We may possess utterly noidea in the highest flights of our abstract thinking (and this includes the mostadvanced thinkers upon our planet) of the nature of the impulses and conceptswhich animate certain universal Creators. Ponder on this.I also pointed out to you that there are three major groups of meditating agentswho act as intermediaries between the three groups of Self-conscious Lives uponour planet, and also between our planet and that which lies behind and beyond itand with which our planetary Logos has intimate and intensive relation. I amnot, however, going to deal today with that which is extra-planetary; it wouldbe, for you, sheer waste of time. I will deal with the theme of meditation asthe agent of the creative process Now , and with the part meditation must playin the preparation for the coming of the Christ and the inauguration of the newcivilisation which is so definitely on its way.There are, as you may surmise (if you have read my instructions intelligently),seven phases of the creative meditative process; all of them are productive ofthe required results. All that at present exists in the three worlds and in thehigher spheres is the result of some form of meditative activity. These sevensources are:1. The planetary Logos Himself , Who formed and informed the world by Histhought, and Who holds all together within His Mind for the many, many aeons ofmanifested existence. As I have before said, the occult truism that “Godthought, God visualised, God spoke and the world was made and is sustained”remains eternally true.2. The Group which is the higher correspondences of the Nirmanakayas . Thisgroup sustains and cooperates with the planetary Logos in His concentratedcreative thought; its Members are the agents for attracting—through the potencyof Their meditation—those extra-planetary energies [209] which He needs to carryforward His vehicle of expression, the planet, and thus to bind all togetherinto one great created Whole, tending ceaselessly to the greater glory of God.They wield the Law of Synthesis and hold steadfastly (in the universal Mind ofthe Logos) the ultimate result of the divine Will-to-Good.3. Shamballa , with its life and intention focussed in the Council Chamber ofthe great Lord, Sanat Kumara. Here is known and embodied the Purpose of theplanetary Logos under the meditative impression of the group which knows Hiswill and which wields the Law of Synthesis. In the hands of this august Council,the Law of Karma finds adequate planetary guidance; this does not refer to thelaw as it affects the individual human being because of such individuals theCouncil Members have no knowledge, for the reason that They think and meditateonly in terms of the Whole; but They know the nature of planetary karma and ofits delayed or rapid application, according to transient planetary indications.The great Wheel of Life, with its passing manifestations and its recurringcivilisations, is directed by Them; the manifesting kingdoms in nature, greatcyclic expressions of life, are controlled by Them, and all this is producedthrough the potency of Their creative meditation which impresses the neededinspiration (another phrase for the breath of life itself) upon the Nirmanakayasand through Them upon the spiritual Hierarchy. Their link with all theseplanetary groups (and it is real and vital) can be grasped in the key statementthat “all Lives upon or within the aura of the planetary Logos and of Hismanifested Body, the Earth, have been, are or will be in the future humanbeings, thereby establishing and demonstrating their past, present or futureidentity with humanity, the fourth kingdom in nature.” This kingdom is theplanetary group or centre which expresses in time and space all the divineaspects—sometimes in latency and sometimes in potency. Here lies the clue to theentire mystery of divine guidance, and here is also to be found the guarantee ofthe divine Will-to-Good. [210]4. The Nirmanakayas, the divine Contemplatives . This is the receptive groupwhich receives impression from Shamballa in relation to the planetary creativepurpose. Then They, on Their own level of atmic activity, build—throughcontemplative meditation—a vast reservoir of potent energies which areimpregnated with the qualities of the seven energies of the seven planetaryRays. They are the Custodians of life, under the direct inspiration of theBuddhas of Activity, and They spend the aeons of Their planetary service:a. In active contemplation of the divine Purpose.b. In a developed receptivity to that aspect of the Purpose which must beexpressed through the medium of the divine Plan, and thus presented to theHierarchy.c. In developing that spirit of sevenfold receptivity which will make Them achannel for the inflow of ray energies from Shamballa into the Hierarchy. Theirunited aura or area of influence and the extent of Their magnetic and dynamicradiation correspond roughly to the aura of the planet itself; They contain(within Their ranks) Members Who are identified with the Lords of the sevenRays.They are, in a peculiar sense, the creative agents of life as it streams forthfrom Shamballa into all the aspects, areas, kingdoms and fields ofmanifestation. This They are enabled to do through sustained, concentrated,intensive and dynamic meditation. They are necessarily a second ray group (asthe second ray is the ray at present of the planetary Logos) but They focusTheir meditation largely along first ray lines (which is a subray of the secondray in this solar system, as you know) because They are the creative agents oflife itself and the knowers and the custodians of the will of the planetaryLogos, as it works itself out in manifestation. They are the source in reality[211] of planetary invocation and evocation. Again, ponder on this.5. The Hierarchy of Masters , the Masters of the Wisdom and the Lords ofCompassion. This group, which stands midway between Shamballa and Humanity, issubject to impression from Shamballa, via the Nirmanakayas, and its Members areThemselves the agents for the impression of Humanity. They embody and expressthe love aspect of the divine purpose; They wield, direct and control the Law ofAttraction—the motivating energy which swings the Law of Evolution into activityin the three worlds. Much is known by you anent this group of divine andspiritual Workers, and I will not enlarge upon it here. Basically, They workthrough directed meditation and each Ashram is a centre of meditation to whichevery disciple, initiate and Master contributes. I would have you bear this inmind and endeavour to realise, as disciples, that your meditation—bothindividual and group meditation—if it is of an adequate nature and quality—willbe absorbed into and become part of the ashramic meditation. The theme of thehierarchical meditation is the Plan, as it embodies the divine Purpose.6. The New Group of World Servers is fast becoming a major centre of planetarymeditation. Much of this meditation is far from being of an occult nature butthat is of no importance; it is largely based upon deep reflection upon theproblems of humanity, backed and aided by the deep aspiration of the mysticsfound within its ranks, and aided also by the meditation of those fewesotericists (technically speaking) who are working there also. This group is areflection of the invocative and evocative capacity of the Nirmanakayas, butthis aspect of their activity is only in process of being learnt and applied.The entire activity of the New Group of World Servers along the invocative linewas stepped up and greatly hastened by the giving to the world of the threeInvocations during the past few years. What was actually a vague demand and afluid nebulous receptivity became (by the use of the Invocations) [212] apowerful invocative plea, and resulted in the evocation of energies from theHierarchy which were transmitted by the New Group of World Servers to Humanityand which are responsible for much of the constructive work now going forward inmany parts of the world. I have told you much about this group and will notenlarge upon it here; your understanding of the work to be done should beinstinctual for you all belong to it, if you are in any way dedicated to theservice of humanity, under inspiration of the Hierarchy; your instinctualreaction to hierarchical impression as a member of this group should developrapidly into an habitual life tendency. Thus is a Master created. The creativemeditation of the New Group of World Servers has for its objectives the creationof the new civilisation and of the new world order.This group itself works through another group: the intelligent men and womenupon the mental plane, those who, added to the intelligence, possess a love oftheir fellowmen; these, in their turn, work through the idealists who seek abetter world and those who respond to the inspiration of goodwill. This lastgroup, in its turn, works with all who are emotionally implicated in the desireto help humanity change its living conditions for the better. These people arenot open to direct spiritual impression, but the intellectual approach and thepresentation of ideas appeal to them, and they constitute the active creativegroup who act as the dynamic inspiration to the seventh group, which is7. Humanity itself. Men everywhere are, if they only knew it, always in a stateof unconscious meditation, dreaming of better things, fighting for desiredmaterial benefits, longing for that which lies beyond their present possessionand their present attainment and, in many cases, even their vision. All thesedesires, longings, wishes, visions and dreams are the “ingredients” of thefocussed meditation which they will some day know; they are the first resultswhich produce success in the three worlds, and which lead [213] eventually to anintegrated personality, ready to appreciate the higher aspects of meditationwhen concentration upon worldly material success and benefits has proved nolonger appealing. That which they have, through meditative concentration,succeeded in creating (and all men, under the Law of Karma, create their ownworld) no longer satisfies; their meditation then shifts into the creation ofhigher things, into the world of spiritual values and of that which we cover bythe unsuccessful and inadequate term of “heaven.”See you, therefore, how all that is, is created by meditation, by desire merginginto transient thought, and transient thought becoming clear thinking and,eventually, abstract and transcendent thought. Prolonged concentration upon someform or another eventually becomes meditation upon that which is not of thenature of form; from thence it passes into that contemplation which is thesource of inspiration and of illumination.Trace these concepts which you, who have studied the Science of Meditation, knowto constitute its recognised stages, and note how each stage is creative innature, each stage produces creative changes and that (as far as humanity isconcerned) the Christ spoke scientifically and also in a planetary sense when Hesaid: “As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.”You have, therefore, three major groups of thinkers and three other groups ofintensive, creative thinkers, all of them responsible for and also dedicated tothe comprehension of the divine Purpose as it works out through the spiritualhierarchical Plan; this is applied under the Law of Evolution to humanity and,through humanity, to the subhuman kingdoms in nature. From the human family, alldivine Lives and Beings have come; in humanity the creative process isconstantly working; and into humanity all subhuman lives must eventuallyproceed. As regards the meditative creative process, the diagram on thefollowing page may serve somewhat to clear your minds: [214][Image00013.jpg]The three subhuman Kingdoms in Nature.Esoterically, the reflection of the three major groups, listed above.We need not deal here with the higher groups of spiritual Intermediaries andTheir techniques of creative work, because Their meditation lies on too high alevel for your consideration. But the meditation work done by the Hierarchy andby the New Group of World Servers lies within your range of understanding; manydisciples will read what I am here saying and, in time, many of the lesserworkers and aspirants in the ranks of the group will come to an understanding ofmy meaning. It might profit us if I briefly stated [215] the grades ofmeditative work, leading to creative result of an effective nature, upon whichyou might reflect. For our purposes we will divide them into seven grades, ofwhich four might be regarded as individual and the other three types asrepresentative of their group nature:1. Desire , leading to the attainment in the three worlds of that which thelower man desires and wants; this will include the desires of the lowest typesof human beings through all intermediate types up to and inclusive of theaspirational mystic.2. Prayer; this is the stage wherein the aspirant, the mystic or the spirituallyinclined man blends personality desire with aspiration for soul relation andcontact; he, through the proved efficacy of prayer, discovers the subtler powersand the fact of the essential dualism of life; he finds that he himself is botha lower self and a higher Self.3. Mental reflection or concentrated thinking. This in time produces integrationand definite personality achievement in the three worlds, leading eventually tocontrolled reflection and scientific or concentrated thoughts; this type ofthinking has produced all the creative wonders of our modern civilisation and itculminates in the concentration achieved in occult meditation. This meditationfinally brings about the reorientation of the personality and soul fusion.4. Straight meditation . This is a focussed, concentrated mental attitude andfixed reflection; it is creative in nature, for it creates the “new man inChrist” or produces the soul-infused personality; this personality then proceedsto recreate his environment and to cooperate consciously with the creative workof the Hierarchy.Little as you may realise it, all these expressions of human meditation orconcentrated thought—whether it is concentrated desire for physical or emotionalobjectives or the higher aspects of spiritual, concentrated aspiration—dodefinitely [216] create that which is desired. This is equally true of the otherthree stages, for they are intelligently and effectively creative and these fourstages are responsible for all that is seen, possessed, utilised and known asexistent in the three worlds. Men have inherited from previous civilisationsmuch of value and much which is disastrous in nature; in their turn, modern menhave created this present civilisation. This civilisation is unique, because itis the result of all the combined factors, and these factors have succeeded inbringing humanity to the point where there is recognition of failure, and inproving that religion and science together have reoriented men to the world ofsubtler and of higher values than the strictly material.The other three stages of human meditation are as follows:5. Worship . This is the united recognition and the subsequent reflection ofhumanity upon the fact of divine Transcendence and divine Immanence. It isimplemented by the world religions and it created that path of return to thecentre or source of divine life to which the world religions and the heart ofman bear equal testimony.6. Invocation and Evocation . This form of spiritual, dynamic meditation islargely in the hands of the New Group of World Servers and of the men and womenof goodwill in every land. These will be generally unknown to each other, butthey are all creatively striving and creatively thinking towards the worldwideuplift of mankind; they are earnestly working at the creation of a new worldorder and for the manifestation of a more definitely spiritual civilisation.7. Ashramic Meditation. This is based upon the evocation of human response tothe higher spiritual values; it concerns itself with the creation of thoseconditions wherein these new values can, under the divine Plan, flourish; it isfocussed on that immediate aspect of the Path which humanity needs to tread, andits intent is to swing into creative activity the desires, aspirations, [217]reflections and concentrated meditation of men, at whatever may be theirparticular point in evolution, so that a mighty, coherent and invinciblemovement will be instituted which must and will result in the creation of thenew heavens and the new earth. This is one way of expressing the significance ofthe coming of the Kingdom of God on Earth, and the creation of a new order andway of life.There are crisis points at times of superlative tension in the meditative workof all hierarchical Ashrams. At the times of the new moon and of the full moon,all members of all the Ashrams meditate deeply in an invocative and evocativemanner; their meditation, therefore, falls into two parts: the first part isevocative of inspiration from the Nirmanakayas with Whom they deliberately getin touch; the second part is invocative of the New Group of World Servers andenables them responsively to come under hierarchical impression. Three times ayear—at the April, May and June Festivals (The full moon of Aries, or Easter, ofTaurus or Wesak, and of Gemini or of the Spirit of Goodwill) —there is a unitedhierarchical meditation led by the Christ; these Festivals are invocative ofShamballa or of that which lies beyond the Nirmanakayas and can only be safelycarried forward in united meditation, under directed guidance and the highestpossible inspiration. Each Ashram can approach the Nirmanakayas as a group atstated periods for which due preparation is made; only the entire group ofAshrams, the Hierarchy as a whole, can approach Shamballa. The New Group isinvocative to the Hierarchy for purposes of impression and can be impressed byany Ashram through its disciples in that group; thus the great chain of contactand the great channel for the inflow of spiritual energy reaches from Shamballato humanity and then, through humanity, to the three subhuman kingdoms; in thisway, these lower kingdoms are “enlightened and raised.” All this is accomplishedthrough meditation, through invocation [218] and evocation, carried forward inthe spirit of worship, which is the fundamental method of spiritual recognition.Thus, creatively, the glory which is hidden in every form is evoked and slowlybrought to exoteric manifestation.In the destruction of the old world order and in the chaos of these moderntimes, the work of the new creation is going forward; the task ofreconstruction, leading to a complete reorganisation of human living and to afresh reorientation of human thinking, is taking place.What, therefore, is the creative work confronting the Ashrams in the Hierarchyand the members of the New Group of World Servers, working creatively under theinspiration and the impression of the Hierarchy? It falls into two parts:1. The work of bringing order out of chaos.2. The task of preparing the way for the reappearance of the Christ.There is much that must be done to change conditions, institute new values andproduce the bringing in of an entirely new civilisation—a civilisation whichwill permit the externalisation of the Ashrams, or of the Hierarchy, and arestitution, therefore, of hierarchical or spiritual control as it was known inold Atlantean days, only this time on a much higher turn of the spiral and withthe intelligent cooperation also and the wise assistance of humanity, which wasa factor lacking in the earlier civilisation. Once this has been dealt with inthe reflective, concentrated meditation of the individual aspirant, in theunited reflection and meditation of the many spiritually inclined groups in theworld today, and once the New Group of World Servers and the Hierarchy areworking in the closest kind of cooperation, then the visualisation and theprojection of the intended civilisation will have reached a definite and a mostimportant point of precipitation . Then, the invocative appeal of the unitedHierarchy and of the New Group of World Servers will be [219] so potent that itwill evoke a response from humanity and a cycle of organisation, of planning andof effective expression will follow. Reflection, meditation and visualisationwill give place to scientific thinking (which is essentially meditation) and tothe needed physical plane activity.This will take place, esoterically speaking, under the impression of the Mastersupon the three major rays. The first Ray of Will or Power (the Ray of the divineDestroyer) is already actively working, destroying the old and outwornconditions and bringing about the wreckage of the old civilisation so that thenew order can be effectively brought into expression. As the Christ said, whenHe instituted the Christian civilisation of the past two thousand years (whichhas gone sadly far from His original intention), you “cannot put new wine in oldbottles.” The war (1914-1945) started the needed process of destruction, and thepost-war period is carrying forward the planned undertaking. It is nearing itsdesired finish, if men work towards the freedom for which all their souls long.The second Ray of Love-Wisdom, through the many extant educational processes andthrough the modern conflict of ideas (producing thus a borderland between theareas of influence of the first and second rays) is opening the minds ofthousands of people. The pronounced contrast in ideas—as, for instance, thecontrast between totalitarianism and the democratic freedom of thought (doessuch democratic freedom really exist, my brother?)—is forcing men to think, toreflect, to question and to meditate. The world is thereby greatly enriched, andthe whole human family is transiting out of a pronounced cycle of karma yogainto the required cycle of raja yoga, from unthinking activity into a period ofillumined mind control. It is a mental illumination which is brought about bythe meditative and the reflective activity of humanity as a whole, and this iscarried forward under the guidance of the New Group of World Servers, workingunder hierarchical impression.Members of all the ray types are to be found in the New Group of World Servers,either through the activity of the personality ray or of the soul ray;therefore, the energies of [220] all the rays are being brought to bear uponthis creative period in modern human history. It is interesting to have in mindthe fact that through the medium of all the fighting forces of the world (naval,military and air) much needed hierarchical work is being accomplished; theenergy of the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict is making itselfphenomenally felt—this time in conjunction with the unusual activity of thefirst ray. Therefore, through the Forces of Light, liberation into freedom willcome and it will mean the freedom of all mankind. I make here no defence of waror of fighting, brother of mine. I simply deal with world conditions as theyexist today, and with the processes and the methods which are characteristic ofthe civilisations which have already disappeared and of the civilisation out ofwhich we are today emerging. As man leaves the animal, the strictly physical andthe highly emotional and inflammable stages behind him and learns to think ,then (and only then) will war cease. Fortunately for humanity, this is happeningmost rapidly.For the first time in human history, the lines of demarcation between that whichis right from the angle of the spiritual values (the essential freedom of thehuman spirit) and that which is wrong (the imprisonment of the human spirit bymaterialistic conditions) are clearly perceived by the majority of the nationsof the planet. Within the United Nations is the germ and the seed of a greatinternational and meditating, reflective group—a group of thinking and informedmen and women in whose hands lies the destiny of humanity. This is largely underthe control of many fourth ray disciples, if you could but realise it, and theirpoint of meditative focus is the intuitional or buddhic plane—the plane uponwhich all hierarchical activity is today to be found.The fifth Ray of Concrete Knowledge is also expressing itself powerfully in themeditation and the reflection of the world scientists in all fields of humaninterest; in their hands the form of the new civilisation is being constructed.I would remind you that when I use the word “scientist,” I refer to all who areworking in the social sciences and the economic [221] sciences as well as thelarge group of chemists, biologists, physicists, etc., who are usually coveredby that term. The organising, defining power of the mental plane is beingbrought to bear upon all phases of human life by the scientists of all the manyschools of thought; out of this meditative and creative thought which they allso admirably demonstrate will come the structure of the new civilisation.The sixth ray disciple is active also in organising the mystical aspiration ofthe masses of men everywhere which is in itself a most potent energy; theseaspirational men (no matter what may be their immediate aspiration) arenecessarily polarised upon the astral plane but are not yet capable of the clearmental perception of the massed intelligentsia or susceptible to the influenceof the accurate, esoteric approach. Their guided, mystical orientation will beone of the most powerful factors in the destruction of the old values and in themassed recognition of the spiritual truth which underlies all life; it is withthis reorientation that sixth ray disciples, wielding sixth ray energy, areoccupied at this time. You need to remember that the one-pointed attitude of themystic, functioning in group formation, will be a powerful factor in thecreative work being done by the Hierarchy and by the New Group of World Servers,because theirs will be a massed effect, and usually wielded unconsciously.Under the influence of disciples on the seventh Ray of Organisation or ofCeremonial Order, that powerful physical concretisation of energy which we call“money” is proving a topic of the most definite concentration; it is being mostcarefully considered, and the minds of thinking financiers and of wealthyhumanitarian persons and philanthropists will be gradually led forward from astrictly philanthropic activity to an activity which is impulsed and broughtinto expression by spiritual insight, and by a recognition of the claims ofChrist (no matter by what name He may be called in the East or in the West) uponthe financial reservoir of the world. This is a hard thing to bring about, forthe subtle energies of the inner worlds take much time in producing theireffects upon the objective, tangible plane of divine manifestation. Money is notyet used divinely, but it will be. [222] Nevertheless, the task is well in handand is engaging the attention of disciples upon all the rays, under the guidanceand the impression of the powerful seventh ray Ashram—now already in process ofexternalisation.The effect of human meditation at this time is to change conditions, to invokethe higher, spiritual potencies, to work with concentration—both vertically andhorizontally—within the world of men and within the Kingdom of God. Thisvertical and horizontal activity holds the secret of creative meditation . It isinvocative of the higher energies, and creates a channel of contact between souland spirit. This is brought about by what I have called “vertical meditation.”It is also evocative and creates a ferment or dynamic movement in that level ofbeing which must be affected or changed, and this is the horizontal aspect. Boththe vertical and the horizontal activities are descriptive of the method ofinvocation and of evocation, as employed by all the linking groups between thevarious planetary centres; a reference to the chart (page 214) should help makethis clear.But all these processes and the entire scheme of manifestation are brought aboutthrough organised and conscious meditative methods; planetary, group andindividual meditation is creative in results, and it is this aspect of it withwhich I am dealing in this instruction.Therefore I shall give—for your constructive use if you care to use them—twomeditation forms or outlines for reflection. Shall I call them two presentedrings-pass-not for your controlled reflective thinking? One is a meditation forworkers in the New Group of World Servers who are interested in preparing theway for the reappearance of the Christ, and the other is a meditation of asimple nature (combining the aspects of prayer, meditation and invocation) whichhas for its objective the deflecting of money from material ends into the workwhich the Hierarchy seeks to have accomplished.To sum up:The Lord of the World, through meditation, is carrying forward processes whichHe instituted in His original, creative meditation—back in the darkest night ofthe time when [223] He decided to create this planet of ours for strictlyredemptive purposes. The whole creation is the result of His directed andcontrolled thought—a process of sustained thinking which sweeps all the creativeenergies into evolutionary and cyclic activity, in conformity to the patternwhich He eternally visualises. He has organised a group which is responsive toHis meditative intention; these Beings aid Him by Their concentrated andrealised Purpose to bring into our planetary livingness certain extra-planetaryenergies which are needed to carry forward the planned work of the planetaryLogos. Shamballa itself is also permeated with His thought and conscious (if Imay speak symbolically) of that which the Logos has visualised. They are theCustodians of His Purpose, as it is revealed to Them, cycle by cycle. The lengthof these cycles is one of the mysteries which is strictly guarded in the CouncilChamber of the Lord of the World; these cycles have reference only tomanifestation in the three worlds wherein the concepts of time and spacecontrol.The Hierarchy is the Custodian of that aspect of the cyclic, planetary Purposewhich is called the Plan ; this covers such relatively brief periods ascivilisations—where humanity is concerned. In relation to Shamballa, theintermediate group of meditating, creative Workers is called into activity inorder to receive impression of the immediate, desired hierarchical activity, totransmit the needed energies from Shamballa to the united Ashrams and thus,esoterically, “inform” the Hierarchy of that which merits immediate attention.Again, upon a lower level of the evolutionary spiral, the Hierarchy in its turnimpresses the New Group of World Servers with the Plan to be at once applied tothe helping of humanity. This group is the major creative agent in the threeworlds for the remainder of this cycle of planetary experience. This has notalways been the case. Humanity can now intelligently work with the presentedPlan, and this for the first time in human history. I would have you note this.Men can now do their little share in bringing the divine Purpose intomanifestation, because they have now unfolded the needed mental capacity. Thecontrol and the creative [224] development of the three lower kingdoms in natureis slowly being taken out of the hands of the deva evolution (hithertoresponsible) and placed under the supervision of mankind; as it is said in theancient Archives of the Masters:“Eventually, the solar Lords, through manas (the mind) will control the lunarlords of elemental substance, and not alone their own but that which looks tothem for aid. Thus will redemption come to all through man, and thus the gloryof the Lord of Life be seen.”Focussed intention, concentrated meditation, visualisation, directed invocation(producing evocation) and leading to responsive results, are the major processesof creation upon all levels and by all beings. Prayer, focussed desire,meditation and focussed intention are the graded and sequential lessons whichmankind has to learn. Worship, or recognition of divine Transcendence and divineImmanence underlies all the mass recognition of spiritual potency. Thus themeditation of the planet penetrates into that which lies beyond the planet andis fused and blended in a solar sense with the Voice of Him Who has brought allinto being, and with the Will of Him Who is carrying all forms of His livingnesstowards the perfection which He purposes; in so doing, the great processes ofRedemption are furthered, to which all World Saviours (in relation to humanity)are the symbol, the guarantee and the eternal testimony.In giving you these two meditations, I would remind all who undertake to usethese meditative forms that they will not prove effective and of the neededvital potency unless the one who thus meditates identifies himself with thepurpose and objective of the meditation, dedicates himself to cooperation withthis objective and redeems all aspects of his own life in conformity with thefocussed desire expressed in this spiritual appeal. It is useless, my brothers,to meditate along lines which will aid in preparing the world for the coming ofthe Hierarchy and for the reappearance of the Christ unless , again, thatpreparation is an integral part of [225] your own constant daily endeavour, andis not just simply wishful thinking and the formulation of a hopeful theoryanent the future of humanity. It is useless for you to meditate in order toreorient money, for instance, towards spiritual work (and by “spiritual work” Ido not here refer to the work of the churches and of the world religions) unlessall the monies which you individually have to handle are dedicated to rightusage, the fulfilment of your right obligations and the covering of your karmicresponsibilities, plus the constant recognition of the relation of all money tothe spiritual future of the race and the requirements of the hierarchical Plan.There must always be, in your consciousness, a recognition of the needs of allmen, and this must be true of all spiritually-minded people, of all trueesotericists and of the religiously inclined man whose heart and understandingare more divinely inclusive than are the hearts of the average followers of anyreligious doctrine, enunciated by the theologians of any faith.It must be realised that money is the energy which can set in motion and makepossible the activities of the New Group of World Servers—no matter what theircolour, caste or church. Money does not yet lie in their hands. Their need forit is great. Millions are needed to spread the required knowledge of thehierarchical Plan; millions are needed to further the work of men of goodwill;millions are needed to educate the masses in the fact that He for Whom all menwait is on His way back to ordinary visibility. The billions which are spent atpresent on luxuries, on expensive and unnecessary objects of desire, thebillions (and, my brother, it is billions, as world statistics show) which gotowards the purchase of candy, liquor, tobacco, jewellery and expensive furs,the millions which go in the violent search for excitement and for ceaselessnightly pleasure and, finally, the billions which go the way of armed conflictin all nations must be deflected towards those expenditures which will make theplans of the Hierarchy possible, which will aid humanity in its search for thenew, spiritual and free way, and which will therefore bring into being the newcivilisation. Billions are required to overcome the materialism which hasdominated [226] mankind for untold aeons; billions are also needed to bringabout the reconstruction of human affairs and thus purify and beautify ourmodern world to such an extent that the Christ can appear among men; through thewise expenditure of the financial resources of the world in the many fields ofhuman betterment and uplift, the Christ will be enabled to “see of the travailof His soul and be satisfied.”I ask you, therefore, to follow these two meditations at least once a week andupon different days. These two forms of invocative appeal can be used by all whoare willing to participate in the indicated service.REFLECTIVE MEDITATION UPON PREPARATION FOR THE REAPPEARANCE OF THE CHRISTStage I.After achieving a positive and intended personality quietness, formulate clearlyto yourself in your own words, the answers to the following questions:1. As a member of the New Group of World Servers, what is my specific, fixedintention at this moment of dedicated contact with my soul?2. Is my concentrated and expressed personality purpose in line withhierarchical intention—as far as I am permitted to know it?3. Have I—in my own personal daily life—earned the right (because of definiteeffort and not so much because of success) to stand with those Servers Who arenow undertaking the work of Preparation?This is the one time in the meditation where you think of yourself, and it ishere because it is a method of personality, focussed attention and aligns yourpersonality upon the mental plane.Stage II .Having answered these three questions in the light of the soul, then say withemphasis:“Forgetting the things which lie behind, I will strive towards my higherspiritual possibilities. I dedicate myself anew to the service of the Coming[227] One and will do all I can to prepare men’s minds and hearts for thatevent. I have no other life intention. ”PAUSEStage III .1. Visualise the world situation as best you can and in terms of your majorworld interest and with what knowledge of world affairs you may possess. See themass of men everywhere glowing with a dim light and, here and there, points ofbrighter light where members of the New Group of World Servers and men ofspiritual intention and of loving hearts are working for their fellowmen.2. Then visualise (through the creative imagination) the vivid light of theHierarchy, streaming towards humanity and slowly merging with the light which isalready in men. Then say the first stanza of the Invocation:“From the point of Light within the Mind of GodLet Light stream forth into the minds of men.Let Light descend on Earth.”3. Then ponder upon the reappearance of the Christ; realise that no matter bywhat name He may be called in the many world religions, He is still the samegreat Identity; reflect and speculate upon the possible results of Hisappearance. Then say the second stanza of the Invocation:“From the point of Love within the Heart of GodLet Love stream forth into the hearts of men.May Christ return to Earth.”4. Endeavour to concentrate your fixed intention to serve and to spread love inyour surroundings and realise that in so far as can do these things you areattempting to blend your personal will with the divine Will. Then say stanzathree of the Invocation: [228]“From the Centre where the Will of God is knownLet Purpose guide the little wills of men—The Purpose which the Masters know and serve.”5. Consider practically what you can do in the coming week to further thepreparations for the coming of the Christ.PAUSEThen sound the OM three times, dedicating the threefold personality to the workof preparation.Suggestions:1. It is suggested that you do this meditation once every week, each Thursday ,in the place of your usual meditation; endeavour to assume an attitude ofaspiration, devotion, prayer and fixed intention (in this order), prior tofollowing the outline. Esoteric students need the heart approach, as well as themental approach, in order to make this meditation the powerful instrument whichit can be.2. Between Thursdays endeavour to carry out the results of the reflectionexpressed in this meditation. Lay practical plans and then review each week theplanned activities when you sit down to this meditation, in the light of yourexpressed Intention .3. Make this meditation brief and dynamic. After doing it a few times, thisshould be easily possible; forget the various stages and be impelled by thesequence and the synthesis of the form.* * *REFLECTIVE MEDITATION ON ATTRACTING MONEY FOR HIERARCHICAL PURPOSESStage I .After achieving a positive and intended personality quietness, formulate clearlyto yourself and in your own words, the answers to the following questions: [229]1. If money is one of the most important things needed today for spiritual work,what is the factor which is at present deflecting it away from the work of theHierarchy?2. What is my personal attitude towards money? Do I regard it as a great andpossible spiritual asset, or do I think of it in material terms?3. What is my personal responsibility in regard to money which passes through myhands? Am I handling it as a disciple of the Masters should handle it?PAUSEStage II.1. Ponder on the redemption of humanity through the right use of money.Visualise the money in the world today asa. Concretised energy, at present largely used for purely material purposes andfor the satisfaction (where the individual is concerned) of purely personaldesires.b. Visualise money as a great stream of flowing golden substance, passing out ofthe control of the Forces of Materialism into the control of the Forces ofLight.2. Then say the following invocative prayer, with focussed mental concentrationand from a heartfelt desire to meet spiritual demands:“O Thou in Whom we live and move and have our being, the Power that can make allthings new, turn to spiritual purposes the money in the world; touch the heartsof men everywhere so that they may give to the work of the Hierarchy that whichhas hitherto been given to material satisfaction. The New Group of World Serversneeds money in large quantities. I ask that the needed vast sums may be madeavailable. May this potent energy of Thine be in the hands of the Forces ofLight.” [230]3. Then visualise the work to be done by those groups which claim your presentallegiance (i.e., the Arcane School and the Service Activities, or any othergroup which you know is attempting to carry out the hierarchical Plan). Then,through the creative imagination and by an act of the will, see untold andunlimited sums of money pouring into the hands of those who seek to do theMasters’ work.4. Then say aloud, with conviction and emphasis:“He for Whom the whole world waits has said that whatsoever shall be asked inHis Name and with faith in the response will see it accomplished.”Remember at the same time that “faith is the substance of things hoped for andthe evidence of things not seen.” Then add:“I ask for the needed money for . . . . . . and can demand it because`From the Centre which we call the race of menLet the Plan of Love and Light work out.And may it seal the door where evil dwells.’”5. Close with a careful consideration of your own responsibility to the Plan,and each week plan your financial cooperation with the Hierarchy. Be practicaland realistic and know that if you do not give, you may not ask, for you have noright to evoke that which you do not share.Suggestions:1. This meditation is so simple that many of you may regard it as innocuous andperhaps futile. Used by many simultaneously, it may shatter the impasse which[231] at present prevents adequate funds pouring into the work which theHierarchy seeks to accomplish.2. Do this meditation every Sunday morning. Take what you have saved during theprevious week and dedicate it to the work and present it in meditation to theChrist and His Hierarchy. Whether the sum is large or small, it can become anattractive and magnetic unit in the Masters’ plans.3. Realise the occult Law that “to those who give shall be given” so that theycan give again.4. Attempt to feel true love sweeping through you, and have the fixed intentionto express this love to all you contact. It is the great attractive and selflessagent in world affairs.PART XIVIn my last series of instructions I gave you a group meditation which was basedupon the furthering of the work of the New Group of World Servers, as theysought to prepare humanity for the reappearance of the Christ. That preparatorywork is the major incentive lying back of all that I do, and was the primereason for the formation of the group in the early part of this century.Pioneers of this group appeared in the nineteenth century but the organisation,as it now exists, is of relatively modern days.In this instruction we will consider the relation of group meditation to thework of the New Group of World Servers, and the necessity of establishing in theworld a united world group, given to unanimous and simultaneous meditation uponthe work of preparing the world for the new order and for the jurisdiction ofthe Christ (if I may use such a phrase).It is necessary for you all to get a wider vision of the enterprise which thisgroup has undertaken, or else the meditation work which you will do will hinderand not help. The task of the group of World Servers is not the spreading ofesoteric or occult information. In preparing the world of [232] men for thereappearance of the Christ, the needs of all the many grades in the social ordermust be met; world groups of every description have to be contacted. Much of thework to be done, therefore, will be purely economic and will concern the rightfeeding and the development of a true security for millions who—for manylives—will not be interested in matters esoteric. The reform of the churches ofthe many world religions is another aspect of the same work, requiring no occultinformation but the introduction of commonsense and progressive ideas intotheology, and the shift of the ecclesiastical emphasis from material values tothe spiritual. The political regimes of the world need orienting to each other;it has never been the divine plan that all nations and races should conform tosome standard political ideology or be reduced to a uniform general form ofgovernment. Nations differ; they have different cultures and traditions; theycan function adequately under varying and distinctive governments; nevertheless,they can at the same time attain a unity of purpose, based upon a genuine desirefor the true welfare and progress of all men everywhere.In all these spheres of human thought and activity, the New Group of WorldServers are playing a prominent part. At the very heart of that worldwide groupare those who are in the Ashrams of the Masters—as are some of you—or on theperiphery or within the sphere of influence of these Ashrams. Their task islargely a meditative one, carried on in order to influence the minds of thosemembers of the group who are not yet in touch with any Ashram; they work thusfrom humanitarian, interested and basically ray reasons, and all such membersare more or less under the control of their soul ray; this affects mostdefinitely the varying fields of service. These are the areas of thought withinthe human family wherein the preparation for the coming of the Christ must becarried forward; but this activity is not, as a rule, associated with theesoteric angle or approach to truth but strictly with the angle of thebetterment of human relationships. The Christ Himself (two thousand years ago)tried to demonstrate this mode of helpful activity; He kept the esotericteaching for the few, the very few, who could approach [233] understanding, butHe dealt with the masses from the angle of commonsense and physical planehelpfulness. Have this ever in mind.I have been for some time seeking to impress upon you the eternal fact that theentire universe has been created and its evolution processed through the powerof thought, which is only another word for controlled meditation. This coversthe combined meditation of numerous subjective, spiritual and mental groups; thelaws of this meditative work are the result of certain mental determinations,which embody the will of the planetary Logos and are imposed upon all lessergroups of lives by Those Whose task it is to wield the divine laws and enforcethem. Freedom of the will is here to be noted in relation to the Time conceptbut not in relation to the final and inevitable divine results at the end of theimmense world period. The major thoughtform of the spiritual Hierarchy, createdby joint ashramic meditation, is called by us the Plan . The basic purpose ofSanat Kumara is revealed from cycle to cycle by His Agents in Shamballa, and isby Them impressed upon the minds of the senior Members of the Hierarchy. They,in Their turn, make this impression the subject of Their ashramic meditation,adapting its various concepts and the outlined purpose to a most carefullyformulated Plan, presenting—as far as humanity is concerned—seven aspects orphases of evolutionary development and endeavour, according to the work desiredof any Ray Ashram implicated at any particular time. Each Ashram thus undertakesmeditation upon the general Plan and thus (if you could but realise it) eachinitiate and disciple finds his place and sphere of activity and service—fromthe very highest initiate to the least important disciple.You might here ask: What is the value of the meditation and contribution of anew disciple, unaccustomed to ashramic patterns of thought and unable to carrymuch weight in the general group meditation? That is a questioning worthanswering and of great encouragement to the neophyte. The various grades andranks of initiates and disciples are so constituted that the result of theirmeditation upon the Plan is that the many needs of the varying masses ofhumanity (from [234] those of the advanced intelligentsia down to those of theunskilled labourer) can be adequately met and the great mass of men swungaccurately into line with evolutionary purpose.Have you ever stopped to think that the meditation of a Master upon the Plan ofwhich He is custodian, and His formulation of what He can do along the line ofeffective cooperation, is of no service or usefulness to the illiterateinhabitants of our great cities and agricultural areas? The need of theseunthinking masses must be met by disciples of less spiritual development, andprobably their greatest appeal is through the application of economic help; thetask of these lesser disciples is to prove to the ignorant masses that—as thecenturies slip away—spiritual living and true spiritual understanding includeevery aspect of physical plane expression and not simply the religious or thephilosophic modes of thought. The meditation, therefore, of every grade ofdisciple and initiate has its use, for by their meditation (carried forward ontheir own level) they can adapt the Plan to the widely differing masses and thusthe hierarchical Plan can reach from the Masters of the Hierarchy, through theAshrams to the New Group of World Servers, and thus to the whole of the humanfamily. I would like you to grasp the true simplicity of this picture, if youcan, for you can have a share also in this great meditative task.One of the things which I set myself to achieve when I undertook this work ofmaking the Plan clearer to the minds of men, and thus preparing the way for theMaster of all the Masters, was to prove not only that the Plan was based uponplanetary meditation but that, in its progress towards expression, it met theneed of all possible groups and grades of human beings; and that—more importantstill—it could be proved that the word “spiritual” covered every phase of livingexperience. Ponder on this statement. That is spiritual which lies beyond thepoint of present achievement; it is that which embodies the vision and whichurges the man on towards a goal higher than the one attained. The ecclesiasticsof the world have made a great line of demarcation between what is human andwhat is spiritual, between what is material and what is not; in so doing theyhave created sin and [235] greatly complicated human living and understanding.They have given a selfish import to human aspiration; they have not taughtmankind that meditation and prayer were simply phases of cooperation with thedivine Plan. Individualism was fostered and group understanding was lost.Maybe—owing to the work of the Brothers of Darkness—there was no way to avoidthis dangerous sidetracking of human intent and truth. But the time has now comewhen the great rhythm of meditation, ranging from desire through prayer toworship, and from thence to meditation and invocation, can be imposed by menupon their own thinking.This is the immediate task of the New Group of World Servers, cooperatingeverywhere with the men of goodwill; each member of the New Group has toascertain for himself where he stands, where his meditative responsibility liesand in what field destiny indicates his service to the race of men must befound. This is no easy task, brother of mine. Men are frequently so spirituallyambitious and waste their time in doing that which is not their destined taskbecause in so doing they satisfy their spiritual pride.You must learn to give a wider connotation to the word “meditation” than youhave hitherto given. Concentrated thought is part of the planetary meditation;planning with care for the helping of the needy and pursuing all avenues ofthinking to make that plan useful and effective is meditation; laying oneselfopen to spiritual impression and thus to cooperation with the Hierarchy ismeditation; in this enumeration of meditative possibilities I have not touchedupon the major creative meditation which is responsible for the evolutionaryprocess and the controlled moving forward of all the world of forms into greaterglory and light.The work hitherto done in such occult groups as the Arcane School and others, asthey teach meditation, has been nothing but the learning of a neededconcentration. Only in the meditation work of the fourth degree has some of thecreative work become possible and that in its most elementary stages; yet theArcane School leads the aspirants of the world in meditation of an occultnature, thought not in any way a mystical nature. The mystical type ofmeditation [236] is of ancient formulation and its use indicates the next stepfor the masses of men; the practice of mystical meditation is not that whichshould be followed by aspirants and disciples who seek to work in an Ashram incooperation with the Plan and under the guidance of a Master.Meditation only becomes effective creatively and on all the three planes in thethree worlds when the antahkarana is in process of construction. The worlds ofthe personality are the worlds of the third divine aspect and the creation ofthoughtforms therein (as usually carried forward by the concrete mind) isrelated to form, to the acquisition of that which is desired and dedicatedlargely to the material values. But when a man is beginning to function as asoul-infused personality and is occupied with the task of rendering himselfsensitive to the higher spiritual impression, then the creative work of theSpiritual Triad can be developed and a higher form of creative meditation can beemployed. It is a form which each person has to find and discover for himself,because it must be the expression of his own spiritual understanding, initiatedby a conscious construction or creation of the antahkarana and subject toimpression from the Ashram with which he may be affiliated.Earlier in this instruction I used the words: “An united world group given tounanimous and simultaneous meditation ... for the jurisdiction of the Christ.” Iparticularly want to call your attention to this last phrase which introduces anew concept into the preparatory work to be done by the New Group of WorldServers. The task is, through meditation, to establish the knowledge of and thefunctioning of those laws and principles which will control the coming era, thenew civilisation and the future world culture. Until the foundation for thecoming “jurisdiction” is at least laid, the Christ cannot reappear; if He camewithout this due preparation, much time, effort and spiritual energy would belost. Therefore, we must assume (if these premises are accepted) that there mustbe organised—in the near future—a group of men and women in every country who,under due and proper organisation, will “simultaneously and unanimously”meditate upon those juridical measures and those basic laws [237] upon which therule of Christ will be founded and which are essentially the laws of the Kingdomof God, the fifth kingdom in the evolutionary and natural processes of planetaryunfoldment.So much has been discussed in relation to these laws from the mystical andstrictly Christian angle that the terms used are essentially meaningless; thewhole subject requires revitalising; it needs to be endowed with a fresh and newpresentation and a new terminology, more suited to the growing mental grasp ofthe scientific and modern mind. There has been endless talk about Brotherhoodand the establishing of the principle that we are all the children of God, andthis has done little to change men’s approach to each other and to the sharedhuman problems.The New Group of World Servers will talk in other terms and their emphasis willbe upon:1. The Law of Right Human Relations.2. The Principle of Goodwill.3. The Law of Group Endeavour.4. The Principle of Unanimity.5. The Law of Spiritual Approach.6. The Principle of Essential Divinity.If you will study the many books which I have written, you will discover thatthey have been basically occupied with the rules which govern the ability to dogroup work—which is the work to which the Hierarchy is eternally committed. Ihave given you the Rules for Disciples in A Treatise on White Magic , the Rulesfor Aspirants in Initiation, Human and Solar , the Rules for Disciples andInitiates in A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Volume V . In other volumes you willfind the Rules for Group Work; all these rules are, in essence, modes of conductwhich, when imposed upon, impressed upon and followed up by an aspirant, willenable him to reach an understanding of spiritual law and of the nature of theKingdom of God. All these are preparatory to the establishing of the newdispensation on Earth.I would also call your attention to the words “unanimous [238] and simultaneous”meditation; they are not idly chosen. A situation which is unanimous is not onewhich is—from the spiritual angle—imposed. It is in the nature of a spontaneousmutual reaction—a reaction which is evoked by the immediate response of a soul,in touch with its personality, to a spiritual truth or intuition, and from thisthere is no lower mind escape. The concept of unanimity which has been presentedby Soviet Russia runs completely counter to the truth. Their idea is that theconcept, the idea, the decision and the interpretation of a group of powerfulmen establishes the truth, and to this truth the docile masses render promptallegiance. This is a basic misconception and to it no member of the New Groupof World Servers will render homage; they will fight this imprisonment of thehuman soul to the last gasp. True unanimity is free decision in response to apresentation of truth which is as near the achieved reality as possible.Therefore, it is in the enunciation of truth that security for all men lies .This necessarily involves a deeply spiritual presentation of essential facts.The principle of simultaneity is allied to this, for a mutual recognition of anidentical approach to truth renders inevitably activity in unison.The whole point, brother of mine, is that in both connections the incentivetowards activity lies with the individual and there is no imposing authority.The only authority recognised is the truth as it emerges in the humanconsciousness, in any world or historical cycle. Today more truth is beingrecognised (and incidentally, repudiated) than at any other time in humanhistory. Men have attained the point in evolution where they are able to knowthe truth if and when presented, because the concrete human mind is now morehighly responsive to abstract truth, and therefore to the next evolutionarypresentation. It is this which the Totalitarian Powers, the unconscious (and Imean that, brother of mine) agents of the Black Lodge are fighting; they willnot win; in the long run they cannot, for the human spirit is eternally soundand sane.I would have you consider these suggestions with care and thus prepareyourselves for an elucidation of the spiritual [239] laws and principles, asthemes for meditation. I herein present to you six themes for group meditation;this is essentially your next consideration if the “unanimous and simultaneous”meditation which can be immediately effective is organised and developed."},{"pageContent":"SECTION THREE — TEACHINGS ON INITIATIONPART I[243] Prior to profiting by more information and thus piling up increasedresponsibility, there is a vital need for the majority of aspirants anddisciples to assume a different attitude towards the opportunity to prepare forinitiation with which they are all faced. The more advanced among them areconscious of impending possibilities. The significance of the proffered traininghas made its just appeal. Others are so immersed in the tests and difficultiesincidental to the clarification of the vision prior to the processes ofinitiation, that they have neither the time nor the strength to do more thanlive through the time of trial and, at the same time, to serve as best they can.Both the vision and their service suffer from their failure to develop thatdivine indifference which is the hallmark of the true initiate . Added to allthis is the world situation with its inevitable all-enveloping psychicatmosphere, its attendant strains and its constant wearing anxiety, plus thehold which war sufferers have on all hearts and sympathies. Most aspirants anddisciples believe that they are bearing enough and are tried to the limit oftheir capacity. This is not the case. The deeper sources of strength in themhave not yet been evoked, and the tension under which they should act and livefrom day to day is only as yet a feeble one—it is not all-exacting. Ponder onthis last phrase.The objective demands being made upon all disciples and therefore upon all ofyou, are not simply to enable you to live through the present period assuccessfully—emotionally, mentally and spiritually—as possible. It goes fardeeper than that, or should. Apart from the demands upon your spiritualresources (incident to the particular initiation which it is desired that youtake) there is also the demand upon all [244] disciples to participate in theeffort of humanity, as a whole, to take the first initiation with all thephysical relinquishments, and the agony that ever precedes the birth of theChrist in the heart of the individual—only this time it is the hearts of allhumanity. Preparatory to this first initiation, there has always tobe—individually and now collectively for the first time—the denial of the lowerself and the fervid acceptance by the personality of the loss of all thematerial factors which have held the soul a prisoner in the womb of time.Hence, my brothers, the wide extent of the material destruction to be seen onevery hand, the depths of physical poverty into which all men have been and arebeing plunged, the detachment from the priority of things which is beingenforced, and the necessity for rebuilding human life on sounder values than thephysical. In all this disciples and initiates are today sharing and (whenunderstanding is present and right orientation) the help which those can givewho have already undergone the first initiation, is great. To this you arecalled, and upon your understanding response to the collective need will dependthe rapidity with which you will be enabled to achieve the next expansion ofconsciousness or initiation which may be, for you as an individual, possible.You have, therefore, to consider your individual response to the demands of yourown soul and your collective response to the collective need. It is the initiatein you, the Christ in you, which is now called to this collective service andthe radiation today of the Christ spirit, actively present in the hearts of alldisciples is the one thing which can salvage mankind, enable humanity to moveforward on to the Path of Discipleship and thus evoke that new spirit which canand will build the new world.I would like to deal somewhat with the theme anent the attitude of the accepteddisciple towards his Master and towards the general subject of initiation, andthen consider the immediate steps ahead which the disciple must take, where heis and with what equipment he has. This is the first and necessary step.Disciples must clarify their position and must continue to learn from theirMaster, in spite of [245] the crises of initiation. Unless they act upon theproffered instruction and have confidence in His occult intention, all that theMaster may say or do is of small usefulness. It serves only to increase graveresponsibility with its attendant liabilities; knowledge and the pressure ofspiritual energy become a danger if not used. This is a basic and importantstatement.There are, my brothers, two major prerequisites which are needed by all of youin connection with group integration, and they follow upon what you have hadearlier when I sought to help you to integrate with your brothers. I gave you,as you will recall, as part of your group meditation the following simpleintegrating formula:“I am one with my group brothers, and all that I have is theirs. May the lovewhich is in my soul pour forth to them. May the strength which is in me lift andaid them. May the thoughts which my soul creates reach and encourage them.”Of the two prerequisites to which I now allude as needed by all of you, one ofthem refers to your integration into my group of “practising chelas,” and theother relates to your capacity to contact me at will—a thing as yet onlypermitted to three of you at this time, and this because they seldom availthemselves of the privilege. Our first task is therefore to attend to theserequirements which call for a right attitude on your part and the use of thefirst of the ancient formulas which it is my intention to give for deepconsideration and eventual experimental use. Before I give this formula,however, I would like to deal with a question which is bound to arise in theminds of those of you who are senior in this group.The question might be voiced thus: “If I am in preparation for the second or thethird initiation, I must have been in a group of disciples—presumably theTibetan’s—for some lives at least. Why then the need for an integratingformula?” Because, my chela, though you have been in a group of disciples priorto this, it was not my group but [246] the group of either the Master M. or theMaster K.H. Owing to the fact of world urgency and the immensity of the work tobe done by Them and owing also to the fact that They are preparing to passthrough one of the highest initiations, these two Masters have handed all but afew of Their senior disciples to me and to two other of Their initiatedisciples, themselves Adepts or Masters. They have also retained in Their groupsof disciples those who have started specific work under Their direction in someprevious life, and a few disciples who came into incarnation in this worldperiod having the brain and the mind awakened to their relationship to theseMasters. These conditions do not exist in this group in relation to me—theMaster chosen to lead you forward. Yet (though you remember it not) all of youknew me well when working with the two Chohans, and hence the decision for youto work under my instruction and guidance. It has worked happily and with nodelay so far.Another reason for the use of this formula of integration by those who have hadexperience of group work is that there are some in the group who are as yet farfrom true integration, and the experience of the older chelas can be ofinestimable help if they will thus to serve the group and me. Much of what Isaid in the earlier instructions (Vol. I) on the relation of chelas to theirMaster could well be applied here and with profit.THE FORMULASThere are six ancient formulas or symbolic forms which are to be found in thearchives for disciples. They concern the six fundamental prerequisites forinitiation. They are used prior to all the major initiations, and have thereforefive significances or meanings which will become apparent only as each of theseinitiations is undergone. They are in the form sometimes of symbols andsometimes of words, and are amongst the oldest formulas in the world. They havebeen used down the ages by all disciples and initiates of the Great White Lodge.They concern what are called “the six [247] relations.” Each of these relationsmust find expression in attitude, in service, and in some deeper expansion ofconsciousness, to which I may not refer but which must be self-ascertained. Itis essential that the would-be initiate discover for himself the esoteric, innerand subjective value of the formula under his consideration. Just one hinthowever in this latter connection I may give.The disciple, when he becomes an accepted disciple (and this through the Lodge’srecognition of his pledge to his own soul), arrives at a definite and factualrecognition of the Hierarchy. His suppositions, his desires, his aspirationalwish-life, his theories, or whatever you may choose to call his reaching out andup towards divinity, give place to clear knowledge of the liberated group ofsouls. This happens not through the occurrence of convincing phenomena, butthrough an inflow of the intuition. He undergoes, therefore, an expansion ofconsciousness which may or may not be registered in the brain. Every step of theway from that point of recognition onward has to be consciously achieved andmust involve a conscious recognition of a series of expansions. These expansionsare not initiation. Have that clearly in your mind. The initiation lyingimmediately ahead is simply the effect of the recognition. They might be called“stabilising points of crisis,” in which the “occasional becomes the constantand the intended becomes the intentional.” Ponder on these words. The Hierarchyis now a fact in your life and your awareness. What is the next fact or point ofintegration or consciously achieved inclusiveness? A study of the formulas andtheir correct use will reveal this to you. I have laid the emphasis uponvisualisation and given you some hints connected both with initiation and thecreative work of the imagination, because these teachings and the development ofthese faculties will require calling into play your understanding, if theformulas connected with initiation are to be given. These six formulas aretherefore formulas of integration, and one or two hints may here be imparted.Formula One concerns, as I have told you, integration into a Master’s group, andit has two uses—if I might so [248] express it from your particular point ofview. One produces a group inclusiveness, which integrates you with your groupbrothers into my group and brings a revelation of the hidden side of a chela’slife. When I say this I refer to his new astral conditioning . This is given thename of the Revelation of Group Feeling . This subject is vaster in itsimplications than you might surmise, for it concerns united group sensitivity orresponse, outwards to the world of men, inwards to the Hierarchy, and upwards tothe Monad. It does not concern the sum total of the petty moods and feelings ofthe personalities of the group members. Its second use is to bring about contactwith the Master of your group—in this case myself, the Master D.K. This is aprocess which I have already done my best to help you to achieve through myinstructions re the Full Moon contact—something you have most inadequatelyunderstood and attempted. Perhaps now you will work harder at the production of“contact relationship” as it is esoterically called. It is with Formula One thatyou must now work.Formula Two deals with alignment; not alignment as it is understood in the verynecessary preparatory work of the Arcane School. That form of alignment is theproduction of effective and direct contact with the soul. The alignment to whichthis formula refers is connected with the antahkarana. This will be our nextconsideration when Formula One has brought about certain changes inconsciousness. I shall not consider these formulas at present. I will only pointout their major implications which will be seldom what you think, conditioned asyou are by the terms and interpretations of the lower mind.Formula Three is related to certain changes in the egoic lotus. These changesmight be inadequately expressed in the terms of the Old Commentary :“There is that which transmutes knowledge into wisdom within a flash of time ;there is that which changes sensitivity into love within an area of space ;there is [249] that which alters sacrifice into bliss where neither time norspace exists.”Formula Four has a specific effect upon the “jewel in the lotus,” awakening itto life; this it does (through effects produced) upon the three planes of thethree worlds, thus bringing about changes in the seven wheels (centres) so thatthe “dynamic point at the centre of each wheel obliterates the lesser points offorce, and thus the wheel begins to turn upon itself.”Formula Five awakens the Will , but any interpretation of this awakening wouldprove meaningless to you until the previous four formulas have established aneffect upon you and the needed interior changes have taken place.Formula Six is sometimes called “the word of death.” It negates the destructiveeffect of the death process which is going on all the time within the mechanismof the disciple or initiate. The death proceeds with its needed work, but it isnot destructive in effect. This formula has never been given out before todisciples, but can now be known because the Piscean Age is one in which at lastthe power of physical death is definitely broken and the signature of theResurrection is revealed. In this esoteric negation of death are the deeplyhidden and impressive causes of the two stages of the world war (1914-1945), andin this formula lies the significance lying behind the “fight for freedom” ofthe peoples of the world. It is sometimes called “the formula of liberation.”If you were a disciple who had access to the archives wherein instructions fordisciples are contained, you would be confronted (in relation to the sixformulas referred to above) by six large sheets of some unknown metal. Theselook as if made of silver and are in reality composed of that metal which is theallotrope of silver and which is therefore to silver what the diamond is tocarbon. Upon these sheets are words, symbols, and symbolic forms. These, whenrelated to each other, contain the formulas which the disciple has to interpretand integrate in his waking consciousness. This must be done through the mediumof living processes. [250] As I cannot show you these formulas upon the physicalplane, the best that I can do is to describe them to you, and in thisInstruction I will seek to describe Formula One. The comprehension of the wordsand symbols produces two reactions in the consciousness of the disciple—and whena group of disciples are working with the same formula (as is the case in thisgroup) this is intensified and of still greater value.The first reaction is called the “Formula of Revelation” and is related to theunited sensitivity of the group. As, together, the group members brood upon andcome to an understanding of the formula, they will swing into a responsivenessto the feeling and sensitive reactions of the individuals in the group, andthese, together, constitute and form the astral body of the group.When this reaction has been established (and a spirit of non-criticism and oflove will greatly aid in the process), the group together can arrive at thesecond purpose of the formula, which is called “the discovery of the pointwithin the circle.” This signifies—as far as the group is involved—therevelation of the central coherent force of the group itself. This is—at thesame time and until after the higher initiation which we call the fourthinitiation—the Master at the centre of the group. This is, consequently, thecorrespondence to the “jewel in the lotus,” where the individual is concerned,to the Hierarchy, where humanity is concerned, and to the central point of lifein all forms. Of form and of consciousness, the circle and the point are thenatural symbols. This applies equally to the atom, to man, to the planet and tothe solar system. The concept must constitute the foundational idea in allreflection upon this formula.Now for the formula itself:“A line of fire between two blazing points. A stream of water blue—again aline—emerging from the earth—and ending in the ocean. A tree with root above andflowers below. [251]“Out of the fire, and always at the midway point, appears the eye of God(Shiva). Upon the stream, between the two extremes, there floats the eye ofvision—a thread of light unites the two.“Deep in the tree, between the root and flowers, the eye again is seen. The eyethat knows, the eye that sees, the directing eye—one made of fire, one fluid asthe sea, and two which look from here to there. Fire, water and the earth—allneed the vital air. The air is life. The air is God.”The significance of this formula is not difficult for the advanced student tograsp in connection with himself. The eye of knowledge, the eye of vision andthe directing eye of Deity are familiar to him. But it is the great and majoresoteric implications which I ask you to consider. An extension of theseconcepts to a Master and His ashram or His group of practising disciples, is ofvalue to you in your reflective consciousness. The first and obviousinterpretation concerns the eye of knowledge. But what of the eye of vision whenduality is being overcome , and what of the “purpose for which the worlds weremade”—the little world of the individual (once individuality is achieved) andthe greater world of an organised group, integrated and functioning as a unit,and the distant subtle world of divine intent?I say no more in this connection. I commend to your brooding reflection thesesubtle implications. I would ask you to ponder on them and—prior to the WesakFull Moon—I would ask you to write your understanding of the formula from twoangles. About these two angles you definitely should have ideas.1. The angle of the individual.2. The angle of a group of chelas.Both these unities utilise the eye of knowledge and the eye of vision.PART IIPOINTS OF REVELATION[252] I have dealt considerably in my earlier writings with the theme, Points ofCrisis. We can now approach and prove the livingness of our progress from theangle of Points of Revelation . The entire objective of the initiationpreparatory process is to bring about revelation. You must ever bear in mindthat that which is revealed is eternally present. There is, therefore, occulttruth in the statement that there is “nothing new under the sun.” All that isrevealed upon the Path of Discipleship and of Initiation is forever there, butthat which can perceive, reach out and include has developed with the ages. Uponthe Path of Discipleship, in the earlier stages, the eye of vision is theillumined mind. Upon the Path of Initiation it is that of which the eye of themind is the exteriorisation—the intuitional perception of the soul itself. Butas evolution proceeds, that which is brought to the point of perceiving theexisting verities differs vastly as the centuries slip away. E’en the adept ofthe present is pronouncedly more perceptive and more accurately interpretive andhis vision more penetrative than was the adept in Atlantean days, and theinitiate who will achieve initiate-perception during the coming Aquarian Agewill be greatly in advance of those who now function as the adepts of today.I have warned you that discipleship is becoming increasingly difficult. This isowing to the increased sensitivity to the esoteric values and realities whichthe modern disciple manifests. He can and does perceive that which was the goalof initiation in earlier aeons and perceives these things normally and as anestablished fact in a developed awareness. It is the spiritual parallel of thedevelopment during material evolution of the five senses. His goal and his“pointed direction” lie far ahead and his inclusiveness opens for him doorswhich in earlier times only opened to the initiate knock. I consequently holdout to you no easy way but only one of difficulty and adjustment.[253] In all forward stages upon the Path of Initiation, there are three phaseswhich concern the initiate-aspirant’s reactions. There is first of all thevision of the soul, but whereas in the past there was the vision and thestarting point, now the modern disciple perceives likewise many of theintermediate stages, the opposing forces, the obstructions and the rapidlyarousing handicaps and hindrances. The words I here use are chosen withdeliberation. He is not now totally blind nor does he move forward entirely inthe dark. There is enough light in him to bring to him what is called the“little revelation,” and, in that light, will he see the greater light andarrive at a truer perception. He sees himself, and that—for aeons—the disciplehas ever been able to do. But now he also perceives and recognises his brotherin the light, and this evokes personality reactions and he has to adjust himselfnot only to himself as he discovers himself to be, but likewise to what he findshis brother also to be. This is no easy adjustment to make, and this the earlierimparted Rules of the Road (Discipleship in the New Age, Vol. I. Pages 583 -584) will have indicated to you.I would like here, my brother, to list for you the most important of thestatements made by me in the previous instruction, indicating those which embodyimportant hints and showing you, this one time, with what care I prepare thatwhich I seek to impart and how, therefore, I expect from you a careful study ofmy words. Here are these key thoughts:1. Only that which you know for yourself and consciously experience is ofimportance. This refers especially to the following:a. Your perception of the vision.b. Your contact with me, your Master.c. Your recognition of the initiatory process.I told you, therefore, that you must have (for the goal) the demonstrating ofthe initiate-consciousness through both mind and brain and consequently upon thephysical plane. [254]2. Initiation is, as far as you are at present concerned, a “moment of crisiswherein the consciousness hovers upon the border line of revelation.” Thisinvolves consequently:a. A tremendous pull between the pairs of opposites.b. The existence, as a result, of a field of tension.c. The effort to stand firm at the midway point.I would remind you that this does not refer to the man upon the path of life,pulled as he is between the pairs of opposites upon the plane of desire, but tothe soul standing at the midway point between the monad and the personality andpreparing to make the Great Renunciation—a renunciation which the personalitymakes possible—and to disappear, leaving the two (personality and monad)perfectly at-one. It is the man, as the soul, in full waking consciousness whotakes initiation. Hence the emphasis upon soul contact when a man is upon theProbationary Path and passing through the early stages of discipleship. Thisleads, later, to the emphasis placed upon the need for two majoractivities—before the man can take the higher initiations:a. Upon alignment.b. Upon the scientific building of the antahkarana.3. The revelation, given to the initiate, is not a vision of possibilities, buta factual experience, leading to:a. The evocation of new powers.b. The recognition of new modes and fields of service.c. Freedom of movement within the bounds of the Hierarchy.d. New hierarchical contacts and new responsibilities which face the initiate.He, therefore, realises what St. Paul meant when—talking in hierarchicalterms—he said “All things are become new.” It is not simply a question of visionand contacts but of vital interrelation and of recognition which bring with theminsight into the Mind of God . [255]4. Four lines of teaching were emphasised in past centuries and up until theyear 1875:a. Hints as to the changing of personality character as preparatory toinitiation.b. Teaching as to the oneness of Deity and of the universal order.c. Instruction as to the creative process.d. Laya yoga or the yoga of energy, working through force centres.Two things must now happen: the imparted theories which have guided thedisciple’s thinking hitherto must become practical experiences, and there mustbe such a shift in consciousness that the present vision must become the pastexperience and a new and deeper and entirely different recognition must take theplace of the old goals. Here comes, consequently, a complete test-out of pasthierarchical methods and modes of work. Has what the past has given proved anadequate preparation for that which will be the methods and propositions of thefuture? Have the foundations of truth been so securely settled that the comingsuperstructure will be based on such a sound reality that it can stand theimpact of the new incoming solar and cosmic forces? Will the past work of theHierarchy stand? Such are the problems with which the initiate-teachers aretoday faced.Just as the attitudes of the disciple to daily living and to world happeningsare totally unlike that of the average man because he is living increasingly inthe world of meaning, so the initiate -disciple develops an attitude to livingprocesses and to world events which is based on character (necessarily),interpreted in the world of meaning, but to them he brings a different light tobear and a motivation—based on newly acquired knowledge and understanding—whichis entirely different to the two previous conditions. The four lines of teachingare taken for granted; the initiate is supposed to have grasped and mastered allof it in some experimental and experiential measure. Now the new formulas oflife must control; they are life formulas, not [256] soul formulas. Newknowledge must supersede the old and it will not concern that which has hithertobeen regarded as the ultimate goal.An illustration of this is the fact that to the esotericist of the past littlewas known of the seven Rays and the seven ray types, and naught had been givenout anent Shamballa. Now the world of instructed disciples is slowly awakeningto these newer values and truths and to the sevenfold source of life expression;the Will of God is going to take shape consciously in the minds of men in thefuture in such a manner that the old truths will condition and control as neverbefore, but will drop automatically below the threshold of consciousness and thenew emerging values and recognitions will take their place in the surfaceconsciousness of all disciples—and their name will be Legion.5. The astral body provides no hindrance to the initiate-disciple, but providesa medium of facile contact with the Hierarchy. This is due to the fact that thelink between the astral body and the buddhic consciousness becomes at this stageincreasingly close. They constitute essentially a pair of opposites which willeventually fuse; then the astral body will disappear as does the soul body at alater stage of development.6. Every disciple has to discover for himself and alone for which initiation heis being prepared; the Master never gives this information. Light on the subjectcomes through the recognition of tests and the types of experience which comehis way. “It is a matter,” I have elsewhere told you, “of interior orientationand not of outside information.” Recognition and orientation are the keynotes ofthis phase.7. Always there exists the need for humility. This involves:a. An adjusted sense of right proportion.b. A balanced point of view.c. A dispassionate attitude.d. Truthful recognition of assets as well as debits. [257]Here also I gave you a hint in stating that true humility is based on fact, onvision and on time pressures.8. Two immediate objectives face the disciples, plus the need for one quality:a. To integrate into the inner Ashram as “practising chelas.”b. To contact the Master at will.c. To develop divine indifference.9. In connection with the formulas, two reactions are automatically evoked inthe true disciple and in the true group within the Ashram:a. The reaction which is called the “formula of revelation.” This designatessensitive response to the ancient formulas which are given to those beingprepared for initiation. One of these I have already given to you.b. The reaction called the “discovery of the point within the circle.”Have you ever thought, my brother, that one reason why you have not as yetcontacted me freely in your waking consciousness and talked with me face to facemay be due to the fact that the “circle” is for you only as yet a theory? Untilthe circle of your brothers is a fact in your everyday awareness and of primeimportance in your daily life, it is not possible for you to arrive at contactwith the “Point.” The disciple starts on the periphery of the Master’s circleand works towards the centre; he is apt, however, to reverse this procedure inhis consciousness.I have stated that initiation is essentially a process of revelation. For thedisciple who is being prepared to take an initiation the emphasis is necessarilylaid upon recognition —the intelligent recognition of what is to be revealed.This requires on his part a definite emergence from the world of glamour so thatthere can be a clear perception of the new vision; a new light is thrown uponold and well-known truths so that their significance is extraordinarily [258]changed, and in that changing the plan or purpose of Deity takes on an entirelyfresh meaning. The inexperienced neophyte is constantly receiving revelationsand recording what he regards as most unusual intuitions. All that is reallyhappening, however, is that he is becoming aware of soul knowledge, whereas forthe initiate the intuition is ever the revelation of the purpose of Shamballaand the working out, both from the short range and the long range angle, of thedivine Plan. The revelation which is accorded at initiation is given to thesoul, recorded by the “mind held steady in the light” and then later—withgreater or less rapidity—transferred to the brain. You can see, therefore, thetrue intention of the system of Raja Yoga as it trains the mind to be receptiveeventually to the Spiritual Triad . You can also see why for centuries theemphasis of the Teachers of the Ageless Wisdom has been upon the necessity fordiscrimination, particularly where the probationary disciple is concerned.I am at this time carrying the current teaching upon initiation a step forwardand am seeking to show that it is not essentially a process of soul-personalityfusion (though that has to be a preliminary step) but of monad-personalityintegration, carried forward because of an attained alignment with the soul.Initiation is in fact the essential and inevitable process of transferring theprimary triplicity of manifestation into the basic duality of spirit-matter. Itis the “dissolution of the intermediary,” and to this the crucifixion and deathof the Christ was dedicated and intended to be the revelation, to the initiatesof the past 2000 years, of the transmutation of the trinity of manifestationinto the duality of purpose. I cannot word this in any other way but theenlightened will comprehend my meaning. The interpreters of the Gospel and manydisciples of the Christian dispensation have singularly failed to grasp thisrevelation; they have laid the emphasis upon the death of the personality,whereas when Christ experienced the “great void of darkness” and chanted aloudthe occult mantram “My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me,” he wasrecognising simultaneously the distinction between His “robe of glory”(symbolised by the [259] partition of His garment by the Roman soldiery) andalso calling the attention of all future disciples and initiates to thedisappearance of the “middle principle,” the soul; He was projecting (into theworld consciousness) the recognition which must come of relation to the Fatheror the Monad. This great dissolution is culminated for us at the time of thethird initiation when the Light of the Monad obliterates the light of the souland the material atomic light of the threefold personality. But—and here is thepoint—the recognition of this death and its effects is only symbolically enactedand recognised at the time of the fourth initiation, the Crucifixion. All lesserdissolutions, deaths, renunciations and disappearances of that to which thelower nature holds and is held are enacted in relation to the accustomed aspectsof form-life, and of conscious sensitivity and awareness; they are simplypreparatory to and symbolic of the final great dissolution of the causal body,consummated at the Crucifixion. This leads to the resurrection or uprising ofthe personality-soul consciousness (duly fused and blended) into that of themonad. This is finally carried to the point of solar perfection at the Ascensioninitiation.I have given you this teaching in terms of the Christian presentation as it maybe simpler for you to grasp, but there are many other formulations andapproaches to these truths and the newer they are the more difficult necessarilyare they to present. Only those who are on the immediate verge of initiationwill understand; the others will prefer to interpret these truths to themselvesin the easier and well-known formulas of the preparatory stage of the at-one-ingof soul and personality.The stage of recognising the revelation which is accorded to the initiate of themajor Mysteries is itself divided into lesser phases. These might be describedas three in number though much is dependent upon the initiation to be taken andthe ray of the prepared disciple. These are:1. The Stage of Penetration. This refers to the piercing through the worldglamour and thereby effecting two objectives: [260]a. The Light of the Spiritual Triad streams into the consciousness of theinitiate, via the antahkarana, so that the Plan for humanity and the divinePurpose in relation to the planet become increasingly clear. This initiatesrelation to Shamballa.b. Part of the world glamour is thus dissipated and thus a clarifying of theastral plane takes place and humanity is consequently served. Every disciple whoarrives at a recognition of the initiate-revelation releases light anddissipates a part of the glamour which blinds the mass of men. The sixth raydisciple takes far longer over this stage of penetration than do disciples onthe other rays but only in this world cycle.2. The Stage of Polarisation. This is the stage wherein the initiate, having letin the light and penetrated through the dense fogs and mists of the world ofglamour, suddenly realises just what he has done and takes a firm stand,correctly oriented towards the vision (or to word it otherwise towardsShamballa). One of the things which must be grasped is that as the initiate is apoint of hierarchical life (either on the periphery of the Hierarchy, or withinthe circle or at the centre) he is a definite part of the hierarchical effort.That effort is directed towards an orientation to the greater centre oflife—Shamballa. Students are apt to believe that the orientation of theHierarchy is towards humanity. That is not so. They respond to human need whenthe demand is effective, and are custodians of the Plan; but the orientation ofthe entire hierarchical group is towards the first aspect, as it expresses theWill of the Logos and manifests through Shamballa. Just as the disciple has todo two things: polarise his position by establishing right human relations andat the same time become a conscious, practising member of the Kingdom of God,the Hierarchy, so the initiate—upon a higher turn of the spiral—has to establishright relations with the Hierarchy and become simultaneously conscious ofShamballa.All I can impart here is the desired point of attainment [261] but thephraseology is relatively meaningless, except to those who are experienced inthe processes of initiation to a greater or less degree, according to theinitiations already taken. This polarisation, this point of focussed effort andthis attained orientation is the basic idea lying behind the phrase “theMountain of Initiation.” The initiate “plants his feet upon the mountain top andfrom that point of altitude perceives the thought of God, visions the dreamwithin the Mind of God, follows God’s eye from central point to outer goal andsees himself as all that is and yet within the whole.”3. The Stage of Precipitation . Having thus identified himself throughpenetration and polarisation with the Plan and with the Will of God (which isthe key to Shamballa), he then proceeds—as a result of this triplerecognition—to do his share in materialising the Plan and in bringing throughinto outer manifestation and expression as much of that Plan as he can. He thusbecomes first of all an outpost of the Hierarchy (which of necessity meanssensitivity to the Shamballa energy), and then increasingly an Agent ofLight—the Light universal, or the Light of the Monad.I have no more to say today anent initiation. Ponder upon that which I havegiven and grasp as far as you imaginatively can the magnificence of theinitiatory process—so vastly more inclusive than has been indicated by any ofthe teaching given hitherto. After the war is over and the new world, with itscoming civilisation and culture begins to take shape, an increasing emphasiswill be laid upon the purpose of the Controlling Deity or basic Life or Energyas it is working out through humanity. This will be done by those who aretrained esotericists. Much that is now being said by world leaders and servingworkers in every nation is an indication of an unconscious response to theShamballa energy. Towards the end of the century and during the first fewdecades of the twenty-first century, teaching anent Shamballa will be givenforth. The effort of the abstract mind of man will be towards the comprehensionof this, just as the [262] goal of hierarchical contact marks the present effortof the disciple. Glamour is disappearing; illusions are being dissipated; thestage of penetration into a new dimension, into a new phase of effort and ofattainment is rapidly being promulgated. This is being done in spite of all thehorror and agony and will be one of the first results of respite from war. Thewar itself is shattering illusions, revealing the need for change and producinga demand for a future new world and a coming beauty in living which will berevolutionary and a material response to an intensive initiation process inwhich all disciples can share and for which advanced aspirants can preparethemselves.THE FORMULASNow that you have, presumably, brooded for some months on my instructions on theFormulas, I will seek to impart to you some of the deeper implications.Formula One.“A line of fire between two blazing points. A stream of water blue, again aline, emerging from the earth and ending in the ocean. A tree with root aboveand flowers below.“Out of the fire and always at the midway point appears the eye of God (Shiva).Upon the stream, between the two extremes, there floats the eye of vision; athread of light unites the two.“Deep in the tree, between the root and flowers, the eye again is seen. The eyethat knows, the eye that sees, the directing eye—one made of fire, one fluid asthe sea, and two which look from here to there. Fire, water and the earth—allneed the vital air. The air is life. The air is God.”These formulas and their implications have caused some of you concern because oftheir extreme difficulty of interpretation. I would ask you to bear in mind thatyou are individually [263] quite unable to grasp the extent of your owncomprehension because the mind (the major conditioning factor in a disciple’slife in the early stages of his training) knows far more than the brain iscapable of recording. Later, in the life of the initiate, the soul registersconsciously for the disciple who can identify himself with the soul, far morethan the concrete mind is able to register. I would ask you, therefore, to ceasegauging your capacity to understand and instead simply to brood and reflect.Let me briefly summarise for you some of the things I indicated anent theseformulas in my previous instructions:1. They are concerned with the six relationships, as the disciple succeeds inestablishing them.2. These six relationships are not six initiations but six intermediateexpansions of consciousness, occurring between the major initiations.3. They are definitely formulas of integration:a. They concern integration progressively into a Master’s group.b. They also concern integration into some state of group sensitivity, on someone plane, for consciousness of sensitive response is the keynote of all theplanes throughout the solar system.4. They are also formulas of revelation. This is peculiarly so in connectionwith Formula One. They bring about, when rightly used:a. The revelation of group feeling.b. The revelation of the Master as He is, the centre of light and power withinthe circle.c. The revelation of the point of life at the centre of all forms.These effects, resulting from right comprehension of the formulas, might beregarded as reactions—automatic and inevitable; I used this word “reaction” inmy last instruction. These reactions are frequently, and I might say usually,unconscious and it is only gradually that the disciple wakes up to the fact thatby quiet reflection upon the formula, certain [264] expansions of consciousness,a greater sensitivity and an intuitive recognition of the hitherto unseen andunrealised have wrought definite changes in his subjective nature. He does therequired work and the results naturally and simply happen.Here is a hint as to the need for occult obedience. I have the responsibility ofindicating to you the work I want done and the steps to be taken. Yousubsequently have to do the work. Most of you, living normally as you do in theworld of effects and not in the world of causes, are preoccupied with thepossible results and the phenomenal differences (if I might call them so) whichare expected by you to eventuate from the work. Therefore, instead ofconcentrating upon exactitude of work and meticulous obedience, your energy goesinto the thought of what will happen, into the consideration of the difficultiesof the work, and into your belief that no results are demonstrating in yourparticular case. Primarily what I am doing in giving you these formulas is toaid you to work in the world of causes and so draw you consciously out of theworld of effects. Therefore, I would ask you to do the indicated work, toconcentrate your minds upon these formulas of power—”working withoutattachment,” as the Gita expresses it—and refrain from looking for results,knowing that they will be there, e’en though unrecognised by you, until yourfocus is more definitely subjective. I did not say “introspective,” my brother,but “subjective.” To be an introvert really means that you, as a thinkingpersonality, are always looking in to your inner feeling and thought life. Thatis not living subjectively; it is living as an outer observer who looks within.To live subjectively means that the focus of your consciousness is within andthat from that point you look in two directions: outward at the personality uponthe physical plane and inward at the soul. Ponder on this. The distinction isvery real and one that you should grasp. The man who knows the differencebetween living an introspective life and a subjective life is well on the way tobeing a true esotericist.Let us look for a minute at Formula One and seek its [265] simplestinterpretation, and yet an advanced one from the angle of the neophyte (whichyou should not be). I will take one or two general ideas which emerge from ananalysis of the whole and then a few sentences which—when interpreted—may throwlight upon certain basic and practical significances.I would first have you note the emphasis upon the “eye” in this formula. It is akeynote and appears in various guises. Behind all the ideas lies the concept ofseeing, of a Seeing One, looking on at the created Whole. This same concept isto be found in the fundamental Masonic symbol of the Eye of God which dominateseverything within the Temple. In this formula we have:1. The Eye of God . Shiva is the first Person of the Trinity, the Destroyer, butat the same time the Final Absorber, the Whole and yet the part. This is theorgan of the divine Will or Power, the Eye, through Whose directed gaze thepower flows outward to its created Whole. In the case of the human spirit, it isthe Monad.2. The Eye of Vision, indicating this time not the directing energy, but theconscious Observer, the Soul, whether cosmic, solar or human.3. The Eye that Know s. This is the disciple who, from stage to stage, reactsincreasingly to the direction of the spiritual will and to the growth ofsensitive response, and in both his brain and his mind consciousness in thethree worlds knows . That knowledge is limited in the neophyte, deepening in thedisciple and profound in the Master, but it is all related to vision.4. At the same time this formula tells us that there are four eyes:a. “One made of fire” . . . the eye of God.b. “One fluid as the sea” . . . the eye of vision.c. “And two which look from here to there, the eye that knows.” These are theeye of the disciple and the eye of the personality. There is a clue to this in astatement in The Secret Doctrine that the right eye [266] is the eye of buddhiand the left eye the eye of manas—these are the eyes of the high gradeintegrated personality, en rapport with the soul.d. “Fire, water and the earth all need the vital air. The air is life.” The clueagain to this is to be found in The Secret Doctrine , I.80, where we find thewords “Matter is the Vehicle for the manifestation of Soul on this plane ofexistence, and Soul is the Vehicle on a higher plane for the manifestation ofSpirit and these three are a Trinity, synthesised by Life, which pervades themall.”You can see, therefore, upon careful reflection how simple this matter is,exoterically considered, and how the key to understanding lies in consciousidentification with all three, both sequentially through growth andsimultaneously through initiation. I have here given you an occult hint.Secondly, I would have you note how this formula refers to the antahkarana:1. “A line of fire between two blazing points”—the monad and the soul.2. “A line, emerging from the earth and ending in the ocean”—referring to thesutratma which, when the antahkarana is completed, blends all types ofconsciousness, spirit and matter, into one living whole, the ultimate Reality.These are some of the more obvious significances; deeper ones will emerge whenthese are realities and not speculative theories in your life. It will beapparent to you consequently the need for definite work upon the instructionsgiven you upon the antahkarana. In connection with the above, I would call yourattention to some words I wrote in my last instruction to you in reference toFormula Two. I there said that alignment “will be our next consideration whenFormula One has brought about certain changes in consciousness. I shall notconsider these formulas at present. I will only point out their majorimplications which will be seldom what you think, conditioned as you are by theterms and the interpretations of the lower concrete mind.” [267]PART IIIIn past instructions we have seen that teaching upon the subject of initiationis given by me (as by all the Masters) in three ways:1. By Hints. These—if seen and followed—will evoke the intuition. Initiation isnever taken unless the intuition is becoming active. Spiritual instinct, thelowest aspect of the intuition, indicates readiness for the first initiation; anillumined mind and spiritual intelligence are the definite sign that a man cantake the second initiation, whilst spiritual perception or intuitive instinctsignifies preparedness for the Transfiguration, the third initiation.2. By the use of certain great Formulas (one of which has already been given toyou) certain definite revelations become possible. These formulas are six innumber; they contain the six prerequisites for initiation, and they aresometimes in the form of words and sometimes in the form of symbols. These serveto develop the “initiate hearing” and the “initiate sight.” They deal with thesix relationships:Formula One . . . Deals with integration into an Ashram and is concerned withthe revelation of group feeling . It is related to the astral nature.Formula Two . . . Deals with alignment. It concerns the revelation of the groupantahkarana and is related to the mind nature, in which the antahkarana isanchored.Formula Three . . . Deals with certain changes in the soul nature. It isconcerned with the relation of time and space, and is therefore related to theEternal Now.Formula Four . . . Deals with the Life aspect. It is concerned with therevelation of the nature of life, and is therefore related to the circulationand interplay of energy. [268]Formula Five . . . Deals with the Will aspect. It is concerned with therevelation of divine Purpose, and is therefore related to Shamballa.Formula Six . . . Deals with the nature of death. It is concerned with therevelation of the constructive work of the Destroyer aspect. It is thereforerelated to the passing Piscean Age and with all processes of “abstraction.”These Formulas have seven interpretations; only three of them are, however,possible of discovery by the disciple in training at this particular time,because only the light from the Spiritual Triad can convey this type ofrevelation and interpretation.3. Through the presentation of Points of Revelation :a. The present vision must become the past experience. Its light of revelationwill fade out as the experience becomes a habit, and therefore falls below thethreshold of consciousness.b. A new and totally different recognition must assume control; this willexpress the initiate-understanding.c. These points of revelation appear when the disciple realises that initiationis not a process of soul-personality fusion but of Monad-personalityintegration.d. These points of revelation assume three stages of recognition:The stage of Penetration.The stage of Polarisation.The stage of Precipitation.The approach of the disciple to the entire subject of initiation differs todayfrom that of earlier times—even so short a time ago as fifty years. It isessential that you grasp the fact that his approach is now mental, and not asheretofore, devotional and emotional and aspirational. It has hitherto beenkama-manasic, which connotes a blend of lofty aspiration, of lower mindattention and focussing, and of attention to the purely physical disciplines.Today, the true [269] disciple who is ready for this great step is in control ofhis emotional apparatus; his lower mind is keenly alert and focussed, and hishigher mind is definitely en rapport with the lower, via the antahkarana.Perhaps clarity of perception will come to you if you realise that theconditional demands of the Initiator (until the period of the year 1400 A.D.)were for conscious soul contact; today, it is for a measure of establishedrelation to the Spiritual Triad, via the antahkarana. This is a very differentmatter; soul contact is necessarily present, but is not deemed to give all thatthe initiate of the New Age must have. Love is of course needed; wisdom must bepresent, but the sense of universality is also required and indicates, whenpresent, a measure of monadic inflow. This inflow comes naturally via theantahkarana or across the “rainbow bridge.” Hence, you will see the reason forthe emphasis which I have lately been giving to the building of this bridge. Agreat change in the human consciousness made it possible—in the year 1425A.D.—to inaugurate changes in the requirements for initiation and definitely tolift the standard. Five hundred years have gone by since then, and the purposeof these changes in discipline and training have proved well warranted. In spiteof all signs to the contrary, in spite of the world war with its attendanthorrors and in spite of the apparent unawakened attitude of the masses, a veryreal measure of monadic energy is present. Humanity will increasinglydemonstrate this as the insistent demand for unity and the growth ofinternationalism will demonstrate. The objectives, goals, theories, aims anddeterminations of the bulk of mankind already testify to this.These expressions of the evolutionary development of humanity are related to thefirst manifesting qualities of the Will aspect. When I say this I give you ahint, reminding you that the candidate for initiation grows by the recognitionand the interpretation of hints, and by extracting from a hint its truesignificance. The will is not, as so many believe, a forceful expression ofintention; it is not a fixed determination to do thus and so or to make certainthings to be. It is fundamentally an expression of the Law of Sacrifice; underthis law, the unit recognises responsibility, identifies itself with [270] thewhole, and learns the esoteric significance of the words: “Having nothing(sacrifice) and yet possessing all things (universality).” I would ask you toreflect upon these words of the great initiate, St. Paul. The full expression ofthese highest spiritual qualities (from the angle of modern man) comes after thefourth initiation, that of the Great Renunciation. Everything is thenrelinquished in order that everything may be held in trust and used for the goodof all; the will-to-good then dominates. Hence the necessity for the scientificconstruction of the rainbow bridge; hence the emphasis upon the Monad, theFather aspect which can now be revealed and known, because the work of aeons isculminating in a general soul contact, where humanity as a whole is concerned.This is testified to by the fact that so very many thousands have (as I haveseveral times told you) taken the first initiation. The Christ Child is presentin truth, and the human heart and mind are becoming aware of that fact; the goalfor thousands everywhere is the demonstration of the Christ spirit, and theexemplification of a life conditioned by love and modelled upon that of Christor Shri Krishna, His earlier incarnation.This makes possible, therefore, the next great human unfoldment which grows outof the Christ consciousness and “brings to light” (I know no other way in whichto express this concept) the will of God, and points also to the basicdistinction between goodwill and the will-to-good. Again I would ask you toreflect upon this distinction, for it connotes the difference between a liferuled and conditioned by the soul and one which is ruled and conditioned by theSpiritual Triad. This distinction is very real, for one quality grows out oflove, and the other out of the recognition of the universality of life; one isan expression of the Christ consciousness and life, and the other is aresponsiveness to monadic inflow, and yet the two are one. More anent this willbe indicated as you study the teaching upon the antahkarana.One of the tasks which I have undertaken is to awaken the aspirants and thedisciples of the world to the new possibilities and to the new incomingpotencies which can become available for use, if they will pass on to a fullergrasp of the developments since 1425 A.D. Much that I am giving and [271] shallin the future give anent initiation, its methods, processes and application willappear entirely new. The New Age will bring in eventually a civilisation and aculture which will be utterly different to anything hitherto known. I wouldremind you here that all civilisations and cultures areexternalisations—modified, qualified and adapted to racial and national needs—ofthe potent, vibrating and planned activity of the world initiates and discipleswho constitute the Hierarchy of the time. Their plans, Their thinking and Theirliving potency pour out ceaselessly and affect the consciousness of Theirdisciples; these latter step down the inflowing energies so that the thinkersand idealists can grasp these new emerging truths more accurately. Eventuallythe truths thus grasped change the consciousness of humanity as a whole andraise it—if you like that phrase; thus modes of daily living, civilised methodsof conduct and cultural developments eventuate. All this is traceable to thegroup of initiates upon the inner side who thus serve their fellowmen and carryforward, consciously and with intent, the Law of Evolution. Whilst doing this,They Themselves are preparing to tread the “Way of the Higher Evolution.” Whatthat Way is I cannot tell you, for you would be unable to grasp its meaning; itis related to the spiritual condition and purpose of the Monad whose goal is notexpansion of consciousness, but of that which such expansions of consciousnesswill reveal—a very different matter and one which is as yet entirely meaninglessto anyone who has not taken the third initiation. Forget not, the Christ and Hisgreat Brothers, and all of an even higher initiate-rank than They possess, havea definite goal, but it is one which will only define itself clearly in thethird solar system, the system in which the Will of God is the dominant idea, asthe Love of God conditions this system in which we now function. But this is notconsciousness or awareness; it is a stage of Being which is connected with theLaw of Sacrifice—the law which governs those states of being which grow out ofthe establishment of right human relations.Purpose can only be revealed and understood when such right relations are thefirmly fixed habits of all “points of [272] divine expression.” You can see,therefore, why it is not possible for those in process of grasping the need forright human relations to understand more than that a great possibility liesahead. Of the nature of this possibility only the higher ranks of initiates areaware, and towards it they strive.THE FORMULASWe now come to the second of the great Formulas which give the initiate the keyto the next stage of his work. These curious and ancient sets of phrases orsymbols are endowed with power, owing to the potency of the minds which havereflected upon them, which have constructed thoughtforms anent them, and whichhave used them as modes or methods of focussing triadal light upon thepersonality. I would call your attention to the form of words just used. Theseformulas do not release the light of the soul into the attentive waiting mind.They release the light of electric fire (and therefore not solar fire) into theintegrated personality, so that the entire man—now become the oriented mechanismof the Monad—is flooded with this higher form of energy—an aspect of the energyof will and related to the carrying forward of divine purpose. You canappreciate, consequently, how relatively impossible it is for any of you to domore than register the more obvious significances of these formulas and thenawait the time when your inner growth warrants a fresh approach to theirinterpretation.This formula is seen by the disciple inscribed upon the plates of the unknownmetal, described by me on page 249. It is formed of a series of lines which meetat a circle within a square, such as that depicted below:[Image00014.jpg][273] Curiously enough, it is this ancient symbol, with its indicated referenceto the emotional nature, and therefore to the Atlantean consciousness, whichpoints to a basis for progress, which is the subtle force behind the “flags ofall nations.” Flags are symbols of the devotion of a people to their nationalsoil and to their national spiritual objectives. They have of course beenprostituted to signify national separativeness and selfishness and nationalpatriotism, but behind the flag is a point of power which is the point ofinspiration to the soul of the people. Not yet, equally of course, is the “pointmoving forward into the circle of the people’s life”; as yet, you have only thesquare of the personality reactions of the people and the lines of theirevolutionary approach to a deeper consciousness; this developing consciousnesswe call the “soul of the people.” Some day, the point will take its place in thecentre of the square and all the lines will converge upon that point; we shallthen have a nation, galvanised into activity by interior spiritual energy, andthe lines which have hitherto converged inwards towards the centre will becomechannels or pathways along which spiritual energy will flow into every phase ofa nation’s civilisation and culture; the nation will then be linked up—throughthe point at the centre—with the source of divine inspiration, which is one forall types, all nations and all races in time and space.I have used the exoteric symbol of the flag to convey to you a hint as to theesoteric meaning of this very simple but most potent form. Four words, or ratherphrases, are found written, deep in the metal, around each side of the square:[Image00015.jpg][274] These words convey the highly inadequate and even unsuitable translationof certain phrases in the ancient Sensa which are intended to convey theessential union, the related synthesis and the cooperative understanding whichwill some day distinguish a humanity, composed of many aspects which arenevertheless expressions of the One Life. They are, however, related to orexpressions of monadic groupings or universal recognitions, and not of soulconsciousness. My difficulty in explaining the higher meaning of the externalsimplicity of these phrases is great; you can only arrive at them yourself asyou ponder the only three interpretations possible to you at this time: theindividual application of the symbol, its national application, and its humanapplication, remembering always that the clue to comprehension lies in therecognition of a “higher Way,” of the existence of the “higher evolution,” ofthe light which is distinctive of Shamballa, and of the use of the antahkarana,as it by-passes (if I may use such a term) the soul and so carries the human,yet spiritualised consciousness into the realms of hierarchical experience inrelation to Shamballa.POINTS OF REVELATIONThis almost brings us automatically to the third aspect of preparation forinitiation which I called in an earlier instruction the “presentation of pointsof revelation.” These formulas, when rightly studied and eventually somewhatapprehended, at least intellectually, carry the disciple to the point where thatwhich is new, hitherto unrealised and for which no words exist, is suddenlycontacted. St. Paul had reached such a point when he referred to “the thirdheaven as it veiled the seventh” (which was the original wording, deleted by therecipients of his message at that time as utterly meaningless). Eye has not seennor has ear heard the inexpressible revelation which comes to the initiate whocan penetrate into certain high places where the nature of the divine Willsuddenly assumes a different and amazing significance, where the purposes beingworked out in the Council Chamber of Shamballa are visioned—not in detail but as[275] a suddenly contacted inspiration; then for the first time the initiatebecomes consciously receptive to the energy pouring into the Hierarchy from theGreat White Lodge on Sirius.It is at this point of revelation and in relation to this symbol that theinitiate eventually stands. Then the “many lines of force within the squarebecome the seven paths of light which claim His choice, leading Him on to thesevenfold Path of initiate evolution.” This is the Way of the Higher Evolutionof which man knows nothing. The words refer to the seven paths which the Masterhas to consider and from which He has to choose His future Way. Then the symboltakes on the following form:[Image00016.jpg]“All paths meet at the centre. The many become the seven and the eight. Frompoint to point the lines converge. They stretch from point to point. The outersquare, the circle of the One and the point of unity are seen as one, and theMaster passes on His way.”He has penetrated to the centre by passing along the antahkarana which He hasHimself constructed. There He polarises Himself and takes His stand, and fromthence—at the centre of the circle and within the square of service—Heprecipitates the energies and forces which that service demands. From these fewhints you can grasp the nature of this symbol and the quality of its meaning,plus the potency of the force which (through its correct apprehension) can carrythe initiate-disciple from “the unreal to the Real.”The first formula was basically concerned with the monadic significance of thewords “from darkness to Light,” leading to vision and illumined purpose; thesecond formula gives the higher significance to the words “from the unreal tothe Real,” whilst the third we shall find expresses the true [276] meaning ofthe words “from death to Immortality.” Thus this prayer of the ancient pastbecomes the present effort of the distant future. Can you understand thisstatement, brother of mine? Into that light, that reality and that life theinitiate penetrates. In that light of reality and life, he polarises himself,and from that point of universal life, reality and light he works.PART IVAs you together study this subject of initiation, I would ask you to keep anopen mind. I have told you that changes are imminent in the training of theinitiates of the future, and that the techniques of developing a disciple’sconsciousness will be different to those used in the past. They will not be thesame as those hitherto employed in the East. These have motivated the teachingalong this line which has gone out in the West. This does not mean that theearlier methods were not correct and right. It means that the intelligent graspof the disciple and the initiate is now so advanced (relatively speaking) thatthe old methods would no more apply than do the simple sums in arithmetic, setin grammar school, aid the progress of the college graduate. They were necessaryin the early stages; the power or the ability to divide, subtract, multiply andadd were conferred, but it is the power and the ability which are now used, andnot the exercises.ON HINTSThe hints a Master earlier gave were concerned largely with the building orchanging of character and with the awakening of the chela. These no longerconstitute hints to the modern disciple; he knows enough by himself to work onhis own character, and he has penetrated to the fringe of the inner world by hisown effort and on his own power. Such is the rule for the majority of aspirantstoday. The hints such as I will give you are superficially easy to understandand have an apparently obvious meaning; but they [277] are concerned withservice and with human and planetary affairs, and are capable of severalinterpretations—according to the point of unfoldment and the ray type.In my last instruction I gave you three hints, and it might be useful if webriefly considered them. I will indicate to you the line along which light mightcome to you, as a group, at your particular point of development.The first hint dealt with the changes wrought by the work done in the Ashramswhich are enfolded in the one great Ashram of the Hierarchy. I said that theresults of this would be that a closer relationship would be established withSanat Kumara and His Council Chamber. This will be the result of the work doneby the disciples of the world—in or out of incarnation. I wonder how many of youpondered on the significance of the statement that the changes were broughtabout by the activity of the disciples; by this I mean not the senior initiates,but what you mean when you speak of a disciple. You might naturally have assumedthat the needed changes would be instituted by the Masters, or by the Christ, oreven by Sanat Kumara. But it is not so. Why is this? What idea lies behind myflat statement? The disciples of the world are the intermediaries between theHierarchy and Humanity. They are the product of immediate human endeavour; theyset the pace for human unfoldment; they are therefore closely en rapport withthe consciousness of the race of men. It is the quality of the new disciples,the rapidity with which men find their way into the ranks of the disciples, andthe demand which the working disciples in the world make on behalf of humanity(which they know ) that brings about the needed changes. The Masters are trainedin the art of recognition, which is the consummation of the practice ofobservation; They stand ever ready to make the needed changes in the techniquesor curriculum whenever human nature outgrows the old presentations of theever-needed truths. The need is indicated to Them by Their disciples, and Theythen initiate the required changes. When these occur at a time of crisis and arefar-reaching in effect and are determining of conditions for several thousandyears to come, then the entire Hierarchy meets in conclave. Upon [278] the basisof the light in this hint, you can for yourselves infer much.The second hint I gave indicated that mankind had evolved so well that today thegoals and theories, the aims and determinations now expressed in human thinkingand writing showed that the will aspect of divinity, in its first embryonicmanifestation, was beginning to make its presence felt. Have you followed thishint? Have you realised that the uprisings of the masses and their determinationto overcome handicaps and all hindrances to a better world state are indicativeof this? Do you grasp the fact that the revolutions of the past two hundredyears are signs of the striving of the spirit aspect? That spirit is life andwill; the world today is showing signs of new life. Think this out in its modernand immediate implications and see the way that the world is going under theinspiration of the spiritual Will.The third hint I gave you was intended to suggest that it was the duty and theresponsibility of the disciple, working under the inspiration of the Ashram, to“modify, qualify and adapt” the proposed plan of Shamballa (for which theAshrams are responsible) in connection with the coming civilisation and culture.There is an “art of spiritual compromise” which must be learnt and which it isdifficult to master, because it negates fanaticism, requires a trained andintelligent understanding of applied measures and truth, and also negatesevasion of responsibility; it involves also a comprehension of the timeequation, of differing points in evolution, plus experience in the process ofdiscarding the outgrown and unnecessary—no matter how good it may appear to be.In these three hints lie much scope for individual education and expansion ofconsciousness, and it is in the right use of these hints that the disciplelearns to serve with adequacy and precision and to render satisfactory serviceto the Hierarchy. I shall ever indicate to you when I give you a hint, and uponthese hints I would ask you to concentrate. I shall not always elaborate as Ihave done today, for you must grow by solving your own problems.One of the difficulties which is associated with inaugurating [279] a new andmore advanced attitude towards initiation is the offsetting of the idea that theinitiate always knows all there is to know. You need to remember that knowledgeis associated with the factual world; it concerns the accumulated information ofthe ages; it is closely connected with memory and its subjectivecounterpart—recovery of past knowledge. This means regaining again, consciously,all that the Ego has stored up as the result of many incarnations and manydifferent experiences; it is related to the “knowledge petals” in the egoiclotus and to the concrete lower mind. Knowledge is that which brings about aneffective working relation between this outer tier of petals, the concrete mindand the brain. It embodies the “intelligence equipment” of a soul in incarnationduring any one life, dealing largely with the ephemeral, the transitory and thepassing. The factor which is enduring in knowledge is simply its power to relatethe past and the present, and thus produce effective, phenomenal living today.Wisdom is the hallmark of the initiate, and this he possesses even if hispractical knowledge of mundane details—historical, geographical, economic, andcultural—may leave much to be desired. The disciples within a Master’s Ashramcan provide Him with what knowledge He may require, for they are drawn fromdifferent cultures and civilisations and among them can summarise the sum totalof human knowledge at any one given time. This must not be forgotten. A Masterof the Wisdom always knows where to go for knowledge. Knowledge and intelligenceor mental polarisation must not be confounded in your minds. I might add to theabove that knowledge deals with the ascertained and the effectual on thephysical plane and in the three worlds; wisdom deals with inherent capacitiesand possibilities of spiritual expression. Knowledge can be expressed inconcepts and precepts; wisdom is revealed through ideas against which (veryfrequently) much mundane knowledge powerfully militates. The concrete mind ofteninhibits, as you well know, the free flow of ideas intuitively impulsed; it iswith this free flow of the new ideas that the initiate is basically concerned,because it is ideas, their right application and interpretation, [280] whichdetermine the future of humanity and of the planetary life.The first thing, therefore, that the disciple in preparation for initiation hasto learn is the nature of ideas and their distinction from contactedthoughtforms—to express it simply, and therefore, from the complexity of thesubject, inadequately. The primary task of the Master is to aid the disciple todevelop the intuition, and at the same time, keep the mental perception in anactive and wholesome state. This is done, first of all, by enabling him toarrive at a right relation and correct evaluation between the abstract and theconcrete realms of thought—those higher and lower aspects of the mind which areto the soul what the lower mind and the brain are to the personality. Think thisout. A true recognition of this distinction produces a new focussing of the lifeforce within the soul which will, in the earlier stages of discipleship, workthrough the abstract mind and the concrete mind. But the abstractions with whichthe disciple in training is then dealing are not in the nature of intuitions,and here is a point where confusion oft arises. They are merely the broad,general and universal perceptions and world inclusions which the graduallydeveloping intelligence of mankind has registered and recognised and which theforemost thinkers of the race grasp with facility, but which seem so amazing tothe neophyte. They appear to him of such magnitude and importance (as objects ofhis enhanced vision) that he confounds them with ideas and their intuitiveperception. He has not learned to discriminate between abstract thoughts andintuitive ideas. Here lies the crux of his problem.Ideas are other than this, as far as the initiate is concerned; they dealprimarily with that which will eventually be, and are those formative newspiritual and creative impulses which will supersede the old and build the “newhouse” in which humanity will live; cycle after cycle and civilisation aftercivilisation, the fresh stream of inflowing ideas have conditioned the dwellingplaces of man and his mode of life and expression; through the medium of theseever-living and ever-appearing ideas, humanity passes on to [281] somethingbetter and greater and more appropriate to the life of the slowly manifestingdivinity.Ideas, when intuitively contacted by the disciple or initiate, via theantahkarana, must be brought consciously down to abstract levels of thinkingwhere (expressing it symbolically) they form the blueprints, prior to theinstitution of the creative process which will give them phenomenal existenceand being. I would have you, therefore, remember the three factors:1. The Intuition . . . which contacts and reveals new ideas.2. The Abstract World . . . in which they are given form and substance and whichis to the thoughtform eventually created what the etheric body is to the densephysical vehicle.3. Concrete Thought . . . producing the concretising of the thoughtform and thusmaking the idea available to mankind.Here, in this simple summation, is expressed for you the process which thedisciple will be able to follow when he is initiate; as each initiation istaken, the scope of the idea steadily increases, and its potency also, so thatit might be said that the initiate—as he progresses upon the Path ofInitiation—works first with the idea, then with ideas, then with thehierarchical Plan in a wide and general sense, and finally reaches the pointwhere he comes under the influence of the purpose of Sanat Kumara. Then the willof the Lord of the World will stand revealed to him.The work of the initiate is carried forward within the ring-pass-not of theUniversal Mind; this is only a phrase expressive of the range of thought,planning and purpose which is that of a planetary or solar Logos. The quality ofthe approach which the initiate brings to the work is drawn, as pure energy,from the heart centre of the planetary Logos; it is pure love with itsinevitable corollaries, wisdom and [282] understanding. These give him insightinto the plan. The power which he can bring to the task is drawn from hiscomprehension of the purpose of the planetary Logos and this expansive andall-inclusive work is entered into in graded sequences and carried forward underthe influence of the initiate’s expanding awareness and his growing sensitivityto impression.I am seeking here to divorce your minds from the idée fixe that the initiateworks because he knows. I would reverse the statement and say he knows becausehe works. There is no point of attainment at which the Initiator says to theinitiate: Now you know, and therefore you can work. Rather it is: Now you serveand work, and in so doing you are embarked upon a new and difficult voyage ofdiscovery; you will discover reality progressively and arrive at whole areas ofexpression, because you serve. Resulting from this service, certain powers andenergies will manifest, and your ability to use them will indicate to you, toyour fellow initiates and to the world that you are a worker, fully consciousupon the inner side of life.The initiate works from his place upon that inner side. During the early stagesof the initiatory process he works in the world of meaning . After the thirdinitiation he works consciously in the world of causes , until such time as heis advanced enough to work in the world of being . The aspirant is endeavouringto grasp the purpose of the world of meaning and to apply the knowledge gainedto his daily life with understanding. The disciple is endeavouring to comprehendthe significance of the world of causes and to relate cause and effect in apractical manner. The initiate of higher degree utilises the potencies of thesethree worlds of meaning, cause and being to implement the purpose of SanatKumara.These differences are not hard and fast, with clear lines of demarcation; lifeis fluid and moving and the points of attainment are myriad in number andprogressing forward all the time, but the general picture will serve to carryyour thoughts away from the “trappings of initiation,” from the colouring andthe unimportant, so-called facts (actual and [283] imagined) which have been somuch emphasised by the occult groups and leaders and which have been held out asinducements to would-be disciples. I would have this group which I am trainingforget the details about initiation as presented so oft by the mystery mongerand the emotional person, and concentrate upon the far more factual realities ofmeaning, cause and being. The old and outworn presentations were the product ofthe concrete mind, and are therefore crystallising in their effects anddistorting in their results; they are also evocative of spiritual selfishnessand isolation, as well as of astral curiosity. The new approach which I seek toindicate makes its appeal to the abstract mind and to the soul, whose values aresound, and eventually to the intuition; it is not so colourful an appeal as faras the personality is concerned, but it will produce more creative results andlead the neophyte along a safer road, with fewer disappointments and failures.THE FORMULASThe idea of meaning, cause and being underlies the symbology or the significanceof the formula with which we are concerned in this instruction. I have pointedout to you before the difficulty of putting these ancient symbols or symbolicwritings into such form that they can convey meaning through language. Thisdifficulty is well-nigh insurmountable in connection with this third formula.The reason for this is that this formula has been preserved as sounds or (if Imay use so ambiguous a phrase) as trumpeted words . It has not been committed toinscription as have the two previous symbolic formulas which you have alreadyreceived. All that I can do is to give you a meaning (as far as I myself canunderstand and you can grasp) of these great sounds or chords, massed togetherand interspersed with certain very ancient phrases. You know yourselves howdifficult it is to express the significance of the sound OM. This is a stillmore difficult task; little human thinking has been applied as yet to thisFormula but much has been given to the Sacred Word. Until some thought has beenapplied to what I shall now attempt [284] to give you, it is no easy matter tofind the words to express the underlying idea—the idea you can contact at yourpresent point of development.This third formula concerns Time and the consciousness of the spiritual man whois unaware of separation, of divisions in time and space or of the spell of theGreat Illusion. It deals with the fact of immortality and with the unshatterablecontinuity of consciousness and life. It is this formula which—at the thirdinitiation—produces the transfiguration which comes when the Eternal Now isrealised and when the continuity of awareness and of identity is seen as anaspect of Being. This formula has been called by one of the Masters “the seed ofall philosophies,” and in that phrase you may find light on the subject—providedyou know what philosophy is!To the initiate who uses this formula, creating the necessary sounds andenunciating the ancient words in due place (and these I may not give you), thefollowing six thoughts are emphasised in his consciousness; these six thoughtswill give you the intent of the formula as clearly as is possible. It is notpossible to convey to you the true beauty of the concepts, but if you will havein mind the thought of meaning as light on life, of cause as the breath ofexperience, and of Being as the initiator of all that is, then some vision maycome, some dream arise in your consciousness, and some power of accomplishmentpour in. The Masters use this formula when faced with death in some form oranother (and these words must be used literally). I refer not to death as it mayaffect Them, but to death as it affects God’s created universe, producingrelease or finality, or opening the door to new life and closing the door on acycle of manifestation, a civilisation, or a race or nation.Here, therefore, are the six conditioning thoughts which the initiate holds inhis consciousness when using the formula —a formula which is older than theStanzas of Dzyan:1. God IS . The Lord for aye stands firm. Being exists alone. Naught else is.2. Time IS . Being descends to manifest. Creation is. [285] Time then and formagree. Being and time do not agree.3. Unity IS . The One between comes forth and knows both time and God. But timedestroys that middle One and only Being IS .4. Space IS . Time and space reverberate and veil the One who stands behind.Pure Being IS —unknown and unafraid, untouched, for aye unchanged.5. God IS . Time, space, the middle One (with form and process) go, and yet foraye remain. Pure reason then suffices.6. Being cries forth and says: . . . (untranslatable). Death crumbles all.Existence disappears, yet all for aye remains—untouched, immutably the same. GodIS .Each phrase out of the six has its own symbol at the close of each unit ofthought, if I may call it that. These I may not give you or the chords uponwhich the phrases go forth. I have tried to indicate one of the meanings of theformula, but have not given a translation or a paraphrase. Bear this in mind andas you ponder these six sentences, try to give them an interpretation which willcome to you from the world of meaning , producing a practical application, fromthe world of causes , producing an enlightened understanding, and (if you arefar enough along) from the world of being , producing inclusiveness. Theseformulas have naught to do with personalities or with souls in deep incarnation,identified with form in the three worlds; they concern world movement, great anduniversal developments, and human progress (as a whole) towards the divine. Youcannot yet think in those terms, but you can at least attempt to do so and growthereby.POINTS OF REVELATIONIn the earlier part of your last instruction, I pointed out two most necessaryrequirements which the disciple in training for initiation must grasp. As theyare closely connected with this third point (referring to the revelations whichthe [286] initiate can expect), I would like to touch upon them here. The firststatement I made was to the effect that the will is fundamentally an expressionof the Law of Sacrifice; the second was an attempt to emphasise the necessityfor grasping and accepting two initial premises:First, that energy follows thought.Second, that the eye, opened by thought, directs that energy.Why, I would ask you, is the will an aspect or an expression of the Law ofSacrifice? Because the will, as considered and understood by the initiate, isessentially that monadic essence, qualified by “fixed determination,” which isidentified with the Will or Purpose of the planetary Logos. It is the highestdivine aspect which the initiate finally manifests, prior to entering upon theWay of the Higher Evolution. In this connection it is useful to remember thatone of the appellations of Sanat Kumara is that of “the Great Sacrifice,” andalso to attempt to recognise some of the factors which have earned Him thatname. These might be stated to be as follows, among others which you could notgrasp if there was the language available to express them:a. The basic sacrifice which the planetary Logos made was when He decided toincarnate or enter into the form of this planet. This was from pure choice,motivated by His “fixed determination” to function as the Saviour of the planet,in the same sense as the world Saviours come forth for the salvaging ofhumanity. Sanat Kumara is the prototype of all world saviours.The initiate, on his tiny scale, must learn to function also as a saviour, andthus express the Law of Sacrifice through the medium of the developed, pure,reasoning will, and not simply from that of impulsive love and its activity.Here lies a basic distinction. Sacrifice must not be regarded as a “giving-up,”but rather as a “taking-over.” It has a mysterious relation to the Law of Karma,but on [287] such high levels that only the advanced initiate can grasp it.b. This sacrifice was imperative in the fullest sense, owing to the ability ofthe planetary Logos to identify Himself in full consciousness with the soul inall forms of life, latent within the planetary substance. When He “took over”this task, He, esoterically, had no choice, because the decision was inherent inHis own nature. Because of this identification, He could not refuse theinvocative appeal of the “seeds of life, striving within the substance of theform, and seeking added life and light,” as the Old Commentary puts it. Thisstriving and reaching forth evoked His response and the going out of Hisdivinity, as expressed in will, activated by “fixed determination” to meet thedeeply hidden divinity within these seeds. What He initiated then still persistsand—under the Law of Sacrifice—He will complete the task, no matter how manyaeons it may take.The initiate, on his tiny scale, has to learn to work as a nourisher and saviourof the seeds of life within all forms with which he may achieve a measure ofidentification. His will must go out in response to the invocative demand ofhumanity, and his “fixed determination” must motivate his ensuing activity.c. Under this Law of Sacrifice, Sanat Kumara (to express the idea in occultterms) “must turn His back upon the Central Spiritual Sun, and with the light ofHis Countenance irradiate the path of the prisoners of the planet.” He sentencesHimself to stay for as long as may be needed, “acting as the Sun and light ofthe planet until the Day be with us and the night of pralaya descends upon Hisfinished task.” Thus and only thus can the light of the Central Spiritual Sunbegin to penetrate the dark places of the Earth; when this happens all “shadowsdisappear”—an occult reference to the all-embracing radiance of the Monad as itabsorbs both its reflection, the soul, and its shadow, the personality.The initiate, on his tiny scale, achieves a paralleling [288] expression of theLaw of Sacrifice; he eventually turns his back upon the courts of Shamballa andupon the Way of the Higher Evolution as he retains his contact with the Earthand works as a Member of the Hierarchy for the extension of the will-to-goodamong men, and therefore among all the lesser evolutions.d. Under the Law of Sacrifice, the Lord of the World remains ever behind thescenes, unknown and unrealised by all the “seeds” He came to save, until suchtime as they have reached the stage of flowering forth as perfect men and, intheir turn, become the saviours of humanity. Then they know Him to exist. Fromthe standpoint of the forms of life in the four kingdoms of nature, Sanat Kumarais non-existent. In developed humanity, prior to moving on to the ProbationaryPath, He is sensed and dimly sought under the vague word “God.” Later, as thelife which the “seeds” have manifested reaches the higher layers or brackets inthe human hierarchy, there emerges in the consciousness of the disciple, theassurance that behind the phenomenal world is a world of “saving Lives” of whichhe may eventually form a part; he begins to sense that behind these Lives therestand great Beings of power, wisdom and love Who, in Their turn, are under thesupremacy of Sanat Kumara, the Eternal Youth, the Creator, the Lord of theWorld.The initiate, on his tiny scale, likewise has to learn to work behind thescenes, unknown and unrecognised and unacclaimed; he must sacrifice his identityin the identity of the Ashram and its workers, and later in the identity of hisworking disciples out in the world of daily life. He institutes the neededactivities and brings about the required changes, but he receives no reward,save the reward of souls salvaged, lives rebuilt and humanity led onward uponthe Path of Return.These few thoughts upon the significance of sacrifice or upon the “taking over,”through identification, of the task of salvage, of revitalising and ofpresenting opportunity, are important to all disciples, as a goal and a vision.[289] The second point made, based upon the occult platitude that “energyfollows thought,” should carry inspiring implications to the earnest disciple,if he truly considers the statements made and regards them of practicalapplication.Two things, I told you, are the result of thought, and though these may bementally grasped by the intelligent disciple, they are very seldom understood.They are:1. Thought generates energy commensurate with the potency of the thinking, andqualified by the theme of the thinking. You will see from this, therefore, someof the implications contained in the meditation I have assigned you. “As a manthinketh in his heart, so is he” is a statement of the Christ. From thatdemonstrating personal centre of thought, energy will stream down into thephysical brain, via the etheric body. It will then condition the type of living,the expression and the influence of the man upon the physical plane.2. As a result of focussed thinking “in the heart” the spiritual eye opens andbecomes the directing agent, employed consciously by the initiate whilst doinghis work under the Law of Sacrifice. What is meant here by the words, “in theheart”? The soul is the heart of the system of the spiritual man; it is the seatof the life and consciousness which animate the personality, and it is themotivating potency in every incarnation, according to the experienceconditioning the expression of the spiritual man in any particular rebirth. Inthe early stages of experience, this “eye” remains closed; there is present nocapacity for thought and no ability to think in the heart: i.e., from soullevels. As the intellect develops and the power to focus upon the mental planegrows, the fact of the soul’s existence becomes known and the goal of attentionchanges. There follows the ability to focus in the soul consciousness and so tofuse the soul and the mind that an at-one-ment takes place and a man can thenbegin to think “in his heart.” Then also the “eye of the soul” opens and energyfrom soul levels, intelligently utilised, becomes directed from those levels andpours into what is now [290] ambiguously called “the third eye.” Immediately thepersonality in the three worlds begins to express itself as the soul upon thephysical plane, and will, purpose and love begin to control.These two paragraphs are of importance to the disciple and warrant carefulattention. As these developments take place, the spiritual will steadily growsinto the directing agent, using the right eye as the distributing agent for theenergy of love, animated with will. This is why the right eye has been called,in the esoteric teaching, “the eye of buddhi.” This directing agent uses theleft eye as the instrument for the distribution of the mental energy of thepersonality—now illumined and sublimated.Having these thoughts in mind, I would call your attention to the entire themeof vision, which necessarily underlies our consideration of the points ofrevelation. It is simple to recognise that in the head of the developingaspirant there is a mechanism of great potency, capable of controlling the lifeof the personality. There is:1. The third eye, not the pineal gland but its etheric correspondence. This isthe responsive mechanism to the directing eye of the soul.2. The right eye and the left eye, which take the incoming energy, symbolicallyspeaking , and divide it into two streams which are the correspondence inetheric matter of buddhi-manas.a. Right eye . . . spiritual energy. Buddhi. Pure reason. Understanding.b. Left eye . . . mental energy. Manas. Thought substance.It is the conscious use of these energies and the intelligent utilisation ofthis triple mechanism which is the goal of the initiate up to the thirdinitiation. He learns consciously to direct force in the correct manner throughthe needed organ, doing so as the soul working in full consciousness on its ownlevel, but so fully identified with the personality that the [291] mechanism(now developed within the personality) can be used in the work of the Hierarchy.Let me now expand the concept further, reminding you of the phrase so oftemployed, “the All-seeing Eye.” This refers to the power of the planetary Logosto see into all parts, aspects and phases (in time and space) of His planetaryvehicle, which is His physical body and to identify Himself with all thereactions and sensitivities of His created world and to participate with fullknowledge in all events and happenings. Through what medium does He, on His ownhigh levels, do this? Through what mechanism does He thus “see”? What is Hisorgan of vision? What is the nature of the sight whereby He contacts the sevenplanes of His manifested universe? What is the organ, employed by Him, whichcorresponds to the third eye in man? The answer is as follows: the Monad is tothe planetary Logos what the third eye is to man; this will become clearer toyou if you will bear in mind that our seven planes are only the seven subplanesof the cosmic physical plane. The monadic world—so-called—is His organ ofvision; it is also His directing agent for the life and light which must bepoured into the phenomenal world. In the same way, the Monad is to thepersonality in the three worlds, also the source of its life and light.There are, therefore, three organs of revelation, as far as the spiritual man isconcerned:1. The human eye, giving “in-sight” into the phenomenal world, letting in thelight, and bringing revelation of the environment.2. The eye of the soul, bringing revelation of the nature of the interiorworlds, of the kingdom of God and of the divine plan.3. The centre within the One Life which we call by the unmeaning word “Monad,”the spark within the one Flame. In the final stages of initiation, the Monadbecomes the revealer of the purpose of God, of the will of the planetary Logosand of the door which opens on to the Way of the Higher Evolution. This Wayleads a man off the cosmic physical plane on to the cosmic [292] astral plane,and therefore into the world of divine sentiency, of which we can have nopossible understanding, but for which the development of consciousness has givenus the initial steps.Man has learnt to use the physical eye and to find his way, by its means, aroundand through his environment. The stage in human evolution wherein he learntfirst to “see” lies far behind, but when man saw and could focus and direct hiscourse by sight , it marked a stupendous unfoldment and his first real entranceupon the Path of Light. Ponder on this. It has also interior repercussions andwas indeed the result of an invocative interplay between inner centres of powerand the groping creature in the phenomenal world.Man is now learning to use the eye of the soul, and as he does so he brings itscorrespondence in the head also into functioning activity; this produces fusionand identification, and brings the pineal gland into action. The major result,however, is to enable the disciple to become aware, whilst in the physical body,of a new range of contacts and perceptions. This marks a crisis in hisunfoldment of as drastic and important a nature as the attaining of physicalsight and the use of the physical eye was in the unfoldment of the curiouscreature which antedated the most primitive animal man. Things unknown can nowbe sensed, searched for and finally seen; a new world of being stands apparent,which has always been present though never before known; the life, nature,quality and the phenomena of the kingdom of souls, or of the Hierarchy, becomeas patent to his vision and as real as is the world of the five physical senses.Then later, upon the Path of Initiation, the initiate develops his tinycorrespondence to the planetary “All-seeing Eye.” He unfolds the powers of theMonad. These are related to divine purpose and to the world in which SanatKumara moves and which we call Shamballa. I have impressed upon you elsewherethat the state of being of the Monad has naught to do with what we callconsciousness; in the same way, there is naught in the world of Shamballa whichis of the same nature as the phenomenal world of man in the [293] three worlds,or even of the soul world. It is a world of pure energy, of light and ofdirected force; it can be seen as streams and centres of force, all forming apattern of consummate beauty, all potently invocative of the world of the souland of the world of phenomena; it therefore constitutes in a very real sense theworld of causes and of initiation.As man the human being, man the disciple, and man the initiate gradually moveonward on the stream of life, revelation comes step by step, moving from onegreat point of focus to another until naught more remains to be revealed.In all these spiritual points of crisis or of opportunity for vision, for freshspiritual in-sight and for revelation (for that is what they are in reality),the thought of struggle is the first one to warrant attention. I used, in thisconnection, the words “stage of penetration”; the thought which this conveys tothe initiate understanding signifies an extension of the struggle which theneophyte makes in order to achieve inner control, and then to use the mind as asearchlight so as to penetrate into new fields of awareness and of recognition.Forget not that recognition involves right interpretation and right relation tothat which is seen and contacted. Into all revelation enters the concept of“whole vision” or a synthesis of perception, and then comes recognition of thatwhich is visioned and perceived. It is the mind (the common sense, as it used tobe called) which utilises the physical senses of perception, and through theirunited contribution gets a “whole vision” and a synthesis of perception of thephenomenal world, according to man’s point of development, his mental capacityto recognise, rightly interpret and rightly relate that which has been conveyedto him by the activity of the five senses. This is what is meant when we use thephrase “the mind’s eye,” and this ability is the common possession of humanityin varying degrees of availability.Later, man uses the “eye of the soul,” as we have noted above; it reveals to hima world of subtler phenomena, the kingdom of God or the world of souls. Then thelight of the intuition pours in, bringing the power to recognise and rightlyinterpret and relate.As the disciple and the initiate progress from stage to [294] stage ofrevelation, it becomes increasingly difficult to make clear not only what isrevealed, but also the processes of revelation, and the methods used to bringthe stage of revelation about. The vast mass of mankind throughout the worldhave no clear idea as to the function of the mind as an organ of visionillumined by the soul; still fewer, only the disciples and initiates, are ableto glimpse the purpose of the spiritual eye and its functioning in the light ofthe intuition. When we come, therefore, to the great organ of universalrevelation, the monadic principle, functioning through the medium of anextra-planetary light, we enter realms which are indefinable and for which noterminology has been created, and which only initiates above the third degreeare able to consider.With the sequential stages of polarisation and precipitation I will not todaydeal; I am desirous that you grasp as far as may be, the idea of penetration, ofthe struggle involved and the instrument available in the struggle to see, toperceive and to register impression.What I have given you at this time will provide much ground for thought. Furtherinstruction along this line would be unprofitable until such time as the innermechanism of progressive revelation is more clearly defined in yourconsciousness and is at least theoretically understood and hypotheticallyaccepted. If you will think with clarity and with spiritual brooding upon thissubject during the coming year, it may be possible for me greatly to enlargeupon the matter in my next instruction.PART VI would like in this instruction, my brothers, to make certain suggestions toyou anent the approach to discipleship that humanity is making and the approachto initiation which disciples in every country and of all schools of thought andof religious persuasion are today making. I have told you in many places thatthe techniques for training disciples are changing in order to conform to therapid progress being made in mass orientation, and that a new light upon theentire [295] theme of initiation is imminent. I would like, if possible, to besomewhat more explicit. You, at least, after these years of training by me,should be susceptible to some increased realisation along these lines.Humanity—as has oft been said—is now the world disciple. Why is this? Primarilyfor two reasons:1. Men are rapidly awakening mentally. The whole world is thinking, primarilyalong political lines and along lines of current ideologies. Even peoples longdormant are now convulsed by mental processes. This shift in human consciousnessinvolves a rapid focussing of human intention on mental levels. This mentalpolarisation is essential to discipleship. It is as yet a general trend, butmuch progress has been made as a result of the tension of war.2. Men are rapidly developing an understanding goodwill. The world is full ofmovements for relief and for the amelioration of human distress, and this fromthe point of small and large communities and also nationally andinternationally. To this the Red Cross, UNRRA and many analogous andwell-intentioned affiliations of men everywhere bear witness. This indicates notonly a mental polarisation but responsiveness to the love nature of God; thesetogether indicate a fusion and a sensitivity which is new in human history andwhich is most encouraging, testifying as it does to the success, at last, of theevolutionary process.The time, therefore, when the Hierarchy had to deal almost entirely with theemotional devotee is past, and this has come about far more rapidly than hadbeen anticipated. The task of the Masters before the eighteenth century was totake emotional aspirants and train them in the technique of mental polarisation,prior to permitting them to enter Their Ashrams. This was the best that could beexpected, and in the last analysis was all that was required, because mentallypolarised aspirants to accepted discipleship would have been of little use inthe work of lifting mankind nearer to the light; the Ashrams exist primarily forthat purpose. But the [296] mentally focussed humanity of today cannot bereached by emotional workers alone. The mental approach is called for and ahigher type of disciple is needed.The training to be given to aspirants (and this must be begun in our educationalcentres) will concern the dual use of the mind, the nature of energy, theindication of an evolutionary plan which includes more than the physical forms,and later of a definite and clear purpose for humanity as well as modes andmethods of developing the subjective and subtle powers of the human being. Thiswill involve a study of the constitution of man and the relation of its lowerand higher threefold nature to the three aspects of divinity. You will note howincreasingly, with all of you, I am emphasising man’s essential duality and nothis temporary triplicity. I would have you try to ascertain and understand myreasons. As this curriculum is firmly established it will revolutionise moderneducational systems upon a planetary scale, and then man the reorientingaspirant, will become man the accepted disciple.I wonder whether you have ever considered the widespread effect of all thereflective thinking, the aspirational prayers and the meditation work—untrainedor as the result of training—done by people in their millions down the agesthrough the entire planet? Its quality is altering; its strength is increasing;its livingness is producing changes in the human organism. The tide of spirituallife is today so strong and striving that the next one hundred and fifty yearswill demonstrate the factual nature of the Kingdom of Souls or of God. This, asyou can surely appreciate, will produce fundamental changes also in theimmediate objectives before human progress, and in the Masters’ plans, in theteaching given, and in the training presented.This brings me to the objectives which are now before disciples in training forinitiation. Instead of the past objectives—contact with the soul and entranceinto an Ashram—the following might be listed, but must be understoodesoterically and not literally:1. A sense of planetary relationships. Instead of the emphasis [297] being laidupon the relation of the individual to his soul, to his Master and to theAshram, his consciousness is consciously expanded (if I may use such anapparently redundant phrase) in order to bring about a realisation upwards intokingdoms hitherto unseen and unknown, downwards into kingdoms which we callsubhuman, outwards into the human environment and into the human kingdom, andinwards (a meaningless word, my brother) toward divinity itself. This meanstowards synthesis, towards wholeness, towards the sense of the entire, towardstotality. For all these four directions (of which north, south, east and westare symbols) there are specific techniques, but today I may only indicatedirection.2. A sense of “intelligent supervision” . This must be esoterically understood.What does this mean? One of the most deeply spiritual qualities which would-beinitiates must unfold is the constant recognition of a focussed control upondaily life, circumstance, the future and fate. This is as yet an embryonic senseor entirely new avenue of perception and relatively close to and an aspect ofthe will aspect of divinity. It makes man conscious of his destiny, develops inhim predictive power and gives him initiate insight into purpose and itsunfolding plan. It is a faculty which you would do well to consider and try toimagine as a step towards development.3. The sense of orientation to humanity. I presume you will recognise the truthof what I say when I express the opinion that your individual or personal loveof humanity and the focus of your attention upon human need is very largelytheoretical. It is transitory and experimental in practice. Your intentions aregood and fine but you have not yet the habit of correct orientation and muchthat you do is the result of imposed sacrifice and at a cost; it is not naturalto you; it is still the result of hopeful endeavour; you are still bewilderedover the problem of how to be oriented to the Hierarchy and your soul, and atthe same time to be oriented to humanity and your fellowmen. But the time willcome when you are personally so decentralised that automatically the sense of“others” is [298] far stronger in you than the sense of personality or of thelower self. Let your imagination run wild for a moment, picturing the conditionof the world when the majority of human beings are occupied with the good ofothers and not with their own selfish goals. Such a play of imaginative thoughtis good and constructive and will aid in bringing out into manifestation thatnew world and that new type of humanity which the future will inevitablydemonstrate. On this I shall not enlarge; the practice of goodwill will lay thefoundation for this new type of sensitivity.4. The sense of registered impression . With this new feeling out towards theunknown and towards that which requires a sensitive expansion of consciousness Ishall not deal at this moment. It concerns the theme of training in telepathy; Ishall deal with it as we consider that Science of Impression (Telepathy and theEtheric Vehicle, Pages 41-57) which will eventually be the major objective ofthe educational systems which will be functioning at the close of the New Age,so rapidly approaching. Only now have those forces been permitted entrance intoour planetary life which will present the new subjective environment which hasever been there though unrealised. The reason for this new sensitivity being theobjective of hierarchical cultural training is that it is realised by theHierarchy that man is now adequately intelligent to be trained in rightinterpretation.5. The evocation of the will. This is, for disciples particularly, the new andmost necessary development. As I oft have told you, the average aspirantconfounds will with determination, with fixed intention, with self-will andone-pointed attention. He does not realise that the will is that divine aspectin man that puts him en rapport with and then controlled by divine purpose,intelligently understood in time and space and implemented by the soul as theexpression of loving application. The mode par excellence by which the will canbe developed is the cultivation of the recognition of the divine Plan down theages. This produces a sense of synthesis and this sense of [299] synthesis tiesthe man into the plan through recognition of:a. Its inevitability, therefore demanding cooperation.b. Its success, therefore evoking wise activity.c. Its immediate objective—to which all the past has led.d. Its rightness—to which the intuition testifies.It is not easy for the disciple in training to associate the sense of synthesisand the use of the will together and to realise that a cultivation of this firstray perception is a potent mode by which the highest aspects of the spiritualwill (as yet embryonic within him) can be unfolded. Elsewhere I deal in greaterdetail with the will, its nature and what it is.6. The sense of that which is imminent . This concerns the “raincloud ofknowable things.” I would call your attention to the word knowable. It is notthe recognition of that which is imminent in man, in nature, or latent inmanifestation. Speculation along this line might be and frequently is of no trueimportance. It is what is spiritually imminent which concerns the true disciple,if I may be permitted this play on words. One of the first lessons in theesoteric field is the sense of timing, with which that which is imminent orimpending is connected; the disciple has to awaken to that which is on the veryverge of precipitation into human thinking, life and circumstance; he has totake those occult steps which will enable him to recognise not only that whichis hovering over humanity on the point of revelation or of karmic usefulness(note the phrase), but also enable him to handle himself so correctly and wiselythat he becomes a cooperator, step by step, in the process of aiding in thistask of revelation. More light on this subject will come as we study the Scienceof Impression. The point, however, I seek to make here is that sensitivity tothe overshadowing cloud presupposed the subjective existence of a power ordivine faculty hitherto not consciously used by disciples but which can now beintelligently developed, producing more rapid vision and a more acute revelatoryperception. [300] That power has always been present; it is an aspect of theforce of evolution and has led man on from one point of revelation to another,from one power to another, one sense to another, and from point to point ofunderstanding. It first of all produced the physical senses; it led man on toemotional expression and to mental development; it is the secret behindspiritual understanding, but it has never yet been consciously employed. It isto the mind what the mind, as the common-sense, has been to all the five senses.Think that out.This raincloud is hovering, heavy with portent and knowledge, over a world todayin process of reorganisation and regeneration. The Masters are seeking to hastenin Their disciples this recognition of that which is imminent, so that they canbe the intelligent agents whereby the needed precipitations can be broughtabout. There is a definite technique for producing this peculiar form ofcooperation, but it will not be possible to work with it or apply it for anothertwenty-five years.Here I have very briefly outlined for you the new developments which arepossible if the disciple is rightly focussed and oriented. There are withinlatent possibilities. If you will pause and consider, you will realise that thetask of the Master in the past, as He sought to prepare the disciple forinitiation, was largely concerned with awakening him to the need for occultobedience, for right orientation, for persistence, and for devotion to hisobjective. But all that lies far behind the true modern disciple. Today, theMaster indicates to him the overshadowing cloud of knowable things; He assureshim that he has within him undreamt of powers which will, when brought to thesurface of consciousness, demonstrate to him his own essential adeptship andenable him to share in the great hierarchical task of illumining, precipitating,and lifting. Today the Master—having done the above—leaves the disciple to workthrough to knowledge and cooperative usefulness; He neither pushes him intopremature action nor constantly supervises him; He surrounds him with the auraof His presence and the protection and [301] stimulation of His Ashram; He giveshim occasional hints, and as the disciple acts and works upon the hintedsuggestions, the hint becomes a clear direction and a luminous area ofenlightenment.ON HINTSI have been working with all of you in this manner for more than ten years now;I have sought to bring about a definite awakening to latent possibilities and tothose capacities for cooperation which must be eventually realised by thedisciple. I am not discouraged, because apart from my realisation of theinevitable limitations which encompass each of you individually, I am also awarethat you have placed yourselves in my Ashram for training in the most difficultperiod in the entire history of humanity—a period in which the whole of humanityis passing through the reorientation required by the time cycle and through anentirely new adjustment to a higher rhythm and area of expression. This hasgreatly enhanced all your difficulties, and mine also, as I work with you.However, the next one hundred years will see great developments in my Ashram. Itis, as I have told you, one of the newest of the Ashrams and is only now findingits own format, enunciating its own note, and taking on its own quality. Thissituation has also greatly increased your problem, for you are helping me toform something new.Up to the present time, I have given you four hints which might be summarised asfollows:1. That the great changes being brought about in the Hierarchy, and in order tomake the work of the New Age adequate and to establish a closer rapport withShamballa, have been the result of the work done by the working disciples of theworld. Why the working disciples, brother of mine, and not by the Masters? Ahint ever evokes a question, and it is in the answering of these questions thatthe disciples learn and eventually become Masters. [302]2. That human planning and thinking, as the future is faced, are the firstindications in the history of mankind of the emergence of the will aspect. Canyou answer the question: Why is this indicated?3. That disciples in all Ashrams have the task of “modifying, qualifying, andadapting the divine plan.” Why has this to be so? This is a most significant anduseful question. Why, brother of mine, is the plan not imposed? What are thedistinctions between quality, modifications, and adaptations—for there is adistinction in each and every one of them.4. That the initiate knows because he works. Christ gave the same hint to Hisdisciples when He told them that if they wanted to know the doctrine they mustcarry out God’s will. Do these words convey any true meaning to you?You will note that all of these four hints or seed ideas (for much expandedthinking, leading to renewed activity) have to do with humanity and not with theindividual man. This is a point of importance to bear in mind, for it againindicates the distinction between the training being given now and that whichwas given in the past. I, for instance, am not (in these group instructions)giving you individual hints as to your own lives. This I have done in the past,as have all Ashrams today, as they make their transition between the old and thenew, emerging techniques; they have to employ compromise and adapt to that whichis coming; the future will see, therefore, a gradual cessation of personalityhints. In the future, the true method will be to develop in the disciple thesense of synthesis and of “place” in the One World, and thus decentralise him.The theme of direction underlies the system of instructing by means of hints. Itis apparently a slow technique, but there is a point which esotericists would dowell to remember. If information as to the nature of the microcosm and themacrocosm, as to divine Purpose and the spiritual Plan, as to occult events intime and space, and as to future or immediate possibilities were given out inplain terms (even if the needed language were available) there would be littleunderstanding. I could, for [303] instance, tell you much that would be asuseful to you as the following statement might have been to unevolvedprehistoric man: “There is naught in the world but energy. The Atom of atoms isonly energy and God Himself is naught but energy.” The phrases would haveconveyed to their slow-moving brains absolutely nothing. Primitive man had notthe mechanism whereby comprehension would have been possible. A key to thecorrect interpretation of a hint lies in its association with the idea ofdirection in time and space. And, my brother, in the above sentence I give youthe hint which I have in mind for your consideration this year. The word“direction” is the key to the evolutionary process, to the concept of light, tothe secret of Masonry, and to the motivating power behind manifestation. More Iwill not indicate, but I seek your intelligent assent to that word.It will become increasingly apparent to you that the entire life of a disciplebecomes one of reflective meditation. Meditation forms may at some point ofunfoldment drop away, but the habit of meditation will become a permanent andconsidered habit and will know finally no termination; when that point isreached, the idea of direction will take on divine significance. Here is asecond hint on the same theme. You will recollect that in my last Instructionthe whole subject of meditation was summarised for you as follows:1. A preliminary stage wherein the theme of meditation was recognised.2. Receptivity in attitude, so that the possible and esoteric teaching may berecognised and absorbed.3. The transmission of ideas in some form or another to the brain after theyhave been registered by the mind in the form of seed thoughts, hints orpresented themes and concepts.4. The deliberate focussing of thought upon these ideas.5. As these ideas are considered and developed, they are subjected to analysisand take shape eventually as created thoughtforms.6. They are then subjected to a process of unification through the conscious andconstant use of a mantram.[304] If this outline for thinking is carefully considered, it will be apparentto you that it is suitable for all true thought processes, all mental moods, andall analysis and application of occult hints. I wanted you to realise theessential simplicity of all divine processes and to note the ultimate fact thatsuch processes culminate in a spiritual identification, proving past allcontroversy that separateness is fundamentally non-existent. This is true alsoof the formulas which we have been considering.THE FORMULASAs I told you in my last Instruction, the meaning and even the format of theseformulas are so difficult to convey in words that I have hesitated several timesin proceeding even with so brief an attempted elucidation on the subject. Buteven if I can convey but little of their significance, I can at least build inyour minds the concept of these formulas. They are second ray presentations ofsoul ideas. We are told that God geometrises, when referring to the activity ofthe second aspect, and that a subtle geometrical form lies behind the exotericmanifestation. These forms convey to the occult student the symbolism of theworld of meaning. Behind the mathematics and the geometrical designs, and behindthe numerology which attempts (hitherto quite unsuccessfully) to convey thetruth, but which in a mysterious manner conditions the creative work, arecertain formulas which—as I have pointed out—express significance, intention,meaning. With three of the formulas we have spent a short time in consideration.Broadly speaking, these three condition the evolutionary process through theforms which are the result of the correct use of these formulas in such a waythat a directive is given . I know not how else to express it. The threedirectives, therefore, already dealt with, embody and express the oldestinvocative appeal in the world and (because of the age of this appeal) thesethree formulas have given a direction that naught can offset; the resultantconditions are inevitable: [305]Formula I . . . . Lead us from darkness to Light.Formula II . . . .Lead us from the unreal to the Real.Formula III . . . Lead us from death to Immortality.This brings us to a statement of the next formula and a consideration of itsmeaning:Formula IV . . . Lead us from chaos to Beauty.This formula is presented in the form of a symbol—one which is in such constantmovement that it is most difficult to describe or to make it live before you.There lies before the investigator a square or oblong, composed of akaleidoscopic mass of inchoate colours, moving, pulsating and in constantindescribable confusion. Superimposed upon this square is a radiant sun with apenumbra composed of the seven prismatic colours; these radiate from the sun inregular rhythmic bands and produce a marvellous blaze of colour. The backgroundof the square appears to have its confusion of colours shown of a heavy,brilliant kind and quality; the scheme of beauty emerging (even if it appears assuperimposed) is translucent and delicate and radiantly living in hue. Theheavier background can be distinctly seen through the translucence. This formuladiffers according to the polarisation of the one who visions it and who studiesit. If he is focussed in the personality, and is therefore conditioned by hispersonality ray, one type of energy will impinge upon his consciousness; if heis soul conscious and soul focussed, another type of energy will have itseffect. Thus two different pictures will emerge. Both will be correct, but theinterpreting agent will be different.This formula, if carefully considered and studied for a number of years, willbecome a key form by means of which aspects of the creative process will come tothe attention of the student, plus revelation as to some of the divineobjectives which are wider and of greater and richer implication than has yetbeen realised. I would here remind you that these formulas are not symbols ofwhat already is , but are [306] indicatory key forms of what may or shall be—avery different matter and one which you should bear in mind. They are symbols ofthe future and not of the past; they are predictive and not consummating; theyreveal what is on the way as the result of the divine thought and are notpictorial presentations of what already is.Therefore, they are not easy to grasp and interpret, because it is only theactivity of the intuition which will enable you to understand and move forwardinto the new impulsive causal area. Difficult though this task may be (and, mybrother, is), it is of major importance to disciples in training for initiation,because it will steadily tend to facilitate their entry into the world of causesand their emergence from the world of effects. You can see also from this thatthis formula is related to the Law of Karma; in fact, in the ancient recordsfrom which these formulas are taken, Formula IV has the symbol of one of thefour Lords of Karma at the four corners of this square or oblong design. Thisformula is sometimes called that of “the Sun upon the Square.” I have no more tosay anent this theme at this time or about this formula in this Instruction. Allthat I am giving you is intended to be suggestive and to develop in you thepower to use the interpretive sense—one of the new senses as far as experienceand experiment are concerned, but which is latent in every man.POINTS OF REVELATIONLittle as you may realise it, these words “Points of Revelation” summarise amost definite technique in the training of disciples for initiation. All life isintended to take the form of a progressive series of awakenings. Progress,movement, awakening, expansion, enlightenment, evolution, growth—these words arebut a few of those applied to the effects, both within and without, of thecreative process. What is this creative process but the working out intoprogressive demonstration of the divine intention as it assumes form? Thisintention is a fully comprehended scheme in the Universal Mind; we call itPurpose when considering the grasp by Shamballa of the synthesis of thiscomprehensive intention, [307] and we call it the Plan when considering the workof the Hierarchy in bringing this Purpose as fully as possible into expression.In our studies over the years and in the books which I have put before thepublic with the help of A.A.B. and of F.B. and of all of you who have cooperatedwith them, we have primarily considered the effect of this divine Intention,Purpose and Plan upon Humanity, and this because the Plan—emanating from theHierarchy—has to be implemented by mankind. Hence the importance of their graspand their understanding of the entire proposed programme. What, therefore, willbe the quality of their reaction to what their developed understanding willreveal? What can they expect and what aspects or forms can the revelation beexpected to take? Are they to look for a sudden blaze of light, or should theyexpect a gradual and progressive series of lesser lights? What is the relationof these revelations to the life of the occultist, and must he first of allregister and accept what is conveyed to him as inexplicable but to be admitted,and to be viewed as incontrovertible though beyond comprehension? Or what?Let me reiterate to you the well-known truth that no man is an initiate apartfrom understanding, that the life of the initiate is one of constantregistration of new knowledge which must be transmuted into practical wisdom, ofoccult facts which must take intelligent place in the life-service of theinitiate, and of new inclusions of areas of consciousness; these latter mustbecome the normal field of experience and of expression; they then become theground for further expansion. Every revelation has to be mastered from fourangles:1. The mental, occult, spiritual, hierarchical and triadal facts it embodies.Every revelation has its own format, for all our planes—so steadily beingrevealed—are the subplanes of the cosmic physical plane.2. The meaning which the facts and the format veil and hide and for which theone who is being enlightened must search. [308]3. The effect which the revelation is intended to make in the daily life andservice and the ashramic relationships of the disciple or initiate.4. The germ, seed thought, key form and invocative potency of that which hasbeen revealed. Every revelation has its place in a great series of revelationsand enlightenments; the disciple has to find, within the form of the revelation,that which he must use in order to achieve the next destined point of attainedrevelation.I have here given you, in a very brief form, one of the new techniques fordisciples in the New Age and one of the modes of meditation whereby theprocesses of revelation can be hastened. Hitherto in the past, revelation hascome unexpectedly, as it did to Saul of Tarsus in the Biblical narrative. Insincerity, the disciple struggles and works and serves; blindly he goes forward,and oft in much bewilderment he seeks knowledge and receives it at unexpectedmoments, and these frequently increase, at least temporarily, his bewilderment.But during the coming New Age, disciples will be taught how to work consciouslyand knowingly for light; they will be shown how to realise what will happen tothem before they take the needed steps and follow initiation. This will savemuch time and “focus the light in the desired place” far more rapidly thanhitherto.You will see, therefore, why I have included this teaching upon the Points ofRevelation in what I have to give you anent the processes of preparing forinitiation. It is essential that the modern disciple no longer goes forwardblindly but that he cooperates intelligently in the new systems of training. Youwill note the relation (if you call it no more than that) between the twophrases “points of revelation” and “mountain of initiation.” In the OldCommentary , these are brought together in a very illuminedstatement—illuminating if duly reflected upon:“The disciple climbs the mountain, its five peaks illumined by the Sun andhiding the other two. [309]From point to point he goes and the Way moves upward all the time—out of thedark into the light, from the jungle to the open space, from night to dawn.From point to point he moves and at each point he gets new revelation. Five arethe mountain peaks, and as he mounts towards each peak he receives five timesthe light. Five to the five and so from five to five till five fives havebrought him light. Ten lie ahead, but these concern him not as yet.”What is meant here (to bring it down to the bare factual outline) is that thereare five initiations ahead of the disciple, with two more ahead of the Master,making in all seven initiations, and that prior to each initiation—symbolicallyor factually speaking—there are five great revelations, making a total oftwenty-five, with ten later to be registered by the Master.I have indicated to you in my past instructions three of these revelations. Theyare, if you will remember:1. Energy follows thought and the eye directs that energy. This has been anoccult platitude ever since the days of H.P.B., during whose time it was decidedthat this was the first of the points of revelation which could safely be givento the general public. The assertion of this revealed fact was an essentialpiece of knowledge in the world, prior to the externalisation of the Ashrams—or,my brother, of the Hierarchy. The thought that all is energy has already beenaccepted by modern science, and the concept of vision (the first step towardsunderstanding the use of the spiritual eye) is already part of the teaching ofmodern philosophy and of many of the metaphysical schools.2. The Will is fundamentally an expression of the Law of Sacrifice.Paradoxically we found that when the spiritual will was—even in a smallmeasure—expressing itself, there was no such thing as sacrifice. Incidentally,we considered the great exponents and the great field of sacrifice, consideringthe great Life in which we all, as well as all other forms, live and move andhave our being. [310]I would like here to quote something I said to you in connection with thissubject: “These few thoughts upon the significance of sacrifice, or upon the‘taking over,’ through identification, of the task of salvage, of revitalisingand of presenting opportunity, are important to all disciples, as a goal and asa vision.” (Page 288.)3. The Monad is to the planetary Logos what the third eye is to man,esoterically understood. This is a most abstruse statement for all of you andwill require much concentrated reflection and serene meditation. The vision ofthe solar Logos and of the planetary Logos is closely related to intention andpurpose, and is the cause of the Plan. It is, however, beyond and different tothe Plan. I leave this thought for your consideration and meditation, but canassure you that you will come to no easy or early comprehension.Later on, as the years slip away and as students come and go, a clearer grasp ofthe techniques of comprehension—these emerging Points of Revelation—will formthemes for prolonged meditation and doors of entrance to the new occultism. Thefoundations for this new occultism are well and soundly laid; the superstructurecan be erected now, slowly and with due care, in conformity with the divineblueprints and in response to a sensitive reaction to spiritual impression.I have also told you that, in connection with these Points of Revelation, thereare three stages of activity which, when properly carried forward, will makethat which is revealed of service to the disciple in his contribution to thesalvaging of humanity. These three are Penetration, Polarisation andPrecipitation. Let us now consider these three for a short reflective period.You should realise that all phases of training—those that are associated withlife itself and that specialised training which is given to initiates—areinterlocking and interdependent. It is training, brother of mine, not strictlyeducation. Educational processes, concerning knowledge as they do, may bespecialised, and teaching can be taken in such isolated fields as conchology,biology or history. But in initiate [311] training, where the objective iswisdom and (above all else) the development of spiritual sensitivity, everyphase of approach to the divine unfoldment, and all expansions of consciousness,develop so that divinity is embraced, and every unfoldment of the understandingreveals to the initiate one major Reality—the fact of Being. Therefore, thisconsideration of our Points of Revelation is closely related to another of ourthemes: Training in Telepathy or the Science of Impression. Certain aspects ofthese two activities are the same, particularly the three points which we areconsidering here. The difficulty consists in this, that in relation to thePoints of Revelation the initiate is presumed to work from a more advancedstandpoint of comprehension than does the man who is taking the training whichmakes him sensitive to Impression. He knows the technique of Penetration,comprehends the process of Polarisation at the point penetrated, and—after dueacceptance—understands how to utilise it and precipitate it into the human fieldof service; he consciously employs that which he has learnt, grasped andappropriated. It matters not, in this case, what word you use.It should therefore be borne in mind that in this connection we are consideringthe point of experience where light pours in, bringing revelation, conveyinginformation, evoking the intuition and drawing into the waiting consciousness ofthe initiate those spiritual laws, those rules of the creative process, thoseray conditions and those new energies and forces for which the humanity of anyparticular period waits, and which are fundamentally needed if the race of menis to move forward into greater spiritual culture and out of the relativedarkness in which it at present moves.What we are dealing with here, in connection with initiate training, is theimpending realisation for which any opening cycle attests its waiting, and forthe new truths and the expanded spiritual presentations which it is the destinyof the initiate to bring to the people. You will note that I choose the word“destiny” in preference to the word “karma” because in this type of work theinitiate is working and practising and progressing under a Law of Destiny. Thislaw affects the Ashram and the Hierarchy as a whole, and neither [312] is underthe Law of Karma, as usually understood. This Law of Destiny has been broughtinto being since the foundation of the Hierarchy on Earth; it is the result ofthe pledged and united dedication to service which is the outstanding note ofthe united Ashrams. It is therefore a sevenfold law, for it takes on the sevencolours of the seven rays, the seven qualities, modes and methods, techniquesand energy expressions of all the seven rays. It is therefore, as far ashumanity is concerned, free from all evil, because it is selflessly motivatedand is—in a measure—a difficult law for you to comprehend. Pure destiny, devoidof all evil intent, is an enigma to the average disciple. It appears tocontravene other laws with which he is familiar. As the race of men achievesincreasing purity in the three worlds, this pure destiny will becomecorrespondingly effective. This is an important point upon which to reflect.This penetration makes an event in the life of the initiate. It is indicative ofsuccess and of contact and presents the opening up of a new opportunity. The twosucceeding words indicate effects of this penetration; they are then inevitableand cannot be arrested. By that you may infer that once the initiate haspenetrated to the point where revelation becomes possible he automaticallyattains the needed fixation, concentration, poise, polarisation and focus whichwill enable him to translate what has been revealed to him in terms and symbolswhich will convey significance to the intelligentsia with whom all initiatesprincipally work. I wanted to make this clear because students almost inevitablythink in terms of sequence . The effects of penetration (in this case two innumber) are simultaneous and not sequential. The polarisation of theconsciousness of the initiate, and the consequent condensation of truth, producean unavoidable precipitation which occurs in a flash of time; it results in aninstantaneous intuitive perception, and this is one of the early aspects of thisdual process. Think this out and remember in this connection that theinitiate—in process of receiving revelation—is working outside of time andspace, as you understand it.His consciousness is free, as compared with that of the [313] average man, andthe most urgent and the most difficult part of his task is correctly toapprehend the precipitating truth, information or revelation, and then to giveit an equally correct format so that it can meet the immediate human need. Youwill see, consequently, that the initiate learns to penetrate into the realm ofpure reason from the realm of mind, and there he polarises himself, and truthprecipitates. He has learnt thus to penetrate, and the three stages precedingpenetration have been necessarily sequential, until he has gained such facilitythat they can instantaneously be transcended. He has learnt through life in thethree worlds, to penetrate into the world of mind and the lower concrete mindhas become his instrument, integrating his personality, opening up to him theworld of thought, and putting into his power the processes of thoughtformcreation; he has learnt through meditation to make contact with the soul, theSon of Mind, Who is himself, and has in time identified himself with that soul;he becomes the soul in fact, and can create in the world of thought those livingforms which bring light and help and truth to others; thus he serves; he learnsalso, through unfolding perception, to penetrate into the levels of abstractthought, the antechamber to the world of pure reason, and through these threeaspects of mind he discovers that he possesses the “three keys” which willpermit him to delve into the knowledge, wisdom and reason of the Universal Mind.This is what is revealed to him as he penetrates deeper into what is called theArcana of Wisdom, the Mind of God, the third divine Aspect. This is essentiallywhat is covered by the symbolic and pictorial phrase “the raincloud of knowablethings.” The raincloud is a symbol of that area of the as yet unrevealedpurposes of God which can be immediately revealed if the world disciples andinitiates care to “penetrate to the point of precipitation.”This idea should in the future lie behind all you do in your meditation work.Your meditation should now be regarded by you as a process of penetration,carried forward as an act of service, with the intent to bring enlightenment toothers. I have been dealing with these Points of Revelation today from the angleof vision of the initiate. Process and [314] techniques do their work, and theseare followed by the recognition which the disciple accords within himself tothat which has been accomplished.PART VIIn my last instruction to you I dealt with some aspects of the new approach todiscipleship and to initiation; it is essential that the old concepts—profoundlyuseful in their day—should be forgotten and the newer methods and techniquesshould be substituted. This is now necessary on account of the surprisingunfoldment of the human consciousness during the past twenty-five years. Thesteps taken at the Conclave in Shamballa in 1925 (based on tentative conclusionat the previous centennial Conclave) and the pressures exerted by the Hierarchyhave proved most successful, and out of the chaos of the world war (precipitatedby humanity itself) there is developing a structure of truth and a parallelingresponsiveness of the human mechanism which guarantees the perpetuation and therapid unfoldment of the next stage of the teaching of the Ageless Wisdom.I used a phrase in my last instruction to which I would like to call yourattention. I spoke of the coming ability of mankind to “share in the greathierarchical task of illuminating, precipitating and lifting .” These wordssignify far more than their obvious meaning, and I would like somewhat toelucidate.Men are apt to think that the entire objective of the work of the Hierarchy isto find and admit men into hierarchical contact. It is that minor phase ofhierarchical activity which appears paramount in your consciousness; is it notso? Your main hope is that as you unfold your latent possibilities, you will beable to help others to do the same. This is indeed a worthy thought, but isnevertheless based entirely on misapprehension. Let me, therefore, throw lightupon the matter by quoting the Old Commentary :“When light illuminates the minds of men and stirs [315] the secret light withinall other forms, then the One in Whom we live reveals His hidden, secret lightedWill.“When the purpose of the Lords of Karma can find no more to do, and all theweaving and close-related plans are all worked out, then the One in Whom we livecan say: ‘Well done! Naught but the beautiful remains.’“When the lowest of the low, the densest of the dense, and the highest of thehigh have all been lifted through the little wills of men, then can the One inWhom we live raise into radiating light the vivid lighted ball of Earth, andthen another greater Voice can say to Him: ‘Well done! Move on. Light shines.’”You will note that the emphasis in these words is placed upon humanaccomplishment and not upon what the Hierarchy does for man. When men achieveillumination, intelligently precipitate the karmic quota of their time, and liftthe subhuman kingdoms (with its reflex activity of lifting the Highestsimultaneously), then they can and then they do share in the work of theHierarchy.That cycle of sharing has seemed for aeons too far away to be considered; when,however, humanity precipitated the war, they automatically and somewhatsurprisingly brought the final achievement much nearer. The illumination ofmen’s minds will rapidly follow. The process of lifting the subhuman kingdomshas been amazingly forwarded by science—the crowning accomplishment of which wasthe fission of the atom and the penetration of the “spiritual interfering”aspect of the human spirit into the very depths of the mineral world. Ponder onthis.Therefore, if you could see things as they truly exist in the world of today andview them in their true perspective (and this—as far as you are concerned—isfrom the angle of the Master), you would know that a great step has been takentowards:1. The institution of more rapid initiation, and that in group form. [316]2. The possession of a much closer and a more widespread contact between theHierarchy and humanity.3. The revelation of the true significance of initiation.This true significance lies still behind the curtain of that which veils theultimate truth. The great secrets of Sanat Kumara are there to be found in duetime, and the truth anent initiation is one of them.When the Hierarchy withdrew behind the separating curtain in Atlantean times, itmarked the beginning of an interlude of darkness, of aridity and a cycle of“blank abstraction,” which persisted in its crudest form until 1425 A.D., andsince then has sensibly lightened until we reached the year 1925. It becamepossible for the Hierarchy itself to regard the necessity for reorientation andthe imminence of the revelation of the first secret—the secret of initiation.Note well what I say here. Humanity had reached a stage where it could do the“abstracting” itself, and could eventually and by sheer force of the spiritualwill wrest the secrets from the custody of the Guardians behind the veil. Thispresented the Hierarchy with another problem. How could this be permitted withsafety so that, in its avidity for pure truth, humanity could be simultaneouslytrusted? Revelation brings responsibility, and ofttimes danger. Men, asindividuals, can grasp certain of these truths of initiation and use them forthemselves with impunity, but their revelation to the unready might involveserious risks.It was therefore decided that a truer picture of the nature of discipleshipshould be imparted to the waiting aspirant, the misunderstood principle ofoccult obedience should be “soft-pedalled” (if I may use such a word), and menshould be set “free for penetration”—as it is called—and be taught the neededreticence through testing and experience.It is interesting to note that the cycle now being inaugurated in the world isthat of “Growth through Sharing,” and that advanced humanity can now share thework, the responsibility and the trained reticence of the Hierarchy, whilstparalleling this and simultaneously, the mass of men are [317] learning thelessons of economic sharing; and, my brothers, in this lies the sole hope of theworld.Every initiation to which disciples are admitted permits this closer occultsharing in the hierarchical life. This involves, for advanced humanity, anoticeable increase in vitality and in vital tension and potency. Its reflectionamong the masses is shown in the constant demand for speed and in the enormousspeeding up of the life of mankind in every department of living. This speedingup synchronises with the increasing readiness of disciples everywhere forinitiation—according to their status and developed ability.The difference, brother of mine, between the past and the present readiness liesin the fact that in the past this readiness was a purely individual matter;today it is something which is closely related to a man’s group, and theindividual aspect is of secondary importance. As time and speed increase inimportance for the masses of men, the disciple (ready for initiation) regardshis personal advancement upon the Path as of less importance than his developedcapacity to serve his fellowmen, serving them through the group with which hemay be affiliated and to which he may be drawn. For the disciple facing thefirst two initiations, this group will be some exoteric body of men who claimhis allegiance and in which he learns group cooperation and methods of working;for the more advanced disciple, it is the Ashram and direct service under theinstigation of some Master.I have in the above paragraphs given you a number of ideas which, though not newin their stating, are new in their reference. This is of importance for you toremember—or discover? The significance of sharing and the relation of spiritualdevelopment to speed are points of importance to emphasise. Much that I havesaid above has a close connection with the hint given on pages 302-3. I suggestthat you look it up.ON HINTSI have continually laid the emphasis upon the need of [318] disciples to thinkesoterically , and this is perhaps the most difficult demand that I can makeupon you. A consideration of these hints should teach you much, for they are notwhat they seem upon superficial reading, and the effort to understand and tointerpret should lead you far on your way towards “occult thinking.” The Mastersdo not convey teaching through the medium of hints which could be safely givenin a more open form. They have no intention at any time to be mysterious or tohold back teaching from the enquirer. Their method is, in reality, threefold:1. The presentation of those truths which obviously grow out of a recognition oftruths already presented. There is here usually a close adherence to theesoteric teaching of the time, and this method is essentially a linkingpresentation.2. Occasionally (usually once in a century after Their Conclave at the close ofthe first quarter) there is the imparting of a more advanced body of teaching.This teaching will only be recognised by a few of the foremost disciples in theworld; it will, however, prove to be the ordinary form of occult teaching duringthe next developing cycle. It is this type of work which I have beenendeavouring to do with the aid of A.A.B.3. There is also the teaching which is definitely given within the Ashram, andwhich is not, at the time when the other two forms are prevalent, reduced towriting; it will find its way out into expression as need arises and asopportunity is offered to the disciples who are its custodians. Its presentationis dependent upon the unfoldment—rapid or slow—of the lesser disciples of theworld.All these three methods are in use at this present time.As a man progresses nearer and nearer to his goal, he finds himself beginning torealise that the entire technique of this unfoldment consists of a sequence ofrevelations which are induced by his recognition of subjective significanceswhich are of a nature entirely different to the usual and apparent meanings. Inthe olden days, as you well know, [319] the Master would say to a disciple:“Here is a hint” and, having stated it, He would proceed to enjoin upon Hisdisciple the necessity to withdraw and search for the true meaning until hefound it; then, and only then, could he return for a consequent new hint.Today, this method is no longer being used, and this change constitutes one ofthe modes of training the disciples of the New Age. The modern disciple has torecognise the hint which is related to his point in consciousness and which isto be found in the mass of instruction made available for his use. He has toseek for the—to him—most deeply esoteric statement he encounters in the currentteaching; from this isolated hint he has to abstract the significance, afterremoving it from its context; later, he must learn and profit from its meaning.The hints given at this stage are related to the theme of revelation, or theyconcern themselves with the techniques which make revelation possible. The hint,for instance, with which you can work until you receive the next sequence ofteaching is contained in this paragraph and the one above; you can discover itif you take each phrase, release your intuition and seek for meaning andsignificance related to the possibility of revelation. My one effort today is toindicate the relation between initiation and revelation. The revelation—inducedby right orientation and right thinking—is a part of the training of theinitiate, and many thus in training delay their progress by not recognising therevelation when it tops the line of their spiritual horizon.Five hints have already been given to you, and I would like you to get theirsequence, for it may prove valuable to you and to other disciples:1. That the changes brought about in the Hierarchy have been the work of thedisciples of the world. Have you asked yourself (in studying this hint), Why thedisciples?2. That human world planning is today the first indication of the emergence ofthe will aspect. Why is this rightly so? [320]3. That disciples in all the Ashrams have the task simultaneously of “modifying,qualifying and adapting the divine Plan.” Why is this so? Why is the Plan notimposed?4. That the initiate knows because he works. What does this hint mean to you?5. A key to the correct interpretation of a hint lies in its association withthe idea of direction in time and space.Study these and see what is their relationship and what you feel is the innermeaning which they are intended to convey.THE FORMULASIt might sometimes be remarked that these formulas are attempts by advancedaspirants to confine within due limits some of these escaped revelations. Theyexpress a past, indicate a revelation, and ground the thinking aspirant in theworld of meaning because it is in that world that he must learn to work andlive; it is from that world that he must begin now to work in two directions intime and space, for the world of meaning is the antechamber to the “Circle ofLiberation.” This “Circle of Liberation” is ever entered by the individualinitiate, and has been down the ages, but now, for the first time, it is beingentered by humanity itself and as a whole. This is the result of the experienceof the war, 1914-1945. Humanity, entering this circle, will be confronted by thefirst major lesson: the Unity of the One Life. This form of presentation will bemore easily recognised by the masses than such phrases as Brotherhood,Relationship, Fraternity. Life and its balancing partner, Death, are old andfamiliar aspects of general livingness to the masses, and their starting pointin all revelation is life, and the result of all revelation is death or thedisappearance of veils.The formula with which I present you today consists of three closely relatedwords, and the theme with which the student must concern himself is the natureof the relationship which is indicated—not by the words but by the very [321]nature of that which relates them. This is not an obvious relation but theesoteric and subtle meaning which the intuition will reveal and that the outerwords hide.THE SUN . . . BLACK . . . ANTAHKARANAThese words constitute, and when placed in their correct order create, a mostpotent magical and mantric formula. It has a tenuous yet definite connectionwith the third initiation, but it is not this angle with which you are asked toconcern yourselves but with the triangle created and the lines of force set inmotion when the right word finds itself at the apex of the triangle.The clue to rightly orienting your thinking lies in the realisation of thethreefold aspect of the Sun, the unity of the reality and the dual nature of theantahkarana. More I must not say; it is for you to wrestle with the formula andunearth or bring to the surface its hidden significance. In line with the hintsgiven in connection with the other four formulas, the keynote of this one wouldbe:Lead us from the individual to the Universal.POINTS OF REVELATIONI would like at this point to call more directly to your attention the threestages of revelation; you have been dealing with them and considering them, ifyou have succeeded in following this work closely, and may already have achievedsomething of the automatic and the essential in their activity.Revelation seldom breaks in all its completed beauty into the consciousness ofthe disciple; it is a gradual and steadily unfolding process. The three words Ihave given you as descriptive of the stages concern the individual disciple orinitiate and express the stages of the impact of the revelation upon his mind.There are paralleling inner causes which are responsible for the outer stages ofPenetration, Polarisation and Precipitation. These are: [322]1. The stage of the “advancing point of light.”2. The stage of right direction or the focussing of the “advancing” potency.3. The stage of spiritual impact.Again here (if you could but see it) you have an illustration of the processesand interaction of Invocation and Evocation and of the establishing of a triplerelation between an inner reality and the outer man, the disciple on his ownplane; you have an evocative activity of so potent a nature that it producescorresponding exoteric attitudes and expressions. In reality, you have here aphase of the working of the Law of Cause and Effect, demonstrated in a mostillustrative manner. As the Law of Karma makes its presence felt upon the outerphysical plane, you have the evidence before your eyes of the three stages ofPenetration, Polarisation and Precipitation. At the same time, on the innerplanes, and because of the existence of the inner reality, you have the threecorresponding stages of Advancing Light, Right Direction, Impact. You have herealso an indication of the close interrelation of the outer and the inner,producing a condition wherein the disciple creates a situation analogous to thephase—the long phase—of his creation of karma and its final precipitation in(so-called) “critical” disaster in his physical plane life.A study of the three revelations indicated in the earlier instruction willreveal the accuracy of the above statement. I enumerated them for you in myprevious instruction and wonder if you have read them often. You will find it ofvalue to take these three points of revelation and apply to them the three outerand the three inner stages through which all revelations pass. You may also havenoted how one point of revelation leads normally to another. You will (havingstudied the three revelations indicated on pages 309-10) note how all of themconcern the first divine aspect, starting with the initial energy set in motionby God’s thinking; leading to the expression of the Will, which is the greatfirst ray in action, and then focussing itself through the Monad. [323]Curiously enough, in these three you have—symbolically and factually givenyou—expression of the three exoteric stages:1. Penetration, the descending and circulatory nature of energy.2. Polarisation, the effect upon this energy of the polarised will.3. Precipitation, through the focussed intent and the directed impulse of theMonad.The next sequential revelation will be that of creativity, the world ofthoughtforms and the desire which each human being and humanity as a whole havecreated, and (note this well) the setting in motion by humanity and in relationto its own destiny, the Law of Cause and Effect, or of Karma.I have here condensed into a relatively few short paragraphs much importantteaching anent revelation and its processes and have emphasised a phase of humanactivity (needed to produce revelation) which has hitherto received little, ifany, attention. Revelation is apt to be regarded as apart from all laws, as anextra-planetary activity, as something that occasionally happens to thewell-intentioned aspirant, and as relatively unpredictable and unexpected. Ihave sought here to correct this erroneous impression.PART VIIIt would present a very real problem to would-be initiates if they had to answercertain questions, among them the following: Into what are you being initiated?Are disciples being initiated into the Hierarchy? Are there certain secretcontacts that the initiation makes possible? Is the acquiring of certainmysterious and hitherto unknown knowledge the reward of initiation? There ismuch vague and loose thinking on these matters.Over the years I have given you many definitions of initiation; all of them havebeen useful and true. Today I seek greatly to widen your conception of thesematters and to [324] give you an entirely new slant on this engrossing andassertive work. What I have to say grows out of certain hints I gave you in thepreceding pages. These hints are good illustrations of that method of teachingwhich is profoundly rooted in hierarchical technique. I said:1. That more rapid processes of initiation are now being instituted.2. That initiation veiled a secret and that its revelation was imminent.3. That every initiation permits a closer sharing within the hierarchical lifeand that this sharing is closely related to vitality and to vital tension.4. That initiation is concerned at this time with group life and not with theindividual.5. That initiation concerns the future and involves prevision.6. That time is one of the major underlying themes or secrets of initiation.In this particular instruction I seek to deal with these six points.1. When I say that more rapid initiation is being instituted , it must not beinferred that a certain slackness is to be permitted or that the requirementsare not so drastic or that the disciple will be allowed to take initiationbefore he is truly ready or that he can pass on before he has proved hiscapacity to move forward upon the path. Such is not in any single point thesituation. Three factors are responsible for this change in the hierarchicalrequirements:a. The mental development of disciples everywhere is today of such a calibrethat it does not take as long for them to make the needed adjustments or tochange their attitudes and conditions of life as it did formerly; it does nottake as long for them to assimilate a presented truth or to respond to anintuitive perception. Their grasp of the Law of Cause and Effect and theirappreciation of the subsidiary Law of Consequences is [325] far more prompt thanin the past. These facts therefore necessitate a recognition upon the part ofthe Masters of the more advanced condition and a pronounced saving of time asthe consequence. This you should note as of very real importance; its truesignificance is that the period required for a truth, a contact, or a spiritualapprehension to be registered by a physical brain has been greatly—almostphenomenally reduced. Disciples can now in a few months (if sincere and honestin their endeavour) master ideas and develop responses which it took them yearsto master in earlier cycles of hierarchical effort. This is true, on a lowerturn of the spiral, of the masses of men everywhere. The mind factor is todayalert, trained and controlling. These are facts which the Hierarchy cannotignore, nor do the Masters desire to do so, because it is that mental alertnesswhich has for ages engrossed Their attention and it is this for which They haveworked for aeons.b. Another factor is that many disciples are taking incarnation at this time whoare already prepared and ready for initiation; they have done the needed work inprevious lives. No time, therefore, need be lost, and there is today a constantseries of initiations taking place. This must perforce produce certain importanthierarchical changes; new situations come about in initiate circles and many fitcandidates are supplied for hierarchical vacancies; this produces a shifting ofthe hierarchical personnel on a scale hitherto unknown. Needless to say, thisshifting and changing presents its own peculiar difficulties and opportunities.One of the most important of the latter is that candidates for the Initiation ofDecision are far more numerous than at any previous time in our planetaryhistory.c. Again: Initiation can now be taken in group form; this is something entirelynew in the work of the Hierarchy. Not one by one do candidates stand before theInitiator, but many so stand simultaneously. Together they can think in completeaccord; together they are [326] tested, and together they reach the “point oftriumph” which supersedes the “point of tension”; together they see the “Starshine forth,” and together the energy emanating from the Rod of Initiation fitsthem for the reception of specialised energy, to be later used in their futureworld service. This group approach, this group intention, this “group silentreticence and vocal recognition,” and this group dedication and vision are nolonger in the experimental stage. This group achievement (I refer not here toyour particular group which has not been outstandingly successful) marks thepoint where there can be the inauguration of a new phase of activity inShamballa. This will enable the Lord of the World to become the Ruler of aSacred Planet which, up to date, has not been the case. Our Earth can now becomea Sacred Planet, if all right conditions are fulfilled. A new divine quality (asyet unrevealed and which we would not at this time recognise if presented withit) is slowly crystallising into expression, through the medium of this hastenedinitiation process. Disciples are today witnessing the emergence of a solarcharacteristic, through the medium of their planetary Logos, just as the “Livesof similar Intention”—as it is esoterically called—witnessed it many aeons ago.It is to this unknown and mysterious quality that the “shining forth” of theStar refers.More than this I cannot say, for you would not understand; what I have saidabove you can accept as a possible hypothesis without outraging your commonsenseor violating your intention, that I do ask you to do—just accept.A great opportunity is presented to you, and the success of the system ofRaja-Yoga, the Kingly Science of the Mind (started by the great initiate,Patanjali, eleven thousand years ago) is being demonstrated and his techniquesare being vindicated. What he issued on behalf of the Great White Lodge has nowbeen satisfactorily launched and much of the original purpose justified. For thenext seven thousand years [327] his system will be used to train disciples inmind control. They will, through this system, achieve the stage of “isolatedunity,” and in that recorded unity—alone and yet with many others—take theinitiation which will enable them to release energy into a waiting and demandingworld of men.2. We come now to our second point, that initiation veils a secret and that therevelation of that secret is imminent. Just what this secret is, I may notreveal, but it is concerned with a peculiar type of energy which can be inducedat a moment of supreme tension. The only possible hint I can give you inconnection with this mysterious matter is that it is closely related to the“Blinding Light” which Saul of Tarsus saw on the road to Damascus and the“blinding light” which accompanied the discharge of energy from the atomic bomb.The “Blinding Light” which ever accompanies true conversion (a rare and suddenhappening always when true and real) and which is an attendant demonstration ofall Lives Who have passed the human stage of consciousness—according to Theirdegree—and the light which is released by the fission of the atom are one andthe same expression on different levels of consciousness, and are definitelyrelated to the processes and effects of initiation. This will not even makesense to you until certain initiate-experiences have been undergone by you. Itis not easy for the average aspirant to realise that progressive stages upon thePath indicate a progressive ability to “take the Light.” When the aspirant praysin the new Invocation: “Let Light descend on Earth” he is invoking somethingwhich humanity will have to learn to handle; this is one of the things for whichthe disciples of the world must begin to prepare the race of men.All these planetary developments are attended by risks, and none more so thanthat of the absorption of light—on a world-wide scale—by humanity, with asubsequent reflex action on the three subhuman kingdoms. Nothing which affectshumanity or which stimulates it to a forward-moving activity is without itsinevitable effect upon the three lower kingdoms in nature. Forget not! Mankindis the macrocosm to this threefold lower microcosm.This as you may well surmise, can be among the secrets [328] of the initiatoryprocess. The “principle of absorption” emerges as one of the subjects to bestudied, understood and mastered between initiations, for each initiationcarries the subject another step forward. At present, the physical effects ofthe fission of the atom and its subsequent constructive use is the immediateproblem before modern science, and (I would remind you) it is now an exotericproblem. Its use, or corresponding use on esoteric levels, still remains one ofthe secrets of initiation.3. I stated as our third point that every initiation indicated a closer sharingin all forms of the hierarchical life . Do you realise in any measure what thatstatement means or what the implications are? I am dealing with a point not onlyof profound significance but of major testing. There is a spiritual counterpartor higher correspondence of the economic life of our planet to be found in theHierarchy. Sharing is associated with that which is of value, which should beshared if justice is to be demonstrated, and basically, with those values whichare life-giving. The sharing to which I am here referring is the sharing in allreactions, of all attitudes, of all types of wisdom, of all problems anddifficulties and limitations, so that they become constructive in the groupsense and cease to be destructive. Nothing destructive has place in any Ashram,but disciples can and do use ashramic force in their work in a destructivemanner, and in the three worlds. This is not easy to understand. Perhaps I canmake it clearer to you if I point out that this sharing involves completeknowledge of all the personality reactions of all the members of the Ashram,i.e., of all preparing for the lesser initiations, and therefore of all below acertain degree. There is nothing secret which will not be known, and you canunderstand that the discovery of the factual nature of this constitutes a majortest for all disciples. There is nothing in the mind of a disciple which cannotbe telepathically known to all the other members of the Ashram who are at thesame degree of development or to all of a higher degree, for it is a law thatthe greater can always include the lesser.I wish students would consider this fact with great intelligence and closerattention; they would then arrive at the [329] knowledge that their limitationsdefinitely provide a problem for those less limited. The time has to comewherein candidates for admission into an Ashram, and later, for initiation, mustrealise that their limitations, their relatively petty points of view and theircircumscribed attitudes are a hindrance to ashramic progressive events. If theprinciple of sharing has any significance whatsoever, these are points of greatimportance and are supremely worthy of consideration. An illustration of thiscan be seen in the response of this group to the work which I have asked you toundertake over the years. A tiny handful of you have responded and have madesacrifices and worked hard to further the Triangle work, to spread theInvocation and to help in the Goodwill work, but it is a very tiny minority. Therest have either been interested intellectually but could not make the neededsacrifices, or they refused to put first things first, and secondary issuesoccupied their lives. This limitation, as you may realise, has handicapped theashramic plans, and those who wholeheartedly have worked (and they know I knowwho they are) have had to share—with pain and distress—in the limitation. I havefrequently stated that on entrance into an Ashram the disciple leaves behind himhis personality life and enters as a soul. What I have stated in the aboveparagraph in no way contradicts this fact. It must, however, be remembered thata disciple has become what he is as a result of his personality aspiration, hisstruggles in the three worlds, and an attained point of spiritual unfoldment.Therefore, though he may leave behind his personality with its faults andproblems, he indicates clearly to his co-disciples and to those more advancedthan he is, exactly what is lacking in his equipment, what is his point inevolution, and what stage of discipleship he has achieved. In this connection, Irecommend the rereading of all that is said anent the six stages of discipleshipin Discipleship in the New Age (Vol. l); the material given there is of greatimportance here.At first the disciple may have little to share, and instead presents a greatdeal for senior disciples to record, for which they must make allowance andwhich they have to offset. They have also to regulate the energy which playsupon the [330] entering disciple so that it is adjusted to his point ofdevelopment and to his ray and nature. The group of disciples within the Ashramwho are of equal development with the new disciple, act as a safeguarding group,and this is true, no matter what the degree, where higher incoming energy isconcerned . When a disciple is temporarily bewildered, this safeguarding becomesa major necessity, and where glamour is present in a disciple’s life, it placesa real strain upon his co-disciples. They have to share the charge and shoulderunitedly the protection; it is not the task of the Master, but is carriedforward under His interested and wise instruction.This ashramic sharing is one of the great compensations of discipleship. Bymeans of it added light can be “occultly endured.” I would like to have youponder on that phrase. Great united strength can be brought to the service ofthe Plan, and the occult significance of the words: “My strength is as thestrength of ten, because my heart is pure” can be grasped. The perfectedstrength of the Ashram (symbolised by the number 10) becomes available to thedisciple whose purity of heart has enabled him to penetrate into the Ashram; hisknowledge becomes more rapidly transmuted into wisdom as his mind is subjectedto the play of the higher understanding of Those with Whom he is associated;gradually he begins to contribute his own quota of light and of understanding tothose just entering and to those who are his equals.The strength, availability and usefulness of an Ashram is that of the sum totalof all that its members can contribute, plus that which Those above the thirddegree of initiation can “import” from still higher sources or the Masters ofthe Ashrams can make available at need. Students are apt to think that an Ashramhas only one initiate of the fifth degree (that of Master) within it. Such isseldom the case. There are usually three “cooperating Masters” in every Ashram,with one at the apex of the triangle; He acts as the Master of the Ashram and isresponsible for the preparation of disciples for initiation; frequently thereare also “associated Masters,” particularly during cycles of rapid initiation,as is the case [331] today. There are also Masters Who are preparing for thesixth initiation.This “sharing” process does not involve what is usually understood as the“sharing of trouble.” Personality difficulties and personality problems are notpermitted entrance into an Ashram; only evolutionary limitations and lack ofperfection (limitations in soul expression, indicating the grade or stage ofdiscipleship) are recognised. If, however, disciples act or react in a way thatbrings attack upon the Ashram, that is naturally recognised, but these issuesare fortunately very rare; they may become more common as the spiritualinspiration to which humanity is now subjected and reacting brings far greaternumbers of disciples into relation with the Hierarchy. In the case where adisciple has opened a door of attack upon an Ashram—and this has happened, asyou know, in the case of my Ashram—the work of the united disciples is to “sealthe door” against the menacing evil, to withdraw themselves from the usualconfidence shown to an erring disciple, but to stand at the same time insteadfast love beside him until such time as he has learned the error of hisways and has himself taken the needed steps to arrest the evil which he wasresponsible in starting.It must be remembered that none of this is a personality or an individual attackupon an Ashram. The relatively feeble efforts of a person are unavailing andmake no real impact upon the conscious life of the Ashram. The evil releasedmust emanate from a group, though it is released through the agency of anindividual disciple. That is a totally different matter. A disciple may do thisthrough misuse of the lower mind and its rationalising capacity, which can makeblack to appear white and prove that good intention is responsible forevil-distributed energy; or the disciple can let in evil under the influence ofglamour, provided again that it is group evil. In these ways, the disciplesimply turns the key, and group evil enters. For instance, the harm done to theAshram of the Master Morya by H.P.B. in his earlier incarnation as Cagliostro,(Cagliostro, W.R.H. Trowbridge) is only now fading out, and its [332]repercussions affected the whole Hierarchy. The harm attempted on my Ashram hasbeen more easily offset, and the source of hate which it represented failed inits attempt because of its general ill repute. It has been offset by love andunderstanding which is not so easily the case in a first ray attack.In an Ashram, therefore, the sharing takes place along the following lines:a. The sharing in individual initiation but not in individual problems orpersonality difficulties.b. The sharing in the “art of occult protection.” This involves two activities:the protection of limited disciples and the protection of the Ashram fromattempted attacks or intrusions.c. The sharing in the service of the Plan, resulting in action in the threeworlds.d. The sharing in the Ashramic life, with all that that signifies, and in theopportunities which are thus presented.e. The sharing in the stimulation which comes from the Master’s Presence and inthe instructions which He occasionally gives.f. The sharing in the accession of power or love or insight which comes duringany cycle of initiation. These cycles (for our purposes) fall into threecategories:1. The initiation of members of the Ashram, either before the Christ or beforethe One Initiator.2. Initiations taking place within affiliated Ashrams and having a specific rayeffect.3. Initiations into those degrees which are higher than the fifth degree; thesecreate vacancies, and at the same time cause a tremendous influx of power.At the period of these cycles, all within the Ashram react in some way oranother; no one moves forward upon the Path without creating a new relationshipand becoming a better transmitter of power.g. The sharing in the results of special spiritual events, such as: [333]1. The directed attention of Shamballa.2. An inflow of extra-planetary force.3. The “nearing” or the directed power of an Avatar of some degree.4. The merging of all hierarchical thought and activity into some one directedevent, such as the Wesak Festival and, increasingly, the Full Moon or Festivalof the Christ.There are other events which have a definite effect upon every Ashram, theeffect being determined by the ray or by the “unfoldment of the ashramic Lotus.”Every great act of sharing results automatically in the production of tworeactions:a. The creation of a point of tension.b. The emergence of a point of crisis.On these I shall not here enlarge, for I have given you much along these linesin other and earlier writings. The bringing together of “two points of energy”(as, for instance, two disciples) creates inevitably a point of tension whichcan release energy in the service of the Plan. It produces also a point ofcrisis, according to the development of the disciples involved. There is not thesame point of crisis where initiates of the higher degree are involved. Thepoint of tension in these cases results in a “crisis of projection anddirection” which is in no way related to the disciple’s life or condition or tohis aspiration and understanding.4. Initiation is today concerned with the group and not with the individual.This is not an easy matter to elucidate to a group of people who are still sopolarised in their personalities that it is the personality aspect of theirfellow members which engrosses their attention at all times. I say this withemphasis. Aspiring disciples are far more conscious of the failings and thepersonality attributes of others than are the more advanced disciples in theAshrams. The advanced disciple may be—and is—well aware of the failings,failures and undesirable qualities of others with whom he is [334] associated,but his critical mind is not the determining factor, as it is with most of theless developed. He is far more conditioned by the aspirations, the effort andthe fixed intention than by the personality angle. He gauges the soul’s gripupon the lower self, primarily from the angle of the stability of its hold; histreatment of the aspirant is therefore based upon that recognition, and not uponany analysis of the aspirant’s lack of development. This is a point of immenseimportance, for it is this type of consideration which governs the Masters whenThey are choosing and training a group for initiation. The Master is notoccupied with the temporary faults but with the soul grip and intention, andwith the aspirant’s habitual response to soul energy, when that energy isapplied. Given a firm hold by the soul, an attentive ear by the personality, andconsistent and enduring effort from both directions—soul and personality (andthis is an instance of invocation and evocation)—and the Master can begin totrain a group.This is necessarily a slow process, from the standpoint of the physical plane,but upon the inner planes—where the time factor does not rule—this does notmatter in the least. The Masters think in terms of cycles and not in terms of anindividual life; as you cannot yet do that, except theoretically, it is notpossible for you to understand. The experience, the failures and theachievements of the disciples in my Ashram are seen by me, for instance, interms of one thousand year cycles. What you may have done in this life, unlessof outstanding significance, is in all probability quite unknown to me; if Ichoose to know, I can do so, and I do so in those cases where the results ofsome activity have repercussions upon my Ashram or upon a large proportion ofthe group of disciples.Let me put it this way: the petty selfishness and the silly little vanities andthe irritations which disturb you, the unkind words you may speak of or toothers, and the withholding of love or the fact of wrong emphasis in your dailylife are not noted by me or by any Master. They are the affair of your own soul;the results affect your family, friend, or communal group, and are none of Ourbusiness. Yet those are [335] the things which you notice in others and whichaffect your judgment, evoking like or dislike, praise or blame, but inevitablyputting you—as an individual—upon the judgment seat. There no Master sits. WhenChrist said: “Judge not and ye shall not be judged,” He indicated a state ofmind where understanding so controls that the aspirant no longer praises orblames; because of this general attitude within his mental approach to people,he is then free to become a full member of an Ashram.If you consider the many apparent failures in my experiment in forming anexternal group affiliated with my Ashram, and as demonstrated in the bookDiscipleship in the New Age , you may well wonder why on earth I chose such agroup of people or why I chose to make myself aware of their thinking, faultsand failures. I will tell you.From a survey of one thousand years which I have been enabled to make (as areall the Masters), everyone of these people shows a definite soul intention, allare definitely oriented in their personality life to the spiritual world, andreact to soul control correctly—if at times quite feebly. The soul has them in atrue grip, and that grip has become a stable and persistent hold. Therefore, inspite of serious faults, and in spite of pronounced personality qualities ofundesirable nature, and in spite of wrong emphases, these people were and areready for training. Their failings and faults will disappear more rapidly thanyou imagine under the influence of the soul—as the dew disappears under themorning sun. The enterprise of the Masters to substitute group initiation inplace of the laborious process of individual initiation is proving successful,even though it is still in the experimental stage.The “cycles of interest,” or those periods in which the Masters pay closeattention to the quality aspect of mankind, are also being speeded up; the“gauging” process will take place now every three hundred years, instead ofevery one thousand years, as has been the case until 1575 A.D. This change canbe attributed to the greater sensitivity of man’s response to spiritualstimulation and to the rapidity with which he deals with his personality. Thisis, of course, not [336] apparent to you, on account of your day by dayconsideration of each other; it is, however, apparent to Those Who view humanitywith greater disinterestedness, deeper understanding and over much more extendedcycles of time.The result of this more frequent watchfulness on the part of the Hierarchy hasbeen shown in the confidence with which the Masters have undertaken to preparepeople for initiation.This decision to do so, and permission having been granted from Shamballa,certain matters came up for consideration. Most of them would naturally be tooabstruse for your comprehension—which is seated in the mind and brain instead ofin the soul and heart. It is obvious that if initiation is a physical planeaffair, requiring recognition in the brain consciousness, the disciples must bein physical incarnation together, and by this I mean within the ring-pass-not ofthe three worlds which are the dense physical planes of the cosmic physicalplane) for a sufficiently long period of time to test their reactions, as agroup, to the concept of group initiation and to each other as participants. Fora great part of this time there must also be a physical plane life, shared byall in the group; this need not involve similarity or identity of location, butmust involve similarity of world affairs and civilisation. This physical planenecessity is—as you will perceive—a test of individual integration, with a viewto group integration later on.It is this test which I have been applying in my work with all of you in thisspecial group; the related state persists also on the inner plane after death,and in the consciousness of those (at present non-affiliated) who are still partof the group chosen for the experiment, on my part, of group preparation forinitiation. Other Masters are doing the same as I am doing. We hope during thenext five hundred years to present several such groups to the One Initiator. Allwho are in these groups have taken the first initiation, as have so manythousands of people in the world today. Many have taken the second initiation,particularly those who are working in fifth ray Ashrams and in third rayAshrams, for such disciples are distinguished by a lack of emotional emphasis.[337] Group initiation has been forced upon the Hierarchy by the rapidunfoldment of the spiritual consciousness in humanity, an unfoldment whichdemonstrates—no matter what the ray—as goodwill. This goodwill is not to beinterpreted as the sentimental sixth or second ray untrained aspirant is proneto interpret it. It can take many forms: it can show itself as sacrifice on thepart of science and a dedication of the fruits of scientific research to humanwelfare; it may take shape in the third ray aptitude to dedicate great wealth tophilanthropic or educational enterprises. In neither of these cases is thedisciple apparently distinguished by a so-called loving nature. Yet the resultsof their application to science or their accumulation of the crystallised pranaof the financial world are turned to the helping of mankind. This will be a hardsaying for some of you who rate an irritable remark by a co-disciple assomething disgraceful and belittle the efforts of the money-maker, and do bothwith a sense of self-righteous congratulation.The old saying that “the evil which men do lives after them, the good is oftinterred with their bones” is not occultly true. Evil may follow after a man inhis next incarnation until he has learnt to eliminate it, but the good men do(even with mixed motives) is not forgotten but is entered upon the calendar ofthe Hierarchy.Before the end of this century, thousands will stand before the Initiator andtake initiation in group form; they will pass through the door of initiationtogether and together take their vows. This statement applies to the second andthe third initiations. The higher initiations will still be taken individuallyor in groups of three, but not more. When the Masters take the sixth initiation,They perforce take it alone at the “midway point” between Shamballa and theHierarchy, apparently deserted by both attentive groups. There, in completesilence and in a condition of “isolated unity,” They will make Their greatdecision. Then and only then will They become aware of the vast attentivespiritual audience which has awaited Their will.5. Initiation concerns the future and involves prevision . Again I must repeatmyself and say that this theme or motif [338] of initiation is one mostdifficult to explain. Why should the fact of being initiated involve prevision?That is the immediate question which arises to your lips. I will counter thisquestion with another one. What do you understand by vision? I refer, of course,to vision which is true, and which therefore presages events. In all mysticaland occult writings the idea of vision, of seeing a vision or of materialising avision, runs like a golden thread through the thinking of the aspirant. It isconnected in his mind with spiritual achievement, with the attainment of hisgoal and with the recognition of that which lies at the heart of all highspiritual adventure. The mystical writings refer to visions and always in termsof that which lies ahead, of that which is deeply desired; the concept is oftenprostituted to an excessive emotionalism or to a sublimated sex expression. Theoccult writings frequently refer to vision as a moving point, advancing towardsa progressive revelation of divinity. The whole concept is, however, relativelyvery simple.Every initiation, and every stage preparatory to initiation, involves the seeingof the remote yet the attainable; all vision leads up to the momentous event ofthe sixth initiation, when the Master faces what is for Him the final visionwithin this planetary ring-pass-not. He makes His great decision on the basis ofthe seen opportunity, and through His response to the seven phases of thatcosmic vision, He treads one or other of the seven Paths. For this great “crisisof vision” all the lesser visions have prepared the Master; after His decisionis made there is no longer any vision as we comprehend the term. There is afactual perception of such a nature that the element of time—as evidenced byremoteness, by the distance between this and that, between here andthere—forever disappears. This is, necessarily, a somewhat meaningless statementto the majority of people.For the aspirant, whether his goal is the Path of Discipleship or one of theseven Paths leading away from known planetary experience, there is persistentlythat which conveys to consciousness two factors: [339]a. A dualistic perception of that which has been attained and of that which liesahead to be attained.b. A recognition of the events which will, if experienced, merge the two intoone major happening; time, therefore, enters in. However, it is not time as itis conditioned by the receptivity of the human brain, but time as it representsevolutionary movements, resulting in an achieved though constantly relativeperfection.Oft I have said to you that time is the sequence of the states of consciousness,as registered by the human brain. It is therefore a physical event. Behind thisdefinition, however, lies a real or true time of which the initiate becomesincreasingly aware. The great Law of Karma has received little attention fromthe standpoint of time; yet it is that which determines the sequence ofevolution, of evolutionary progress, the period of karmic recognitions, and theconclusion of a karmic cycle.The ordinary teaching on Karma (particularly as to the time element) has beenterribly prostituted by the purely selfish rendering given to it by those earlytheosophical teachers who misunderstood and misinterpreted what H.P.B. said.They had little chance to do much else than relate it to individual affairs, ifthey were going to familiarise the public with the concept, but theynevertheless did much harm with their puerile setting of times and seasons, andtheir attempt to take to themselves the mysterious functions of a Lord of Karma.It is always difficult to convey any true concept of Karma, because itpredominantly concerns cycles and the sequence of world events. There is much tobe done in relating time and conscious recognition together.In this connection, initiation might be defined as embodying three recognitions:a. A recognition of the end of a cycle of happenings, i.e., retrospection.b. The recognition of the appearance of an eventual yet imminent cycle, i.e.,prevision. [340]c. An acceptance of initiation or a recognition of its occurrence, i.e., thepresent attitude.Here you have, in relation to the initiate, a situation which includes past,present and future, and—in this presentation of the Eternal Now to the attentiveeyes and heart of the initiate—you have what is, for him, at his particularpoint of initiatory unfoldment, the consummation of all vision or visions. Thistends to definite progress; it obliterates what is usually understood by Karma;it initiates new and spiritual causes which—in their turn—magnetically projectthe initiate onward until (at the sixth initiation) he “no longer needsincentive, for vision is incentive and the pull of the spiritual magnetism uponour planetary life.” Thus it may be occultly expressed.For the initiate (at this great stage of experience), Karma ends. By this I meanthat Karma—as the ordinary student understands it—is no longer effective.Neither good Karma, resulting in a sense of bliss, nor bad Karma, resulting in asense of penalty and related to a conviction of sin, as the Christian theologyso dreadfully miscalls it), has any longer the slightest hold upon him.Manifestation and the Law of Cause and Effect are related; where manifestationexists, there this great Law—governing substance and innate in matter—mustcontrol and must condition form. The Master, however, stands free, endowed withthe Christ-consciousness. He then wields this Law, but is not wielded by it.Such is the reward of following the vision: first of all, the mystical vision;then later, the vision of predetermined choice, of Plan and of cosmicopportunity.This latter threefold vision is a very different thing to the self-centred anddualistic vision of the mystic. That vision is a part of the evolutionaryspiritual development of all of us and lies behind most occult aspirants. Moreabout this higher vision I may not say; the theme is too abstruse. It involvesexperiment and experience. Through both of these phases the initiate passes andlearns the smallness and the inaccuracy of his past opinion and interpretationof experience. [341]6. Time is one of the major underlying secrets of initiation . You will notefrom this, the great emphasis on time as event, and as being of true importancein the career of the initiate. The time here referred to is time as the initiateunderstands it—free as he now is from the control of form or of materialsubstance. It is time as it conditions speed; as it establishes rhythm; as itdirects relationships; as it determines choice and fixes decision: activity,rhythm, relationship, decision! The decisions arrived at are not related to lifein the three worlds, but embody the reactions of the Spiritual Triad. This is apoint most difficult for you to grasp, because you have not yet truly built oremployed the antahkarana; it is time as the opener of the door toextra-planetary existence and as it releases the initiate, not only from thecosmic physical plane but from the cosmic astral plane also. It is with thesethoughts that I must stop my present exegesis, because language has not yet thecapacity to indicate the truth, even if such indications were fruitful and ofuse even to the advanced aspirant.ON HINTSThere is one mistake which esoteric students are prone to make; they are apt tobelieve that a hint is so carefully veiled and so cautiously concealed that itis only discoverable after most persistent search. Such is not the case. A hintis usually quite obvious, and should be; however, its meaning, as it concernsthe life, work and activities of the disciple, is the factor which presentsdifficulty and calls for careful reflection. Take, for instance, the obviousnessof the hint (on page 319) in which even the paragraphs where it was to be foundwere indicated. The hint which you were intended to take as a guide is to befound in the words that the disciple must “. . . recognise the hint which isrelated to his point in consciousness . . . my one effort is to indicate therelation between initiation and revelation.”Four ideas emerge for the disciple as he studies this hint: [342]1. Recognition Of what? 2. His own point in consciousness What is it? 3.Initiation Which? 4. Revelation Again, of what?One thing you are all apt to forget as you hunt feverishly for the hint, andthat is: it is a hint for the searching disciple. It is not of generalapplication as far as my intention is concerned, but must contain something eachof you needs in order to take the next needed step forward during the yearfollowing your receipt of the instruction. Had you considered it in that light?You now have six hints which can be summed up for you in the form of questions,addressed personally to you and to no one else; they require your personalapplication, understanding and reply:1. How have I, as a disciple of D.K., contributed to the work of inducing theHierarchy to make certain needed changes where the task of influencing humanityis concerned?This would involve a high-powered livingness.2. Is the Will aspect in my life beginning to create situations which arerelated to the hierarchical Plan which I—as a disciple—must follow?This would involve a careful construction of the antahkarana.3. In what way have I cooperated with the Plan in order to have “modified,qualified and adapted it” to meet the need I see?This would involve careful soul-personality cooperation.4. As I work, do I see an increasing vision of divine intention, and do I knowpractically more than I did?This would involve occult obedience in its true sense.5. Do I work with an inner programme, and are my thoughts and activities rightlydirected?This would involve the dual life of the disciple and correct orientation. [343]6. Do I recognise in the life-training which I am receiving preparatory stepsfor initiation, and the possibility of impending revelation?This would involve constant ashramic contact.These hints are therefore intended for the guidance of the disciple in training;the formulas are of wider connotation and concern the group, the Ashram, theHierarchy and the workers with the Plan upon the inner and the outer sides oflife. The synthesis of the teaching or of the training given is something whichyou should not overlook. The unit, the individual and the part are always viewedin relation to an expanding and inclusive whole. One of the marks of readinessfor initiation is the ability to see this inclusive entity and to note the lawwhich is transcended when the part becomes the whole; the disciple must be ablealso to register and respond practically to the greater spiritual laws whichtake the place of those which have been transcended. In this last sentence Ihave given you the seventh hint.It is through the medium of a hint that the Master in any particular groupconveys to a disciple His desire for the disciple. In past times, the hint givenwas obvious and clearly stated by the Master. Today, owing to man’s greaterintellectual perception, the hint is still obvious, but it is contained in groupinstructions, given not to the individual but to the members of an Ashram atsome particular stage of development—as is the case with all of you who receivethese teachings.You now have seven hints which are capable of a dual interpretation, ofindividual reception, and of group conditioning. It is with the aspect ofindividual receptivity that you should be concerned, for the effort to applythese seven hints to your daily life of service will train you in the techniquesof my Ashram.THE FORMULASI do not intend to give you a formula in this instruction. The five which youhave already received still remain unexplored [344] and unexplained by any ofyou. You have—with only one or two exceptions—omitted to give much thought orstudy to these important creative processes. To grasp the meaning of thesemysterious presentations, the creative imagination must be brought into play; itmust be remembered that these words, symbols and forms have relation (aprogressive relation) to the initiation for which the disciple is beingprepared. They are in the nature of keys to a door and—when properly grasped,understood and used—they render the disciple capable of demanding entrance onthe basis of demonstrated, effective, creative work. They show also (and I wouldlike you to note this with care) that each initiation is the evidence in thedisciple’s life that he has succeeded in grasping some great divine idea.In the five formulas with which you were presented, five divine ideas were givento you. They were apparently familiar on the surface, but each of them veiled adeep and hidden significance. Each of these five ideas controls one or other ofthe five initiations, but they have not been given to you by me in their rightorder. That order is for you to determine. I have no intention to give it toyou, and you have no need to receive any more of these formulas. I will however,in later instructions, take up each of these supreme, governing ideas andendeavour to give you initiatory insight into their esoteric significance.You will have noticed that the formulas, as given to you by me, have beenarranged into two different groupings. I mention this because these groupingsemerge out of the general text and may not have been discriminately seen by you.In one group, you have five formulas indicated, each of them dealing with amajor governing concept. These concepts are divine ideas, brought down intohuman thoughtforms, and each of them conditions the work of our planetary Logos.They are so all-inclusive that there is little that the disciple can do aboutthem, except feel himself as an integral part of them—from which he may not andcannot differentiate himself.The second grouping is of not nearly so great importance, but it is probably ofgreater practical usefulness; it will, if [345] subjected to deep meditation andconcentrated thought, prepare the disciple for a deeper understanding of thefirst grouping of divine ideas. These five formulas hold within themselves asixth, which I am not going to give you though I am here referring to it. Thesecond grouping of the formulas is as follows:Formula I . . . Concerns integration into an Ashram. Group feeling. Dissipationof glamour through light.Formula II . . . Deals with alignment. Revelation of the group antahkarana.Reality revealed by an aspect of the mind.Formula III . . . Deals with changes in the soul nature. Time and space. TheEternal Now or immortality.Formula IV . . . Deals with the Life aspect. Concerns the circulation of energy,and therefore the mode of the creative process.Formula V . . . Deals with the first aspect, with the Will. Relates to divinePurpose. Shamballa.Formula VI . . . Concerns Death. The constructive work of the Destroyer aspect.The “passing” of zodiacal and other cycles.This sixth Formula is a deduction from the other five. I have been dealing inthese instructions with the larger formulations. The lesser might be regarded asthe subjecting of the formulas to the first and third methods of interpretation,whilst the larger group of ideas concerns the second and the fourth interpretivemethods. This is something which it is important for you to bear in mind.POINTS OF REVELATIONIt must not be forgotten that all that is here communicated is strictly inrelation to initiation. The revelations accorded (of which three have alreadybeen indicated) concern the initiate and his work as it is impulsed from themoment [346] that an initiation has been passed. Life for all men everywhere isfull of revelation, recognised or unrecognised; it might be said that there islittle else, though the majority of them are of small importance except in theircombined sequence . They might rather be regarded as creating or constituting a“field of revelation” or an area of consciousness wherein five major points ofrevelation will some day be seen, grasped and understood; they are the substancewhich has within it that living something which is invocative of light; it isthat material substratum which is capable of evoking that “lighted response”which the initiate demonstrates when he himself has learnt to generate the fivepoints of revelation. These five points (which I shall indicate) must not beconfused with the five initiations. They are indeed related to them, but theright order in itself constitutes a revelation, and none of them can bespecifically applied by you to any particular initiation. In fact, it might besaid that all five of them apply to each initiation, giving—as the initiate canreceive and bear it—five aspects of divine activity; these are in the nature offive modes or techniques of the future work to be done by the initiate betweeninitiations. The quotation from the Old Commentary as given on page 308 can beregarded as a key to the entire technique.It is, however, a technique which is formulated by the initiate himself and isnot one imposed upon him within an Ashram or by the watching Master. All thesepoints of revelation also concern the techniques of creation, and indicate tothe Master what will be the nature of the creative work with which He—under law,according to ray, and in relation to one of the seven Paths—will eventuallywork.The entire theme is too complex for anything more than hinted concepts at thistime. The general theme has been covered by me to date under four groups ofthoughts or four groups of presented ideas. Even though I realise that I amrepeating what has been earlier given, I must—for the sake of clarity—call yourattention to them anew:1. The Five Points of Revelation . Of these, three have already been given:[347]a. Energy . . . .Thought . . . . . . . . Directive Energy.b. Will . . . . . . Expression . . . . . .Immolation. Sacrifice.c. Monad . . . . Universality . . . . .Extra-planetary Light.2. Modes of Interpreting the Points of Revelation:a. The mental, occult, spiritual, hierarchical and triadal approach, revealingfacts.b. This fivefold significance as it is conditioned by the particular initiationbeing undergone.c. The consequent reactions by the initiate, affecting his daily life, serviceand ashramic activity.d. The germ, seed, key or inherent, invocative potency which will appear whenthe three previous groups of approaches have been taken. This potency will laterbe exploited.3. The Inner Subjective Techniques :a. The stage of the “advancing Point of Light.”b. The stage of right direction of the light potency.c. The stage of spiritual impact.4. The Outer Objective Technique :a. Penetration.b. Polarisation.c. Precipitation.You can see, therefore, how definitely all the above processes involve a plannedcreative activity. These ideas are not those, however, which can be used by theuninitiated aspirant. The use, through understanding, of these techniques isconfined entirely to creative work, carried on in accordance with the Purpose ofShamballa and not in accordance with the hierarchical Plan. The above variousstages of the fourfold process mark eventually the recognition by the Master ofdivine Purpose; it is also shown how that purpose is revealed in five stages,requiring in addition two final revelations of major importance.One of the lines of thinking which it is most necessary to impress on advancingand advanced disciples is that of “initiated thinking”. This means thoughtcarried forward on purely abstract levels, and embodying, therefore, thoughtwhich is free from soul conditioning or from the crystallisations [348] of thelower mind. It is essentially triadal thinking and is only registered by thebrain when the antahkarana is somewhat constructed and there is some directcommunication from the Spiritual Triad to the brain of the personality.I am emphasising this point here because the fourth point of revelation concernsthe sudden recognition by the initiate of the potency of Purpose, as it isexpressed in creation, plus a paralleling recognition that creativity is—for theMaster—the expression of all for which He has been trained; it is at the sametime the lowest of the three possible recognitions anent divine Purpose. Theothers have nothing to do with creation within the planetary ring-pass-not, butconcern the implementing factors of the divine thinking. I know not how else toexpress these deep and abstruse realities—abstruse because the adequatemechanism for their comprehension has not yet been created by the disciple. Wemight therefore word this fourth point of revelation as follows: Purpose itselfis but an energy, released within the confines of the Council Chamber; there itmust take shape. Behind it looms that which has brought it into being.I would ask you to ponder deeply upon this section which we have called thePoints of Revelation; they are aspects of the training given to the initiate.They are also—on a higher turn of the spiral—the esoteric correspondence orhigher meaning of the words: “As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.” In thecase of the initiate however, the heart is only one of the conditioning pointsof contact through which the “advancing point of light” can come.It is perhaps a somewhat new thought to you as aspiring occult students thatthere is a major revelation—something entirely new and unforeseen—which isinherent in the situation when a candidate for initiation stands before theInitiator.A consideration of the three points of revelation already given may show you howdeep may be the present mystery where each of these points is concerned. Themystery of the eye and its relation to light (esoterically understood) is verygreat, and as yet no student, no matter how diligent, knows anything about it.For instance, brother of mine, when the [349] third eye, the inner eye, and theMonad are brought into direct alignment with “the Eye of God Himself,” so thatwhat the planetary Logos sees can be partially (at least) revealed to theinitiate, who can tell what that revelation will bring of results andenlightenment? When the true nature of the will is comprehended and theself-will of the personality (of a very high order, necessarily), the will ofthe soul (as demonstrated by the activity of the highest tier or circle of theegoic petals), atma, expressing itself as the spiritual will, and Sanat Kumaraare also brought, through initiation, into direct alignment, who, again, canpredict what the revelation will be? When, again (as hinted on page 313), themyriad thoughtforms of the concrete or lower mind are seen as illusion, and thelower mind, the knowledge petals of the egoic lotus, the abstract mind andbuddhi or pure reason are all brought into alignment with the Lords of Karma ina direct relationship and as signifying the ending of karma in the three worlds,who can foretell the nature of the ensuing revelation? It is alignment thatholds the clue or the key to all these deeply spiritual events.It is these ideas which must arise as the true occult student faces up to therecognition of opportunity and prepares definitely and consciously forrevelation. It will be apparent to you that the revelations with which I amdealing take place as a result or a consequence of standing before the OneInitiator, and only when the initiate is presented by the Christ. The earlierinitiations may have their corresponding revelations, under the great Law ofAnalogy, but they are themselves of a very high type of illusion; they have thequality of illusion and require the recognition (by the initiate) that theysimply veil an ultimate possibility for which he must work and wait.PART VIIII feel it necessary again to reiterate that initiation is concerned with theconsciousness aspect of the disciple or of the group that is to undergo theprocess. The emphasis has been laid in the past on contact with the Hierarchyand—as we [350] have seen—with the use of devoted, emotional zeal as the mediumof that contact. Again, as we have seen, the period of time which has passedsince H.P.B. brought this teaching to the modern world has changed all that, andthe emphasis is now on the initiation of the consciousness of the disciple orgroup into areas of divine expression, hitherto unrealised. Initiates, in thepast, were admitted into the world of ideas, of intuitional perception or ofbuddhic awareness; their task was to transform these ideas into ideals; thus,they presented spiritual goals and hierarchical objectives to the race, thisbeing their major form of service. Today, owing to the pronounced development ofmankind, the accepted disciples of the world, those who have undergone the firstinitiation (and their name is Legion), and the initiates of higher degree, haveobjectives which their mental unfoldment has made possible; they can be admittedinto divine areas of consciousness which are conditioned and brought into being,not by divine ideas but by the divine Will (their perception of that Will willbe according to the degree of the initiatory control). Their task is thereforeto perceive the Plan which is the hierarchical mode of implementing the divineWill, plus the Purpose which is perceived by the Heads of the Hierarchy. Theyhave also to undertake to see that that Plan becomes a factual expression uponthe physical plane and a part of the recognised consciousness of humanity as awhole. This, being a relatively new unfoldment, has not yet made the necessaryheadway, largely owing to the planetary Karma and the appalling situation withwhich humanity has confronted itself. I would have you here note my phrasing.Evidence, however, of the growth of the human intellect along the neededreceptive lines can be seen in the “planning” of the various nations, and in theefforts of the United Nations to formulate a world plan which will eventuate inpeace, security and right human relations. It is interesting to note that, fromthe very start of this unfoldment, three occult factors have governed thedevelopment of all these plans: its clearcut significance, unperceived as yet byyou, in the setting of a time boundary by the nations who formulate these plans,[351] within whose announced limits certain objectives are presumed to bepossible of attainment.It will be obvious to you therefore that, owing to the changed polarisation ofthe disciples of the world, the entire quality, processes and modes of activityof the Hierarchy have undergone and are undergoing change. The nature or qualityof the disciples being admitted into hierarchical participation necessarilycondition the rhythm and the keynote of the Hierarchy at any given time. At thesame time, nothing hitherto developed or gained is ever lost, and the quality ofdevotion is still potently present; enrichment proceeds and, if I may use suchan inadequate phrase, the perception of all within the Hierarchy is tremendouslyenhanced; areas of the divine perception, clothing divine purpose, are steadilybeing revealed.Revelation is not only the prerogative and reward of the attaining initiate, butit is increasingly taking on new forms and fresh outlines for the Masters Whohave attained —a process made possible by the higher mental perception of theincoming disciples. Group work, group reaction and group possibilities arecarried to their highest point of expression within the Hierarchy. I want you toconsider this with care, and not regard the Hierarchy as a static point of loveand mediatory activity, as is so often the attitude of the disciple. Theevolutionary process conditions the Hierarchy as it conditions humanity and allelse in the manifesting universe. There is, however, an evolutionary interplaywhich—in this era and at this time of crisis—is producing effects inrelationship.Approaching this subject from another angle, the mental polarisation of thedisciple seeking entry into the hierarchical sphere of work is producing aunification of initiatory effort which is new in the spiritual history of theplanet and which is the first step being taken at this time upon inner andsubtle planes to bring about certain great “Crises of Initiation,” involvingsimultaneously all the three major planetary centres—a thing hitherto unknown.Up to 1875, initiation was a sequential process as well as largely an individualprocess. This is slowly being changed; groups are being admitted [352] toinitiation because of a recognised and sensed relationship which is not that ofdisciple and Master (as heretofore), but which is based on initiate-relationshipin group form, and which is present between Humanity, the Hierarchy andShamballa. It is this spiritual and subtly sensed relationship which is todayfinding physical plane expression in the worldwide effort to establish righthuman relations.Initiation is no longer regarded essentially as the moving of a human being whohas accepted certain disciplines and made certain self-determined progressiveadvancement in consciousness into closer contact with the Hierarchy and a groupwithin the Hierarchy; that angle of it will rapidly become a thing of the past.It is the moving forward of an entire group of spiritually-minded disciples andinitiates into new areas of the divine consciousness and into a closer rapportwith the Mind of the Lord of the World. This the disciples and initiates will dotogether , according to their degree and their point in spiritual evolution. Irefer not here to the evolution of the form. Three things will thereby bebrought about:1. A closer linking of the three divine centres (Shamballa, the Hierarchy andHumanity) so that the flow of divine energy will be increasingly unimpeded, andPurpose, Plan and their Precipitation upon the physical plane will befacilitated.2. A far more powerful Hierarchy and one much more closely linked to Humanity bythe principle of intelligence—implementing the love principle—and far more enrapport with the Purpose, which is the dynamic focus of all planetaryenergising, development and evolutionary growth.3. A fusion or establishing of relationship within humanity itself, producingright human relations and a consequent integration into the Hierarchy. This willbe in the nature of a mass initiation and will be made possible by therelatively new process of group initiation, growing out of the slow method ofindividual initiation.[353] These are difficult matters to make clear, my brothers, but I may perhapshave succeeded in conveying to you some general idea as a basis for your furtherthinking.The individual disciple, seeking initiation, is with deliberation and with hisfull and free consent merged into the group; he achieves this fusion by his ownindividual effort and is (throughout the entire process) an absolutely freeagent, moving forward and becoming mentally inclusive, as rapidly or as slowlyas he chooses. He determines the time and the event himself without interferenceor obstruction from any outside force.This is the relatively new spiritual technique, and it is a technique acceptedby initiates and disciples of all degrees in all three divine centres. Likeeverything else that happens upon the subjective plane of human living, a majordistortion of the process and of the new technique will appear in some form orother in human affairs and constitute a great obstruction (apparently andtemporarily) to human progress. It will be in the nature of a sidetrack and aglamour, brought into impelling and compelling use by the enemies of humanityand by those who work constantly against the Forces of Light. Today, thisdistortion can be seen demonstrating in all totalitarian countries; theindividual is not free and his fusion with the state and his progress as astate-absorbed entity—deprived of the right of free choice and forced throughfear and penalty to relinquish his own self-directed life—is a growing menace tomankind.It is the right use of this same energy which makes fusion with the Hierarchypossible. These are points worth considering, and will convey to you someunderstanding of present world conditions. The underlying Principle of Fusionand of group endeavour is right and part of the divine plan; its implementationby grasping, greedy and ambitious men, or by deluded disciples, is terriblywrong and will lead to disaster. This disaster the Hierarchy is seeking toavert, but the Masters are handicapped (as usual) by the relatively few uponwhom They can depend, and by the lack of understanding amongst the masses ofwell-intentioned people. [354] These, through their ignorance rather thanthrough their planned ill-doing, know not how to stem the tide of evil.ON HINTSThus far I have given you—for your searching consideration—seven hints. I intendto give you no more than these seven , because what you now have will proveadequate for many years of study. Each of them, in fact, could provide the themeof a book, and the search for their meaning will take all that you have ofmental and intuitive perception. The significance which is immediately apparentis the one which probationary disciples can well see, grasp and appreciate.Disciples can, however, arrive at much deeper significances, and it is to thesethat the group attention is now called.Let me point out that the apparent significance is applicable to the trainingand the unfoldment of the individual aspirants, and is therefore in line withthe ancient use of hints by the Masters of the Wisdom. But the deeper meaning(for which you must search) is not so easily seen and is concerned withhierarchical impression, involving necessarily ashramic intention and itsprecipitation in service. It is here that the Points of Revelation are to befound of prime importance, and the reason why I am laying much emphasis uponthis little-understood theme of revelation.As you already know, a hint is susceptible of many interpretations, according tothe point in evolution and the grade of the disciple. A Master can gauge adisciple’s ability to pass onward and arrive at his attained status by his modeof handling a hint. In the preceding instruction I posited for you a series ofquestions relating to the subject of hints, but I did not tell you that theywere in the nature of a test. They were framed in words that appeared to makethem of general and personal application. Did you deal with them as such? Therewas no need to do so and (if you have truly understood what I have indicated rehints) you must have wondered why the questions were drafted in that particularform; you would then have proceeded to consider their themes and the answersrequired from the standpoint of the [355] Ashram, which is not the standpoint ofthe individual. I know not what you did. I can only hope for your rightapproach. If—to illustrate—you interpret the sixth hint, which states amongother things that “my one effort is to indicate relationship between initiationand revelation,” by pondering upon the initiation which you believe lies aheadof you as an individual, and the consequent revelation which will then be madeto you, then you will be functioning as an aspirant and not as a disciple. If,however, you sensed, no matter how dimly, that each initiate-group enriches theAshram with its invoked revelation, you will then be arriving closer to thedesired consciousness.For your instruction, I propose to take these seven hints and—in thisinstruction and the next—I will “open up” the hint for you and try to show you alittle (not all) that a hint, rightly approached, can convey. As I do so, itwill become apparent to you that you must always have in mind three things:1. A hint today will concern the group—its interrelation, its fusion, itsinitiation and its service.2. A hint is intended to teach you something new in your experience , even if—asa theory—it may seem quite familiar to you.3. A hint, like all else in the occult teaching, is capable of seveninterpretations which can roughly be divided into three. These three are that ofthe probationary disciple or aspirant, that of the accepted disciple and that ofthe Master or the higher initiate. That interpretation which I will indicate toyou will concern the meaning which it has for the accepted disciple, andtherefore its meaning for those of you who read these words.The probationary disciple can arrive at the significance of a hint as it can beunderstood in terms of the three worlds, i.e., its physical application, itsemotional or devotional expression, and its mental formulation; the disciplemust interpret and apply it in terms of the Plan, of directed energy and [356]of the Ashram, as it exists as the servant of humanity. If you will endeavour toarrive at this attitude and also at a spirit of true self-forgetfulness, youwill assuredly learn much. I shall not be able to give you full and adequateinterpretations or write you at length upon each hint, but I will give youenough to enable you to go deeper into significances than would otherwise bepossible. Because we are considering the seven rays, do not waste your timeattempting to assign the seven hints to the seven ray influences or to the sevenprinciples. Disciples on all the rays can work with these hints in terms of theseven rays, if they so choose; but these seven terms of ray interpretation haveto be used on each hint, a task which is too great for our present endeavour.These seven hints are used in all Ashrams as teaching measures, and when I firstgave them to you (scattered through the papers during the past few years,beginning in 1941 and more definitely isolated for your reflection since 1945) Idid not mention this fact. You can see, however, the richness of thecontribution of the disciples since the inauguration of the new technique. Sincethat time, disciples in all the Ashrams, and therefore on all the rays, delvedinto meaning and arrived at revelation . I have given you these seven hints intheir simple modern rendering. I will try and give them to you in their moreesoteric presentation, as they are thus preserved in the Archives of theHierarchy.Hint One. As I have given this hint to you, the wording is as follows: “Thechanges brought about in the Hierarchy have been the result of the work of thedisciples of the world.”Here you have a very simple statement but one which is distinctly bewildering inits implications. Its ancient formulation in the Archives consists of aninjunction to the Master and runs as follows:“Regard and recognise the changes in the hearts of men, and change the rules asmen in time and cyclic change [357] approach the Ashram. The Ashram stands notstill. New life pours in from either side.”This will perhaps throw light upon the interpretation which I originally gave toyou. One of the most difficult tasks which confronts the Master is to teach thedisciple to think of the Ashram and to act and serve, think and invoke, as amember of the Ashram would normally do. Two thoughts, therefore, emerge from astudy of the two versions of this hint:1. That the Law of Change governs the Hierarchy just as it governs Humanity.2. That the disciple who functions under this law has the following things todo:a. Deal with the constantly transforming changes in his own personality.b. Adapt himself to the rapidly developing and changing events which are takingplace within the Hierarchy.c. Contribute to the wise circulation and direction of the new energies whichare pouring into and through the Ashram. This he does by realising himself as acentre of changing energies. This is the way the Hierarchy works.You who read and study the ways of the Ashrams at this time are witnessing aperiod of extreme change and adjustment and of a far-reaching reorganisation.For ever the occult law holds good: “as above, so below,” and the reorganisationof planetary affairs which is taking place at this time is partially the effectof the changes produced in the Hierarchy by two major factors, to both of whichI have frequently referred:1. The higher and more intelligent type of disciple who is now affiliating withthe Ashram and his instinctive demand for group work and recognition.2. The new energies pouring through Shamballa into the Hierarchy; these are ofan extra-planetary nature [358] and have their source largely in the Aquarianquality of the present cycle; these energies are steadily eliminating theenergies of the Piscean Age.Therefore, my brother, from the angle of the searching disciple, this first hint(in one of its deeper meanings) provides you with three lines of thought or ofmeditative reflection: Evolutionary Change, Reorganisation, GroupResponsibility.The concept of service rendered by the Hierarchy is consistently present. Theway to world change is also given. The Hierarchy as a meeting-place of energiesis emphasised and—in the disciple’s consciousness—these factors begin to emergeas a vital vortex of force, receiving, distributing and under order—that orderbeing the directed focussed will of the many Ashrams within the one Ashram. Inthose Ashrams, groups of disciples are working, blindly and ignorantly at first,but with a growing sense of responsibility, of relation and of direction. Asthey work for the Plan on the physical plane, they carry with them to the Ashramthe registered sense and the acute realisation of the basic changes in the humanconsciousness which are the immediate results of world affairs; from theirreaction, from the quality of their recognition of immediate need, and fromtheir efforts to present the truth in terms of the “newest mind”—as it isoccultly called—the Master in the Ashram can change His techniques, use newideas upon receptive minds, and thus keep pace with the rapidly developinghumanity with which He has to deal.One of the ideas which a disciple should learn from his reflection upon thisproblem is that he is already a part of the Hierarchy whilst at the same time heis a part of struggling, unhappy humanity. Therefore, he is not alone orisolated; he is a part of the Hierarchy because he has “entered with his group”;this is a fact, even if he fails to comprehend the full implications of thatphrase. At the same time, he learns that only in so far as he has developedgroup consciousness and is beginning to function as “one absorbed within thegroup” can he truly pass into a closer and more [359] vitally contributoryrelation to the Ashram to which he belongs.Hint Two. “Human planning today is one of the first indications of the emergenceof the Will aspect.”So this second hint runs. This sounds relatively simple and to be a rather tritestatement, and that is because it gives in reality only a general idea andsynopsis of the ancient formula. These formulas, which reach the candidate forinitiation as hints, are fundamentally in the nature of instructions to theMaster, and provide in their entirety a sequence of teaching and of progressiveunfoldment of truth. This fact emerges more clearly in the original wording, asnearly as I can translate it for you, or rather, transfer into words what wereoriginally word symbols or ideographs:“When the stream of direction is noted by the one who seeks the inner side, thenlet the Master indicate the pattern and then await results. This may take time.Results come not through the action of but one; they appear when the manyrespond on Earth to that which comes from the higher Centre through the One.This they do blindly, when at stage the first; later they move with care andright direction. Thus affairs are changed on Earth.”To the aspirant, the statement re planning fixes his attention upon the physicalplane; he then begins to see what are termed “indications of direction”; he seesthem in terms of humanity’s immediate purpose and becomes aware of the tiny partwhich he can play by cooperation with this planning—or, perhaps, by repudiatingit. Decision in both cases is dependent upon his background, training,circumstances and prejudices, plus his ability to make choices. This is as faras he can go, and he usually is quite satisfied with the part he has played inthe various processes, and regards his choices and decisions as aspects of hismental determination.But in reality he is at fault, and the case as he visions it [360] is not so. Hemust learn to function entirely differently. This hint is not concerned with apart which an aspirant must play as an individual, nor does it include thefactor of mental appreciation of the qualities of his own nature. Where the truedisciple is concerned, three things are involved and condition his wholeapproach to this problem of human planning:1. Its relation to the Plan, as it has been communicated to him within theprecincts of the Ashram.2. His ability to use a measure of the true divine Will as it pours through theAshram from Shamballa for the implementation of the Plan, and as constitutingits directing agent.3. The sequence of the planning as it materialises on Earth in relation to thetime factor. Three things emerge in his thinking at this time:a. The immediate steps to be taken in order to carry the Plan forward,logically, practically and with the least expenditure of the destroying aspectof the will.b. The probable duration of the cycle in which the Plan can progress from itsinception until its fulfilment.c. An appreciation of the unfolding pattern of which the material planning is anexpression. He needs to discover how far human planning conforms to thatpattern. He must sense where nonconformity originates and what steps—as far ashis particular point in evolution permits—the Ashram should take to offset thedistortion of the Plan. Only in this way will he learn himself to plan.You can see from the above what a different approach is here involved when adisciple deals with a hint, how wide are the vistas which are opened up, howsubjective his predominating attitude must be, and how inevitably the grouprelationship to the planning becomes apparent and important to him as anindividual as well as to the group as a whole.[361] It is for this reason that disciples in an Ashram are of no politicalpersuasion and own to no nationalistic bias. This is not an easy thing for themto achieve at once, but the group consciousness gradually assumes control, andwith it the disciple’s ability to think and work with the group in terms of thePlan. He grasps eventually that in relation to humanity, the planning of theHierarchy falls into certain definite phases of activity—all of them related andall of them tending towards the externalisation of the Plan in any particularcentury, cycle or world period. These phases are:1. The phase of Purpose , originating in Shamballa and registered by the seniorMembers of the Hierarchy.2. The stage of hierarchical Planning . This is the formulation of the Purposein terms of possibility, immediacy, appropriateness and the availability of thedisciples, plus the energies to implement the Plan.3. Next comes Programme , wherein the Plan is taken up by the particular ashraminvolved in its implementation and is then reduced to the formative stages ofhuman impression and direction, the conditions necessary to bring about itsemergence, and the two phases of this conditioning. These are usually in twoparts; i.e., the destruction of all hindrances and the presentation of the Plan.4. The emergence of the hierarchical Pattern (based upon the recognition ofpurpose, careful planning and a detailed and carefully thought-out programme),both in the minds of the disciples in the Ashram who are involved in theimplementation of the Plan, and among the intelligentsia on Earth. These twogroups have the task—the first group consciously and the other unconsciously—ofbringing the pattern of things to be into the mass consciousness, by no means aneasy task, as the present state of world affairs demonstrates.5. Then comes the final phase of Precipitation , when all the subjective workhas been done on the basis of possibility, and when the pattern and a part ofthe programme are recognised by the world thinkers in every nation, either [362]favourably or with antagonism. The planning, having reached this final stage,then proceeds under its own momentum.These are some of the ideas which lie behind the particular hint which I havegiven to you, as far as the disciple is concerned. According to his developmentand his point in evolution, so will be his emphasis; some disciples can aid theMaster in the planning process because they are becoming sensitive to impressionby Shamballa; others are engrossed in the formulation of the programme and inimparting some of its features to more limited disciples, thus setting them towork. A group of carefully chosen disciples are always held in the Hierarchy towork solely with the pattern; this is a most important phase of the work,requiring a spirit of synthesis and an ability to hold streams of hierarchicalenergy under control. Disciples who are not so advanced, and who are thereforecloser to human thinking at the particular moment in history, undertake tosupervise the precipitation of the Plan. Their work is necessarily far moreexoteric, but is most responsible, because it is when the Plan has reached thestage of human implementation that error is apt to arise and mistakes can occur.In every ashram are to be found those disciples whose task it is to make theneeded readjustments of the pattern and the demanded changes in the programme asthe process of precipitation goes forward. It is a law that human freedom maynot be infringed. The staging of the Plan and its working out is, in the lastanalysis, an entirely human affair, once it has reached the stage ofprecipitation. It is dependent upon the responsiveness of human brains, andtheir recognition of need and its sources. This is a point which should beremembered.The above short explanation of the implications of a hint, and particularly ofHint Two should show you how rich is the area or the atmosphere of a hint—if Imay use such peculiar phrasing; it will show you also how hints are largelyconcerned with ashramic duty. [363]THE FORMULASAll that I have done hitherto in connection with the presented formulas has beento give you five of them and to indicate the nature of the sixth, which is notto be given. It is all that I can at this time do. I would, however, like tosummarise here what I have already given, because of the major importance of thetheme.I gave you certain definitions of a formula which it is necessary to repeat.They are not many, but they indicate a phase of hierarchical working and oftraining in a certain definite esoteric technique which is essential for everyworker in an Ashram to grasp. This, therefore, concerns you.I also covered their description and significance in two ways: the firstconcerned their application to the disciple and to his ashramic life andservice, and the second had reference to the more universal and general meaning.We can therefore sum up what has been given in a threefold manner and provide aclosely integrated yet widely useful approach to these fundamental formulas. Iam thus provided with the background of what I feel the need of saying to you onthese formulas:I. The Formulas Defined.1. They are second ray presentations of soul ideas. Essentially, they aregeometrical forms, lying behind all exoteric manifestations; even when presentedas words or phrases they are susceptible of being reduced to definite forms.They are building patterns.2. They express significance and intention. To the disciple and the initiate whoemploys them correctly and with understanding, they indicate energy direction asa definite part of the creative work which emanates constantly from the world ofsouls, from the Kingdom of God and from the Hierarchy. They are rightly orientedenergy patterns.3. They are related to the world of meaning and are the esoteric symbols to befound behind all exoteric [364] forms. They veil that which is in process ofbeing revealed. They are revealing patterns.4. They contain or veil the six prerequisites for initiation, and are thereforesix in number. They indicate the six relationships or the six intermediatestages of consciousness to be found between initiations. They have uniquereference to the pattern of the initiate-consciousness.5. They are definitely formulas of integration, both universal and individual.They present certain great creative patterns connected with the integration oflesser forms into a greater whole.6. They are related to the entire process of death. Death—from the angle of theformulas—is the integration of the essential being in all forms with the patternwhich produced its exoteric manifestation. They concern the discovery of thepattern.II. The Formulas from the angle of Discipleship.Formula 1 . . . Concerns integration into the Ashram; it concerns the“revelation of group feeling.” It is related to sensitivity and conditions thelife of the Ashram.Formula 2 . . . Concerns alignment in the three worlds with the soul. It isrelated primarily to the higher alignment between the Personality and theSpiritual Triad, via the antahkarana. It conditions the whole spiritual man.Formula 3 . . . Concerns the soul and the egoic lotus. It is related to thetransfer of soul energy into the antahkarana, producing conscious awareness oftime and space in terms of the Eternal Now. Right interpretation of this formulagives insight into the past and into the Law of Cause and Effect; it also givesintelligent appreciation of present opportunity as well as an intuitiveperception of [365] the future possibilities which confront the Hierarchy.Formula 4 . . . Concerns dynamic energy and is the basis of the true Laya-Yoga;this yoga deals ever with the point within the circle and its relation to otherpoints which condition the evolutionary process.Formula 5 . . . Concerns the Will and is related to divine purpose. Itconditions the establishing of all correct relationships.Formula 6 . . . Concerns the processes of death which have a most definiteeffect upon already established relationships. It concerns life-transference andhas relation to the presentation of opportunity.III. The Formulas from the universal creative Aspect.Formula 1 . . . The transition from darkness to Light. Creation in the Light.Formula 2 . . . Transition from the unreal to the Real. The nature of reality.Creation in time and space as understood in the three worlds.Formula 3 . . . Transition from death to Immortality. The nature of Life. Thecreative process and life energy.Formula 4 . . . Transition from chaos to ordered Beauty. Relation of the worldof effects and the world of meaning. Then relation to the world of causes. Thenature of karma. Progressive evolutionary creation.Formula 5 . . . Transition from the individual consciousness to the universal.Evolutionary processes from divine Purpose into plan and then intomanifestation. The nature of individual renunciation. The one Life.Formula 6 . . . Transition from cyclic living into life itself. The Purpose ofcycles. Control of time-space consciousness.[366] Two major ideas emerge from a careful study of these three tabulations:Pattern and Transition. It is upon these two that I would ask you to reflectconstantly. In past years, I have frequently called your attention to thenecessity of a vital and active programme, formulated by you and self-initiatedby you, and therefore, in these tabulations, you have much that can throw lightupon that necessity and upon the lines along which the programme should go; youmust remember ever that the programme of a disciple and of an ordinary aspirantare not in any way identical.Programme will—if followed with spiritual exactitude—reveal your soul-intendedlife pattern and this will be an expression of a life purpose . This summationof a disciple’s life is also the summation of the life of the Lord of the World,Whose self-initiated programme, implemented by evolutionary energy and steadilyrevealing the “pattern of things to come” is increasingly known as an expressionof the divine initial purpose.The section upon formulas is perhaps the most exacting in the series ofinstructions I am now giving you, for it involves creative thinking, intuitiveinsight, and the use of the spiritual will; these three activities arerelatively new to the aspirant and present as yet great difficulties. These youwill have to think out for yourselves, and thus acquire the training which willenable you to see life in the process of producing great formulas of livingwhich, in their turn, will produce the essential creative patterns.There is nothing more that I need to say on this subject. Later teaching on thematter will be available next century. I have already given you more than youcan understand, but not more than you can begin slowly to study and eventuallyto comprehend by direct programme-forming in your own life, and making it at thesame time an essential part of the programme of the Ashram with which you findyourself affiliated. This you will have to do through self-devised formulas,thus producing a life-pattern which will be indicative to the watching Mastersas to the point in evolution attained by the disciples. [367]POINTS OF REVELATIONIt might here be noted by you, as we consider this entire subject of revelationfrom the angle of the initiate, that (in the initiatory process where thedisciple is concerned) revelation is simply one way of expressing the constantlyrecurring effects of pressure forward and of vision. Throughout the entireevolutionary process there is essentially nothing but a growing revelation. Thetwo terms, Evolution and Revelation, go together. Any distinction lies withinthe field of revelation or—to word it otherwise—within the various planes ofconsciousness, and particularly that in which the revelation is taking place.Earlier I said that “the next sequential revelation will be that of creativity,of the world of thoughtforms which humanity as a whole has created and thesetting in motion—by humanity and in relation to its own destiny—of the Law ofCause and Effect or Karma. This will take us back into the very night of timeand demonstrate the hope of the present era.”Revelation is both formless and also within form, and the closer to realisation,the more subtle and devoid of form will be the revelation. This is, of course, aplatitude of which you are well aware but it needs renewed recognition. Again,there is necessarily, in revelation, always the concept of Light and that whichit reveals. Light on the physical plane produces the organ of vision, the eyethrough which revelation of physical areas of consciousness becomes possible;the same theme of light runs through the analogous process by means ofsynchronising instruments upon all planes; nevertheless the physical concept ofinstrument falls increasingly into the background, and other words take itsplace as we deal with higher areas of consciousness: Recognising Perception.Interpreting Perception. Spiritual Perception. Decisive Perception. These termswill suffice to convey to the disciple the nature of the recognitions which herenders to the revelation that unfolds before him, once he is an initiate withinthe Ashram and is changing his apparatus of perception from the tangible one ofthe three worlds (tangible because [368] within the world of forms) to thehigher correspondences which he must use in the future.It is at the sixth Initiation of Decision that Perception and Recognition of therevelation reach their heights for the initiate. After this, the subtlercorrespondences to the tangible senses of taste and smell begin definitely todemonstrate, but with them we shall not deal, for they are effects of revelationso far removed from the possible achievement of the majority of the Masters thatthey concern us not; they are more properly related to the unfoldingconsciousness of Those Who function in the Council Chamber of Shamballa. Humanevolution or the human evolutionary process is entirely concentrated around thesense of sight, with its consequent effects and results of vision, recognitionand perception—all of them constituting what we mean when we speak ofrevelation.This revelation can be—as I said—either in form or formless; it can be apictorial symbol or a subtle demonstration; it can be expressed only in words,or it can take the form of wordless recognition; it can be a goal or a futuresensed possibility, but it can also be an incentive and the dynamic impulse ofthe initiate’s life because it is not distant but is a real aspect of his divineequipment—I know not how else to express these possibilities to you, mybrothers. It is with these aspects of revelation that we are here dealing,because they are strictly aspirational developments and are available as aresult of ashramic training and of hierarchical initiation.I would remind you that in all that I am giving you in this series ofinstructions I am dealing with hierarchical initiations and not with thoseadvanced stages of unfoldment which are referred to when the subject of theChrist arises or of those times when He is spoken of as the Teacher of theAngels. Let us keep our thinking and its resultant aspiration in the realm ofhuman possibilities. I would have you note the distinction that can be madebetween the aspiration which precedes thought and which presupposes an emotionalorientation to light and revelation, and that which is the consequence ofthought and which is the seed of an oriented perception [369] of that which liespermanently within the consciousness of the Hierarchy.As we consider these revelations, I would like to take them up with you from asomewhat new angle; I would ask you to remember that the concept of Light mustalways be established by you mentally , alongside that of the revelation itself.I would ask you also to remember that I am dealing with revelations which are nolonger true revelations, because they have been formulated by the initiates oftoday and made visible in words. Revelation is therefore, as far as you areconcerned, of two kinds:1. Those that have been recognised and perceived in the past and (consequently)have been “reduced to words”—using the phrase in its occult and limitingsignificance.2. Those that are as yet unrevealed to any except those who have taken thefourth initiation. The three points of revelation (indicated by me) can usefullybe related by you to the first three initiations, though they necessarily havean interpretation appropriate to all the initiations.Let me express for you here—in their briefest form—the four points of Revelationalready indicated, and then “in the Light” let us consider them as suggestedearlier.1. Energy follows thought and the eye directs the energy.Involves the physical plane.Relates to the first initiation.Concerns the ajna centre and the so-called third eye.2. The will is an expression of the Law of Sacrifice.Involves the astral plane.Relates to the second initiation.Concerns the heart centre, the “advancing point of Light.”3. The Monad is to the planetary Logos what the third eye is to man. [370]Involves the mental plane.Relates to the third initiation.Concerns the head centre, the light of Purpose.4. Purpose itself is only an energy, released within the confines of the CouncilChamber. There it must take shape.Involves the buddhic or intuitional plane.Relates to the fourth initiation.Concerns the throat centre. Light upon the Path.There follows next the fifth revelation, which is as follows:5. When the light of the seven Rays is blended with that of the seventh Ray,then light supernal can be known.Involves the atmic plane.Relates to the fifth and sixth initiations.Concerns the alta major centre. Extra-planetary light.You will see therefore, brother of mine, how very abstruse these apparentlysimple statements anent revelation can be. As I have formulated them above, theyindicate the revelation in its primary and initiatory individual recognition;the meaning is, however, far greater than appears, and is in reality related tothe unfolding purpose of the planetary Logos, involving the planetary Council.All that I have here given you in connection with the seven centres (if broughtinto relation with all that I have given you in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire ) willafford you some general idea of the various planetary significances. This I havepersonally no time to do, even if it were desirable, but it will be obvious thatwhat I have indicated along the line of correspondences must be true, for theancient truism “as above, so below” holds eternally good, and it is the task ofthe Hierarchy to demonstrate this. The relation of the microcosm to themacrocosm can never be broken, and that relationship is deeply involved in thesefive points of revelation.[371] It has been occultly stated that:“The five points of the five-pointed star are pyramids of ascension and, at thesummit of each point—hidden within the emanating rays—lies a point ofrevelation, offsetting the radiation but preserving the deeply seated magnetism.Thus is there symbolised the going forth, the coming back and the point ofpeace, surrounded by activity.”I will endeavour (as we consider these points of revelation) to express as faras may be this relationship of the smaller to the great, of the part to thewhole, and of the five points of spiritual contact upon the physical plane(outlets for the energy generated in the planetary centres) with the sum totalof the means of expression. These centres are brought into expression—as far asthe points of revelation are concerned—at their respective initiations:1. The ajna centre.2. The heart centre.3. The head centre.4. The throat centre.5. The alta major centre.I say not that these five exits for planetary energy are the planetary centres,for they are not; I say that they are the points through which the energy of aplanetary centre is directed in the service of humanity at this particular time.The centres of the planetary Logos are necessarily directed in their inflow andoutflow from Shamballa; they are expressions of the Purpose underlying thecreative evolutionary process. The five corresponding exits are those which, inthis cycle, disperse the energy—generated by the Hierarchy, under theinspiration of the divine Purpose and directed towards the carrying out of thePlan.It is wise to remember that the Plan is as much of the divine Purpose as can bebrought into expression upon the planet—under the Law of Evolution and thetension of this [372] planetary crisis through which we are passing at thistime—or at any one time or particular epoch in time and space. Let us nowconsider these points of revelation so as to gain from them some realunderstanding:The First Point of Revelation: Energy follows thought and the eye directs theenergy.We are not dealing here with the simple statement that thought power is anenergy and that the process of thinking generates automatically an energy whichproduces objective forms, induces related action, and is the source therefore ofall that appears or manifests. That is a platitude today, and humanity isincreasingly aware of the subjective power of thought and of itsconsequences—objective realisation. We are to concern ourselves with that whichlies behind the mental perception of the ordinary man and with the revelationwhich comes to the initiate disciple as he stands within the ashram andperceives—as a result of the initiatory process—the nature of the divine Plan,as it can be seen working out on various planes of our planetary existence.There are three things which the initiate notes as the new panorama unfolds inflashing light before him:1. The point of tension which precedes revelation. There is much to beconsidered in relation to tension as the forerunner of initiation and itssubsequent revelation.2. The stillness by which the revealing vision is surrounded, if I may soinadequately express the idea. The revelation is given to the initiate as ifthere was nothing in all the world but himself (a point of tension) and a vortexof force which takes form before his eyes, revealing to him an inevitable butfuture activity.3. The level upon which the revelation (apprehended at the highest possiblepoint of consciousness for the initiate) must eventually be materialised orbrought into being.Initiation is always taken on levels of consciousness higher [373] than themental, and the initiate must not only realise the significance of therevelation but must also know the sphere of activity of which it will be theinspiration. I would have you ponder on the wording of this last sentence.Each of the five points of revelation indicates to the initiate: procedure,location and objective. Each is therefore susceptible of many and variedinterpretations; these are dependent upon the initiatory status of the disciple.With these we cannot deal, because it would entail the writing of anothercomplete treatise and this would also be largely incomprehensible to theuninitiated reader. I can, however, give you some ideas anent the five points ofrevelation which I have indicated, leaving your intuition to wrestle with theirimport—or leaving it to your imagination if the intuition is not yet creativelyactive; it must always be remembered that the imagination is the seed of theintuition, because that which is not existent somewhere within our apparentlycomplex planetary system cannot be imagined.In connection with the aphorism that energy follows thought, I would have yourelate this concept to the Science of Impression, bearing ever in mind that theMasters of the Wisdom work in three ways as They endeavour to implement thedivine Plan:1. They formulate, deliberately and in line with Their fixed intention, thosethoughtforms which must be “impressed” upon the substance of the level ofconsciousness desired.2. These living forms of thought are then occultly energised and become centresof energy or reservoirs of energy, with the original thoughtform as the creativesource at the centre. These thoughtforms and this generated energy are heldsteady within the aura of the Master or of a group of Masters.3. The energy is then projected on to a particular plane or into the mindconsciousness of those disciples who are en rapport with the Master, or of thosegroups of disciples or aspirants who are working in close association with somehierarchical group. If I say to you that the initiated disciple uses the ajnacentre, I am only stating a partial [374] truth; many of the Masters workthrough no physical or etheric mechanism whatsoever, but utilise what might betermed “a point of projection” within the ashram; this is a point of sevenfoldcontact, available at all times for the use of all those initiates who havetaken the third initiation. They work consequently from that high place withinthe Hierarchy and do not need to employ the ajna centre or any other centrewithin the etheric body. Writing as I am, for disciples and initiates who havenot yet taken the third initiation and who are still “confined” within physicalvehicles, the information that the “eye directs the energy” is sure and far moreeasily understood.From the angle of our studies, the revelation accorded to the initiate relatesto the carrying forward of the divine Plan upon the physical plane and to theimplementation of the will of Shamballa, through the medium of disciples andaspirants and of advanced humanity, working—consciously or unconsciously—in ourmodern world.Down upon the level of daily living, disciples are today learning three things:the Technique of Impression, the generating of energy, and the use of the ajnacentre. Many are responsive to impression, but fail to recognise or use theenergy of which the impression is simply the forerunner; others respond to theenergy, but fail to register the Plan which it is intended to implement, and theenergy then leads to great but fruitless activity. Still others are learning touse the centre between the eyebrows, standing as silent and poised recipientscontrolling the third eye, the directing agent of the received energy. It mustbe carefully borne in mind that the energy to be used is not the energy whichthe disciple himself generates or his own life force, but is somethingdifferent, something which he has received from the Hierarchy and of which he issimply the agent or channel. He has therefore to learn to distinguish betweenthe various energies he contacts. The initiate has to master the techniques ofdifferentiating between:1. His own energy or energies, which have been generated [375] as the result ofhis life experiences down the ages or centuries.2. His ray energy which, rightly used, conditions his work with and for theHierarchy.3. The energy of the ashram of which he may avail himself in the process ofcarrying out activities—initiated by impression. In the early stages he callsthis the energy of his Master, but learns later that it is—in reality—the energygenerated by his Master’s group, the ashram.4. Hierarchical energy or the energy of certain associated ashrams or of theentire group of Ashrams, the Hierarchy itself. The use of this highly qualifiedand most potent energy can only be employed when the disciple has earned theright to certain privileges and can be trusted to use the potencies correctly.5. The energy of the Head of the Hierarchy, or the Christ force, as it issometimes called. This force imports into the usually available energies certainconditioning qualities which emanate from Shamballa, and are therefore relatedto the will aspect. This type of force has not hitherto been available toworking disciples but is now available, having been released at the WesakFestival of this year (1948). Even now it can be used only by highly trusteddisciples, and usually by those only whose rays are the first Ray of Power orWill or the second Ray of Love-Wisdom. These will be the rays of one or other ofthe two major vehicles—that of the soul and that of the personality. There arenaturally exceptions to this rule, and these exceptions will be increasinglynumerous as time speeds by; but in the present time, first and second rayvehicles provide the line of least resistance.The first Point of Revelation has necessarily an unique relation to the physicalplane, to the hierarchical workers in physical bodies, and to those whoconsciously use the ajna centre. The number of those who can work with theenergy of thought is now very great, because so many hundreds of thousands havetaken the first initiation. This becomes clear when you realise the untoldnumbers of those who are definitely [376] oriented towards the light, who arespiritually motivated and are consciously trying to tread the Path or—to expressthe idea in Christian phraseology—to follow the footsteps of Christ. They mayknow nothing of the occult teaching or of esoteric techniques, but thediscipline of their lives and their realised fixed intention and service bringthem inevitably, eventually, on to the occult way. They are learning to think;they earnestly seek to know the right way for humanity, and desire to ascertainthe will of God; they are therefore building thoughtforms and are developing thepower to be impressed. At present, they appear to be putting the cart before thehorse, and they need to learn to think after impression; but this the spread ofthe various meditative processes will eventually correct. Later, the directingpotency of the ajna centre (the centre between the eyebrows) will attract theirattention and the triple process of impression, thoughtform construction, andenergy direction will be mastered by them, and the first point of revelationwill no longer be a revelation; they will be committed to an intelligentimplementing of the Plan upon the physical plane.The Second Point of Revelation: The Will is an expression of the Law ofSacrifice.The second Point of Revelation is of peculiar interest. It concerns the firstcontact of the initiated disciple with the energy emanating from Shamballa andtransmitted to him via the Master of the Ashram with which he is at this timeassociated. He has not yet reached the stage wherein direct contact ispermitted, but still needs the ashramic protection which the Master provides. Atthe indicated second initiation he receives a quality of stimulation whichenables him to “see” the astral plane as it essentially is ; with thisrevelation comes also the recognition of the basic human necessity to “make itholy” or to “render whole” that which provides the most disturbing element inthe existence of mankind.[377] I cannot here deal with psychic construction, with astral impulses orglamours, nor can I spend time referring to the usual astral conditions—so wellknown and so carefully followed by the mass of men. Each human being haseventually to make his own definite decision anent the astral plane and hisrelease from its control, and has then to follow (for several lives) a policy ofnon-association with its phenomena. But the initiate-disciple receives an uniquerevelation and an applied conditioning which enable him to recognise it as aman-created whole or world or state of consciousness (whichever term you maycare to employ) and therefore as something which must be transformed. Two thingsconsequently emerge in his consciousness:1. That the astral plane is not God-created, or divinely “inspired,” but is theproduct of human desire, evinced at the very dawn of human intelligence; thisdesire has built thoughtforms which are in tune or allied to every phase ofhuman desire from the lowest type of physical desire up to the spiritualaspiration of the man who is seeking liberation. What can the disciple,therefore, do to make the astral plane “holy” or “set apart” and segregated fromthe sum total which the Divine Thinker, Sanat Kumara, has created, and withwhich the desires of mankind—through the medium of the astral world—have,fortunately for the individual man, become entangled? At this point, he knowsthat he must, inevitably and eventually, contribute something. He realises thathe must intelligently work towards the separation of the astral plane from thesix planes of divine creation. I would ask you to remember, brother of mine,that the star of creation is the six-pointed star and not a seven-pointed star.2. As the needed service which must be rendered takes possession of the heartand mind of the initiate, the method is simultaneously revealed to him. Thismethod is the use of an “advancing point of light”; it is, however, a form oflight which can only be implemented by the wil l ; this will can only fullycomplete its task when all three [378] aspects of the will—as exemplified in thethree points of the Spiritual Triad—have all been sequentially employed.You can see, therefore, how different is the revelation which comes to theinitiate than are those which the average aspirant and disciple regard asastounding revelations. Their sense of values is in error. There is a groupservice quality to the revelation with which we are dealing, and also aboutthese five stages of revelation, which is unknown until the antahkarana has beencreated, thus linking the Spiritual Triad and the Personality. The energy thento be used is entirely related to the Will aspect of divinity. This does notdemonstrate as it does with average advanced humanity, as applied goodwill, butit expresses itself as a dynamic destructive spiritual Will; it adds its quotaof destroying energy to the task of destruction with which the Hierarchy isconfronted in connection with the astral plane.This Point of Revelation brings with it certain revelations of an unexpectednature and imparts to the initiate certain new and significant results whichregister as truths to the initiate-consciousness. He discovers that he mustlearn the divine nature of the destroying aspect of the Will; he learns that itis not related, when demonstrating as this particular aspect, to determinationor fixed intention, but is a fluid energy which can be directed toward the planeof desire wherever and whenever contacted; he finds out also that, in order tocombat this vast and vibrant astral world, an aspect of light must be employed,and that therefore he is being given his first opportunity to work with Lightunder the inspiration of the Will—as do all the Members of the Hierarchy; herealises, consequently, that he must employ this aspect of light under theaction—definitely directed—of the Will, in order to bring about thedisappearance of that world as a sentient conscious entity; he knows that hemust primarily destroy the astral phenomena for which he is creativelyresponsible, and that (having done this) he must demonstrate his completefreedom from the phenomenal contact of the astral plane at the second, the thirdand the fourth initiations. [379] This he must do through the “advancing light”of lower mental substance, and the activity of the buddhic level of activity;then to this he adds the destroying power of the atmic level of activity. He hasto take note, in this process, of a certain level of responsibility. Thus he canfinally destroy (with the means of the advancing light of the atmic plane) acertain proportion of astral substance for which he is not individuallyresponsible but which is nevertheless related to the group or to the nation withwhich he is by birth or inclination affiliated. It is the united and syntheticuse of the three triadal expressions of energy which makes the work of the worldservers effective.You can see from this short résumé which I have given you about the results ofthe second point of revelation, how widely comprehensive is the entire theme ofrevelation as it implements, impulses and motivates hierarchical activity.Through those revelations the initiate-disciple becomes aware of the task whichhe must fulfil and the next immediate step which humanity must take—through oneor other of its grouped masses. These revelations concern the use of the Will inimplementing the evolutionary aspect of the divine purpose. In all these pointsof revelation the Spiritual Triad is involved, and every one of the revelationsis—in a steady crescendo of illumination—the result of initiation.All the five points of revelation are conveyed or make their impression at eachinitiation, but differ greatly according to the initiation taken. The use of theWill aspect in “making holy” or in “setting apart,” is active not only at thesecond initiation, but in all of them and—in a peculiar sense—at the sixthInitiation of Decision; of this initiation the six-pointed star is the symbol.The decision there involved tests the initiate as to how free he is from alldesire—a factor which impregnates the entire creative world. Freedom from thatcontrol indicates the recognition of the Will as an expression of the Law ofSacrifice.The Christian interpretation of the Will of God and of the significance ofsacrifice is based, in reality, on human revolt and on human refusal to seeanything in the spiritual life but an unintelligent acceptance of theinscrutable divine [380] Will; it posits also the need for pain and thesuffering of sacrifice in the sense of complete abnegation of all that might beregarded as good and useful, as desirable and joyful. This revolt has colouredthe entire presentation of what Christian theologians regard as God’s Will; thispresentation involves the unavoidable imposition of the will of a transcendentalDeity, and leads inevitably (though totally inconclusively) to the dreadful andsymbolic death of the Christ upon the Cross and to the painful and sacrificiallife of the spiritual man. There is much teaching given out by the church uponthe necessity of the submission of the human will to the divine Will; however,little or no teaching is given of the joyous use of the Will of Christ, immanentin every form, and peculiarly active in the form of humanity, and thereforecapable of joyous and understanding use. The idea that sacrifice signifieshappiness and a joyful process of making desire “holy” is absent; theologiansrefuse to recognise that the releasing of the energy confined and imprisonedupon the astral plane, into “enlightened” service upon other planes, is neithercomprehended nor in any way understood.The concept of substance runs through all that is here given; the atrophying ofthe substance of the astral plane, the merging of “lightened” substance withthat of other planes, the use of the substance of light as a medium of spiritualdestruction, and the bringing in of the three types and qualities of thesubstance of the Spiritual Triad (in order to liberate humanity) is never noted.Nevertheless, these three types of substance (mental, buddhic and atmic) are allsymbolised for us upon the Mount of Crucifixion. There are also far deepermeanings to the well-known Gospel symbolism than those which have beenrecognised or studied.I have here, however, thrown some light upon this second point of revelation,and much upon which you could well ponder and reflect.PART IXYou will find it of value, brother of mine, to summarise the mass of informationwhich I have given anent Initiation; [381] I refer not only to that which iscontained within these particular instructions but to that which is to be foundwithin all the many books which I have written. Isolated statements andinteresting details are really of no major importance. It is the entire generalpicture and the recognition of the place of initiation in the evolutionaryscheme which should engage your attention. Earlier in these instructions Ipointed out to you that meditation was a planetary technique; in the same way,initiation may be regarded as indicative of successive planetary consummationsmarking, for instance, the birth of each of the kingdoms in nature; initiationis, par excellence, a series of graded steps or awakenings which enable thehuman being to become eventually a member, or a point of light, in the Kingdomof God. When an adequate number of members of the fourth kingdom have undergonethe process of initiation (technically understood), then the fifth kingdom willcome into exoteric manifestation. The method of making this hitherto subjectivekingdom a factual entity is rapidly nearing, and the proof of this is—for thefirst time in history—group initiation . This can now be undertaken, and it isfor this that the Hierarchy is working today, where aspirants and disciples areconcerned.The problem of group initiation must be, I know, one of difficulty for you toconsider. Many questions must naturally arise. Can, for instance, the faults ofa disciple keep the group back from initiation? The answer is no. The result ofthe dominant shortcomings of the members of the group being prepared forinitiation only serves to eliminate them from the group temporarily , but itdoes not thereby hold back the group. The group moves forward through the doorwhen all the necessary eliminations have taken place, and also when the grouphas developed certain capacities—as a whole and mutually. Let me specify some ofthese capacities, but without going into detail:1. The capacity to be outward looking and interested in the reactions of lifeand of events upon humanity .2. The steady tendency towards decentralisation, so that the personal self ishandled with a just sense of proportion [382] but is not regarded as thedominant factor in the daily life.3. As a result of this decentralisation the aspirant grows increasingly towardsa more complete fusion with the group. He knows himself to be an integral partof the group and with all that such a relationship involves.4. He is becoming every day more integrated. This integration is a fourfold one:a. His personality, in its various aspects, is integrated into one functioningwhole.b. He is achieving a pronounced relationship with the soul, and for this reasonis becoming a soul-infused personality.c. As a worker for humanity, he is blending always more closely with the groupin training, and is becoming an integral part of it through similarity of aims,spiritual aspiration and trained techniques.d. He is slowly being integrated into the very heart of humanity; this puts himin touch with the Heart of the Hierarchy and—through the Hierarchy—energies fromthe Heart of the Sun can reach him.5. He indicates a growing sensitivity to all that is spiritually esoteric(forget not that there is an esotericism which is not spiritual, but which isstrictly related to black magic); his inner hearing and his eye of vision arerapidly being brought into an occult focus.These are simply some of the capacities unfolded by the individual aspirantand—if you study them with care—you will realise that they are of fundamentalimportance. It is the fusion of all these capacities in group work which enablesthe group to seek initiation and to be welcomed through the slowly opening doorby Those Who are to be found upon the other side.Another question which might well be asked is: Do all the members of the grouphave to be at the same point upon the Path of Discipleship, or can they be atmany differing [383] stages of discipleship or initiation? What you really meanwhen you ask this question is: Is the group—composed as it is ofindividuals—taking the same initiation? Are all its members at exactly the samepoint in evolution? By no means. A group should be (and is) composed ofindividuals at varying points of development; some may be preparing for thesecond initiation; others may be in training for the third initiation, and a fewmay be ready for the fourth or the fifth initiation. The nature of theinitiation to be undergone is known only to the disciple and his Master; it isof no interest to the group itself; the diversity of the initiations for whichpreparation is being made tends to enrich the group content; the more ray typeswhich are found functioning in the group, the more valuable will be its service.It is the bringing together of groups in preparation for initiation which hasled to the present basic change in the methods of the Hierarchy. Awould-be-initiate does not, at first, work solely under the care of the Masterof a particular Ashram. Certain of the Masters (usually Masters like myself whohave only lately passed through the fifth initiation) have been chosen to trainand instruct aspirants on all the rays until after the third Initiation ofTransfiguration.Then and only then does the disciple-initiate pass into the Ashram of the Masterof his ray— one of the senior Masters in connection with the seven majorAshrams. If he is a disciple in the Ashram of a Master Who is on one of the Raysof Attribute, the task of that Master is to prepare him for transition on to oneof the major Rays of Aspect. This shifting and interchange is taking place allthe time. When, for instance, the Master R. assumed the task of Mahachohan orLord of Civilisation, His Ashram was shifted from the seventh Ray of CeremonialOrder to the third Ray of Active Intelligence; the majority of those who havetaken the second and the third initiations were transferred with Him under whatmight be called a “special dispensation”; the rest of the members of His Ashramremained for tuition and training in service under that Master Who took Hisplace as the central point of the seventh ray Ashram.Still another question could well be asked: What is the [384] attitude of thegroup during initiation if the individual members are undergoing differentinitiations? Is the group integrity imperiled? During the period of initiation,their attitude is one of focussed, concentrated and deep meditation in which theinner attitude is given solely to the concept of Hierarchy . The disciple isnot, at this time, occupied with the Ashram of which he is a part or with anyquestionings as to the nature of the Ashram into which he is now entering as aninitiate—either as an initiate of the Earth initiations or, in the seniorgrades, as an initiate of the Sirian regime. He is—during the first fourinitiations—entirely centred in consciousness upon the larger Whole wherein theAshram to which he belongs is a part; he is attentive to the Christ, the Head ofthe Hierarchy, because He is the Initiator of the first two initiations whichalways seem to the neophyte of major importance. After the third initiation heis attentive to that “veiled Presence of awful Power Who tests his fitness forworking in the will of God.” I would ask you to note the peculiar phrasing“working in the will of God,” and to remember that that Will, centred orfocussed in Shamballa, is one of the great basic energies; the initiate has tolearn to work in and through that Will. If, therefore, each initiate in thegroup is conscious of the initiation next to be taken, then subconsciously heeliminates all awareness of outer contacts and stands alone, and yet in groupformation, before one or other of the two Initiators. The inflow of dynamicenergy which comes to him through the application of the Rod of Initiationbecomes a group inheritance and serves to galvanise, integrate and fuse thegroup into renewed activity and a deeper subjective union.There is one point which is oft overlooked, but which I gave to you earlier, andthat is the mental approach to initiation . So much emphasis has been laid uponthe love quality of the Hierarchy, on its being the expression of the seconddivine aspect, that the hierarchical mentality (if I may use such a phrase) isfrequently forgotten; yet it is a law—closely related to initiation—that “thework of the initiate is carried forward within the ring-pass-not of theUniversal Mind.” I [385] would have you give these words calm and matureconsideration.The planetary Logos works—as far as His manifestation, the Earth, isconcerned—from cosmic mental levels; all that is manifested through His CreativeWord is His focussed thought and His fixed mental intention. In order to createa material world, He directs His thought from what can be regarded as theconcrete levels of the cosmic mental plane; the whole process is one ofprecipitation, consolidation and irradiation.All the initiatory processes through which the disciple must pass are primarilyconcerned with the thought of the supreme, incarnating Deity; that thoughtdemonstrates as the will-to-good. The disciple’s progress from one initiation toanother imparts a gradual unveiling of the divine Purpose, as it expressesitself through the hierarchical Plan and manifests that quality of love (thewill-to-good) which gives to the Purpose and the Plan warmth, its magneticappeal, and the major attribute of healing. It might be said that the Purpose ofthe planetary Logos, as it emanates from His high place under the impact of Hiswill-to-good , is redemptive in nature.This theme of redemption (which underlies all the initiatory processes) ishidden in the karmic responsibilities of Sanat Kumara; stage by stage,initiation by initiation, the disciple arrives at an understanding ofredemption. First of all, he learns to bring about the redemption of histhreefold personality; then the concept enlarges along paralleling lines as heseeks the redemption of his fellowmen; later, he shares the redemptive workconnected with all true hierarchical endeavour and becomes an “active part of aredeeming Ashram.” At the later initiations, and after the fifth Initiation ofRevelation, he sees with a new clarity some of the karmic liabilities which haveled the planetary Logos to create this planet of suffering, sorrow, pain andstruggle; he realises then (and with joy) that this little planet is essentiallyunique in its purpose and its techniques, and that on it and within it (if youcould but penetrate below the surface) [386] a great redemptive experiment isgoing forward; its prime implementing factors and its scientific agents are the“sons of mind who choose to be the sons of men and yet for all eternity remainthe Sons of God.” These “sons of mind” were chosen, in that far distant timewhen the fourth kingdom in nature came into being, to carry forward the scienceof redemption. There is a true historical and spiritually esoteric significancein the words in The New Testament that the “whole creation groaneth andtravaileth together in pain until now, waiting for the manifestation of the Sonsof God.” St. Paul is there referring to planetary purpose and to the determinedinsistence of the Sons of God that eventually—as they brought about theredemption of substance, of matter and form, and thus proved the possibility ofthat redemption through their own transfigured personalities—their reward shouldbe their eventual manifestation as expressions of divinity. For this purpose andwith this goal in view, they instituted the great evolutionary process ofinitiation, thus producing a continuity of revelation and of enlightenment. Inreality, the period of time at which the final initiation is undergone is simplya climaxing, triumphant demonstration of the realisation and purpose of all pastexperiences; it is fulfilment (by the One Initiator) of the first promise evermade to the “sons of mind” when they originally started their redemptive work,and is “a sudden blazing forth of the individual glory and its merging atinitiation with the glory of the whole.”These ideas may give you a fresh viewpoint anent initiation, and if you canponder and think correctly, they will aid you in entering somewhat into the Mindof God, thus permitting you to penetrate at least into that “area of promise”upon which all spiritual hope, all expectancy and the dynamic intention behindthe evolutionary process depend. The “halls of initiation” (to speak again insymbols) in which the initiate demonstrates his redemptive quality are the true“promised land.” The whole story of the Jewish people is based upon arecognition of this fundamental truth; it is, however, distorted by them into aform of individual and racial possessiveness, owing to the profoundmaterialistic [387] selfishness of the race. They give to the entire, eternalhope (which is the hope of all the sons of mind) a material and racialdistortion and a purely material objective—the objective of territory. All thisis, in its turn, founded upon the arrogance, the aggressive nature and the lackof true perspective which are basic characteristics of the Jewish people, inspite of many exceptions .The “area of promise” wherein the divine thought is projected, directed and heldtrue to the originating impulse of the planetary Logos is to be found on cosmiclevels and remains there unchangeably. It is that which holds Sanat Kumara, inHis Council Chamber at Shamballa, standing steadfastly by all those lives whichare undergoing redemption and by all those who are the agents of the redemptiveprocess until “the last weary pilgrim has found his way home.” These agents arethe sons of men who will—each and all—demonstrate eventually “within the courtsof Heaven” and at the place of initiation, the nature of their high calling;they will prove to all who can grasp the significance of the demonstration thatthey have only “become again in full expression what they have always been.” Nowthe removal of the veils of matter permits the inner glory to shine forthand—the redemptive work now being finished—”they can walk with glory in creativeundertakings.” I am quoting some words which the Christ used (at an initiationheld not so long ago) when addressing a group of new initiates.ON HINTSWe will now proceed to a consideration of the hints which I have already givento you. They are seven in number. With two of them I have already dealt. Theywere:Hint I. . . . The changes brought about in the Hierarchy have been the result ofthe work of the disciples of the world.Hint II. . . . Human planning today is one of the first indications of theemergence of the will aspect.[388] Five hints remain to be considered, and I list them here, not in thequestion form as given earlier, but in their original wording. I would ask youto read them several times straight through with concentrated thought and tonote how closely they are related to each other, and how they cast a light uponthe initiatory process which is unique, synthetic in value and enlightening. AsI have told you, they are each of them subject to seven interpretations, but forour purposes we will confine ourselves to the study of them from the angle ofaccepted discipleship, i.e., of the disciples working in an Ashram and preparingfor service and for initiation.Hint III. . . . Disciples in all Ashrams have a task of “modifying, qualifyingand adapting the divine Plan” simultaneously. Why is this so? Why is the Plannot imposed ?Hint IV. . . . The initiate knows because he works. What does this hint mean toyou?Hint V. . . . The key to the correct interpretation of a hint lies in itsassociation with the idea of direction in time and space.Hint VI. . . . The disciple must recognise the hint which is related to hispoint in consciousness.... My one effort is to indicate the relation betweeninitiation and revelation.Hint VII. . . . One of the marks of readiness for initiation is the ability tosee the expanding and inclusive Whole, and to note the law which is transcendedwhen the part becomes the Whole.In connection with the sixth hint, I pointed out that revelation—induced byright orientation and right thinking—is part of the training of the initiate.Many thus in training delay their progress by not recognising the revelationwhen it arises above the line of their spiritual horizon.You will note that the hints themselves frequently deal with the nature of ahint, because a hint is in reality and when properly considered, the seed orgerm of an intended revelation. The Master knows well what is the nextrevelation [389] which will be in order for the disciple in training; throughhints He sows the seed of revelation, but it remains for the disciple todiscover that which the hint is intended to produce, and to nurture the seeduntil it flowers forth in the beauty of revelation.In seeking to elucidate these hints for you I am not doing work which you shoulddo. I am, in fact, only marshalling for your benefit the ideas, information andconcepts which are already to be found in your subconscious mind—placed therethrough meditation, study and experimental critical living. Having done that, Ileave it to you to proceed alone and unaided towards the moment of revelation.You talk of a series of initiations, but the Masters talk in terms of a seriesof revelations , and Their work with Their disciples is to prepare them forrevelation. Bear in mind, brother of mine, that revelation is hard to take andto hold—a point oft overlooked. It is exhausting to the personality of thedisciple, but it is of no service unless the personality recognises it; it isexcessively stimulating and the initiate passes through three stages where arevelation is concerned: First comes the stage of ecstacy and of supremerecognition; then darkness follows and almost despair when the revelation fadesand the disciple finds that he must walk again in the ordinary light of theworld; he knows now what is , but it is at this point that his test lies, for hemust proceed on that inner knowledge but dispense with the stimulation ofrevelation. Finally, he becomes so engrossed with his service, with aiding hisfellowmen and with leading them towards their next revelation that theexcitement and the reaction are forgotten. He then discovers to his surprisethat at any time and at will—if it serves his selfless interests—the revelationis forever his. Ponder on this.Let us now study the remaining hints:Hint Three. “Disciples in all the Ashrams have the task of `modifying,qualifying and adapting the divine Plan’ simultaneously. Why is this so? Why isthe Plan not imposed?”[390] You will note immediately the relation of this hint to the first onegiven. The concept of responsibility underlies the significance of this hint,and in connection with it I would remind you that—from the angle of the esotericscience—the sense of responsibility is the first and the outstandingcharacteristic of the soul. In so far, therefore, as a disciple is in contactwith the soul and is becoming a soul-infused personality, and is consequentlyunder soul direction, so far will he undertake the task presented to him in thisthird hint. The “modifying, qualifying and adapting” process is carried onthrough the medium of an intellectually focussed personality and is aided by thecomprehension of which the concrete mind is capable. It is a result of theactivity of the soul upon its own level and is related entirely to thehierarchical group intention and to the furthering of the divine Plan.The apprehension of this Plan by the disciple will necessarily vary according tothe disciple’s point in evolution. In the very early stages of discipleship, hiscapacity to “modify, qualify and adapt” is small indeed, but each expansion ofconsciousness fits him increasingly to do this. You would find it of interest tostudy again the stages of discipleship as outlined in Volume I of Discipleshipin the New Age. You would note how each stage (when it is a factual experience)enables the disciple to see the Plan from the angle of the Ashram and of theMaster with increasing clarity; finally, there comes the time when the disciplearrives at the very heart of things and is so close to the heart of the Masterthat the hierarchical planning becomes something in which he shares and to whichhe contributes.There are two thoughts which should be here considered. First of all it shouldbe realised that the disciple, under the Law, has to master the technique ofspiritual compromise, and secondly that the three words: modify, qualify andadapt, have definite reference to the three worlds wherein the Plan mustmanifest. There are two kinds of compromise, brother of mine. There is thecompromise in which the balance is attained for the sake of expediency, and thisis usually on the side of the least desirable, the more material and theeasiest. There is also the compromise which swings decision (and [391] decisionis always involved in the furthering of the Plan) over towards that whichconcerns the spiritual values, and which will eventually bring about thegreatest good for the greatest number. It is this art of compromise which thedisciple has to learn, for little is gained by the imposition of the spiritualvalues. The compromise to be established by the disciple lies between therecognition of the stage reached by average humanity and the immediate aspectsof the Plan which the Masters feel should be presented to, and recognised by,everybody.The value to the ashram of a trained and functioning disciple lies in hisability to “see with the Ashram” that activity which is required, and thetechnique and mode of bringing about still another development within theeternal Plan; to this must be added the disciple’s understanding of thecivilisation and the culture of which he is a part and a comprehension of thefield in which his endeavour must lie. Being a functioning human being and apart of the great panorama of life, he can interpret to the Ashram what he seesof extended evil, what he notes of humanity’s striving towards the good, and the“revealing voice” of the speechless masses; his suggestions as to the immediatemode of turning the hierarchical ideas into ordinary human ideals are ofimportance to the Master of his Ashram. His value in this aspect of thehierarchical work is that he is not a Master, that he is necessarily closer intouch with the daily life of ordinary human beings, and that the field of hisactivities is with personalities, whereas the Masters and the senior initiateswork with souls. When a disciple is a truly soul-infused personality, he cangive to the Master most valuable assistance. There are, it should be pointedout, three types of hierarchical workers:1. Souls; i.e., those initiates who have taken the fourth Initiation ofRenunciation and in whom the soul body, the causal body, has been destroyed.They are the Custodians of the Plan.2. Soul-infused personalities; these are the disciples and the initiates of thefirst three initiations, through [392] whom the “souls” work in the carrying outof the Plan.3. Intelligent aspirants who are not yet soul-infused personalities but whorecognise the necessity of the Plan and who seek the welfare of their fellowmen.The highest group formulates the Plan; the second group “modifies, qualifies andadapts” the Plan to contemporary human requirements and thus ensures the gradualand steady continuity of the Plan; the third group are the agents who carry thisPlan to mankind and seek to make it workable, guided by spiritual compromise—thecompromise evidenced by the second group.Disciples, as they grasp the Plan and are spiritually informed as to the stepsto be taken to modify the Plan upon the mental plane so that its acceptance byhumanity is intelligently progressive and is not dynamically imposed withconsequent disastrous effects, are the primary agents. They accept theresponsibility for the needed compromise, for it is their responsibility and notthe responsibility of the Masters. The various aspects of the Plan—as presentedto them in the Ashram—are then modified and rearranged so that the Plan becomesa series of sequential steps and is not the violent impact of an unrealisedidea. It might be said that the spiritual compromise of the disciple (workingwith the Plan) transforms the basic idea (through mental modification) into anacceptable ideal.When the process of modification is completed, the idea—in the form of anideal—descends to the astral plane, the plane of the emotions. There it becomestinctured with the quality which the working disciple believes will make thebest appeal to the masses of men with whom he may be working, and particularlyto the aspiring intelligentsia.Today two qualities are “tincturing” the ideal of the coming civilisation forwhich all disciples are working: Freedom and spiritual security. This is trueeven if the man who talks in terms of security omits the word “spiritual.” It isthat for which they nevertheless seek. Then later, the ideal, “duly modified andqualified” is presented to the world of [393] men upon the physical plane, isthere adapted to the differing fields of thought, to the diverse types ofconsciousness, and to the nations and groups with which the New Group of WorldServers is working. This triangle of workers is enfolded on all sides by theworld of souls and of men; its apex reaches to the highest levels of theHierarchy; its second point is anchored in the New Group of World Servers; itslowest point penetrates into the masses of men. You have, therefore:[Image00017.jpg]There is a straight line of spiritual descent from the Masters into the ranks ofmen, and—in the New Group of World Servers—the task of “modifying, qualifyingand adapting” is carried forward. Mistakes are often made, because this triplework is dependent upon clear vision and a balanced judgment, but in spite ofeverything, the work goes on and (in the long last) that which is the divineidea does emerge as an accepted ideal and, in due time, is the means of carryingthe entire human family onward along the Path of Evolution.Hint Four. “The initiate knows, because he works. What does this hint mean toyou?”The entire story of evolution is covered in these few words. The Christ put itin other words when He said “If any man shall do His will, he shall know”; underthe occult law, doing ever precedes knowledge because knowledge is gainedthrough experiment and experience. The disciple or aspirant works always in thedark, particularly in the [394] early stages of his unfoldment, following a deepand hidden instinct towards right activity. By that hard and persistentperformance of duty, under the pressure of conscience at first, under theimpulse of his awakening soul, and under the influences of the Master, he movesforward from darkness to light; he discovers that obedience to his spiritualinstincts leads him inevitably into the realm of knowledge, and thatknowledge—when acquired—is transformed eventually into wisdom. He then becomes aMaster and walks no longer in the dark.Aspirants usually bitterly resent the many cycles of darkness through which theyseem to go; they complain of the difficulty of working in the dark and of seeingno light anywhere; they forget that the ability to work in the dark or in thelight is all one inherent capacity. The reason for this is that the soul knowsnothing but being , and light and dark are—to the soul—one and the same thing.Above everything else, knowledge comes through conscious experiment, and wherethere is no experimental activity no experience can be gained. Knowledge is thereward of both these factors—a knowledge which is not theoretical but which isproven, factual, and the intelligent result of hard work; it is also the resultof frequent distress (rightly handled) and of spiritual anticipation.The above is true of the life and work of the individual aspirant as he tacklesthe problem of his own lower nature and prepares for the stage of becoming asoul-infused personality; it is true also of the working disciple, seekingknowledge and wisdom as he works out the hierarchical Plan as best he can. Hemust perforce experiment and gain practical experience; he must learn themeaning of both success and failure, and the knowledge which can be gainedthereby. Knowledge comes at first through the struggle to move forward intogreater and clearer light; then it comes as the aspirant (seeking soulexpression) learns to forget himself in the need of others as they demandwhatever light and knowledge he may possess; wisdom takes the place of knowledgewhen, in the transmuting fires of struggle, pain and [395] hard work, theaspirant transforms himself into the working disciple and is gradually absorbedinto the ranks of the Hierarchy.There are other and deeper meanings than the above, but I have here indicated toyou the way to fuller knowledge; the latent significance will inevitably revealitself, as you work through experiment and experience and from experience into amanifesting expression of divinity.Hint Five. “The key to the correct interpretation of a hint lies in itsassociation with the idea of direction in time and space.”I wonder, brother of mine, if you can realise that a hint is not a hint as longas it fails to give you direction and the power to move forward. A hint is not astatic point of information. Correctly approached, it becomes the dynamic,underlying next step forward upon the Path of Return. It is there that the words“in time and space” come to have significance. One of the first things which adisciple has to learn is correct timing, both as regards his own experimentalspiritual life and in relation to the work which he may be doing underhierarchical impression in the world of everyday affairs. It is one of thehardest lessons to learn, particularly during the stage wherein the disciple canbe easily swayed by impulsive, emotional enthusiasm; it is a peculiarly hardthing for people upon the sixth Ray of Idealism or Devotion to grasp.Disciples, in their novitiate, make more mistakes as regards time than anyother; that would naturally be expected, because time is only a word for daily,eventual living. I would have you note the word “eventual” in its connotationwith current events . Time is naught but a succession of events, as registeredby the physical brain consciousness; these events are apt to have undue and toopowerful an effect upon the disciple. Once, however, he can think of events asaspects of time, he not only begins to develop a needed continuity ofconsciousness, but he develops also a sense of proportion which has astabilising and sound effect. Students [396] would do well to take the words“direction in time and space” and use them as a seed thought in meditation. Thereward would be great.It is wise to remember that “space is an entity”—as H.P.B. expressed it. When heso defined space, he gave humanity one of the most important hints it has everreceived. The realisation of the existence of this entity leads to a practicalrecognition of the aphorism that “in Him we live and move and have our being.”It explains the necessity for the esoteric teaching anent planetary centres andthe planes as states of consciousness. The disciple then begins to study himselfin relation to this “all-enveloping Entity,” to ascertain the “direction” fromwhich the various energies (which empower his life and motivate his actions)come, and to familiarise himself gradually in “the location of these powerstations and of those radiant centres of light which—founded by the divineCreator—are the sources of life and the origin of light and knowledge.” Thus isit expressed in the ancient archives which, at times, I attempt to translate foryou.Direction. Time. Space. With these concepts in mind, occult information beginsto assume a new and deeply esoteric importance. They can be studied in two waysby the disciple (and it is for disciples I write):1. As indicating the direction in time and space from whence motivating energyand illumining love can make an impact upon the receptive disciple.2. As indicating (again in time and space) the direction in which the energies,manipulated by the disciple, must go as he learns to cooperate with, and workout, the hierarchical Plan. This is the positive and not the negative aspect ofthese words.The disciple moves always in a world of energies; they make an impact upon himfrom many and varying directions. He has to learn which energies should berejected and those to which he should be receptive; all these energies aremoving in space and are in reality the life-aspect of the space-entity; all aredetermined by the time factor with which the disciple [397] must familiarisehimself. On the other hand, the process is reversed at times. The disciplelearns to use energies—located and found by him in space—within a set time andthen to direct them accurately (via the ajna centre) into the work and into thegroup which is under hierarchical influence, through his own immediate efforts.Ponder on this, for in these words lies hid much illumination.The remaining two hints will be covered in my next communication, and then theteaching upon the Hints will be concluded. The teaching upon the Formulas wasconcluded in the earlier instruction because enough had been given anent theseabstruse forms to serve the purposes of instruction during the coming cycle.POINTS OF REVELATIONWe have already dealt with two of the points of revelation and have thereforeconsidered the two which have reference to the first two initiations; these aretaken upon the physical and the astral planes respectively. At the secondinitiation, the initiate begins for the first time (though in the mostelementary form) to employ the will aspect and—in the revelation accorded—hetakes a major step toward the third Initiation of the Transfiguration. Thisconnotes the transfiguration of the personality and its liberation from thealluring imprisonment of the three worlds. Now he faces that great transitionalinitiation and is confronted with the revelation which has been expressed for usin the following words:The Monad is to the planetary Logos what the third eye is to man .These are mysterious words and can only be understood if brought into relationwith the previous revelation, involving the Will and the Law of Sacrifice. Itshould be remembered that the Law of Sacrifice (in its destroying aspect) isdominant during the second, the third and the fourth initiations.1. At the second Initiation of the Baptism, the control of [398] the astral bodyis broken; it is sacrificed in order that the intuition, the higher counterpartof the “propelling aspiration” (as it is sometimes called) may assume control.2. At the third Initiation of Transfiguration, the control of the personality inthe three worlds is broken in order that the Son of Mind, the soul, may besubstituted finally for the concrete and hitherto directing lower mind. Again,through the Law of Sacrifice, the personality is liberated and becomes simply anagent of the soul.3. At the fourth Initiation of Renunciation, the destroying aspect of the Law ofSacrifice brings about the destruction of the causal body, the soul body, inorder that the unified soul-infused personality may function directly under theinspiration of the Spiritual Triad—the triple expression or instrument of theMonad.The significance of these “destructive episodes which produce the freeing of theprisoner of the planet” (i.e., the divine, spiritual man) lies in the fact that,after the fourth initiation, the light of purpose is the sole controlling factorin the career of the initiate; he enters then upon a stage wherein he steadilyapproaches closer to the “centre where the will of God is known.” It is anelementary revelation of the divine Purpose which is given at the thirdinitiation; only the first stage of that mysterious all-embracing Purpose is atthat time revealed; the remaining six initiations progressively reveal (to theMaster) the all-enfolding Purpose.Earlier I told you that three words should be considered in relation to thePoints of Revelation: Procedure. Location. Objective. All three of them are ofuse here in considering the nature of the impending revelation.The recognition of these Points of Revelation falls automatically into two mainprocedures or planned processes:1. The procedure carried forward under the impulse of the Law of Sacrifice which“destroys all hindrances, breaks down all impediments and removes all individual[399] obstacles, thus releasing the initiate into that vortex of force in whichhe learns the method of handling the planetary correspondence of that which hehas individually overcome.” These words should be carefully studied in relationto the second, the third and the fourth initiations.2. The procedure carried forward at the remaining five initiations; in theseinitiatory processes there is a “spiritual absorption of the initiate into thecircle and into the cycle of the Universal Mind”; the initiate is then “caughtup and liberated into planetary fields of endeavour wherein the will must beemployed as the Monad may direct.”You can see from the above how abstruse all this advanced teaching mustnecessarily remain—veiled and protected in order to protect and guard theinitiate. This dual procedure in relation to the crucial moment in each of theinitiations is always most scrupulously guarded. The moment “wherein theinitiate, standing upon the point within the triangle and not upon the square,”sees (in a flash of time) the great aligning procedure which will carry him fromthe immediate point of revelation on to the final glory, must and will beforever protected.The location of this particular point of revelation is on the mental plane;through the alignment of the concrete, lower mind, the Son of Mind and theabstract mind, a direct channel for vision is created. The medium of revelationat this initiation is the antahkarana, which is rapidly being constructed andcan thus prove the connecting link and the esoteric mode of vision. Theinstrument of reception is the third eye which—for a moment—is temporarilysuspended from its task of directing energy upon the physical plane and thenbecomes a stationary, receptive organ, turned inward toward the higher light.The head centre is therefore involved, and a secondary alignment takes placebetween the ajna centre, the head centre and the soul body. All this takes placeat a high point during the third initiation; for the first time in his personalhistory the initiate is completely [400] aligned and can function straightthrough from the head centre to the highest point of the Spiritual Triad. Youhave, therefore, the reason for the sudden inflow of transfiguring glory.This is the objective of the initiation, and the triangle of procedure, locationand objective is created, flashes into being, and then—at the close of theinitiatory process—fades out, leaving however a permanent, new, spiritual andinstinctual trend towards monadic perception and livingness.You will note, therefore, how this information—by pointing out the attitude ofthe third eye during this initiatory process and its new function in relation tothe Monad—throws fresh light upon the work of the Monad. This third eye is nowreceptive to light from the highest source, is arresting in its outward-goingactivity and functions like a lens for the reflection of light and for theattaining of the highest possible inner vision for the particular point inevolution reached. All this embodies an activity which (except in the case ofthe highest initiates) remains very mysterious. However, a study of the use ofthe third eye at the third initiation will bring illumination of the teachingthat the Monad is to the planetary Logos what the third eye (in its initiatoryfunction) is to the disciple of the third degree of initiation.The Monad is the source of light, not only to the human family, but it is thereceiver of light from the threefold Sun ; it is the lens through which thelight of the solar Logos can flow to the planetary Logos, preserving and holdingsteady in that light the vision, the purpose, the will and the creativeintention of the planetary Logos.More along this line I may not convey to you. I can only give veiled suggestionsand formulate for you certain phrases or seed thoughts which (if duly consideredand reflected upon) will begin to train your perception and develop the thirdeye, enabling it to reorient itself and change its function when the right timeand the correct emergency come.I have told you that these points of revelation are the germ or seed of acertain invocative potency; this is especially true and correct where theteaching anent the third eye is concerned. Initiation is not an abstract,mystical process to [401] which the disciple is subjected upon some one or otherof the subtler planes, the knowledge of which must gradually seep through intohis consciousness. This may be partially true of the first two initiations (theSirian initiations of the threshold), but all the remaining initiations involvethe whole man and “three periodical vehicles,” producing a steady fusion ofthese three, an increasing reaction to the Light of the World, and an ability toregister in the physical brain (if the initiate is functioning through karma,decision or service in the physical body) that which is undergone; in thisregistration process the third eye is acutely involved. From the time of thethird initiation this third eye is subjected to training and begins to functionin the two following ways:1. It is (in a measure) a correspondence to the concrete mind, with its capacityto interpret environment and experience.2. It can also act as a lens or a light-gatherer from the inner and higherworlds.You will note, therefore, the fresh significance that these ideas give to thethree stages which accompany the points of revelation: the Stage of Penetration,the Stage of Polarisation, and the Stage of Precipitation. The inferences to bedrawn I shall leave you to work out for yourselves after due study of theteaching.Passing on to the fourth Point of Revelation, we find it covered in thefollowing words:“Purpose itself is only an energy, released within the Council Chamber atShamballa. There it must take shape.”This point of revelation carries the initiate to one of the highest points ofcontemplation; we are here concerned with his sudden apprehension—at the fourthInitiation of Renunciation—of another phase of the divine, conditioning Will. Hehas begun to recognise and to interpret—even though in [402] an elementaryfashion compared to what he will recognise at the ninth initiation—thedestroying aspect of the Will as it expresses itself through the Law ofSacrifice. Now, for the first time (as a result of destruction), he can begin tograsp the essential building aspect of this same Will and to appreciate hisfuture function as a creative Builder. The building here to be carried forward,I would remind you, is not the building which is distinctive of the seconddivine aspect—that of Love-Wisdom. It is strictly connected with that of thefirst aspect of Purpose, Power or Will; it deals with the processes whichprecede the actual creative building, the drawing up of the blueprints (if I mayuse such a term) “within the confines of Shamballa,” where high spiritual Beingsmust lay Their plans. This is a different process to the creative buildingprocess, and is related to a mysterious undertaking which is carried forwardunder the “Law of Assembly.”The energy which is employed and with which the initiate at this time makes hisfirst and very temporary contact is that which the planetary Logos employs as Hegathers into His ring-pass-not that extra-planetary substance which mustprogressively be used, as the world of being and of forms makes progress underthe Law of Evolution. It must be remembered, for instance, that the planetaryforms are now composed of a much higher substance than in primeval days. It mustalso be remembered that a great process of elimination is forever going on,accompanied by a paralleling process of substitution . That which is rejectedand which is occultly thrown out as no longer serving the purpose of theplanetary Logos is replaced by that which “will measure up to the purpose of theFather.” It is this concept which has been travestied and distorted by theChristian teaching anent the “vicarious atonement.” This grew out of a basicconfusion between the Law of Sacrifice and the Law of Assembly, and took placewhen any understanding of the nature of the Father remained a supreme mystery;the whole process was then interpreted in terms of the first and highest Aspectof the essential Trinity, of which man knew nothing, instead of in terms of thesecond Aspect, the building, magnetic [403] aspect of Love. We are—if it couldbe but realised—in process of re-interpreting and re-arranging what can becalled “the doctrinal structure underlying the relation between knowledge andwisdom.” This involves the destruction of old concepts such as the trinity ofmanifestation, and the assembly of those new and more correct ideas which mustinevitably be substituted for the old, as the unfoldment of the first aspect ispresented to the initiate upon the Path. This, through certain later activities,will gradually seep downwards into the consciousness of humanity, and the newworld religion will be founded upon a deeper spiritual perception of the Fatheror Life Aspect, in place of the rapidly crystallising vision of the Son orconsciousness aspect.You get a clue here to the teaching which I have oft given to you, that thehigher processes of spiritual unfoldment must consciously give way to a muchhigher phase of perception, for which we have, as yet, no word. In relation toconsciousness, we speak constantly of initiation; in relation to this newprocess of simultaneous perception and interpretation, we employ the rathervague word “identification.”The process in which the initiate is now permitted to share during and after thefourth Initiation of Renunciation (which is presented to him in a successiveseries of points of revelation) is made possible by his submission to the Law ofSacrifice. This, in its turn, brings his consciousness under the influence—indeveloping stages—of the Law of Assembly. This is a law to which I have not yetmade reference in any of my previous instructions. The initiate can now—throughappreciated and comprehended revelation—add to his work with the Plan and itsbuilding technique, a capacity to work with divine Purpose and with thosesubstances (etheric in nature) and those energies which permeate the cosmicetheric body (the four higher planes of our cosmic physical plane) under a lawwhich is set in motion by the Father, but which makes the building activity ofthe Son possible, so that it is utterly in line with divine Purpose.Another angle of this process, revealed by the point of revelation attained inthe fourth initiation, is that there is then indicated the very highest point ofthe process of redemption, [404] because the energies released within theCouncil Chamber of Shamballa are “the living substance which is substitutory innature and which is made available to the progressing point of light.” Thatpoint in the divine consciousness which can be called (for our purposes) theUnit, Man, redeems sequentially the substance of which all forms are made andbrings into manifestation the higher counterpart of that substance, released—forman’s use—at Shamballa. This is a deep mystery and I fear it is not possible forme to express these ideas with greater clarity. However, under the Law ofCorrespondence or Analogy, the initiate can gradually come to a true perceptionof the significances involved. These points of revelation emanate from the worldof significances, and not from the world of meaning; they cast light, if trulyinterpreted and in due time, upon that world of meaning, thereby redeeming andliberating the forms in the world of appearances.You have therefore, in this suggested point of revelation, the same threesequential methods of apprehension of truth as is to be found in all suchrevelations. What are these methods?There is, first of all, the recognition of a great procedure which must, underthe Law of Assembly, be responsible for the bringing in of extra-planetaryenergies as the redemption of the worlds of being and of form is carried forwardby the second divine aspect. Of this procedure I can tell you naught. The placeor the location of the procedure of assembly is made clear. It is in the CouncilChamber of Shamballa. I would, however, brother of mine, call your attention tothe fact that Shamballa is simply a word conveying the idea of a vast focalpoint of energies which are assembled and brought together by the planetaryLogos in order to create a manifestation adequate to His unfolding intention andplanetary service. The objective is equally clear; it is the assembly of thatwhich has in it energies of redemption. Just as the Science of Redemption, underthe hierarchical Plan, is the technique employed to redeem the world ofappearances, so—on a much higher level—the Law of Assembly [405] produces theScience of Energy which is the redemptive process (in a sense which you cannotpossibly understand) influencing the work of those who labour for redemption inthe world of meaning.Again you see how all this comes under the three stages of Penetration,Polarisation and Precipitation, for it is related to the assembling of theredemptive energies brought into our ring-pass-not through the activity ofBeings at Shamballa Who can penetrate into extra-planetary spheres and thenfocus (within the Council Chamber at Shamballa) the energies thus assembled.They can then precipitate them into the ring-pass-not of the Hierarchy, andconsequently hasten the redemptive work and carry the energies from the highestlevels of the cosmic physical plane down to the lowest level of outer, densephysical manifestation.The agent of this process is the energy of the intuition or the energy of purereason. This is the mental quality “within the ring-pass-not of the UniversalMind” which is increasingly employed by the higher initiates in the work ofassembling energies. This energy is perceptive of the stage of redemptionattained in the world of appearances as the Hierarchy applies the redemptiveenergies; it is also perceptive of the quality and the stage of activity whichthe new energies to be assembled must possess.I would call your attention to the fact that this point of revelation is relatedto the plane of pure reason or to the buddhic plane; this is the lowest of thecosmic etheric levels; it is therefore a plane of “transitional ejection”—alevel from which the new and assembled energies are “let loose upon the world ofouter forms.” This process has been greatly facilitated since the entireHierarchy shifted its location (since 1925 A.D.) from the higher mental levelsto the buddhic plane, thereby making direct and unimpeded etheric receptionpossible. This is one of the significances of the words which we read in The NewTestament that “the veil of the Temple was rent in twain from the top to thebottom”—a symbolic way of expressing the unveiling of an unimpeded channel. Thiswas made possible by the Christ as the [406] Avatar, working in cooperation withthe Master Jesus, and also by the point of evolution reached by the humanity ofthat time.We will leave the fifth point of revelation at this time and consider it in ournext instruction. It is one of tremendous importance, for it concerns thehighest aspect of the Will and covers the synthesis of the energies of the fiveplanes of human and superhuman evolution. This synthesis precedes the work doneon the two highest planes of divine unfoldment, and comes to its focus and itsfull expression at the time of the sixth Initiation of Decision.PART XFor years we have talked about group initiation, and it remains as yet, for you,an unsolved problem. The phrase, “group initiation” is only used by the Membersof the Hierarchy in reference to the first two initiations—initiations of thethreshold, from the angle of the Lodge on Sirius. After these two preparatoryevents, the initiate—at and after the third initiation—reaches the point whereinhe “undergoes initiation” in his own right (as the phrase runs), for he can nowbe trusted to ask nothing for the separated self; his personality is temperedand adjusted to group conditions; increasingly he is manifesting as asoul-infused personality, and the antahkarana is being rapidly created andeffectively used. To phrase it otherwise: as the number and expressions ofsoul-infused personalities grow and initiates of the third degree increasenumerically on Earth, what will be the result? Three great happenings will takeplace with spiritual and focussed intention; they are today taking place, whichis the point I wish to bring to your attention; it is this conscious intentionwhich confers potency in the life of each disciple and initiate.1. The Kingdom of God or of Souls, distinguished by the potency and therefore bythe aura and radiatory emanation of love, is definitely anchored on Earth, andis penetrating [407] ever more fully and successfully into the three worlds ofstrictly human endeavour. There have always been outposts of this kingdom amongmen; there have ever been individuals in all parts of the world—in the worldreligions or in other constructive groups—who were linked consciously to theirsouls, and consequently linked to the Hierarchy. There have always been those inevery land who developed and expressed the Christ consciousness; this is lovingunderstanding and intelligent, living service, no matter by what words orterminology they expressed the tremendous spiritual event of which they wereaware. But—from the standpoint of the world populations—the fourth kingdom innature dominates in every field of thought and of activity, and not the Kingdomof God or of Souls.Today, as a result of a spiritual awakening which dates from 1625 A.D., andwhich laid the emphasis upon a wider, general education and upon a revolt fromthe imposition of clerical authority, the radiation from the world of souls hasgreatly intensified and the Kingdom of God is becoming a corporate part of theouter world expression, and this for the first time in the long, long history ofhumanity.The effect of this radiation or magnetic aura is now so extensive that we needno longer talk in terms of bringing in the kingdom or of its manifestation onEarth. It is already manifesting , and its aura is co-mingled with the mental,astral and etheric auras of mankind. Recognition only is required, but (and thisis a factor to be noted) recognition is being withheld until the kingdom ofsouls can be safeguarded from the narrow claims of any church, religion ororganisation; many will claim (as they have ever done) that admittance into theKingdom of God is to be found through their particular separative group. TheKingdom of God is not Christian, or Buddhist, or to be found focussed in anyworld religion or esoteric organisation. It is simply and solely what it claimsto be: a vast and integrated group of soul-infused persons, radiating [408] loveand spiritual intention, motivated by goodwill, and rooted in the human kingdom,as the kingdom of men is rooted in and is a break-away from the animal kingdom.2. The antahkarana is now being built by all soul-infused personalities (orconstructed unconsciously by all struggling to attain spiritual orientation andstature), and is rapidly becoming a strong cable, composed of all the manythreads of living light, of consciousness and of life; these threads are blendedand fused so that no one can truly say: “my thread, or my bridge, or myantahkarana.” This, in ignorance, they ofttimes do. All soul-infusedpersonalities are creating the human antahkarana which will unite, in anindissoluble unity, the three aspects or energies of the Spiritual Triad and thethree aspects of the soul-infused personality in the three worlds. In time tocome, the phrase “life in the three worlds” will be discontinued; men will talkin terms of “life in the five worlds of the manifested Kingdom of God.” Think inthese terms today if you can, and begin to grasp somewhat the significance ofthe truth therein embodied. In the beautiful Eastern symbology, “The Bridge ofSighs” which links the animal world with the human world and leads all men intothe vale of tears, of woe, of discipline and of loneliness, is rapidly beingreplaced by the radiant Rainbow Bridge, constructed by the sons of men who seekpure light. “They pass across the bridge into the Light serene which thereawaits them, and bring the radiant light down to the world of men, revealing thenew kingdom of the soul; souls disappear, and only the soul is seen.”3. Then follows that stupendous event for which all soul-infused personsprepare—the externalisation of the Hierarchy and the reappearance of the Masterof that Hierarchy, with the Personnel of which it is composed; this group ofliberated and functioning souls will appear on earth as part of the manifestedphenomena of the outer plane. This I have been dealing with in another section(The Externalisation of the Hierarchy) and will not enlarge upon it here. Theoutposts of that [409] Kingdom and the vanguard of disciples and initiates isalready here.The work or the radiatory activity of the Hierarchy is today more potent than atany time in human history. The Masters and Their disciples (under the guidanceof the World Teacher of that period) were physically present on earth in earlyAtlantean times, and the radiation emanating from Them was protective, guardingand nurturing. Later, the Hierarchy withdrew into a subjective expression andhumanity was—under the Law of Evolution—left to its own devices thus to learnthe Way and tread the Path of Return through individual experiment andexperience. The Masters (in this long interim) have not come forth to contacthumanity on any large or group scale; many of Their senior disciples have,however, emerged at varying intervals and when needed; the World Teacher hasalso come forth to sound the key or note for each new civilisation and toexpress the results of the passing civilisation. Men have had, therefore, tofind their way alone to the Hierarchy; in silence that Hierarchy has waited,until the number of “enlightened souls” was so great that their invocativeappeal and their magnetic radiation reached a potency which could not be denied;the balance of equilibrium, attained between the Kingdom of God on Earth and theKingdom of God in Heaven (to use Christian phraseology) became such that the“Gates of Return” could be opened and free intercourse established between thefourth and the fifth kingdoms in nature. The gates (and I am still speaking insymbols) are already opening and soon will stand wide open to admit the passingof the “Son of Man, the perfected Son of God,” back to the place—our Earth—whereHe earlier demonstrated perfect love and service. But—as you know—this time Hewill not come alone, but will bring with Him the Heads of certain of theAshrams, as well as a trained group of initiates and disciples.These happenings are taking place today before the eyes of all men, even thoughmuch that is going on remains totally [410] unrecognised over vast areas of theworld of thought and by many millions of men. However, brother of mine, thereare enough initiates and disciples working upon the physical plane at this timeto ensure a recognition so extensive that the steady, consistent arousing ofhuman expectation is guaranteed. Ponder on this and learn to recognise on everyside the signs of human anticipation, and the pronounced indication of theapproach of the Hierarchy.These three happenings will also indicate to you that, as far as the masses ofmen are concerned and the first two initiations are likewise involved, there istoday and will increasingly be need for group initiation. It must be rememberedthat if these two earliest initiations are to be administered upon the physicalplane by the Christ in His function as Initiator, that then the time factor mustnecessarily be involved, and that it will not be possible, therefore, to admitdisciples one by one to initiation. Administration of the initiatory formulawill have to be in group formation, and that—as you know—has necessitateddrastic changes in the presentation of the training to be given to aspirants anddisciples. People everywhere are joining groups of all kinds and workingsteadily in group formation; these can be regarded as preparatory classes ingroup fusion and group work. Among those in these many groups—functioning inevery land—will be found those who form part of the subjective groups which theHierarchy is everywhere forming upon all rays, on every plane and under manyvarying astrological aspects. Such a group is the one with which you areaffiliated, objectively and subjectively; groups like the one to which youbelong are far more common than you realise. The Masters are all working in asimilar manner, where groups in preparation for initiation are concerned.It is not easy to induce aspirants and disciples to function in this preparatorygroup formation and to make it the major interest in their lives, for they mustat the same time fulfil as perfectly as may be their family and socialresponsibilities and their business obligations. None of you would have beenoffered this opportunity had you not been capable of this dual life. I would askyou to study carefully the background [411] of this present hierarchicalundertaking (I had almost said, adventure) and fulfil your part in thepreparatory work which is demanded. This work falls into two parts:1. Your own preparation, as a soul-infused personality, for initiation; thiswill embody personality life disciplines.2. Preparation for the reappearance of the Christ; this will embody your lifeservice to humanity and to the Hierarchy.With these ideas on group initiation, I leave the subject and will now proceedwith the subsidiary themes of our study.ON HINTSTwo hints remain now for our consideration and both appear to be very simplewhen read for the first time; they must, however, be regarded as being givenutterance in the “Halls of Initiation” and as, therefore, containing much thatis not immediately apparent. Hints given by a Master are never obvious in theirsignificance; any apparent simplicity is the veil of deeply hidden truth, and itis for this that the disciple must search. This is, curiously enough, a part ofthe content of the sixth hint which is earlier given as follows:Hint Six. “The modern disciple must recognise the hint which is related to hispoint in consciousness.... My one effort is to indicate the relation betweenInitiation and Revelation.”In the past, it was the Master Who succinctly gave the disciple the hint whichHe deemed appropriate to the immediate need. Decisions as to the need of adisciple are based on his soul-fusion and upon the world need at the time, whichmay be calling imperatively for the disciple’s service. The hint given wasusually removed from all context; the disciple had to recognise it for what itwas, and had then to proceed to discover its meaning and to find thesignificance of its indications. Owing to the point attained in the evolution[412] of humanity, the hint was practically and invariably of a mental nature,and stimulated the intelligence, and intensified the strength of the mind, themental search light, or the soul. Such hints are now constantly given by seniordisciples to aspirants upon the Probationary Path. They serve to clarifythought; they remove glamour and illusory veils; they reveal the mental approachof the personality to the problem of soul contact and are an integral part ofthe process which enables the aspirant to establish a rapport which will bringthe soul and the personality together and lead to soul fusion with itsinstrument.But, as the race has unfolded the principle or aspect of intelligence and hasreached its present relatively high stage of mental understanding andperception, the older process has proved too simple and elementary; the moderndisciple did not profit by the single mental statement presented to him by hisMaster; it proved no real challenge and became a point upon which discriminationof an interior activity must be made, and not a factor calling for the neededhigher illumination. The older position was that of understanding and followinga hint, and this brought the aspirant closer to acceptance in a Master’s Ashram;it developed the mental apparatus, providing a better instrument for soulcontact, and later, for service. The major emphasis was, however, soul contact,and the hint was usually of a purely personal nature, and was concerned withthose inhibitions, wrong interpretations and negations which interfere with truesoul contact and present a barrier to progress into an Ashram.The Hierarchy was faced with the fact that thousands of aspirants have beencoming into incarnation with much of this primary mental work well accomplishedand with a substantial measure of soul contact already satisfactorilyestablished; the ancient method, therefore, began to prove futile. The entireprocess was too easy and did not constitute a test of the disciple’s intuition.When this was grasped, the whole subject was shifted, within hierarchicalcircles, from the mental plane to that of buddhi or of pure reason. This led tothe discarding of a hint as a means of mental unfoldment and to the developmentof a new process whereby the presented [413] hint was invocative of theintuition. The standard of requirements was consequently raised. The minds ofmen met this new challenge, and the consciousness of those who stood on theperiphery of the Hierarchy, and in line, therefore, for ashramic training, wasrecognised as being now basically mental, with a growing sensitivity tointuitional understanding. It was realised in hierarchical Ashrams that thelight of the soul was, speaking generally, beginning to flood the aura of thefourth kingdom in nature, and that there were many thousands of aspirants whowere developing responsiveness to the light of the Spiritual Triad. The Masters,therefore, withdrew Their attention from aspirants upon the Probationary Path,and left them to be trained by disciples in some one or other Ashram, and gaveTheir attention primarily to those upon the mental plane who could be attractedby triadal expression and energy, and who were not entirely interested in thetask of soul contact.The problem confronting the Hierarchy was interesting. This new type of aspirantwas responsive to three types of light:1. The light of substance, or the innate light of the personality.2. The light of the soul, attuned to the light of love, which dominates theHierarchy.3. The light of the Triad, which is an aspect of the spiritual Will, and whichstreams from Shamballa.The first thing, therefore, which the aspirant must be taught is to know, pastall interior controversy, where he stands upon that part of the Path ofEvolution which stretches across the mental plane into the plane of buddhi, andthus is on the Way of the Higher Evolution. I am here using words symbolically.He must know which of the lights (to which he finds himself responsive) is thelight which he must use to make further progress. Is the light of thepersonality to be trained upon the point of soul contact, so that the lower mindbecomes the searchlight of revelation? Or has the point been reached where thelight of the soul, which is the pure [414] energy of love, can be turned uponall life and circumstances in the three worlds, thus enabling the disciple tobecome a soul-infused personality and thus permitted entrance into theappropriate Ashram? Or has a still higher point been reached, and the light ofthe Spiritual Triad can begin to be directed upon the soul-infused personality,via the antahkarana?These are the problems which the modern aspirant has to face, and therefore hemust himself discover the hint which is related to his highest point inconsciousness. I would ask you here to bear in mind that the point inconsciousness is not necessarily identical with the point in evolution. A highpoint in evolution can be reached unconsciously and the disciple is frequentlynot truly aware of what he IS . He has to become consciously aware of his exactpoint of attainment before he can really know what the next step is which hemust consciously take. He is presented at this stage with a vast body orstructure of truth; his mental appreciation of these stages and principles canbe very real, but there is apt to be much confusion when the concrete mind isunduly dominant (as it so often is); the abstract mind is likewise active, andfaint indications of the functioning of the intuition and of the higher modes ofknowledge and of realisation are given. The disciple then passes through thestage wherein he appropriates everything that comes his way; he seeks to useeverything he knows or even senses in his effort to advance, to developusefulness and to pass through the door of initiation.It is at this point that the new training in this new era of hierarchicalactivity is applied to the modern disciple. Being naturally a mental type, he isunfolding rapidly a correct sense of proportion, and is therefore urged byashramic activity and by the aura of the Ashram in which he is now permitted towork, to discover for himself that hint or veiled information which will clarifyhis way. He begins to understand that the lower mind, with its multiplicity ofdifferentiations and its tabulating, analysing and complicated approach totruth, is only a foundation upon which he can take a firm stand, but that he isfaced with a profound simplicity; [415] he realises that he must find out forhimself that hint (which his own ray equipment hides but also reveals) whichwill enable him to substitute the pure reason for the many complexities of thelower mind. He has to wrestle with the problem of this simplicity, with itspenetrating potency, and with its swift comprehension of the basic truthunderlying the many truths; he learns, finally, to substitute the intuition—withits swiftness and its infallibility—for the slow and laborious work of the mind,with its deviousness, its illusions, its errors, its dogmatisms and itsseparative thinking and cultures. He finds out—as a preliminary step—the natureof his rays; he begins to discriminate between intelligence, love and what hebelieves, theoretically, the will may be, but he knows that he has as yet noreal experience of this highest divine aspect. His developing intelligence isthe result and the reward of experience; his understanding of love, the seconddivine aspect, is also in the experimental stage and his knowledge is notreliable; the fused expression of intelligence and love (of personality andsoul, to be specific) can only be possible when the will aspect in some measureis beginning to function.He has, therefore, to find a truth which is for him an immediate necessity. TheMaster will not tell him what it is; he must now formulate his own hint, basedupon attained knowledge and recognised vision. He must then take action upon thebasis of the hint, gauging the accuracy of his formulations by the measure oflight, of intuitive perception and of revelation which appears to him to bepresent in his mind content. These factors should manifest if his formulation ofthe “hint of truth” is in line with his next delineated step. Certain factorsmust, therefore, be borne in mind if the disciple is to be sure of the groundupon which he stands, and if he is to know that the hint which he has forced toemerge out of the welter of unassimilated and heterogeneous knowledge iscorrect, and therefore vital for him. These factors are:1. The hint upon which he is working will be, for him,a. A summation or anchored thoughtform of any wisdom which he may have attained.I did not say summation [416] of knowledge, brother of mine, for wisdom andknowledge are two very different things.b. Peculiarly distinguished by his ray quality, and therefore in line with hisnormal ray development. A hint, for instance, formulated by a first ray aspirantmay have no meaning or instruction for an aspirant upon the third ray, and viceversa.2. The hint upon which he is working will tend always towards the simplificationof knowledge, of motive, and consequently of activity.a. It will be distinguished by synthesis.b. It will be recognised as calling for the exercise of the intuition or of thepure reason; this is what Patanjali describes as “straight knowledge,”uncomplicated and, at the same time, profoundly inclusive.c. It will be more easily interpreted by symbols than by words or by formulatedsentences.3. The hint upon which he is working will lead inevitably to revelation or intothe light which will reveal the next step ahead, divorced from questionings andbewilderments. Such hints fall into various categories, indicative of progressand of attainment, i.e.,a. Certain preliminary hints, concerning preparation for ashramic relationships.b. Others concern the service to which the pledged disciple is committed by hissoul and which his personality must ascertain and recognise as involvingresponsibility.c. Others again will deal with the building of the antahkarana which will linkthe Spiritual Triad and the soul-infused personality. Such a hint was once givenby a Master to one of His disciples, by way of illustration. He said: “Learnthat all Ashrams are found upon the Antahkarana.” It took the disciple a fulltwo years to arrive at the hidden significance of this trite statement. Can youarrive at it in any quicker time?d. Still other formulated hints deal with the particular initiatory process withwhich the disciple is faced. It [417] is for that reason that I earlier remarkedthat my one effort at this time, as far as you as a group are concerned, is toindicate the relation between Initiation and Revelation. There is no initiationpossible without a preceding revelation, and yet each initiation leads to asubsequent revelation. The objective of all initiation is a conferredrevelation, yet no initiation is attained without an earlier self-engendered andnot conferred revelation.Let me here give you certain esoteric “hints” which may give you some idea ofthe nature of the concepts which you—as a soul-infused personality—must learn toformulate. We will start with the one given above by the Master:1. All Ashrams are found upon the Antahkarana.2. In that light shall we see light.3. The Way of the Higher Evolution is ever preceded by the destruction of allother ways.4. The Will of God destroys the wills of men, but both are needed to completethe whole.5. Radiation and magnetism, invocation and evocation, are four aspects of a dualwhole and all must be unfolded by the Server.6. The seven, the forty-nine and the one are only ONE and this the initiate mustknow within himself, discarding all but one.7. Loyalty must give place to identification, and the light is ever merged indarkness.These seven hints are all hints of which you can make use, if you care to do so.They all lie within your range of capacity and would contribute much to yourunfoldment. You would find it of value to apply what I have here explained anentthe sixth hint to the understanding of all the others, and note what progressyou could make towards the needed revelation.Let us now consider the seventh hint which runs as follows: [418]Hint Seven. “One of the marks of readiness for initiation is the ability to seethe expanding and inclusive Whole, and to note the law which is transcended whenthe part becomes the Whole.”This sentence, with its many implications, is more than a hint, though twodeeply significant hints are contained therein. It is a statement of individual,group, planetary and cosmic import and is the one hint out of the many which Ihave given to you in my various books and in these more particularisedinstructions which has a definite application for every single and isolatedinitiation. It is capable of indicating to the initiate—no matter whatinitiation he may be taking (from the lowest to the highest)—his readiness toundergo the expansion of consciousness which each initiation involves, thenature of the expanding vision with which he will then be confronted, and thehigher reflection of the Law or Laws which initiation enables the initiate tograsp and thereby relinquish the laws which have hitherto governed his conductand which have conditioned his realised life experience. Those laws he perforcecontinues to obey, as a member of the human kingdom, but his consciousness isnot conditioned by them but is rapidly becoming subservient to a higher and amuch more deeply spiritual law.Some of the more obvious meanings of this seventh hint it might profit us toconsider. Its significance is, however, something which will be revealed as aresult of initiation; you can see, therefore, that a close study and a vitalcomprehension of Hint VI must normally precede any true understanding of thisfinal hint which I have here given you. There are—needless to say—nine esotericinterpretations of this hint, corresponding to the nine initiations. Thissentence both in its individual, tonic and orchestral sounding forth, carriesinformation and illumination even to the planetary Logos when it is utteredduring any cosmic initiation that the planetary Logos may be taking—and which Heis Now doing.This hint is working out today in the consciousness of humanity as a whole; thereason for this is that the perfected [419] Personality of Sanat Kumara—focussedat present in His creative throat centre, Humanity—is reverberating to theorchestral effect of the formula which embodies this hint from the cosmic angle.To this I need not further refer, for you could not understand. Nor do I to anygreat extent, brother of mine, being but an initiate of the fifth degree. Thereason lying behind all this is that the planetary Logos in this particularworld cycle is undergoing an initiation which will shift His focus into thehierarchical centre, into that centre of energy which we call the Hierarchy;from that point of attained focus He will submit to the cosmic initiation forwhich His planetary work—creative and magnetic—has prepared Him. As He, in HisOwn essential nature, makes progress, every phase of His manifesting body, Hisexpressive Personality, is involved, with the emphasis of the conditioningenergies working out through the two centres at this time pre-eminently active;i.e., the centre which we call the race of men, Humanity, in which the energy ofintelligence is focussed and critically active, and the centre where the love ofGod is demonstrated, the Hierarchy. In these two centres a great activity is onthe move and a vital expansion or moving outward is taking place.Remember, brother of mine, initiation ever connotes activity, intelligentunderstanding, focussed attitude, deliberated movement, conditioning newrapports and the attainment of a new and greater ring-pass-not in consciousness.Let me list the leading and quite obvious inferences contained in this seventhhint, reminding you that each separated phrase, statement or concept is only thebasis or foundation for a new and further understanding. Each grasped inferenceis like a seed thought in an ordered, concentrated and successful meditation. Itis well to remember that the initiate, prior to and during any initiation, hasattained a mental attitude of the utmost concentration; this point of tension issomething of which you know, as yet, little, and yet you glibly use the words:Meditation and Concentration. Temporarily , and in order to move forward and atthe same time to leave behind , the initiate becomes a “static point ofconcentrated contemplation.” He then stands before the [420] Initiator in anintense interior preoccupation with the world of significances. He only movesforward again, dropping then the static attitude, after the application of theRod of Initiation. His ability to contemplate significances rests upon histrained capacity to move with ease in the world of meaning (the major task whichconfronts all of you at this time). The objective of the first two initiationsis to enable the initiate to live in the world of meaning; the objective of thenext four initiations—up to and including the sixth Initiation of Decision—is toenable him to live in the world of significances. This must be carefully bornein mind when pondering upon the temporary static condition of the initiate as hestands in the hall of initiation.Here are the points which must be consciously noted in the hint underconsideration; each of them veils a deeper meaning and can convey a vitalesoteric significance. Let me quote this hint again in full:“One of the marks of readiness for initiation is the ability to see thisexpanding and inclusive Entity, and to note the law which is transcended whenthe part becomes the Whole.”I prefaced this statement by the words that “the unit, the individual and thepart are always viewed in relation to an expanding and inclusive whole.” Let usconsider this statement in detail:1. The marks of readiness for initiation : What, my brother, are these marks?For what signs does the Master look before He presents His disciple to theInitiator? Are these marks to be seen present in the three bodies in the threeworlds? Or are these marks only to be seen in the body which will be primarilyaffected by the initiation to be undergone? Initiation affects both theconsciousness and the form—each in a different manner; the difference is broughtabout by the effect of the inflowing spiritual life and the divine will upon thetwo differing types of substance. Forget not, that in this solar system all thatwe [421] know—even of the very highest aspects—are substantial, because ourseven planes (if I may reiterate this basic fact) are the seven subplanes of thecosmic physical plane—a fact which is often forgotten in the loose use of theword “spiritual.” Again, can the initiate himself recognise and register themarks of fitness? These are all questions which you must answer before you canpass on to a deeper meaning and significance.2. Ability to see the expanding Whole. This leads naturally to the inferencethat, from a point of limitation, the initiate becomes aware of more than heever before realised was in existence, and this he grasps up to another point oflimitation. You have, therefore:a. Recognition of past attainment, leading to a point of temporary staticexpectancy.b. Recognition of a capacity, hitherto unrealised, to see that which hashitherto escaped conscious registration.c. Recognition of a movement of an expanding nature which increases the range ofthe initiate’s vision and which indicates a new area, both of future conquest(from the conscious control angle) and of service. This recognition will end themoment of acquiescent waiting, and inaugurate a new cycle of deepenedhierarchical activity.d. Recognition of the limit of the permitted expansion of consciousness, with asimultaneous recognition that the widened periphery of consciousness and ofactivity of which the initiate has suddenly become aware indicates theborderline of a still further expansion. This, when later undergone, will enablethe initiate to grasp the true significance of the words “the Whole.” Area afterarea of the Body of Him “in Whom we live and move and have our being” issteadily revealed to the progressing initiate until some day “he will know, evenas he is known”. He will then be granted a vision—dim and distant though it wellmay be—of that which expansion means to the planetary Logos—those fields ofdivine activity which lie outside our planetary ring-pass-not. For theirunderstanding, [422] and for freedom of movement within those areas, all thepast has prepared the initiate, and in the unfoldment of the three divineaspects of intelligence, love and will, the disciple or initiate has beencreating the instrument and developing the faculties which will enable him tomove out into solar or cosmic spheres of action, via one or other of the sevenPaths; with these I have dealt as far as now is possible in the last volume of ATreatise on the Seven Rays, Vol. V.e. Ability to see the . . . inclusive Whole. This is the practical angle of theabove mentioned reality. The initiate consciously includes in his thinking thisnew area of the divine Life to which any particular initiation can introducehim. Seeing, recognising and registering the vision and recording the expansionin his consciousness is not enough. The initiate grasps the fact that he ispresented with a widened and widening field of service for which he has theequipment, or at least the latent capacity; he begins to establish thoseconditions which will enable him to make his magnetic aura adequately inclusiveand competent within the new field of revelation.3. He notes the law which is transcended . The simple illustration of this canbe given here in terms of the teaching to be found in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire. As a human being, the disciple was ruled and conditioned by the cosmic Law ofEconomy, along with its various subsidiary laws which were active andconditioning in the three worlds of human evolution. This law is the basic lawof nature and of the natural evolving man. After the first initiation, he comesunder the Law of Attraction which carries and wields the energy of loveand—though the Law of Economy is then abrogated—it preserves an habitual controlover the habitual process of the form vehicles which are now used under the Lawof Attraction; this law works within the consciousness of man and also withinthe forms in the service of the Hierarchy. This Law of Attraction is a majorsoul law.Later, after the fourth initiation, the disciple comes [423] increasingly underthe Law of Synthesis, which is the major Law of the Spirit in the universe. Hiscapacity then to include rapidly develops and his sense of awareness can (afterthe sixth Initiation of Decision) begin to range in an extra-planetary fashion.The meaning of all this may be only theoretical, as far as your understandingmay be concerned; its significance must be carefully sought and this will not,by any means, prove an easy matter. Revelation will, however, come if you studywhat is said about these three major laws in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire.4. The part becomes the Whole. This phrase marks a consummation, and allinitiate-consummations are unexpected and even staggering in their import. Uponthese words I do not care to enlarge. Their familiarity is such that they arenecessarily meaningless to the average esoteric student. We say the words gliblyand they voice a vague objective. Nevertheless, they veil and signify the mosttremendous experience of which the human consciousness is capable, and one whichlooms with increasing magnificence during each successive initiation. Theyinfer—to sum it all up—participation, consciousness and cooperation in thethinking and the planning of the planetary Logos. Ponder upon the importance ofthese words and upon what they signify in relation to the human being.You will see, therefore, from this brief exegesis how each of these hintscarries in it more than you might imagine or anticipate; each of them hides inits heart and at the very centre of its meaning the germ of an expandingrealisation. Keep this thought ever in your minds as you seek to learn thesignificance of an esoteric hint and begin to draw correct inferences from theveiling symbology.POINTS OF REVELATIONYou will have noted from the previous instructions that these points ofrevelation are essentially planetary in nature, even if they may have—at firstreading and consideration—an [424] individual connotation. These points ofrevelation concern the Hierarchy and its intelligent appreciation of the secondor love aspect; they embody the fundamental realisations which the united groupof Masters of the Wisdom bring definitely and consciously into the radius ofTheir awareness. As this phase of Their great work is carried forward, itfrequently coincides with the initiatory processes which are being applied toinitiates and disciples; they then become—if they are capable of the necessaryunderstanding—participators in this great hierarchical activity. You will alsonote that each of these points of revelation can be phrased in such a mannerthat awareness of basic and fundamental law is conveyed to the student.We have, therefore, in these five points of revelation, the expression of fivehierarchical laws; it is interesting to realise that only the first point ofrevelation has been formulated into a law capable of ordinary humancomprehension; this is the law that “energy follows thought” and that “the eyedirects that energy.” Mankind has reached the stage where comprehension of thisfirst point of revelation is becoming possible and two factors have made thispossible:1. The formulation of this law related to energy coincided with modernscientific discovery, for today it is recognised that everything that exists isessentially energy in some form or another.2. The enormous number of aspirants who have taken or who were in process oftaking the first initiation.Again, if you pause to think, you can see the processes of invocation andevocation in action.The second, third and fourth points of revelation are (symbolically speaking)still retained within the Halls of Initiation, and their expression upon thephysical plane—as an understandable law—still lies ahead and is subject tofuture elucidation. The second point will soon be capable of expression in thethree worlds, because men are slowly coming to the realisation of the nature ofthe will and the right place [425] and proper reality of sacrifice in the divinescheme of revelation.The fifth point of revelation is worded as follows:“When the light of the seven Rays is blended with that of the seventh Ray, thenlight supernal can be known.”The implications attendant upon this fifth point are amazing at the firstglance, and they demand an immediate recognition of the two factors of time andspace . The significances which are implicit in this point may be clearer if Iparaphrase the statement and thus give you a sense of significance which willgive you understanding. When the energy of the light of all the rays can expressthemselves through the medium of the seventh ray, then the highest aspect of thedivine light can penetrate down into the physical plane. This must be obviouslya most difficult statement for you to grasp, but it is also a statement offundamental truth.In an earlier instruction I pointed out that three ideas were involved ingrasping the significance of these points of revelation and—once you havegrasped them—they are beautifully clear and simple. The Procedure required forthe manifestation of “light supernal” takes place when a transitory point ofsynthesis is reached and the seven energies are blended into one great energeticLight. These seven energies have ever, unitedly, created the “light supernal”upon the highest levels of divine expression, but that revealing light onlyfinds Location when the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Order is active and in processof manifestation in the three worlds, and necessarily, therefore, upon theseventh plane, the physical plane. Such a manifestation inevitably takes placein moments of planetary crisis, when the seventh ray is active and when the Sunis in Aquarius. Such a combination of relationships is being established now,for the seventh ray is rapidly coming into manifestation and the Sun is inAquarius, for the Aquarian Age is just beginning. The Objective of thiscombination (which has occurred six times during [426] the period of the fifthroot-race) is to bring about illumination and the establishment of order uponthe Earth. The first indication of the possibility of the effectiveness of thesedivine proposals was the giving out of the New Invocation; its potency was sogreat that right conditions had to be considered before its enunciation waspossible. That was the first step in the planned precipitation of the “lightsupernal”; the second step will be the reappearance of the Great Lord, Who willact as the lens through which the light can be focussed and adapted to humanneed. Conditions are rapidly being brought about whereby this great event oflight distribution will be possible. The Christ can and does function now uponthe atmic plane and embodies within Himself the great Point of Revelation whichhas been expressed by me in the words: “The Will is an expression of the Law ofSacrifice.” The invocation now mounting from humanity to that high Place wheredwells the Christ is, at this time, focussed in or originates upon the plane ofthe emotions; because of this, we find the words in the Scriptures that at theend of the age “the Desire of all Nations” will come forth. The movement tobring Him—from the angle of the masses—emanates, therefore, from the astralplane. The plans for His coming are being laid in the higher correspondence ofthat plane, the buddhic plane, or the plane of pure reason.The motivating power for His coming is being provided by all disciples andinitiates; it is therefore a joint movement, qualified by the desire and themotivation of the united Hierarchy and Humanity; this Invocation cannotconsequently be denied. Astrologically, the time is propitious; from theplanetary angle, great and momentous events are imminent, as the planetary Logosis taking a cosmic initiation; the energy which produces order and whichmagically brings spirit and matter together (the energy of the seventh ray) isalready organising human affairs and these three great coinciding events in timeand space make it possible for the seventh ray energies to reach a high point offused activity and of blended cooperation.The result will be the creation of a direct channel for the precipitation of“light supernal” into the three worlds and its [427] dominant focussing upon thephysical plane. Thus will be brought about the new civilisation and the newworld order, and the new approach to divinity will be rendered possible; theinitial steps will then be taken to create the “new heavens and the new earth.”You will need here to discriminate carefully between symbols and facts; more, Ineed not here indicate.In our consideration of this fifth point of revelation, a most complete pictureis given of the three stages of the process, which I mentioned earlier:Penetration, Polarisation, Precipitation.In this particular revelation, all the planes (of the cosmic physical plane) areinvolved; this, in itself, is unusual; the entire proceeding concerns thepenetration of the blended seven rays throughout all the states of consciousnessas indicated by the seven substantial planes. This must be remembered, becausethe concept of “planes” is almost irretrievably (and I use this word advisedly)associated with the idea of matter or of substance. This is basically correct,and yet the emphasis must be upon the aspect of consciousness as it informssubstance. The effect of the penetration with which we are now dealing is uponthe many varied types of consciousness which express themselves through theseven types of substance. The blended energies penetrate through the medium ofstage after stage of conscious awareness; nevertheless, they only affect thoseforms of life which react instinctively to their influence. The importance ofthe present penetration lies in its completeness and in the fact that responseto these blended energies is definitely more rapid and inclusive than everbefore in planetary history.There are, therefore, three stages in the penetrating process at this particulartime:1. The initial act of penetration which takes place “within the area guarded bythe Spirits of the seven Rays.” This connotes extreme activity in Shamballa andalso necessitates the cooperation of the Lord of the World and of the entireCouncil over which He presides.2. The achievement of a point of polarisation. The preceding [428] penetrationof the energies reaches a point of focus upon the mental plane and there—for abrief time—an unique process of consolidation and of consequently greater fusionis brought about. In this unique moment in the history of humanity, this momentof potency is appropriated by mankind.I wonder if you realise the gravity and the importance of this statement.Because humanity has passed through a great cleansing process and because in theworld today there are many aspirants and disciples, the effect of thesepenetrating energies is such that they inevitably evoke response. They becomepolarised or focussed upon the mental plane. Because of this also, everybody whois mentally centred and controlled, as well as aspirationally motivated, isfaced with an imperative opportunity. This opportunity is unprecedented in humanhistory and is also based upon certain astrological relationships which I havealso touched upon in this series.3. Because of the evolutionary preparedness, evident in the consciousness ofhumanity, the penetration of energies which have already reached a point ofpolarisation upon the mental plane is now being continued, and the result is adefinite precipitation of all these energies upon the physical plane, in densephysical substance; the precipitation is also evident in the ordinaryconsciousness of ordinary mankind. This statement, you will have to accept onfaith. The evidence for the truth of the statement will be found in increasedhuman receptivity to the will-to-good which the activity of all the seven rays(custodians of the divine purpose) promotes.We are therefore, my brothers, living in a time of spiritual crisis. When ahuman crisis and a spiritual crisis coincide, there comes one of the majorperiods of opportunity and decision in general human affairs; hence the extremegravity of the present moment. All I can do is to call it to your attention; itis for you to watch and interpret current events, and it is for you to note theexpression of the precipitating and penetrating energies, in order to cooperateas far as your insight [429] permits, and thus further the right production ofthe required effects.PART XIOne of the factors (and I believe I have earlier pointed this out) which haswarred against a true understanding of initiation has been the puerile andfeeble interpretations of it which the various occult groups have promulgated.Often have I wished that H.P.B. (my first and earliest amanuensis) and the manyprevious teachers of occult truth had given out nothing whatsoever aboutinitiation, the Masters and the occult Hierarchy. Humanity was not ready, andthe Hierarchy is not as it has been portrayed by earnest Theosophists andRosicrucians. The Hierarchy has been pictured as a group of eager men, anxiousto establish happy relations with humanity. In this, the Members of theHierarchy are not primarily interested. The prime objective set before everyMaster of or in an Ashram is to see the purposes of Sanat Kumara working outsuccessfully through the medium of hierarchical endeavour. Their work lies withthe advanced thinkers in the human family who are capable of grasping the Planand of penetrating to the periphery of hierarchical influence. The Masters seekdisciples among the world intelligentsia, but They do not seek for them amongthose who constitutionally join occult groups and the ranks of the glamoureddevotees who seek association with some Master. They seek for them among thosewho intelligently love their fellowmen and who are free from spiritual ambitionand self-seeking. They never look for them among those who love the idea ofbeing the sought and the beloved of the Masters. A man may have no practicalknowledge of academic initiatory teaching but—if he loves his fellowmen and isdedicated to their service and can use his mind on their behalf—he is probablynearer to initiation than the devotees of the occult schools.These schools have, however, done one vital and important task: they havefamiliarised mankind with the general concept of initiation; they have thereforeposited an impelling [430] goal, and they have consequently served. This mustnot be forgotten. It is really not the fault of the individual that he warps anddistorts a presented truth. It is his point in the evolutionary cycle whichmakes that inevitable. The moment that such a point in the evolutionarypresentation is twisted and distorted so that it is not progressive in itsappeal, but serves only to feed individual pride and the sense of personalityachievement, it is necessarily not spiritual.In our approach to the entire theme of initiation I would ask you ever to havethis in your minds; I would ask you to seek for the different and not the usualapproach to this much discussed theme; I would ask you to question all thatmakes you personally feel adequate to the initiatory demands, and to look forthat which will lead you to exert all that you have of intuition and spiritualperception. I would beg you to repudiate all that makes you feel a devotedfollower of the individuality of any Master and which leads you to feel that youare in the vanguard of the evolutionary wave. I would like, in this instruction,to give you a new slant on the initiatory processes and thus to present to you afresh incentive to constructive endeavour and towards a commonsense approach tothis subject. My reason for so doing was given you in our last instruction, whenI said: “When the human crisis and the spiritual crisis coincide, there comesone of the major periods of opportunity and of decision. Hence the extremegravity of the present moment.” I would suggest therefore that we study thisproblem of the initiatory process from the angle of Penetration , ofPolarisation, and of Precipitation. These are words which have a practicalusefulness if correctly understood; I would ask you to consider them from theangle of your individual approach to the Initiator. There are consequently twoangles to this needed consideration: that of yourself, the individual disciple,and that of the group of which you should be (are you?) an integral part. Let ustherefore take up these points and see what we can learn from them. Whatpenetrates? Or into what do you, as a disciple, seek to penetrate? Where are youpolarised? And what do you really mean when you use that word? What is [431]precipitated when you have succeeded in the processes of penetration? or whenyou have arrived at a measure of polarisation? These are aspects of the teachingwhich are of importance; otherwise you are working with no intelligentperception and are using words without meaning.Initiation is essentially a penetration into areas of the divine consciousnesswhich are not within the normal field of consciousness of a human being. Thisinitiatory penetration is achieved by the disciple through reflectivemeditation, the development of an interpretive spiritual understanding, plus theuse of the trained discriminative mind. This leads eventually to thestabilisation of his consciousness in the new field of awareness, so that hebecomes polarised there and can work intelligently from the attained point ofawareness and of conscious vision. Once he can do this and is aware of the newenergies with which he may now work, he enters the stage wherein he mayprecipitate these energies into the three worlds of human service and thusemploy them for the furthering of the hierarchical Plan. These three stages ofconscious activity—penetration, polarisation and precipitation—are definite andrecognised stages in every initiation, with the exception of the firstinitiation. The disciple (as the Scriptures put it) “takes the Kingdom of Heavenby violence” and thus penetrates into the arena of activity of the Initiator;within that area of spiritual and dynamic influence he becomes polarised, withresults which are conditioned by the particular initiation being undergone. Fromthis point he carries forward the task of precipitating the contacted energiesand learns how to make them available in his work for humanity.At the same time, the Initiator “polarises” the energies of the “penetrating”disciple and “precipitates” them through his vehicle according to the Will orPurpose of divinity. The stage wherein the disciple is demonstrating thesubjective fact that he is initiate is called the stage of penetration. That inwhich he stands face to face with1. The Angel of the Presence, [432]2. The Initiator,3. The Initiating Masters,is termed the stage of polarisation. Then when the initiatory process iscompleted and “he returns from whence he came to carry out the Plan,” the stageof precipitation takes place. Therefore, there are two processes of activitygoing forward simultaneously; i.e., that which is implemented by the Initiator,and one for which the advancing initiate is responsible.The moment, therefore, that a disciple enters upon the Path of Initiation, heis—from the second to the ninth initiation—to be found functioning at one orother of these stages. He is either penetrating into new areas of divineawareness and penetrating deeply into the Mind of God, or he is learning to liveand function from a point therein attained to which we give the name ofpolarisation, or else he is serving to the utmost of his ability in theprecipitation of the energies which will make possible the manifestation of theKingdom of God upon the physical plane.Every initiate is himself a polarised point of precipitated energy; everyinitiate works from a known point of polarisation, and his main task is theprecipitation of energy in order to energise, stimulate and create that which isneeded in any immediate field of divine activity. Occult obedience is in realitythe ability to work with these energies in relation to the Plan, even if only atiny part of that Plan is known to the initiate. He becomes a part of a greatenergy distributing group. You will realise, therefore, from the above, thatthese three words which we have been considering are major key words in thehierarchical programme. One of the tasks of a Master, in connection with Hisdisciples, is to aid them in bringing about effective polarisation and aconsequent spiritual stability. The disciple has to effect the stage ofpenetration alone and unaided; during the process of polarisation, the Master ofhis Ashram is permitted to help. The stage of precipitation falls into threeparts:1. That in which a relation is set up between the initiate-disciple [433] andthe Initiator. The Initiator focusses the new and probably unrecognised energieswithin Himself and by their means sets up a spiritual rapport with the newinitiate.2. That in which the energies, transferred by the Initiator into the aura of theinitiate, are precipitated by him. This is preceded by a short primary phase inwhich the initiate polarised the energies of which he is the recipient intowhichever centre is active in any particular initiation. For the second andthird initiations he polarises them or focusses them in the heart centre. Afterthe third initiation they are focussed in the head centre, but are precipitatedand distributed through the medium of the centre between the eyes, the ajnacentre. This latter centre is, as you know, the directing agency of the soulwithin the soul-infused personality.3. Later, he finds that he can use any centre as the point of precipitation,according to the needs of the work to be done or the service to be rendered. Anadvanced initiate, however, works from a point of polarisation within theHierarchy itself, distributing and precipitating the energies via anyappropriate centre. In working with the subhuman kingdoms, initiates use thecentres below the diaphragm more than initiates working in the human family.The first Initiator is, as you know, the Soul, the Angel of the Presence, andthe stage of penetration covers the long evolutionary cycle wherein the Soul isseeking to establish contact with and control of the personality. The stage ofpolarisation covers the cycle in which Soul control is stabilised andconsciously imposed upon the threefold lower man. The stage of precipitation isonly known for what it essentially is when the energies of the Spiritual Triadcan be passed through the antahkarana into the soul-infused personality. Wehave, therefore:1. The Path of Evolution . . . . . The stage of Penetration. [434]2. The Path of Discipleship . . . The stage of Polarisation.3. The Path of Initiation . . . . . .The stage of Precipitation.These stages are presented in dramatic form during the process or therecognition of initiation. As you have oft been told, it all concerns the use ofenergy, and covers the entire period of training for energy distribution.Initiation is in fact a process wherein the initiate is taught how to work withenergy, how to use the creative, attractive and dynamic energies in accordancewith the hierarchical Plan in order to bring about the precipitation of theplanetary Purpose into the outer field of manifestation. You may say that thereis little new in these things which I am telling you and that is somewhat true,but not entirely so.The use of the three words which I have been attempting to elucidate for youbrings in, however, an exceedingly deep occult apprehension of the hiddenMysteries and of the spiritual Realities: the conception of a goal to whichpenetration must be made; of a fresh area of consciousness in which the initiatemust be stabilised and polarised; and the result—the dynamic use of hithertounknown energies. These are made available to the initiate because he isinitiate and must proceed to carry out what has been revealed to him of thehierarchical Plan, from the attained Point of Revelation . All this is implicitin these words, and in their brevity they convey the greatest spiritual truths.They convey an increasing sense of eternal livingness, activity and movement;the initiate discovers himself to be a point of energy in an ocean ofenergies—energies which are being directed by groups of Living Beings Who workfrom the angle of a proved immortality, and Who—because of Their livingness—canbe precipitating centres of energy under the divine Plan and in accordance withthe divine Purpose.The word “revelation” is one that has been greatly misused by the mystics of theChurch and of the great world religions; by them, its use is usually of aselfish nature and the concept implied is that revelation is the due reward,conceded to the mystic because of his struggles and his deep search for God.Then, suddenly, God is revealed to him; [435] suddenly the Angel speaks;suddenly his search seems ended and reward in the form of revelation is accordedhim. This procedure and sequence of events has been the ordinary form forcenturies and all the time the idea of God Transcendent dominated religiousthought. But the revelation accorded is, in reality, related (until the sixthInitiation) to God Immanent, to God in form, to God in the human heart, and tothat veiled and hidden supreme Reality which motivates all existence and whichis for ever consciousness aware of itself. Revelation is a progress ofpenetration: first into the Mind, then into the Heart, and lastly into thePurpose of the One in Whom we live and move and have our being.The agent of revelation is, for the first two initiations, the Soul and—for thatreason—the first initiation is said to be (and with truth) the expression of theman’s own inner divinity. This is the reason why these first two initiations areregarded as “initiations of the threshold.” It is here that the work of theChrist or Whoever is the cyclic Head of the Hierarchy should be considered,working in cooperation with the Soul of the initiate upon the plane of the Soul,the mental plane; the Son of Mind is set free and then the higher initiationsbecome possible. After that, the One Initiator can be faced or confronted stepby step and revelation is accorded of the world soul, of the planetaryconsciousness—that of which the Soul or the individual consciousness is anintegral part.After the sixth Initiation of Decision, the revelation begins to shift on tocosmic levels and off the cosmic physical plane. A developed wisdom then growsin relation to God Transcendent. The initiate now has knowledge of God Immanentwithin the planetary sphere and can now add, to knowledge, wisdom and can learnto give correct and understanding interpretation to that which is being revealedto him, stage by stage, as he demonstrates that he is initiate. After the sixthinitiation the initiate begins to penetrate, through his projected spiritualawareness, on to cosmic levels where he contacts unimagined revelations. Thefact that I want you to understand can perhaps be best expressed by thefollowing words out of the Old Commentary : [436]“The light that shines within the heart of man discovers light and, in theseblended lights, comes revelation. The light that shines within the sacredHierarchy of Souls discovers these two lights revealed and they reveal athird—the revelation of the higher states of Being which hide and veil a Lightwhich is not of planetary creation. These are four lights which reveal a LightSupreme, a Light which comes from distances beyond the ken of man. Yet all theselights have been revealed because a light has burned—immovable, secure—withinthe human heart.”The whole theme of revelation is the revelation of light, and that implies manydifferent interpretations of the word “light”; it concerns the discovery of thelighted areas of being which otherwise remain unknown, and therefore hidden. Wecreate light; we employ light; we discover greater lights which serve to revealto us the Unknown God. It is the guiding light within us which eventuallyreveals those brighter lights which usher in the process of revelation. I am, mybrother, speaking symbolically as you can well understand.So much of human thought anent religion is concerned with the light ofknowledge; the reason for this is that the first “great lighted area” which theinitiate can grasp is the “circle of the Mind of God,” as it expresses itself inthe living, active state of the planetary consciousness. There is a point in theinitiate process when the initiate becomes aware—in a manner which I cannot ormay not explain to you—of the light as it blazed forth at the consummation ofthe previous solar system; to it we give the inadequate name of the “light ofthe intelligence.” It is really the light of what we call the light of the animamundi; in this initiate experience the light of the Kingdom of Souls is added tothat light. At a later initiation there comes a point of revelation where theinitiate perceives and records as a definite revelation the “light of the divinePurpose,” and this happens in such a way that the light of the divine Mind orthe divine Intelligence becomes available for this increased enlightenment andinforming. When this takes place, a point is reached wherein the intelligence[437] and its various phases as known to him hitherto, drops below the thresholdof consciousness and becomes instinctual, irrevocable habit, but is no longer amajor preoccupation. The “light of love” which flows from the Heart of God(and—from the angle of the solar system—from the Heart of the Sun) supersedesthe light which has hitherto enlightened his way. At that point of revelation(again speaking symbolically), he realises for the first time a threefold“lighted relation”: a triangle composed of the light of the Spiritual Triad, ofa light which is streaming forth from the “Heart of the Sun,” and of a steadilyburning light which glows from the cosmic physical plane. As he has penetratedinto the higher stages of the Path of Initiation, he has moved forward into alight which has been revealed to him by the use of the triple light of hispersonality and the threefold light of his soul which (when blended) representtwo great lights; as he moves forward again, he now blends with these lights thetriple light of the Spiritual Triad; and the union of all these lights reveals alight and lights which are extra-planetary.The above elucidation is of a deeply instructive, though symbolic, nature andcan only be correctly understood if the basic premise is grasped that “light issubstance” and that “substance is energy.” I have here attempted to reduce towords which you could understand some pages out of the Rules for Disciples towhich access is granted as the initiate proceeds on the Way and comes to thecritical stage where “he recognises revelation.” I would ask you to thinkcarefully about these three words because they involve the perception of sometruths which are apt to be forgotten. For instance, the truth that revelation isthe revelation of that which is ever present; it is not in reality therevelation of something new and hitherto unknown. To put this in its simplestterms: the initiate discovers he can perceive more than he ever knew wasexistent or perceptible but that he is only perceiving something that has alwaysbeen there. The limitation, he discovers, is in himself, and the Way ofRevelation is through the discovery and the discarding of his own personal, orrather, individual limitations.The next point to be remembered is that these limitations [438] have beenrejected by him under the applied stimulation of the Rod of Initiation, wieldedby the Initiator. I would ask you to remember that this Rod is the Rod ofStimulating Light which is projected by the Initiator with all its Lightedenergy on to the centre which is receiving attention during any specificinitiation.There is another point of revelation on the Way of Initiation to which I wouldlike to refer. It occurs when the light which the initiate has generated orreceived is projected into the Past and the subconscious mind (as thepsychologists inadequately call it) is revealed to him; this subconscious mindrelates him to all the four kingdoms in nature. This is one of the earliestphases and precedes the shifting of the penetrating, focussed light inextra-planetary areas of consciousness. It constitutes a fundamental revelationand is in the nature of a “summarising point of penetration.”I endeavour, my brothers, to give you—as far as I can—some teaching on thepoints of revelation which the Christ will make possible for mankind to grasp,and try to give you some understanding of the quality of the light of knowledgewhich is inherent in the planet, and the quality of the light of love which isof solar origin; this is one of the teachings which He will make somewhatclearer to mankind.More along these lines I cannot tell you. It was necessary for me, however, tospeak of these matters, even if they sound to you to be but symbols andparables; they will aid you to gain a more just appreciation of initiation.In the planetary and cosmic processes, the fate, the attainment and the progressof the individual initiate are of small importance in the vast scheme of thedivine life. Can you grasp anything of what I mean when I say that initiation isa planetary activity, based on the life of the planetary Logos and the point ofspiritual attainment of Sanat Kumara? This attainment sweeps or carries theinitiate into ever widening spheres of “lighted consciousness,” and this makeshim not only welcome the revelations of light but also to become one of theAgents of the Light.These are deep mysteries and you cannot expect or anticipate full comprehension.Many lives of struggle, service and [439] progress lie ahead, but the reward ofrevelation is adequate compensation for all that must be endured as the initiatediscards limitation. The goal of all this process has been summed up, as far asplanetary humanity is concerned, in the words of the fifth Point of Revelation:“When the light of the seven Rays is blended with the seventh Ray, then LightSupernal can be known.”"},{"pageContent":"SECTION FOUR — PERSONAL INSTRUCTIONS TO DISCIPLES BY THE TIBETANTO L.D.O.August 1940[443] One of the things, my brother, which is being developed in yourconsciousness is the basic spiritual fact that “whether in the body or out ofthe body” (as the initiate Paul expressed it), the life of the disciple does notstand still but inevitably—if he is sincere and earnest—proceeds from revelationto revelation. But for the pledged disciple, such as you are, this revelation isnot confined to mystical depths and heights but becomes increasingly part of therecognisable brain consciousness. This is a lesson which you are learningrapidly and on that fact I congratulate you. Continue so to do and in the comingperiod of reconstruction you will be of effective service.But, brother of mine, to be truly effective in the manner desired, you mustcultivate the attitude of being only a clear unobstructed channel, and you mustnot block that channel with your ideas, your plans and your physical planeactivities. I would not have you cease planning and working actively but I wouldhave you be more discriminating and cautious. I would have you ponder on therelative usefulness of inspiring many to active work in the service of humanity,or sponsoring your own activities and focussing all your efforts uponorganisation work. Such organisation work has ever faintly glamoured you. Thearousing of the desire to serve and the kindling of the flame of intelligentlove for mankind in the hearts of your fellowmen could provide for you anadequate field of service. It would enlist both your personality and your soulin active cooperation and is something you can do unusually well. The gift ofdivine inspiration, as it can be used to affect and galvanise others intoactivity, is rare, but is for you a natural result of your spiritualpolarisation. This [444] you know, and of this faculty you should increasinglyavail yourself. Seek, as I have earlier told you, to be ; aim at being a conduitfor spiritual force; cultivate the power of identification with those you seekto inspire, for this leads to direct transference of energy; develop divineindifference as to your form of service and ponder deeply on the thought of“service by radiation.”As you already know, the five rays governing your monadic expression as soul andpersonality are not particularly well balanced. There is in this incarnation toomuch of the second ray line of approach to divinity; you are primarily 2-4 whereyour rays are concerned. Where the personality ray, the mental ray and theastral ray are closely allied there is always found an easy problem of innercontact, relation and integration. When, however, the aggregate of inner energycomes to outer expression upon the physical plane, there appears what I mightcall a lack of stiffening and a too fluid response to spiritual impulses andideals. There is a correct and undeviating life tendency towards the realm ofspiritual reality, but in the field of manifestation and of creative activitythere is frequently a changeableness and a developed habit of experimentation.The very versatility of the second ray (twice repeated in your life expression)tends to confuse the issue of service and its correct rendering in your mind.You do so many things, my brother; if you look back over your life, you willfind that it is composed of short periods wherein you were intensely preoccupiedwith what you sincerely believed was the purpose of the moment. The time has nowcome when the purpose of the soul, in time and space, must become a pronouncedconviction governing all future activity and all expression upon the physicalplane, subordinating your entire lower nature (the three bodies) with fixedintent to the directed will of the soul.For you, I would repeat, service by radiation is the way . To bring this about,it will be necessary for you to evoke the latent will which must be developedand controlling in you by the time the third initiation comes; at that time themonadic influence is predominantly that of the divine, purposeful [445] will.The expression of this higher aspect of the will, in relation to the three raysof aspect on which all initiates are eventually to be found, is likewisethreefold:1. There is the dynamic will, as it is expressed by first ray egos.2. There is the inclusive radiatory will of second ray souls. This is the kindof will-expression and recognised life purpose with which you must learn to putyourself in direct contact.3. There is the magnetic will of the third ray ego which draws, attracts,manipulates and arranges in accordance with divine purpose. This is not the samekind of magnetism as that of love.In the meditation, therefore, which I seek to give you, we will have thisinclusive, radiatory will primarily in mind, and for the next few months I wouldhave you follow these instructions....Life is difficult these days but you lack not courage, and the sense of innerreality will hold you true to the goal and steady in expression. My attentionturns towards you when you need it. I can be reached.~August 19421. Stand at the centre of dispassion with heart aflame, yet still.2. Be not the centre of the work you undertake, the service rendered, but be itsfluid life.3. Transmute devotion to a cause, to me, to your brothers or your group into aflaming love for all that breathes.4. Learn that your causes are effects. Leave them behind and seek the world ofcauses.5. Three in this group stand close to you. Discover who they are and know thereason why.6. Ask your soul the question: Why is D.K. the Master Who has sought me out?[446]~MY BROTHER: September 1943Since I last communicated with you, more than a year ago, life has brought youcertain radical changes—some of them as a result of the war and your personalityreaction to that war, and a few of them as a consequence of soul impulse. Thesechanges and their resultant readjustments have been so many and have beenbrought about with such relative suddenness that you have not yet had time toknow with clarity (within yourself) the distinctiveness of each change or itsemanating source. Every change in a life condition upon the physical plane isthe result of some inner cause. I hinted at this when I gave you the sixstatements which were intended to aid in the direction of your life. I said toyou: “Learn that your causes are effects. Leave them behind and seek the worldof causes.”These words embody one of the first lessons which a disciple has to master, asyou well know. The initiate lives in the world of causes, for this is obviouslythe world of initiation. He deals therefore with those basic happenings whichact as life-impulses, and initiates only those activities which are formulatedby him as a soul and (bear this in mind) as a soul whose personality isinitiate. Because of this personality capacity of seeing “eye to eye” with thesoul, his activities are results of deliberate spiritual intention.This is, therefore, one of the first lessons which it is my duty (as it is theduty of every Master) to teach all those who have just been accepted into myAshram. Such people are not beginners in the world of occult life as far as theaverage man is concerned, but from the angle of an Ashram most of youindisputably are. I have therefore to teach each of you something as to thenature of that world of causes, and how to discover whether you are notfunctioning as a personality seeking, as far as may be, to be sensitive to soulincentive, or whether you are literally functioning as a soul. These are twovery different matters, my brother. How can you, as a disciple, decide what youare doing and know your reasons? All that I, as your Master, can do is toindicate an approach [447] to reality, and then leave you to arrive at rightdecision, via direct or intuitive knowledge, alone and unaided.Decisions which a disciple has to make are based upon various urges, impulsesand desires; they differ from those made by the average man because they areever accompanied by questionings and by the practice of a constant and oftbewildering inner scrutiny of motive and purpose. You have faced many suchperiods of questioning in the past year, my brother, and your answers havedefinitely affected your personality life, your service to the Plan, yourvarious group affiliations and your general attitude to the spiritual realm.This you know. One aspect of your nature is profoundly satisfied; the other isfull of doubt and enquiry; your soul is on its way to a fuller and richerexperience of life, and this involves difficulty.In some ways, the war has not really touched you very profoundly, even if youretaliate by saying that it has touched you astrally and emotionally. Emotionsare, however, ephemeral. Personality enterprises have offset greatly yourreactions, and changes in your personality life, in your environment and in yourestablished habits have offset much reaction. This is, perhaps, just as well.Then, too, your attempted world service has intensely preoccupied you, and youhave tried to be what I suggested in my statement to you, “the fluid life” ofall that you seek to do. In connection with that work I have only this to say:Your service will be best rendered if you refrain from regarding your plannedorganisation as unique and if you do not attempt to live up so entirely to theworld concept. Your work is inspired from my Ashram; it is an integral part ofmuch larger plans and is largely modelled upon those ashramic plans (which arepart of still greater hierarchical endeavours) and has little in it that isoriginal. It is a small part of a much larger whole and has a very needed partto play. I would remind you that very large trees can grow from very smallseeds. Your seed is one of many in a large pod (to use a botanical symbol). Thispod contains many similar seeds which will bear many similar trees.You have a fluid mind and can do much if your emphasis [448] is placed where Isuggest—a fluid life . Otherwise your fluid mind will incite you to so manyuseful activities that many of them will amount to very little. One of yourmajor needs is a planned concentration and an ability to make discriminatingchoice as to activity and technique. You cannot possibly do everything that yousee needs to be done; therefore, do that which will bring about the greatestamount of good to the greatest number of seeking souls. This is always adifficult matter for the creative worker to grasp. The doing of the thing whichhe plans is to him oft the satisfactory reward of effort, and his focussedactivity and attention is founded upon what he creates. Yet the created thing isonly an effect—an effect of what, my brother?Again we come back to the subtle question which your soul seeks to have youanswer this life, because in answering it you will find a release which willgive you a definite opportunity in your next life. What motives are impellingyou to action in your personality life, in your group relation, and in yourservice to humanity? A general answer will not suffice, for you will find thatseveral widely different motives condition each field of expression, and whenyou know what they are, you will be able to bring all the three phases of yourlife into one rightly oriented functioning whole. Is your creative work theresult of a desire to create, or is it impelled by love of humanity and,therefore, an automatic intelligent response to human appeal? Are you nurturinga small and healthy seed or are you endeavouring to transplant a tree? This lastquestion has far more significance than perhaps you guess. It holds in itscorrect answering the secret of your success. Are you cooperating with the Plan,or in reality with your plans? Again a question of importance.A rich life of service lies ahead for you in the coming period ofreconstruction, but its full expression is dependent upon your achieving a pointof focus, leading to a point of tension which will, in its turn, inevitably leadto a point of crisis. When these—focus, tension, and crisis—condition all yourliving, then your work will move ahead towards a most desirable fruition.Like all creative workers, my brother and my friend, you [449] resent all formswhich you do not yourself initiate. I am not, therefore, giving you a set formfor meditation, but I am giving you a loose structure of thought which I wouldlike to see govern your approach to life, to work and to all you do as adisciple coming forth from my Ashram. This will constitute your cooperativecontribution to the group need and to humanity.Take the three words which I have given you and seek to weave the energies whichthey represent into your life pattern, welcoming the changes which they maybring and knowing that they are, for you, the correct procedure because thesethree concepts govern the needed evolutionary process for you at this time—asthey do for the bulk of disciples and, to a certain degree, all lesserdeveloping nature.I. FocusSeek to ascertain in a wide and general sense where your major life focus isestablished. Is it emotional, mental, or on soul levels? Is it focussedconsciously in the Hierarchy, in my Ashram, or where? What is your daily focusas you watch yourself each day of living? Where, each day, has your attentionbeen, having in mind that a disciple’s focus is frequently in one place whilsthis attention is in another? Do you know what I mean when I say this?II. TensionStudy for the next year whether you know the true significance of tension. Foryou, it should mean (speaking in a symbolism which you ought to understand) thatmoment of exquisite sensitivity which appears just as the life within reachesthe point of “breaking forth” into the light. It is that moment of alertconscious anticipatory direction which distinguishes the runner in the Olympicgames as he stands poised for his supreme effort and test. It should be, foryou, the moment when you switch your identification with that which you do, awayfrom that act of doing (which is in reality only an effect of an initiatingcause or motive) into the world of origins, of motives and causes. In thatsupreme moment of tension you relate life [450] and form, the fluid and theconcrete; then an organism, and not an organisation, takes shape before youreyes.III. CrisisThe comprehension and the system of right reflection which the two aboveprocesses will generate must inevitably eventuate in a point of crisis. Aboutsuch a crisis I can say little. It will take place in conformity with yourability to focus, in line with your attainment of the right tension, and theprecipitation of the crisis will, therefore, give you release, freedom, clarityof vision and entrance into light.In closing let me say: Preserve your essential and innate integrity, my brother.Be like the sapling which bears up against the storms of wind and rain, holdingits life in form intact and gaining added beauty as strength develops.My blessing rests ever upon you, and my cooperation and my help when needarises. On that you may count. Meet happiness and distress alike withequilibrium, and be a strong hand in the dark to all you meet.~BROTHER OF MINE: November 1944I believe that when this reaches you and you scan the interval between theseinstructions and the previous one, you will realise the significance of yourlife events in a new way. They have been many, and they have been varied. Do youappreciate what they mean? The past year brought you crisis after crisis; itinvolved periods of quiescence and of enforced activity; it also brought periodsof a definite recognition of growth wherein you registered expansion and arrivedat certain inner decisions by which you must and will abide, because they markeda certain high water mark of your soul’s development.Your problem is now concerned with this point of attainment. Is the high watermark reached a temporary one, preliminary to a still higher attainment, or haveyou—for this life—set your pace and can proceed no faster? Disciples, such [451]as you, need to learn that this type of decision indicates no choice betweenright and wrong, or between progress or non-progress. It is simply a decision,specifically related to timing . Such a decision calls for assessment, forrecognition of presented opportunity in both karma and service, and for discreetdecisions in relation to your activities upon the Path.It is easy to overestimate the importance of any particular incarnation upon thepath of life; it is easy to foster the consciousness of the personality in timeand space, and thus fail to register the “insight” of the soul, regulatingtimelessness and knowing no past or future, but only a sense of Being (faintlyand dimly, because this sense is a monadic prerogative) and of relationship(strongly and urgently).Some souls in incarnation need constantly to spur their personalities on toaction; they require to urge them to achievement and towards freedom frominertia. That is not a problem which confronts you, my disciple. For you, the“lesson of the interludes” is of major importance . I use this word in its mosttechnical sense and as the Masters use it when attempting to incline any lifewithin the Ashram into ways which are, for that unit of life, the essentialprocess for the immediate moment.In all breathing exercises, there are, as you know, the processes of inhalationand of exhalation, with two points intermediate between these two—that of theinterludes. Beginners in the mechanics of right breathing seem inevitablyengrossed with the processes involved, with the amount of air to be indrawn orout-breathed and with the consequent physiological effects and their ethericcorrespondence. Knowers and disciples pay small attention to this dual activity.They are preoccupied with what is proceeding within their consciousness duringthe interludes between the fixed inhalations and exhalations. These phases ofregistered consciousness are in reality points of detachment. They mark thecycles of tension and should be carefully studied and employed by you. This is apoint in your future development to which I earnestly call your attention.In my last instruction to you I gave you three words upon which to meditate andwhich were intended to constitute [452] the theme of your meditation workthroughout the year. By the means of these words you could be enabled to gaugeyour life processes and determine activity. By means of them also (rightly used)you can arrive at a real understanding of the Law of Cycles—in your own life, inthe life of any related group, and in the life of humanity itself. They are alsoclosely related, as you can well imagine, to the rhythm of breathing. It mightbe regarded in the following way, holding the suggested relations in mind:1. Inhalation . . . . Focus . . . . . . . . . . . . Life centralisation.2. Interlude . . . . . Point of Tension . . . .Initiation of causes.3. Exhalation . . . .Crisis . . . . . . . . . . . . Production of effects.4. Interlude . . . . . Recognition . . . . . . . Prelude to refocussing.These phases of activity—both positive and negative—can be applied in allaspects of life and in all activities. You can experience them and institutethem as a personality, and the entire effect of these phases will then becontained within the personality life of the three worlds; you are meanwhile inprocess of learning them as a soul and as a disciple, and for the remainder ofyour life they should establish the rhythm of your effort; later, upon the Pathof Initiation, you will re-learn this same process on the highest possible turnof the spiral within the planetary rhythm—but that time is not yet.As I give you this individual instruction, my brother, I would enjoin upon youthe need to establish this rhythmic, cyclic “breath of consciousness.” Ponder onthis phrase and make this objective a matter of real importance to you until thetime comes when you will work upon inner levels, free of the physical body; youwill find the effort both interesting and also practical.Let these four stages condition the pattern of your daily meditation. Let themalso mark the pattern of your daily life, indicating the gathering in of thesources of supply for that life of service which is your aspiration (I refer atthis point to the meditation process, practised daily). Let them mark also thecarefully planned and silently implemented allocation [453] of such energies tothe arranged duties of the day, and to the active outer task of breathing forthinto the world of men that which it is your duty to contribute. Then let therebe the final interlude of recognition.The point I seek to emphasise to you is the need —imperative and permanent wherethe remainder of your life is concerned—for the interludes . These interludesare, for you, the growing times; they are essentially the “epochs for storage”(if I may use such an arresting and unusual phrase), and they are the “seed ofsamadhi.” What is samadhi, from the initiate point of view and esotericallycomprehended? Simply those interludes in the initiate’s life of service whereinhe withdraws all his forces into a “well of silence”—a well, full of the waterof life. In this state of consciousness two definite activities transpire:Tension and Recognition. Without these interludes of abstraction, his work wouldslowly weaken as the tension, earlier initiated, weakened; his ability toattract and to hold others true to the vision would likewise slowly disappear,as his power to recognise became myopic. The initiate, therefore, as he workswithin the Ashram, withdraws at the needed times. As he inhales the life of theHierarchy, and increasingly that of the Monad (which he gradually learns to do),and as he exhales the living essence into the “world of serving lives,” hebecomes steadily more and more dependent upon the “interludes” wherein boththese phases of activity cease and he becomes immersed in Being and inConsciousness—the intrinsic parts of the animating Whole. I use this phrase“animating Whole” advisedly to indicate that the points of interlude are notrelated to form life at all, but to the life of Life itself.Am I being too abstract with you, my brother? I believe not. As I look aheadinto your future and sense the quality of your life, I know that the keynote ofyour inner programme should be ever the recognition of the essential demand ofyour soul for rhythmic interludes; your personality emphasis should be,therefore, upon this withdrawing. I refer not to the withdrawing from outerservice but to an inner, constant, cyclic attitude of determined and plannedabstraction.[454] If you will study your ray combinations, you will note that you have onlyone of your ray energies along the line of the first ray—that is the ray of theseventh type of energy. All your other rays are related to the great Second Rayof Love-Wisdom. This necessarily constitutes a problem until you remember thatthe seventh ray is the ray of interlude—an interlude and a ray which becomesactive when the attractive, magnetic work of the building rays is ready toprecipitate into the phenomenal world and bring about—under the Law of Ritualand of Divine Ceremonial—new phases of work. These are initiated in the silenceof the process of abstraction, released when the interlude of tension hascompleted its work, and become effective when the interlude of recognition hasmade a new refocussing possible.I am not going to indicate to you the lines along which your service, as adisciple in my Ashram, should proceed. You have already initiated certainactivities, both in your personality life through your marriage and in the worldthrough the order which you have attempted to establish. With that which youhave started you must proceed; and you can regard these words either as astatement of fact, as a predictory announcement, or as a command from your ownsoul. But your success in both these departments of life will depend upon youreffective use of “interludes.” Only you can determine their timing, and this—tobe successful—will require the application and the recognition of need, but alsothe recognition of unfolding spiritual opportunity.As a beginning, and in order to help you to find the length of your cycles ofinhalation and exhalation, I would suggest that you attempt to place one of theinterludes at the time of the full moon each month, and the second interludemight come at the close of every three months of work, at the time of the thirdnew moon. You will have to work this out for yourself, but in doing so you couldestablish a basic rhythm in your life which you would never regret. You couldwork along the following lines of rhythmic abstraction:1. Twelve brief, abstract monthly interludes at the time of the twelve yearlyfull moons. [455]2. Four brief quarterly abstractions at the time of the four new moons,dependent upon the date of the initial, major interlude.3. Two longer periods of interludes or of abstraction at the time of May andJune full moons.These points of inner abstraction, of interludes in your subjective life, can becarried on without interfering with your objective life of service, ofobligation and of duty. I commend these three words to you also as three themesfor meditation.Last year I gave you the three words: Focus, Tension, Crisis. For this comingyear I give you another three: Obligation, Service, Duty. For the year beginningSeptember, I give you: Emotion, Intuition, Wisdom. You have, therefore, themesfor three years’ work in the meditation field and “as a man thinketh in hisheart, so is he.” When you have covered these nine themes for reflection, Iwould suggest that you start again, thus establishing a three year cycle in yourprocess of rhythmic mental building.Keep close to your group brothers. Seek to establish a contact—subjective andreal—with F.C.D. who is so close to you in nature, though with more first raystrength. Whether you ever work for and with him on the outer plane is of nogreat matter. The need is for you to work with him on the inner planes, givinghim what support you can, and receiving from him the strength that you need.Some time, during each morning meditation, I would request you to call him byname three times, and then to send out your heart’s thoughts to him. A linkwould thereby be established which you would never regret.And as for your relation to me, my brother—naught can change that. You areintegrated into my Ashram; you have my confidence and trust; the love of yourbrothers in the outer group of the Ashram surrounds you at all times. Seek toget in touch with me every Full Moon period, and expect results.My love and blessing rest upon you, and the service of my Ashram holds you.[456]~MY BROTHER: August 1946I have for you today naught but a happy recognition. You have proceeded withyour life task with patience, serenity and foresight. The dual life of adisciple (covering personality obligations and the chosen field of soul service)is being successfully attempted by you. Where the word “success” is used, Iwould remind you that the Master neither sees nor notices the small failures,the moments of distress or disturbance or the personality frictions which (fromthe angle of the observing disciple) seem to mar the picture. At intervals—rareat first but more frequent when the service rendered attains greaterimportance—the Master makes Himself aware of the general progress, the growth ofthe general structure of service which the disciple is creating and theextension of his light in the world. It amuses us at times to note that somedisciples (particularly those trained in the earlier, personality-taintedgroups) believe the Masters pry into their daily lives, know their petty faultsand silly little failures and are fully aware of all they think and do. Wewonder sometimes where they think the Masters find the time, and why They shouldbe so interested in habits of thought and action and speech which the discipleis rapidly overcoming.We are only interested in the good which any individual may be demonstrating;only the good reaches us, except in the case of an entire group where the groupinterplay, the group action and the group effect does affect the Ashram. Thequality of the vibration which is felt when contacting you is of the nature ofharmlessness and of goodwill to all men.I am pleased that you are following along the line of your second ray energy,and are occupied with seventh ray activity; that means that, inspired by thesense of unity which is inherent in the soul, you are working on the physicalplane (the point of expression for the seventh ray) and bringing spirit andmatter together. Remember always that this ray which is again coming into cyclicmanifestation is the one [457] that relates the new and incoming spiritualenergy and the substance or matter aspect which will respond to it, utilise itand eventually give it due form. Know therefore clearly what it is you areattempting to do.The main hierarchical need today (apart from its need for workers) is theforming everywhere of such groups as yours, the relating of group with groupwithin the range of influence of that super group, the Hierarchy. Such groupsare forming now in their thousands and are to be found in every land, and theywill eventually blend and fuse together into one great movement of goodwill,which is spirit in actual expression. Aspirants everywhere, Arcane Schoolstudents the world over, and my group of special workers such as yourself, mustcontact these groups, bringing them together on one point only, and that isGoodwill. Each group must necessarily be left free to proceed with its owndestiny and mode of work. Unity is a necessary ideal and is the reverse side ofGoodwill. Unitedly, when the right time comes, these groups must issue a greatmanifesto to the world—identical manifestos being issued in each country by allthe groups who stand for world unity and goodwill. Thus they will make the word“goodwill” carry power throughout the planet, whilst the disciples and aspirantswill, through their thought, make the word “unity” carry hidden power. Thus avast band of men of goodwill will be working unitedly, yet independently, andthere will be made available—in moments of world crisis—an organised, ready andworld-wide public opinion of such strength and organisation that it cannot beignored.Your life pattern, my brother, is now established; seek not unduly to change it,but seek to make your home a centre of spiritual light, and seek to make yourorder so vibrant, so alive, that other groups may gain stimulation from it. Youhave therefore a full life’s work, and in that all aspects of your nature willfind full mode of expression. For disciples, only those tasks which call forththe full quota of innate effectiveness are of real value.Should you find it possible, I would ask you to aid (to the utmost of yourability) your brother disciple, F.C.D., whose rays are closely allied withyours. He has thrown himself into [458] a supremely difficult task ... and hisfuture work will not be easy. Help him; he is one of our agents who is worthy ofall aid, and though temporarily in my Ashram, is a powerful worker in the Ashramof K.H.—his Master and mine. You can work also with power with J.W.K-P. whoserays, with one difference, are the same as yours.In twenty-five years’ time enough work will have been done by groups such asyours so that the pattern of unity in the world will be distinctly seen. Thetheory will be comprehended and much straight application will be made. Unitywill become a definite world goal in a sense different to the present one. Thewords “The souls of men are one” will be recognised doctrine of every worldfaith. So go on with the work of unifying, my brother—in rain or shine.I have asked myself what I could suggest to you for meditation. The vision youhave, and I believe will never lose it. Definitely planned meditation is not soeasy for you, and yet—in order to make the vision factual—meditation is a basicessential, for just as it remains eternally true that “as a man meditateth inhis heart so is he,” it is also equally true that as a man meditateth in hishead so will his vision appear on Earth. A great safeguard for you exists in theelimination of all personality problems—yours or those of anyone else—from yourcurrent meditation project; that project you will have to set for yourself eachyear, and adhere to it. Its theme must grow out of the work of unifying—out ofthe work you have set yourself.My brother, link humility with that task; seek not to link groups with yourgroup, but recognise your group and all other similar groups as parts of aworldwide spiritual movement which (when it reaches momentum) results in unityfor all. A super-organisation which emphasises unity is the last thing to bedesired; a multiplicity of living organisms held loosely together bycooperation, constant communication and possessing identity of goal and ofpurpose is what the world needs today....I assign you no specific meditation. Work out your own, but let it adhere to thegeneral concept with which I have constantly presented all of you. You can (onyour own and as [459] an accepted disciple) seek entrance into the life of theAshram and thus contact me. This may take time, but the link is strong andelastic (ponder on that term) and adherence to the rules will ensure success.My blessing rests upon you and on your aspiration.~TO F. C. D.MY BROTHER: August 1940The past few months have been extremely difficult for you, have they not. TwiceI have myself felt the necessity to envelop you with shielding care and stand asa wall between you and circumstance. Are you conscious of these two contacts?They came at moments of extreme fatigue and tension. The future also holds foryou much anxiety and of this I warn you, for to be prepared is—in the case ofsensitive, imaginative disciples—a great deal of help. It is conditions morethan circumstances which will cause the anxiety. Can you understand thedistinction? Racial, national, and personal conditions meet in your life andcreate a perfect whirlpool of difficulty and a mixture of glamour and reality.Disciples work hard (as you have ever done) to render their relation to humanityinclusive and they struggle to bring about those conditions which will producethis desirable expanded consciousness. But they oft forget that this expansionof consciousness will not make them susceptible only to superhuman influencesand inclusive of soul conditions, but must necessarily include also allintermediate stages of awareness as well as the power to include the reactions,mental and emotional conditions and the pain and suffering of bewildered andsorely tried humanity. It includes also its joys and aspirations.The glamour of an extreme sensitivity is your major handicap, my brother, anddefinitely limits your usefulness. The solar plexus is wide open to allimpressions. But you, as a soul, are quite indifferent and—as a soul—you suffernot at all. Of this I believe you are conscious. Spring free, therefore, [460]upon the physical plane from all psychic impressions, via the solar plexus, andseek instead to register only those impressions and contacts which concern yourservice and deal with man’s next definite step forward. Watch this process withcare in your life. Your extreme psychic sensitivity and impressionability (of avery high order, I must admit, but nevertheless of a personality nature) must beovercome by a paralleling extreme spiritual sensitivity. This again I think yourealise, and you know also that this spiritual tendency is accompanied in you bya corresponding powerful, physical and mental inertia. The potency of yourastral activity depletes the other two points of the personality triangle. Yourspiritual knowledge is so real that you will apprehend my meaning withoutfurther extended elucidation.You are, my brother, upon the path of the Christ, and in preparation fortreading this path of aiding and salvaging humanity, you have to learn (throughintense feeling) the futility of emotion and feeling as a means of salvagingyour brothers. You need to acquire that divine indifference which leaves thesoul free to serve—untrammelled by personality reactions, for that is what allsolar plexus conditions basically are.Above, I gave you one important hint or imparted fact, as the case may be, whenI said that the “potency of your astral activity depletes the other two pointsof the personality triangle.” Your problem this life has been the same as thatof A.A.B.—the transfer of energy from the solar plexus to the heart. The firststage of that process is, esoterically speaking, the discovery of how potent isthe astral polarisation of all your personality forces; the entire focus of yourlife is upon the highest level of the astral plane. This in your case (not inthat of A.A.B.) has led to the withdrawal of energy from the physical body (theetheric body), leading to physical debility and fatigue and also to a pronouncedinability to “ground” yourself upon the physical plane. It has also broughtabout a considerable depletion or enervation of the Will aspect. I refer herespecifically to the will aspect as it produces physical plane expression ofdirected soul activity as the intelligence (focussed in the mind) must conditionit. I do not refer to [461] the will in the sense of any fluctuation of yourspiritual aspiration or failure to progress undeviatingly towards your goal. Butit must surely be apparent to you that if the focus of all your energiesinherent in the personality life and also those inpouring from the soul is theastral body, then there must certainly be a condition of attrition or ofsemi-starvation of the etheric body (determining the physical condition) andalso of the mental body. This militates against the full manifestation of a veryfine mental equipment. I am putting the problem quite clearly to you, becauseyou are a tried and trusty disciple. Before you can take the initiation forwhich you are being prepared, there must be a change of life focus and atransfer of energy from the astral body into the mental body, and consequentlyfrom the solar plexus to the heart.In this process, the group meditation should materially help and I advise you tofollow it with real care. I advise also that you endeavour in the differentcircumstances of your life to insulate yourself (for selfless purpose) from tooclose a contact with those in distress. Aid them; love them; but do not identifyyourself with them. I speak of an astral insulation and not of a refusal to meetand contact suffering humanity upon the physical plane. I refer to an attitudeassumed and held by the soul and mind in regard to the astral body which enablesyou to express that divine indifference to feeling and to personal suffering asa result of that compassion which is the hallmark of the salvaging ElderBrothers of Humanity. Such is your basic problem.Because of this, you will have to watch the earlier effects of this groupmeditation with care so that the solar plexus is not unduly stimulated, and thusyour difficulty increased.I wish also to give you a personal meditation which will, I believe, proveuseful. It is more in the nature of an exercise and its results are based uponyour ability to focus yourself in the soul consciousness and to hold thatposition undeviatingly. It is dependent also upon the power of sustainedimagination which you may possess and is a good exercise in constructivecreative work. It is also rendered more effective if aided by the will and asyour mental body is on the first ray and as this work is largely the steadywithdrawal of energy [462] to the mental body, you should find it relativelyeasy and possible to get the desired results.1. Focus yourself in the head. Sound the OM as the soul and believe that contacthas been made between soul-mind-brain.2. Then see yourself as focussed esoterically upon the mental plane and (fromthe angle of the soul) exoterically in the brain.3. Then inhale deeply, drawing the breath up from the solar plexus in the spineand seeing that upward moving breath carrying the solar plexus energy up thespine into the head, after passing it through the heart. Believe that this takesplace.4. In the interlude between inhalation and exhalation dedicate the energy thuswithdrawn by the soul, believing in its consequent and subsequent transmutation.(I would remind you that transmutation is the changing of one vibration and onevibratory activity into another and higher one.)5. During exhalation—in which the breath is carried on the OM soundedinaudibly—breathe the solar plexus energy, now focussed in the head, to thethroat centre. This should produce increased creative output for humanity.6. In the following interlude, after exhalation, go over in your mind(pictorially) as a sort of recapitulation, what you have done.OM. OM. OM.Repeat this exercise three times and do this transference exercise three times aday. Do not look for results . A year’s steady work with a detached attitude asto these results will be needed before you yourself will recognise difference ofreaction and lessened emotional activities.This exercise, coupled to the group meditation, will (as you will haveundoubtedly noted) produce in the long run the linking up of the three centresabove the diaphragm—the heart, the head and the throat. The exercise just given[463] must be done before the group meditation as it is of the nature of aclearing exercise. If done properly, it will hasten the results of the groupmeditation for it will clear the solar plexus of undesirable emotional force andleave “room for reception,” as the process is sometimes technically called. Truelove will then take the place of emotion, and compassion will be substituted forpity; understanding will take the place of apprehension of suffering.Disciples are apt often to think that the injunction to identify themselves withother people must involve complete identification with all their experiences,moods and reactions. It does not. It should not. It involves identification(through the intuition) with underlying soul purpose and a consequent ability tointerpret and explain the present. Ponder on this, my beloved brother.~August 19421. You have given all you had to give. Now take it back enriched. Then giveagain.2. Peace is to you the clearest light of all. The lessons of the dark havelikewise been revealed. Pass out between the two.3. The best is yet to be. Hold thou to Me.4. The bridge of light is firmly built and on it you can move this way or that,but always on the Way.5. The sorrows of the Cross of Man have weighted thee down but not submerged orblotted out the light. The joy of resurrection lies ahead.6. Love is thy note and wisdom is thy guide. You need naught else but fire.~MY BROTHER AND MY CO-WORKER: September 1943I am not telling your co-disciples whether you are on this side of theseparating veil or not. I am not informing them whether you have crossed the“bridge of light,” to which I referred in my last communication to you. You needtheir [464] protective love, no matter whether you are here or there; theturmoil on the other side is so great—as great as the turmoil on the physicalplane. Whether you are in the body or out of the body, you are thereforepeculiarly vulnerable, because, my brother (as I have told you oft during thepast years), your intense sensitivity has complicated your life problem. Yourkarma . . . holds you back from that complete freedom and liberation which youdeeply desire. Only those who have achieved freedom can return to that groupwith immunity and helpfulness in their hands—the group from which they have beenfreed.I have for you a suggestion. I will not call it an order, for no Master evergives commands, and in any case you belong to the Ashram of K.H. and will havereceived your instructions direct from Him. He feels as I do, that in thepressure and anxiety and in your psychic participation in the fate of yourcountry and in your sensitive reaction to racial strain, the import of Hisconversation with you a year ago may not have registered adequately. It has beendifficult for you and well-nigh impossible to concentrate on planning. I amtherefore going to summarise for you what He then said. The group protectionaccorded you (greater than perhaps you realise) enables me to reach you moreeasily at this time than can any other member of the Hierarchy. I can find andreach you with a minimum expenditure of force.Your Master, K.H., asked you at that time if you were ready to begin work inpreparation for a definite assignment upon the Path of World Saviours.Assignment after assignment in connection with groups, nations, races andincreasingly large units is ever the mode of developing a world Saviour untilthe time comes when he can make a world impact and achieve a measure of worldsalvaging. Many times in the past, I have pointed out to you that you were onthat most difficult path of service. K.H. desired to find out if you wereprepared to accept your first major assignment upon that Way. When you assentedand told Him that you would do what you could but that you had no innerconfidence in yourself, owing to the pressures of the time which appeared to youto have a definitely disintegrating effect on your [465] vehicles, He reassuredyou and told you that the potent inner unfoldment of your love nature and yourcomplete decentralisation were a vital protection. He also informed you that—atthe stage of spiritual development which you had attained—the aura of His Ashramand the aura of mine would act as a shield, and that the resources of bothAshrams were behind you. This, my brother, you know well, and to this fusedefficiency you can testify. . . .I have said enough here to enable you again to resume your active position as apledged initiate-disciple (a position which your co-disciples have everrecognised as yours), and I have shown you definitely how valuable has been toyou the last immediate experience.... Though you are a trained disciple of K.H.,you are still working in my Ashram, as I remain in close touch with worldaffairs in relation to their immediate working out, whilst K.H., being a Chohan,is more active in the handling of the deeper incentives and purposes, and ofthose matters which will not materialise until such time as the work done by me,and others associated with the Great White Lodge and of like rank and of lesserrank, is completed or at least well on the way to fruition.The work assigned to you, my beloved brother, will be work of profoundestdifficulty. You will meet with rebuff from those you seek to help and ... findvery little understanding; you will meet with encouragement and assistance fromthe enlightened among the New Group of World Servers, and this will make yourwork possible but it will also greatly handicap you. . . .Are you big enough for this inadequately outlined task, my brother? Is yourstamina, your inner spiritual orientation and your fixed psychic determinationadequate to the undertaking? Can you do it with your present psychic equipment,or must you build new bodies for integration, use and service? The decisionrests with you, for those who tread the Way of a World Saviour are leftpeculiarly free (owing to certain difficulties in time and space within theplanetary life) and must work as they will, with what they choose to offer andwith a trained understanding of their task.Such was the gist of your interview with your Master. [466] You can now go forthfrom where you are with the endorsement of your Master, with the aid and backingof myself and of A.A.B. and, at all times, the protective aura of K.H.; and—withreverence I would call your attention to this—an aspect of the aura of theChrist is incorporated in that lesser aura.In my last communication to you I stated that “love is thy note and wisdom isthy guide. You need naught else but fire.” That fire, my brother, is the residueof the pure fire which is left when you have trodden upon and passed the burningground, through the Portal into the Presence . That you have done. The fire isthere, and on it you can count if you seek to destroy opposition, to burn downbarriers (inherent in yourself or presented by others), and also to blaze atrail straight from your heart into the heart of others....I stand by you, my brother, unalterably and at all times, and on this you cancount. Such is also the wish of K.H., my Brother and also my Master, and on thatyou can also count. I am giving you no set form of meditation. Reflection anddeep, considered concentration upon the work which I have outlined to you, andwhich your Master wants to see you do, is for you adequate spiritual focussing.The deep love of all your group brothers is yours, and many, many people aretoday sending love to you and many, many minds are thinking of you with thoughtsof gratitude, of strength, of faith and hope. On this too you must count. Thepath of a world Saviour is, as you know, a hard one, but of compensations whichfar outweigh the difficulty. My blessing is yours and my hand is ever stretchedout to you in helping.~November 1944It is not my intention, my beloved brother, to give you any personalinstructions at this time. Those given you during the past three years stillneed consideration, assimilation and factual demonstration. I simply take, atthis time, those needed inner steps which are permitted to the Master of anyAshram in order to draw you into a very close relation to myself and to thegroup. Such a definite and close relation [467] produces healing andstrengthening; it also permits of such a clear vision that the picture unfoldsas a unity and the past is seen freed from karma. This sentence may mean much toyou, if subjected to the inner insight, or it may mean little. It is, however,of major significance to you personally, and to no one else in this group.In your question, my brother (about the nature and the function of thecounterparts in the head of the various chakras, and how to bring about a betteradjustment between the heart centre and its counterpart in the head), you havevoiced an exceedingly esoteric inquiry, and one that will warrant the mostcareful consideration and phrasing on my part. The reason for this is that asyet little is known (even in the esoterically instructed East) in regard to thehead centre. This profound ignorance has not been realised, even by advancedstudents. The thousand-petalled lotus remains a secret, or closed mystery.Though much has been given out in connection with the heart centre, little hasbeen communicated in connection with the head centre. The reason that more isknown about the heart centre is due to its being the centre awakened by thehighest initiation in Atlantean times. In our Aryan race the head centre is theobjective of all stimulation—even the stimulation of the other centres beingnoted in relation to the effect upon the head centre. The race as a whole,however, is only just beginning to be ready for this awakening. Hence thecomplete silence hitherto held upon this subject.Adeptship was achieved in the Atlantean race when the heart centre was alive andits twelve petals unfolded. The fourth initiation, which confers the status ofadeptship, produced the mystic realisation, the unfoldment of the lotus of theheart and the deep conviction of the pairs of opposites, yet at the same timethe knowledge that the phenomenal reality and the spiritual reality were one andthe same reality. Thus the Atlantean attainment established in the consciousnessof its adepts, through initiation, the duality of all creation.The Aryan unfoldment will produce occult identification, the development of thehead centre, and the realisation of [468] unity. “I and the Father are One.”This constituted the real achievement of the Christ, Who was the first of ourhumanity to achieve the complete realisation. This point is of vital interest.Our present Masters of the Wisdom have also entered into this same recognition.The distinction between Them and the Christ is that He added to this realisationthe capacity to be a channel, pure and undefiled by any form ofself-identification, for a cosmic principle—that of Love. Only those Masters,however, Who reached adeptship in Atlantean times are dowered with this occultunfoldment. Disciples are apt to forget that the Masters Themselves are atvarious stages upon the path of Their peculiar evolution.You will see, therefore, that the establishing of the significance of thecounterparts in the head to the heart centre, for instance, involves one of thegreat mysteries to be revealed at a certain high initiation. In the next greatrace, which succeeds upon this one, the goal will be—above everything else—adual one. It will be:1. The conscious unity of the lower centres by means of a great awakening of thesolar plexus centre. This next race will be buddhic or intuitional, andtherefore will embody, as a higher expression upon the turning spiral, thehigher mystery of the astral unfoldment in ancient Atlantis. It will visionforth the higher correspondence of that achievement. This consummatingdevelopment will mark its fourth initiation, and will demonstrate thetransmutation of the astral life into the buddhic consciousness.2. The carrying of all this mobilised energy to the heart centre at the fifthinitiation for group purposes, and the achieving of this in full wakingconsciousness.In the final race the process will be repeated on a still higher spiral, and allthat concerns the higher centre will be unfolded and occultly consummated, againthrough the medium of two stages:1. Wherein the massed energies of the solar plexus (the [469] great clearinghouse) and the heart and throat will be carried—at the third initiation—to theajna centre, and the complete racial “transfiguration” will take place.2. The process will then be carried forward and at the fourth initiation theenergies will be centralised in the head centre.This will lead to a happening of such esoteric significance that I cannotexpress even its dimmest meaning to you because I myself do not know . It liestoo far ahead, even for all Who are the Masters of the Wisdom at this time. Onlythe Christ and the Buddha begin dimly to sense its meaning.Therefore I cannot answer your question because until the head centre issomewhat more awakened my explanation would be meaningless. All I dare say isthat by the use of creative imagination, by a constant application to the way ofthe head, and constant group activity, with an increasing capacity to bedetached, and therefore not so potently identified with the individualconsciousness, you yourself can perhaps get a faint glimmer of light as to thatvibrant reality of which the heart is the reflection.One thing I can add. As I told you before, the activity of the heart centrenever demonstrates in connection with individuals. This is a basic fact. Whatdevastates most disciples is the solar plexus ability (when purified andconsecrated) to identify itself with individuals. The heart centre cannot react,except under group impetus, group happiness or unhappiness, and other grouprelations. This may give you a needed hint. It is a subject which you will dowell deeply to consider, and to discuss with A.A.B. who—like yourself—is also onthe difficult path of teaching and of world salvage.~MY BELOVED BROTHER: August 1946You will have, by now, read and absorbed the papers and communications whichhave been held for you until the close [470] of the war and the attainment ofphysical safety for you. There has been no great need for me to express myselfon the situation which has existed, for the closeness of the link between theMaster K.H., myself and you ensures understanding and precludes waste of time.You have come through a period of great difficulty and danger with no loss ofyour spiritual grip upon essential reality or of your spiritual vision; yourstrength has been such that you have lifted your family with you and safeguardedthem also all the time. Having achieved one pinnacle of spiritual success,another can be glimpsed, and between the two pinnacles lies a field of service,a sphere of danger, a land of glamour and deep morasses through which you muststruggle, until the point of attainment planned by your soul for this life isyours. You can achieve, and for your aiding, I and A.A.B. stand ready.A debate arose between your Master (K.H.) and myself. You had been sent (orloaned if I might call it so) to aid in my Ashram. We discussed the subject asto whether the sufferings of the past few years did not warrant your return tothe Ashram of K.H.; the work there would be hard but not of the same kind, andthere would not be so much need for contact work on the physical plane. Iclaimed that you were strong enough for the dual test; K.H. felt that youprobably were, but that there was no need to ask a disciple always to drink thecup of sacrifice to its very last drop—not at least until the crucifixioninitiation is your right. The task today proffered you, and its incidentalstrain and suffering, will be of another kind and the pain endured will belargely mental, but “you can take it,” as the saying is. It was decided to letyou attempt the task demanded for three years or for seven (according to yourown choice) and then, if you decide to do no more along the indicated lines, youcan relinquish the task . . . with no sense of failure. This work can beundertaken only by people who, like yourself, repudiate without any difficultyall separative attitudes and who ever act and think in terms of the one humanityand with inclusive love. You, my brother, meet all these requirements. . . .This work is most definitely part of my work . . . and I shall be in touch [471]with you at frequent intervals. On that statement you can emphatically rely.Your meditation work must keep pace with your vision. I suggest that you followthe simple outline which I call “The Pinnacles,” and give much time for quietthought and for impression . Know that guidance will be given—given step by stepas needed. My love enfolds you, and the way into my Ashram stands open wide foryou.~MY BROTHER AND MY FRIEND: November 1948It is two years since I last communicated with you, via A.A.B., and they havebeen years of great stress and strain for you. Every disciple in these troubledtimes carries three kinds of stress; no, my brother, I would say the majorstresses are of four kinds:1. There are the stresses and the strains incident to the disciple’s family lifeor his immediate daily relationships, and of these you have had your full share.2. There are stresses and strains due to the deep interior life of soulrelation; these bring with them their own unique difficulties which can beshared with no one (except the Master, when the disciple has reached the pointof unfoldment which you have now reached), and yet which bring about a life ofinner tension which can lead inevitably to the next point of revelation.3. There are the problems and circumstances which arise out of the period inwhich our modern humanity lives; these today are unique and of disturbingimportance; they involve the balancing of values which is going on in everydepartment of human living and which evokes in the disciple an almostunendurable pain and anxiety.4. There are also peculiar complications and tests which have their origin inashramic relationships which the disciple realises through his contact with theAshram. [472] These are the result of his attempt to lift the burden of humanityand the measure of his understanding of the Plan, in unison with the entireHierarchy. This produces an inevitable crisis and constitutes a load which—whenadded to the other three spheres of difficulty—often make the disciple feel thathis cross (his vertical and his horizontal life) is more than he can bear. TheFixed Cross becomes a reality, and he begins to learn its true meaning.All these four types of difficulties are further enhanced when you consider thefact that they are felt in all three aspects of the disciple’s personalitysimultaneously. There is a reaction in his etheric body, in his emotionalvehicle and in his mind. This makes what is sometimes called the “seven divinesorrows”; these are symbolically and most inaccurately depicted in the Christiandiscipline as the seven stations of the Cross. As I told you elsewhere (Atreatise on the Seven Rays (Estoteric Astrology), Vol. III. Page 476) “from thestandpoint of Christian symbolism (even though the interpretation is as yetinadequate) these seven crises correspond to the seven stations of the Crosswhich mark the way of an advancing world Saviour.” Here again you have the fourand the three brought together in a synthesis of service, of discipline and ofunfoldment.All these factors have been active in your life, my brother and co-disciple. Iwould like to commend you on one point. You have proceeded with your Ashramwork, your thinking and your service in spite of all that has been going on.This has been noted by us and it is for this quality of spiritual stability thatwe watch. The field of your work remains the same; it is part of your karmicobligation which may not be avoided, but the mode of work and the nature of thework which should be done will have to be altered for reasons which I amconfident you will understand. . . .I have, as you will have noted, said little to you about yourself and your ownspiritual development. The war taught many disciples that it is in serving andin thinking through that true wisdom comes; they came to realise that in [473]enlightening others the radiance of the glory of God can be revealed. This youhave learned and from henceforth you enter in a new stage of discipleship andcan be regarded as one who can teach himself.The work outlined for you will require only one discipline for you and that is ahard one. It is the drastic organising of your time, irrespective of personalityclaims, or the hindrances of an etheric body which is too loosely knit, and asensitivity which makes life very hard for you. The great need of the servicewhich you can render and the desperate task involved in the reorganisation ofyour time and plans will do much to offset the above difficulties and—in time—to cure them. You do not, my brother, belong to your family any more. Youbelong to humanity—a lesson which A.A.B. had much difficulty in learning.I give you no meditation to follow. You may feel it necessary to make certainchanges in the one you are now doing; feel free to change where you deem itdesirable and seek constantly and daily a closer contact with your Master andwith mine—the Master K.H.Daily I look towards you, brother of mine, and that is no idle statement on mypart. Rest back on my understanding and call on me at need. Develop telepathicsensitivity to my voice—as I have developed it to yours.~TO R. A. J.MY BROTHER AND MY FRIEND: August 1940For you, as for all disciples at this time of world crisis, life has beenexceedingly difficult. This is not a platitudinous truism—in spite of A.A.B.remarking sub rosa that it was. She knows me so well that for years her commentshave proved a source of amusement to me and sometimes have proved most helpfulin aiding me to understand the occidental mind. I am an Oriental of the fourthroot race and although I have had two European incarnations I still at timesfail to grasp or understand the occidental reaction. But the [474] remark aboveis not simply fatuous, but contains in it the clue to your future. Yourdifficulties at this time stem largely from others more than from yourself; theyare instructive more than karmic.You have led a useful and fruitful life; there is still much for you to do whichwill enable you to lay the finger of love upon the hearts and lives of others;as you do so, you relate them to yourself and bring them under “the eye’sdirection.” The larger, wider work of a disciple has not, however, been yoursthis life. Your task has been preparatory to this, and—if you will carry thisrealisation in mind for the remainder of this incarnation—you will pass on intoa life cycle which will reveal to you the path which, as an initiate, you arechoosing to tread.In this connection, forget not, brother of mine, that the teaching rayconditions you and that there is a major difference between teaching as a humanbeing, no matter how good, and teaching as an initiate; it is as a pledgeddisciple that you will learn this basic distinction. It will also have adefinite effect upon your life.This thought gives me the chance to point out to you (and incidentally to yourgroup brothers) that many disciples today—who, like yourself, are not engaged inany spectacular world work—are engaged in establishing those contacts, here,there and everywhere, which will form the nucleus of that group of aspirants andof younger disciples which every senior disciple and initiate automaticallygathers around him. He does not, in any particular incarnation, go out into theworld and say: “I will gather a group which will form my future ashram.” If hedoes this, he will fail; if, however, he seeks to aid spiritually and tostimulate divinely those whom he meets in his daily round of duty, that tells adifferent tale. No one is then unimportant. Deliberately, he gathers people tohim because he steadily loves and helps. Some of these may be just passing by toother goals, and with them he has no permanent link; others send out to him aresponsive thread of understanding and request and—as his intuition develops—herecognises them as his own; he esoterically “intertwines [475] the thread of hislife with theirs,” thereby assuming responsibility and forming a more permanentlink, both in response and in karmic relationship. Both become indissolublylinked.You have touched many lives in your lifework as teacher, and you know andunderstand in some measure those who have responded to you—to you as anindividual and as someone to whom they can look for some measure ofunderstanding. For the remainder of your life, I would ask you to have thesethoughts in mind and begin to lay a planned foundation for the future. This ismy definite work i nstruction for you at this time. It will entail a task ofwatchful observation, of a determined going out to help wherever that help maybe needed. You have, in many ways, what I have referred to in my own mind as Ihave watched you, as a very well-managed inferiority complex—so well managedthat you do not permit it to be a real hindrance; it is one which neverthelessexists and at times presents to you a problem. I would also ask you to ignore itincreasingly, and in the decisions which you will have to make during the nexttwelve months please act with a positive belief in yourself and, withoutquestioning, choose the field of largest opportunity.~August 19421. The note sounds clear for you today, my chela and my friend. It is the hiddennote of sacrifice. But sacrifice is not the thing you think it is.2. The wisdom of the eye is yours. Let the radiation of your heart follow theeye’s direction.3. Live not upon the surface of events; you dwell deep at the centre and thesprings of life.4. The next ten years will hold for you three crises. Make them opportunitiesfor expansive work.5. The diadem, the robe of rose, the sandals on your feet and staff inhand—these are your proud possession.6. Draw near to me in closer personal touch, devoid of personality. This paradoxis clear. [476]~MY BROTHER: September 1943I wonder if you drew out of the six statements what they were intended to conveyto you of direction and instruction? To the fifth statement I seek to draw yourattention. Reference is there made to the “diadem, the robe of rose, the sandalson your feet.” What did these symbolic words convey to you? I mention thembecause I want to build your meditation for the next few months around theconcepts hidden by these word forms. The first three statements were fairlysimple for you to comprehend. The fourth conveyed a prophecy. The fifthcontained some Words of Power and were intended to instruct you as to the natureof your life-orientation and the desired quality of your service during thecoming ten years. They intimate that which you at this time possess but whichneeds increasing appreciation by you. Let me give you some idea as to theirsignificances:1. The Diadem . This is a dual symbol. It signifies accomplishment or thecrowning period of your life (and this you now face, if you so choose), and italso conveys the idea of a more definite and steady use of the head centre. Youare, of course, a “heart” person. The task ahead of you in your meditation workis to lift the energy of the heart centre into its correspondence in the headand begin to live more in the head than in the heart; you should begin also tofuse and blend the energy of this higher heart centre with that of the ajnacentre, thus bringing the “directing eye” into greater service, prominence andusefulness. It is toward this objective that the meditation here suggested by meis planned.2. The Robe of Rose . The symbolism here, my brother, is obvious. Rose is thecolour of devotion, and of that quality you have a full supply. It is however toits magnetic attractive quality, as it affects others rather than yourself, thatI seek to draw your attention. People of pledged devotion are those who havereached a point where that devotion is in no way a hindrance; it is seemingly asafeguard, [477] simplifying their lives. Because of that fixed devotion, theycan walk undeviatingly upon the Way. But they are apt to forget that—equallybecause of that devotion—they ray forth a quality which stimulates itscorrespondence in others. That is why sixth ray people can easily form a grouparound themselves. But they seldom succeed in holding those thus attracted forvery long, because they do not understand the reason for this facility andascribe it ever to wrong causes. Only your astral body is upon the sixth ray ofdevotion, but that makes it potent indeed and, in your case, produces that senseof inferiority to which I referred above. I would ask you to change your pointof view and to regard your sixth ray astral body as a powerful piece ofequipment to be used in service.In these two symbolic phrases we have related the heart centre to the headcentre, and likewise the heart centre to the astral body.3. The Sandals on the Feet . Here, in other words, you have a simple reminder ofthe underlying and motivating power of your entire life. This can be summed upin the flat statement of three truths—unalterable and fixed because imposed uponyour personality by your soul:a. You are treading the Path of Discipleship.b. You have arrived at a certain Ashram or centre of power upon that Path.c. You are intelligently aware of these facts and they are the majorconditioning factors in your life.You have consequently established a thought rhythm which naught can change andwhich will be a powerful incentive in deciding the time of your return when thisincarnation comes to an end, the type of vehicle which you will, as a soul,construct, and the nature of the race, nation and type of service to which theovershadowing soul will commit the personality. Energy follows thought. Adefinition of the personality might be expressed as follows: The personality ofa disciple is a focal point of energy, established by the soul.The “eye of direction,” therefore, referred to in Statement 2, relates primarilyto the long-distance view the soul [478] is taking of you and your preparationfor fuller service in the next life. A study of these three phrases will carryyou into the realm of quality, and not simply of symbolism; the concept of heartradiation, attractive power, and the responsibility of preparation emergeclearly in the three ideas underlying the meditation suggested below. Myproposal to you is that you do this meditation only twice a week—on Sundays andon one day in the middle of the week. On the other days you will simply carryforward the group reflective assignment with your group brothers. In this waythe days of your personal orientation in meditation will be gladly anticipatedevents. Will you try out this plan, my brother?Stage I. The Diadem.1. The establishing of relation between:a. The heart centre and the head centre.b. The heart centre in the head and the ajna centre.Thus a lesser triangle of energy or of “lighted, living relation” isestablished: heart, head and ajna centres.c. The waiting, dedicated, devoted personality and the soul.Thus a greater triangle is established: soul, head and heart.Visualise these triangles as relating and focussing your consciousness as far asmay be in the head, midway between the soul and the heart centre up thespine—and therefore using as that midway point the heart centre in the head.Avoid concentrating upon location. Just imagine the point of attainment as thatof the Diadem.2. Then reflect quietly upon the directive power of the soul:a. Working within the symbolic “diadem of attainment.”b. Using the impelling “eye of the soul” as a directing agent; i.e., the ajnacentre, or the centre between the eyebrows. [479]c. Then say the following words with full intent:“May that soul of mine whose nature is love and wisdom direct events, impel toaction, and guide my every word and deed.”Stage II. The Robe of Rose .1. The next undertaking is a conscious establishing of relation with othersthrough:a. The focussing of the power or energy of devotion within yourself so that itbecomes:1. A radiation affecting others.2. An attractive force relating them to you as their temporary source ofspiritual light.3. A magnetic influence, stimulating a new activity of their soul in connectionwith their personalities.b. An act of service, wherein you flood the personalities of those you areseeking to help, with the pure rose colour (most carefully visualised by you) ofspiritual devotion. This stream of warm rose and radiating light willesoterically drive them in devotion to their own souls and will not attract themto you—a thing which is never desirable.2. Then say with all the outpouring love of which you will increasingly findyourself capable:“Let the love of the soul attract and the light of the soul direct all whom Iseek to help. Thus will humanity be saved by me and all affiliated with theHierarchy.”Stage III. The Sandals on the Feet .1. Reflect more now in relation to yourself, and ponder upon the Path in threeways:a. The Path which you have travelled to my Ashram. This will involve the Past .b. The Path of Service which you seek to travel now, moving freely in and out ofmy Ashram. This involves the Present.c. The Path of Initiation for which you are being [480] prepared. This involvesthe Future —your future and its goal. You begin to realise yourself as apledged, devoted servant.2. Then in your own words, and aloud, you will dedicate yourself in a threefoldmanner to an increased conscious activity as an accepted disciple.3. Seek now—definitely and quietly and with a spirit of waiting anticipation—tocontact me, your Master and your friend. Expect results, though not at the timeyou anticipate.4. Sound the OM softly seven times.May peace and courage abide with you, my brother:~November 1944As I give you this personal instruction (one which can suffice you for thislife) I ask myself: What is the thing of greatest moment that I can say whichwill indicate the point of future emphasis, which will convey strength andpositive assurance, and which will enable you to prepare for the next great stepwhich immediately confronts you? Disciples seldom realise the responsibilitythat a Master shoulders as He seeks to prepare a group of people for worldservice; seldom do they understand the problem with which He is faced, even whendealing with the least advanced or dynamic among His neophytes. What are thefactors which He has to consider and which are potent enough to negate much ofHis effort (as has been the case in this group), and which frequently conditiona disciple to such an extent that he takes no definite steps to meet ashramicrequirements, even when, technically and theoretically, he admitsresponsibility? Let me tell you one or two of these for your guidance and theguidance of the group:1. The karma of the disciple . Of this, the disciple knows little and the Mastermuch; with that karma He may not interfere, because growth and developmenteventuate as the disciple meets the inevitability of events, [481] accepts hiskarma and works to offset it, actuated by right motive. Let me illustrate. TheMaster knows that it is the destiny of, and within the capacity of, a discipleto carry out a certain piece of work and thus to serve humanity in a particularmanner. He knows also that it is His duty to bring the disciple to the point ofcomprehension and to aid him in the accurate performance of this duty. But as Heconsiders the disciple’s karma, He finds that mortal disease will, in a fewyears’ time, lay the mechanism of accomplishment low and prevent both effort andaccomplishment. He therefore refrains from an educational process which wouldotherwise be obligatory upon Him.2. Faulty equipment . Oft a disciple, in a particular incarnation, lacks someneeded characteristic, or some desirable quality, either in his emotional natureor in one or other of the bodies. He may, for instance, have a fine physicalvehicle, great devotion and a brilliant intellect, but along with these, thequality of persistence is not present; the Master knows, therefore, that asteady cooperation and continuous effort is not yet possible. He dare not,consequently, incorporate the disciple (along with other members of His Ashram)in some designated piece of work and of service, because He knows that he willimperil the success of the joint endeavour. The group has therefore to proceedwithout the help which the disciple is otherwise competent to give.3. A blind spot . This is one of the most frequent deterrents which confront aMaster as He seeks to lead His disciples along the Way of Service. The disciplehas some one great outstanding weakness of which he is entirely oblivious andcompletely unaware. If told of its existence, he flatly, conscientiously andsincerely denies its presence. He violently affirms the opposite virtue orstrength. Yet all the time, this affirmation simply indicates the effort of hissoul to build in a quality which, when adequately strong, will result in theexpulsion of the deterring fault. As long as this [482] condition exists, it isnot possible for the disciple to be fully integrated into the Ashram, nor is itpossible to convince him that—in this specific connection—he is totally blind.Vision will eventually and inevitably come, but it will come as a result of thedisciple’s own effort and his self-initiated awakening; once awakened, neveragain will blindness be possible.4. An over-enthusiastic nature. This induces the disciple to rush wildly forwardin an effort to accomplish the indicated task, to prove to the Master hisstaunch determination, and to his fellow members in the Ashram his greatusefulness. This enthusiasm can wreck designated projects, shorten the life ofthe disciple, and thus interfere with his karma and make him a source ofamusement and concern to his group.All these factors, and several others still more subtle, have to be taken intoaccount by a Master, as well as the age, the background and the time cycles ofthe disciple.I would point out to you, therefore, that it lies entirely in your own hands toincrease your usefulness in the Ashram. If I were asked by you today what phaseof your development should receive your attention, I would reply: Seekconsciously and strenuously to overcome negativity. For you, a cultivated andconscious negativity has been an escape mechanism from the executive andadministrative nature of your life. Your soul has forced you for decades intothe position of an executive, superintending and administering agent. Basically,this ran counter to your natural inclination. Yet it was supremely necessary andeducational. Once however you had fulfilled the duties and obligations entailed,and had successfully and adequately carried out your task (which you alwaysdid), your personality—shrinking and sensitive—took refuge in a negativeattitude to people as a whole; you developed an insulation which made itdifficult for you to set up any major relation with other people.Yet, my brother, little as you may realise it, those relationships with others,and a positive interplay with those you contacted, were ever desired by thepeople you met; people [483] have always wanted to get closer to you; they havelonged to know you better and to be of service and of moment to you. As anexecutive, you were ever available; as a soul, within a personality, you havelived your own life apart from others; you have not been easy to contact or toknow; you were never responsive to approach, and your reactions to those whodesired contact have been negative, and this at times when you yourself wantedcloser rapport. Herein lies your task and your problem for the remaining yearsof your life. Learn, please, my brother, to be individually outgoing towards thepeople you meet and with whom life and circumstance bring you into association.Break loose—hard though it may be—from the thoughtforms which so powerfullycondition you, based frequently upon an inferiority complex; refuse to permitthe factors which so powerfully condition the trained, cultured person and theman who is the product of tradition, of good heritage and generations ofcivilised forbears to control you.Your work with children has also tended to set you apart and make you the victimof an enforced loneliness. You could ever be free and magnetic with them butthey intruded not upon the entrenched and enforced fortress of your being. Youmust now fit yourself to teach adults in your next incarnation, and this willnecessitate a different approach and one which will invoke and involve everyaspect of your being. The disciple teaches principally by what he is and bygiving all of himself to all whom he meets. He moves outward spontaneously whensomeone comes within range of his possibility of contact. This is almost unknownto you. The lesson, therefore, which the trained disciple has to master is oneof discernment. He needs to learn discrimination in contact if he is to avoid auseless, if well intentioned, promiscuity.The stage of the world is so set at this time that there is full opportunity foryou to find a wide sphere of contact, to work in full cooperation with otherpeople and with co-disciples, and thus to force yourself to release the magneticpower of your soul-infused personality. Your inner development is greater by farthan your outer expression; you need not, consequently, work with perseveranceat interior unfoldment; [484] you need to strain after outer ability to contact,to influence and to evoke response from all and sundry with whom your lot may becast. Rebuffs, misunderstandings and lack of response will be natural at firstuntil your “technique of contact” is discovered by you and established inaction. Each disciple develops his own technique. You have yet to discoveryours.As with some others, I give you three words upon which I would ask you toreflect as time elapses, and from which you can expect definite results if thereis any truth in the aphorism that “as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.”The first word which I would suggest is Contact . Much soul contact and contactalso with your group brothers on interior levels is easy for you and presents nodifficulties, even if you believe it not. You have a well established contactalong these lines, but your physical brain does not yet register it adequately.That is due entirely to conditions of insensitivity, inherent in your braincells, and is of no great moment. From the standpoint of your daily meditation,I would ask you to go forth to each day’s work with the intention ofmagnetically attracting (in order to help and serve) at least threepeople—either known to you or unknown. You might find it useful (at least for atime) to keep a diary of contacts; you should enter into it a conversation bymeans of which you got close to someone, a contact with some stranger whichseemed fruitful and interesting, or a joint piece of work which you carried outin full comprehension with someone else. This will develop in you an outgoingspirit and an interest in the whole process of contact. It is through contactsand the development of a resultant mechanism, plus a habit of magnetic rapport,which is the secret of all expansions of relationships, and this is preliminaryto initiation. Think on this, for it has its major importance to you.The second word which I want to give you is Impression. This word gives you muchscope for reflection, invoking as it does the entire problem of sensitiveresponse to inner contacts and outer relations. It is the key to the developmentof a trained psychologist and is a branch of that aspect of the universal mindwhich we call truth. The power of correctly [485] registered impression, theability rightly to interpret it and then to draw from it correct deduction, isthe secret of all diagnosis where psychology is concerned. When this is takeninto consideration by a disciple in relation to people contacted, it is ofenormous usefulness; impression—when analysed and the results of analysis areemployed—presents a most useful study, particularly to people like you.Finally, I would ask you to reflect upon the word Relationship. I would have youdo this with the specialised objective of understanding how you, as a disciplein training, can set up those relationships which will bring aid and strength toothers and thus sustain the work of the Ashram. I do not intend to enlarge uponthis as I want you to arrive at your own conclusions and knowledges.What I am really doing, my brother, is indicating to you the field of yourfuture training—a training which will engross the remainder of your life. Thistraining must be self-initiated and it must ever be undertaken in order to fityou to work in the Ashram, as a branch of the great Ashram of the Hierarchy. Youare peculiarly fitted for this work; you need only to release the magneticquality of your already developed nature and thus break down the barriers whichmay exist; thus you will find your field of service tremendously extended andyour potency brought into the field of a realised inclusiveness.~MY BROTHER: August 1946It is in no way your fault that this group on the physical plane is beingdisbanded until the next life cycle of the majority of the members has arrived.It is distressing that the work on the physical plane has to end, but a closeand honest analysis on the part of the group itself would probably show that themajor reaction is a blend of two reactions: first of all, that they could notintegrate and, secondly, a sense of loss because my communications with all ofyou have exoterically ended. Both of these are personality reactions. From thestandpoint of a Master Who knows the unimportance of [486] years, both of thesereactions are of small importance. Few of you are really young; some of you arequite old, though none of you are as old as I am; in a relatively short time allof you will drop the outer handicap of the physical body and be ready for afresh spiritual enterprise. Esoterically (if any of you so wish it), thesituation remains unaltered, provided you keep it so yourselves. The innercontact is still there, exactly as it was before; the goal ahead for each of youis just the same and the door into my Ashram stands wide open to those whofulfil the requirements.What, my brother, is basically your goal? Taking into consideration your ray andtype, it is to infuse your personality with soul energy. This is in the natureof a platitude and you may well respond that this is true of all aspirants. Thisis assuredly so, but your particular soul-objective in this life was to bringthis soul energy down from the subtler bodies into the three worlds so that theycan charge the brain. This charging will result in a hastened development ofsoul quality as it can be demonstrated upon the physical plane.As I have told you before, you are well developed on the inner planes, but yourexoteric expression of this inner unfoldment is not adequately dynamic; it doesnot make adequate impress on the outer conditions of living. This you know. Youhave, I feel sure, pondered and studied the three words—Contact, Impression andRelationship—I gave you in my last instruction. I am equally confident that yourapproach was along the line of strengthening your contact with me, the Ashramand the group; to render yourself sensitive to spiritual impression , and alsoto see that your relationship was right in two directions: towards the Ashramand towards your fellowmen. That is all to the good but—for the sake of your owndevelopment and increased usefulness—I would have you take those same threewords and (for the remainder of your life) direct your thinking towards contactwith your fellowmen, towards the type of impression which you can establish—animpression which will enable them to impress others with the desire to discovertruth and to persevere until the end. It will also involve your establishingwith them an [487] educational relationship evoked by the quality of yourapproach to them and the “satisfying tincture” of your life, as one of theMasters has expressed it.Therefore for you, until I see you on the other side of the separating veil,there must be the expression of the three types of work—expressed in twodirections: the stabilising of that expression towards the Ashram (and that,with you, is well-nigh a habit and need not, therefore, form a drive), and alsoan intensified effort to work out the meaning of these words with yourfellowmen. That will be very much harder. There is so much dammed up spiritualpower in you; if you released it whenever possible and in all directions, youwould be surprised at the result. You could then make the last years of yourlife fruitful and rewarding, far more than they have ever been in the past. Yourlife has been a life of loveliness, though somewhat dimmed by negativity.You are in process of stepping over the periphery of the Ashram towards itscentre. It needs only a little dynamic effort on your part to give you theunquestioning assurance that you are within the ring-pass-not of the Ashram andare functioning as a conscious disciple. Most of the group are not yet at thatstage. The Ashram enfolds you all, but the next move is for each and all ofyou—without aid or help—to step over the mental barrier which keeps you fromconscious knowledge and which (when accomplished) will enable the Ashram to giveyou “the freedom of the city.”One of the ideas which disciples would find it helpful to grasp is that theprocess of passing over to the other side involves no discontinuance of thethree processes of Contact, Impression and Relationship. These being the threewords with which I earlier impressed you and which seem to me today to be ofmajor importance in your life, I would have you grasp, if possible, somewhat thepermanence of their importance. With the mass of ordinary humanity, focussed inall their activities and their thinking upon the physical plane, the periodafter death is one of semi-consciousness, of a failure to recognise location,and of emotional and mental bewilderment. With disciples there is still contactwith people (usually those with whom they have been associated) in [488] thehours of sleep; there is still the reception of impression from environment andassociates, and there is still the recognition of relation with (as on earth)the assumption of responsibility.One of the students in this group asked me a question some time ago which I havebeen long in answering. As it has a bearing on the subject we are considering, Ishall answer it here. After a few subsidiary comments the student said: “I canstill the outer shells or bodies, but have not dared to let go the connectingcord. Is it safe? Can you see my condition and can you tell me?” My reply isquite simple and I know he will understand:Were you twenty years younger, my brother, with perfect safety you could breakthe connecting link, but owing to your age it is not, at this time, right so todo. There are some you have yet to help and one or two threads as yet to gatherup. Undue strain upon the physical vehicle—no matter whether one is young orold—is never necessary and often of a harmful nature. Many aspirants in thisgroup, in the Arcane School and elsewhere, are in training for work in the NewAge and in the next life cycle, and their realisation is often bigger than thepresent equipment of brain cells warrants. Therefore, knowledge and registeredexpansion of consciousness is temporarily withheld until a better physicalvehicle is available. I mention this because some suffer from discouragementwhen, after years of work and the achievement of old age, they find themselvesregistering a static condition, or what they deem to be static. There is no needfor such a feeling, but there is need for care and the progression of theinterior work, e’en when the external recording is apparently lacking.To resume with your own instruction, if you would care to increase the capacityof the three activities—contact, impression, relationship—you might follow asimple exercise when going to sleep at night.After achieving complete comfort, as far as may be possible, attempt to assumean inner attitude of planned, quiet discarding of the physical body, keeping thewhole concept upon the mental plane, yet realising it to be a simple brain [489]activity. The heart is in no way to be involved. Your objective is to preserveconsciousness as you withdraw it from the brain and pass out on the subtlerlevels of awareness. You are not discarding the physical body permanently,therefore the life thread anchored in the heart is not involved. The aim is, fora few hours and whilst clothed in the astral and mental vehicles, to beconsciously aware elsewhere. With determination you become a focussed,interested point of consciousness, intent on emerging from the casing of thephysical body. That point you hold, refusing to look backward at the physicalvehicle, or at the worries, interests and circumstances of daily life, fixedlywaiting for the moment when your negative attitude to the physical plane andyour positive attitude to the inner planes will bring a moment of release,perhaps a flash of light, the perception of an aperture of escape, or therecognition of your surroundings, plus the elimination of all surprise or theexpectation of any phenomena.You are (as you practice this exercise of withdrawal) only going through anordinary everyday process. If facility in doing this exercise is achieved, thehour of death will find you automatically and easily—because the physical bodyis making no resistance but remains quiescent and negative—able to make theGreat Transition without concern or fear of the unknown. This is an exercise Iwould like to see all the group undertake. It involves only the steadypreservation of an attitude, a fixed determination to hold on to the point ofconsciousness which is your persistent Self, plus a live expectancy. I havechosen these words with care and would ask you to study them with equal care.I would like also to formulate your meditation along these three concepts ofContact, Impression and Relationship. The length of the meditation is entirelydependent upon your own choice or temporary need; it is susceptible ofapplication to all or any circumstances and you could use it for the remainderof your life (many years or few) without exhausting its possibilities orusefulness. The outline is not a rigid form, as are so many which I have givento the group. It is intended simply to be suggestive. You can make your life arich experience by the use of these suggestions: [490]1. Poise yourself at the “door of exit” in the head. Realise that that point isone from which you can look outward upon the world of physical living, inwardupon the world of the emotions or of mental perception, or upward towards thesoul. These three directions form a triangle of projected sensitivity.Then sound the OM three times, bearing these directions in mind.2. Take then the word Contact into your consciousness and ponder upon thesethree fields of contact in which it is possible for you to move—the physicalplane, the kama-manasic plane, and the kingdom of the soul. Study these planesof possible and unavoidable contact (for the aspiring disciple) and study themfrom the angle of things as they are. When you have somewhat exhausted this workof familiarising yourself with the possible contacts, remembering that thisparticular work will make your life fruitful in all three directions:Then again sound the OM and attempt to withdraw to a point of silentcontemplation upon the mental plane. Again sound the OM.3. The fact of the possibility of Impression now must engross your attention.You begin to study the general tenor and the outstanding lessons which physical,astral or mental contact makes on you, what they have done for you during thislife cycle or during the past week or day; then definitely and with fullconcentrated interest and attention—you orient yourself to the soul ; you standconsciously ready for impression. What that impression will convey, what thoughtwill come to you or what call to service will sound forth, you know not. Yourattitude is one of a radiant, silent, poised expectancy, and nothing else ispermitted. This you must work to attain. Note (if it comes) the emergence ofsome clear thought, the clarification of some bewilderment, the expansion ofsome mental perception into an intuition, with its consequent expansion of [491]consciousness. You can give as long or as short a time to this as you choose,but never less than ten minutes.Then orient yourself to me , your Master and friend for many years, and againwait. Perchance there may be something I may have to say to you. You will notethat I have used the word “orient” in both cases; I have not said “achievecontact.” The task of receiving impression is not an easy one, and you may haveto work some time on these different levels before you register any definiteresponse from an achieved contact, for that is what it then will be.Then sound the OM twice.4. Having reached as high a point of contact as you can, at any given time, youthen begin to reorient yourself to the physical plane and the life of dailyexperience through a systematised process of Relationships. You assume—as adisciple on the physical plane—responsibility for those relationships (to theAshram and to me) through service planned and rendered; to the soul throughfusion, rendered expressive on the mental plane; to the group emotionalexpression, and to your fellowmen. Grasp these recognitions of relationships,both as they affect your daily life expression and in relation to others withwhom you live and work, down on the physical plane. Again, you bring thisconcept of essential relationships to the effect you have, as a human being onthe Path, to all you meet and seek to aid. Couple ever with this thought theidea of responsibility.Then sound the OM.5. Next say the Invocation beginning with the stanza“From the point of Light within the Mind of GodLet Light stream forth into the minds of men.Let Light descend on Earth,”and sound the OM three times. Please note that the OM in this meditation is tobe sounded inaudibly.If you will follow these suggestions, my brother, you will make rapid progressinto spiritual objectivity, and your light [492] will shine forth moreradiantly. I, your Master, know your inner radiance. Permit the world of outerthings to know it too. The wishes, coming from my heart for you, surround you.~TO I. A. P.BROTHER OF OLD: August 1940In the present world upheaval and with its steady approach to the westernhemisphere, it is not easy for world disciples—with their unusual sensitivity—todetach themselves from the general psychic condition. Yet the aim of eachpledged and obligated disciple (such as you are, my brother, by your ownproving—which is the only sure testimony) must be to hold a subjective attitudeof detached contact—an occult paradox!—and at the same time to carry forward thelife of active service upon the physical plane. This is your problem and onewhich you will have increasingly to face in the future. The present situationmust and will touch all nations and every disciple will be tested and will haveto express the utmost that is in him in service. I point this out so that youcan comprehend the present and be prepared for the future.I write to you as a soul and not as a personality and would ask you to study theimplications of that attitude which I hold towards you. For the remainder ofyour life there should be a close application to the establishing of the gainedsoul contact and the training of the inner attentive man to catch thecommunications of the soul, plus the dedicated will to forget all personalityapplications in the meeting of surrounding need—as far as you can in your owncountry and allied nations. This may come to you as a surprising statement butat the close of the war, the period of rebuilding and the establishing of righthuman relations may (I do not say it will, for the constant element of freewillmust enter in) force each disciple to work in those places where earlier effort,the ties of karma and national heritage, and inclination [493] determine hispersonal allegiance. This will be true for you too but only time will indicatewhether you work with close relationship or from a distance—the first beingpreferable, if possible. I ask you simply to hold these possibilities in mind,to avoid fanatical conclusions, and to be prepared to work where the opportunityconfronts you.The glamour to which I referred in my first communication to you this year (Vol.I, Page 188) is being handled by you with right attitude and common sense. Forthis I commend you, reminding you always that soul contact is universal andinclusive in its effects but that the separative mind (even at soul levels) canstill differentiate and place imparted truths under categories and sources. Itis the imparted truths, the teaching and the inspiration which is of moment andthis fact I believe that you are learning. I, the Master D.K., am a member ofthe Hierarchy and am teaching you through your own soul on mental levels, in theworld of glamour at times also, and exoterically upon the physical plane througha much older disciple, A.A.B., who transmits to you my ideas. Through me,however, and through your contact with me (which is based on the recognition andunfoldment of your soul) you are en rapport with a world of spiritualinspiration and awareness which you can appreciate. Appropriate it, my brother,and transmit the teaching to those you serve but be not occupied or interestedin the sources or origins of this teaching. They matter not . Nevertheless, theresponsibility of the teacher rests upon you. The teacher should be so occupiedwith the need of the taught and with the clarification of the truth, as it isgiven to him, in terms that they can comprehend that he cannot be side-trackedthrough undue interest in the origin of the revelation.A.A.B. here reminds me that I have not given you the rays which control yourpersonality. Your major rays—I and II—are identical with those of J.W.K-P. andC.A.C., and should lead to a satisfactory understanding between you. Thiscombination of the first and the second rays—governing either the soul or thepersonality—is the dominating influence in this work which I am attempting atthis time to do. They are to be found quite often in this group and this [494]is to be expected owing to the fact that the Masters M. and K.H. are theovershadowing influences behind my efforts. Seven of the group members areconditioned by these energies and most of the others have the second ray presenteither in their personality or egoic expressions. This should be noted asdefinitely colouring the group and creating (if I might so express it) the groupnote. Of these potencies the whole group can, therefore, avail itself for itmeans that the inflow of understanding, light and love is thereby greatlyfacilitated.The rays of your personality are as follows:Mental body—The fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict.Astral body—The first Ray of Power .Physical body—The third Ray of Active Intelligence.This constitutes an interesting combination and produces a close relation and aline of least resistance in connection with the soul ray, through the medium ofthe brain (embodying the third ray force) and the astral body. I would point outto you that the brain is ever composed of atoms and cell units which vibrate tothe energy of the ray which controls the physical body. This is a basic occultfact given out in a definite statement for the first time but ever deducible andimplied when the student studies intelligently and has a real grasp of basicesoteric implications. Through the powerful aspiration of your first ray astralbody (which is in fact transmuted desire) and its intelligent expression, andthrough the third ray power of your directing, awakening brain, soul contact isfairly easy of achievement for you at this particular point in your evolution.Your real problem is to free the results of this contact from distortion andglamour by the power of the illumined mind—an illumination achieved throughconflict and discrimination and resulting (when the victory is gained) in theharmonising of soul and its form on earth.I would like, therefore, to give some meditation exercises [495] which willfacilitate the achievement of this clear vision and a correct interpretation ofemerging facts and relations.I. Exercise prior to Meditation:1. Stand erect, facing your soul. Then say audibly, if possible:“I accept the responsibility of discipleship which my soul has placed upon me.”2. Then pause a minute, endeavouring to realise the full significance of thisundertaking. Then dismiss it.3. Again face your soul and say:“I accept with joy and with confidence and with a sense of comradeship, my sharein the responsibility of making the spiritual work in the world successful.”4. Pause again, trying to grasp the true implications of this pledge.II. Meditation Work:1. Sit erect but relaxed. Withdraw the consciousness inward in successivestages, using the imagination in so doing. The imagination is a creativeactivity, producing definite inner change. Upon this you can depend because itis one of the forces influencing substance itself. Therefore,a. Withdraw from the physical brain, after definitely focussing yourconsciousness there. Withdraw to the astral plane.b. Withdraw from the astral body to the mental body. From that point recogniseyourself as an integrated personality.c. Withdraw from the personality into the soul.2. As you do this work, try to see the thread of golden light which connectsthese three aspects of yourself. At the same time keep your consciousnesssteadily focussed in the head at the centre between the eyebrows, the ajnacentre. This thread—dual in nature, like two golden cables intertwined—passes[496] from the heart and connects you, the personality, with the soul.3. Having achieved this alignment and withdrawing, and having thus related thethree aspects of the personality, quietly realise three facts:a. That you are now face to face with your own soul, standing before the Angelof the Presence.b. That you, this angelic Being, are essentially Reality, manifesting throughthree aspects.c. That therefore separation does not exist.4. Then say with emphasis and understanding:“Having pervaded this world of the little manifested self with one fraction ofmy greater Self, I remain, greater, wider, inclusive and therefore overshadowingall my daily living.”Ponder on this for five minutes.5. Then add to the above the following statement:“I, the manifesting Self, through the magical power of my nature, redeem,reabsorb and revitalise this fraction, dwelling in my form.”6. Then sound the OM three times:a. Sound it mentally, breathing forth radiance on to the mental plane.b. Sound it next in a whisper, breathing forth the dispelling power of Light onto the astral plane.c. Then sound it audibly, breathing illumination on to the physical plane.7. This is followed by a period of listening or what is called esoterically“egoic conversation.”I have, my brother, in this instruction given you much food for thought, alsothe basis for real encouragement and an indication of your needed line ofapproach to reality.[497]~August 19421. The disciple has to learn a discrimination for which the discriminativepersonality has prepared him.2. Gigantic thoughtforms dominate the sons of men, speak through a nation, focusthrough a group. Lean on your Soul.3. Your field of service has been real, but older threads of service must laterbe re-grasped. Prepare.4. Sensitivity to Those Who guide and know may indicate a mental interplay. Youreach Their “forms of thought.” Discriminate.5. There is a triangle of force with which you should remain in closesttouch—Myself, F.B., and A.A.B. Stay close.6. Learn to use others in your work and train them so that they too may servetheir fellowmen. This you can do. It is your Soul’s behest, your personality’sdenial.~MY BROTHER: September 1943I have seemed to you perhaps to have been silent and to have left you somewhatto yourself. Such is not, however, the case in reality. You have walked everunder my watchful eye, but there was little that I could do until you hadsomewhat broken the “intent to loneliness” with which your personality has soconstantly met the advances of your soul. This personality reaction you arelearning rapidly, as a conscious soul, to repudiate. Loneliness, isolation, asense of being deserted and a separativeness (based on sensitivity in mostcases) distinguish the first ray disciple, until he learns to preserve hisdivine sense of “unified identity” whilst merging, at the same time, withothers. This again you are learning to do.You have had by no means an easy time, my brother. You have tuned in on worlddistress and are discovering yourself doing so with increasing and oftdistressing frequency. Thus are the sons of God trained and brought to the pointof detached and spiritually oriented servers.I would like to take this opportunity to express to you my appreciation (if suchan inadequate word is aught but [498] meaningless!) of the constant and untiringservice to the Plan which you have so ceaselessly rendered. You have foryears—ever since you first returned to Spain, and later in the place of yourpresent abode—undeviatingly followed the path of ceaseless, constant service.You have reached and have helped many. I would have you know that we are notunmindful; I would have you realise that the work which you do is planned by usand that your task is to render yourself sensitive to our “impression.” Thisdeveloped sensitivity is ever a difficult task for the first ray person. Theyprefer to stand alone and to generate within themselves the plans which theyconsider fitted for the type of service which they seek to render. But todaydisciples are learning that a fused and organised and blended plan or scheme ofworld-wide service is required, and that a master Plan of the Hierarchy must becarried out, and that into this Plan all disciples, including you, mustendeavour to fit.Have you studied with care the six statements I gave you a year ago? I wanttoday to call your attention to the third statement; this set of words shouldcondition your planning for the future, particularly the sentence: “Olderthreads of planning must later be re-grasped.” You started work for us inanother country. Your major karmic destiny lies there, even if you return notthere physically or for any length of time. The Plan must be served. I would askyou to prepare to re-establish the work you started, once the war in Europe isover. I would ask you to prepare to locate there again, if necessary, and tobegin by communicating with as many as you can who earlier worked with you,seeking again to get in touch with all of them and along the original spirituallines. I did not say along the original organised lines. I would ask you to doso at first in a definitely personal manner, writing friendly and personalletters and ascertaining the news and the condition of those who earlier workedwith you as members of the Arcane School. They will form the nucleus of thespiritual work we seek to do and which you can aid greatly in re-establishing.The work of salvaging Europe, spiritually and psychologically, which is our mainpreoccupation, must go on. It [499] must be entirely divorced from politics andpartisanships, and I am asking all of you who are my pledged workers to moveforward in this spiritual undertaking. Your link with the Master R. should helpyou much in taking adequate action in cooperation with A.A.B. and F.B. Thetriangle of force thus formed is strengthened by its link with my Brother, R.Where Spain is concerned, the picture is as follows:[Image00018.jpg]You will note here the direct line of spiritual force descending from the MasterR., via D.K. to yourself, with F.B. and A.A.B. standing by as protecting agentson either side. They aid and sponsor all your efforts.Much will be opening up rapidly now in the field of European assistance, and forthis, in your place and sphere, you must begin to prepare. The spiritual demandof humanity is great and the need to be met is gigantic, but you have theequipment and enough surviving links in that ancient peninsula (where your workbegan) to salvage some remnants of the School and thus reconstitute a spiritualfocal point in that land. Begin, therefore, to lay your plans. Write letters.Locate your students. Establish contact, and step by step, the way will open upbefore you and the work to be done will clarify. Count on your inner strengthand rely on your inner spiritual contacts. Feel not futile or inadequate to thetask, for in these days of urgent distress the aid given to—and consequentlyby—one disciple is greatly intensified and increased.One suggestion I would here make to you personally. On receipt of thisinstruction, will you take a full month for the establishing of such a closecontact with your own soul that love, enthusiasm, wisdom and certain fundamentalspiritual [500] recognitions (which must ever condition the life of an accepteddisciple) will flood your whole being? Day by day link up with your soul; day byday pledge yourself to the work to be undertaken; day by day seek a deepenedrelation with me, with my Ashram, and with your group brothers; day by dayinvestigate your service as rendered up to date in the searchlight of the soul,and then, my brother, with my aid and blessing go forward, recognised by us asone of our spiritual assets. Work to bring the light of love and of spiritualorientation to those whom you are called to serve—in the place where you noware, and increasingly in the future in the place of your earlier service. Again,I recall to you the closing words of the second statement: Lean on your soul.I assign to you no particular meditation. I believe that the group meditationwill give you all you need along this line, and the reflection upon emergingopportunity and the planning for the reopening work will suffice to provide dueexpression for thought, for holding the mind steady in the light, and for therequired meditative concentration.My instructions to you are occupied with the theme of work, are they not, mybrother? But that, to you, is life. It is needless for me to tell you that thesuccess of the coming reorganisation and the success of your spiritual effortwill be largely dependent upon the depth of your individual spiritual focus, thecloseness of your link with your own soul, and the recognition of your“attachment” (technically speaking) to my Ashram. These are the A B C of yourrelationship to me as an accepted disciple.Until such time as your outer course of action appears clearer to you, and untilthe way opens up for a resumption of work, earlier started, you have two thingstherefore to do. I am but summarising.1. Deepen the content of your own inner spiritual life by mature, profound dailyreflection, carried forward on all levels of thought and in every interlude inyour daily life of service and of work. Endeavour to sense the note or thevibration of the Ashram and to establish [501] a much closer link with yourgroup brothers. They value you and must also do their part.2. Lay your plans for increased School activity, and concentrate also upon thework of the Triangles. Prepare definitely for the future, and seek also forthose who can aid in your planned work.The future ahead of my workers and the work to be done which will emanate frommy Ashram is one of great activity. The plans are outlined and the work assignedis clearly proposed. I receive my instructions from a “joint committee” of thespiritual leaders behind the world scene; They are the senior members of theHierarchy, working under the Christ. They arrive at Their decisions after dueconsultation with senior workers, such as myself—Masters and initiates above thethird initiation. Thus the work becomes fused and blended, and the entireHierarchy, at a time of crisis such as the present, is swung into one unifiedactivity. From that point of focussed intention each then proceeds to carry outthe Plan, via Their Ashram, and thus the work makes its impact upon the outerworld.I explain this to you as you are preparing to become an ever more intimatemember in the “circle of the Ashram” which guards the heart of the hierarchicallife.With courage and with determination, my brother and my friend, move forward uponthe Lighted Way.~MY COMRADE AND MY BROTHER: November 1944These are two appellations which are sincere and intended. You are at this timefacing changes. The choice with which you are confronted is not so much whereyou will work, but whether you have arrived at a high water mark in yourdeveloped life of service and can therefore go no further, or whether there arestill to be found in you those springs of interest and those inner urges whichwill enable you to reach outward and further into the life of the spirit. [502]Such is oft the choice with which the disciple is faced who reaches close to thethree score years and ten of ordinary human enterprise, as you do today. Thedifficulty lies in the fact that, fundamentally, either decision is right. Few,however, face the choice consciously or intelligently or, having made it, abideby the decision made. From the standpoint of the ordinary aspirant, the choiceis relatively unimportant because the time equation is of no great moment atthis stage; a few years more or less are of no import in the eternity of soulreaction. Therefore, a decision to relax, to hold the point gained, but torefrain from further struggle, has in it no room for criticism. Remember this.From the standpoint of the accepted disciple—such as you are—there may be moreto the choice than at first appears. It might be of service to you, and to allwho may later read these instructions, if I dwelt for a moment upon theinevitable problem of the working disciple, upon the problem of the man whoreaches the age which you have reached. Shall he rest back upon his laurels (andyou have laurels, my brother, as I pointed out in my last instruction to you) orshall he—to use a Biblical phrase—”gird his loins” anew and go forward with afresh impetus and to a still higher summit of attainment? Shall he demonstratethe power of the seventh wave which will carry him forward much further upon thebeach of life expression or will the strong undertow of ordinary human frailtypull him back from renewed effort?The reasons why a disciple must at least endeavour not to relax unduly andshould push on in spite of fatigue (the fatigue of years of living), in spite ofthe increasing “creaking” of the human apparatus and the inevitable tendencywhich comes from constant service and constant contact with others, might beenumerated as follows:1. He must endeavour to carry the rhythm of service and of fruitful living withhim when—free of the physical body—he stands upon the other side of the veil.There must be no gap in that service.2. He must endeavour as far as in him lies to preserve the [503] continuity ofhis consciousness as a working disciple and should allow no gap to emergebetween his present point of tension and that point of tension which supervenesafter the death experience.3. He must endeavour to close the episode of this life experience so that it isapparent that he is a member of an Ashram; he must permit no break in theestablished relationship, or any cessation to the flow of ashramic life throughhim to the world of men. This activity, on account of the natural and normaldeterioration of the physical vehicle as it grows older, is not so easy a task;it requires a definite concentration of effort, thus increasing the tension inwhich a disciple ever lives.4. For any disciple in my Ashram, the problem in this time of world crisis ispeculiarly urgent, and this for the following reasons:a. My Ashram is the main affiliated Ashram with that of the Master K.H. To Him,my Master (as I am yours), is given the task, on a large scale, of worldeducation along new lines. Through my Ashram, working under the inspiration ofHis, the newer, esoteric presentation of truth is to be given out. The work thatI have already done—through my books and through all the teaching which you haveattempted to embody—is to render the teaching of the other and older esotericschools and groups entirely exoteric. There is little left to them that is new;they must now link up with the sources which I represent if their leaders are topresent fresh and vital information to their students, or they must take what Ihave conveyed to the world, via A.A.B., and thus again reintegrate into theesoteric whole.b. Disciples in my Ashram have a dual responsibility to stand steady in apreservation of realisation —if I may use such a phrase. This steadiness mustnot be relaxed in any way as old age draws near, and it must not be permitted todisappear through the transition of death itself. It is through the unbroken[504] conscious thinking of a welded group of disciples that the Master of anAshram works. It is not so much the active outer service of a group of discipleswhich is of major importance (though it has necessarily a vital purpose) as thecoherent, integrated group thought which is so potent in effecting changes inthe human consciousness.c. The peculiar problem of the present world crisis and the terrificreadjustments in the human consciousness, incident to the inauguration of a newculture, civilisation and world religion, warrant my presenting the members ofmy Ashram (even affiliated groups, such as yours) with the opportunity topreserve intact and free from all deterioration their “state of mind” throughoutthe remaining years of this life, through the process of dissolution, and oninto the freedom of the other side of the veil. This preservation of consciousintegrity is no easy task; it requires understanding and most deliberate effort.I call you, therefore, my brother, to exactly this effort. The consequences toyou will be a much harder life of service from now on; the results will be thecarrying out of your plans for work with greatly intensified effort.You should now work in closer cooperation with A.A.B. and F.B. The task ofcarrying esoteric truth into Latin and Catholic America and southern Europe isno easy undertaking. It will be slow. Your foundation must be well and trulylaid. The quality of those reached by you in the future is of more importancethan the quantity. Bear this ever in mind. Relinquish not the various phases ofthe work you have so successfully launched, but proceed with them asheretofore—no matter where may be the place of your physical plane enterprise.One of the many things which you need at this time to learn, and which you mustinitiate during the next few years, is how to gather people together and workthrough them. This, as you have been taught, is very difficult for a first raydisciple to master, particularly when the soul ray [505] and the ray of theastral or emotional nature are both first ray. It is easy for the first raydisciple to withdraw into his soul consciousness, far easier than for any otherray types, and your problem (as it is also the problem of J.W.K-P.) is to givethe second ray personality fuller sway, and thus balance the first ray abilityto demonstrate detachment by the functioning of the opposite quality ofattachment—so distinctive of the second ray nature. Ponder on this.As I told J.W.K-P. some years ago, a “detached attachment” (paradoxical as itsounds) is the goal of the first ray working disciple. This is equally true ofyou. You and he have the same egoic, personality and mental rays. Hence theclose link with him which you have ever realised. He is a disciple of the MasterM., temporarily working in my Ashram. You have been admitted into the ranks ofaccepted disciples in my Ashram and by me, but you will eventually betransferred into the Ashram of the Master M. The free interplay thus establishedbetween my Ashram and that of the Master M. is due to the fact that He is theinner Head of all esoteric groups, and in the interest of the coming new worldorder, the teaching Ashrams are being strengthened by the inflow of first raydisciples. This should be a point of real interest to you.What, my brother, shall be the type of meditation and interior work which youshould be doing during the coming years? I would like to have you meditate uponthe “three activities”: Outward moving, persistent orientation, and interiorwithdrawing or abstraction. The relation of these three activities or threeattitudes should form one aspect of your reflection upon these phrases; therelative activity involved in each attained position should constitute another;the effect produced by each of them in the three worlds, and also upon soullevels, demands careful and concentrated thought. What, for instance, is thenature of “outward moving” upon the astral plane? How would “persistentorientation” appear or express itself upon the mental plane? Or “abstraction andwithdrawal” upon the physical level of consciousness? How can you, as adisciple, display these attitudes simultaneously? I think you will admit, mybrother, that in these three concepts [506] and in their working out in thedaily life within the ring-pass-not of the three worlds and in the life of thesoul upon its own plane, I have given you the theme for much thinking during thecoming years. Take each of these phrases, therefore, and think each of them outin relation to each of the three planes in the three worlds, and to each other;carry the same directed thinking on to soul levels and shift the theme then intothe three worlds of the Spiritual Triad, regarding the lower three worlds thenas reflections of the higher, triadal three. Keep notes of all the thoughts ofreality which come to you; watch the reactions produced in your vehicles ofexpression, and become increasingly aware of the changes which conscious,deliberate thinking will bring about in you. Think—if I may so express it—inyour heart, and also in your mind, and endeavour to comprehend the distinctionbetween these two modes of thought.This reflective work should constitute your meditation work in the future; itwill condition your interior development and will also inevitably make yourouter work more dynamic.One reason why I have emphasised the need for attachment in this instruction isthat right attachment releases the love of the soul, and only love, consciously,intelligently and deliberately applied, can make for successful work, both inEurope and South America—your two recognised fields of service. Only your secondray personality will have the capacity to reawaken contact with your students inSpain or hold steady those already working in South America; it is throughindividually re-found, re-awakened and re-inspired realisation that the work,planned and intended by me, can be successfully carried forward. Such is yourimmediate task. Only your second ray personality can have the patience to coverthe mass of detail needed and to persist in the face of apparent nonsuccess.Much skill in action will also be required. The Catholic Church is governed bythe first ray as its soul ray, and by the third ray as its personality ray.Hence its love of politics and of temporal power; hence also its intenselycommercial and financial preoccupations. The mental ray of this Church is sixthray. Hence its narrow one-pointedness; [507] its emotional body is also sixthray in quality, whilst the physical ray of the outer organisation is seventh.These are points which should interest you and which you need to bear in mind asyou work. A realisation of this peculiar combination of rays will demand of you,and of all workers along esoteric lines, great skill in action.With renewed endeavour, enlightened understanding and courage, go forth again,my brother, in the service of the light. I stand ever behind you. On that point,have no doubts. I shield and protect, but I leave you free to work.~MY DEAR BROTHER: August 1946This is a new way for me to address you, but you have endeared yourself to me byyour patient persistence and your undeviating adherence to the service of theHierarchy. For many years you have done our work in a most difficult sphere. Isay this to you because I would not have you spend time (or should I say, wastetime, my brother?) in wishing you had done the work better or differently, or inthe unrewarding task of self-depreciation. I would tell you quite simply that weare not ungrateful and we are not dissatisfied. The Latin field—by that I meanthe sphere in which the Latin race predominates, Italian, Spanish andPortuguese—is one of the most difficult in which to work. The narrowness ofthought induced by Roman Catholic Church control, the crystallisation whichcomes from a very ancient development, and (in South America) the wide mixtureof races, make the task of bringing spiritual liberation one of peculiardifficulty.Do you realise, my brother, that you have been drawing the plough over theground in preparation for the New Age teaching for the first time, and that thatground is very hard, very stony, and at present relatively unproductive?So be of good cheer. Your work is more fruitful than you realise and in somelife you will see the results of the apparently unrewarding toil of the years ofyour spiritual enterprise.[508] I have few instructions to give you. Proceed as heretofore, but deepenpersistently your own inner life; give more time to quiet reflection and studythan to the technicalities of the task; let others deal with the mechanics ofthe work whilst you seek to act as a spiritual reservoir from which they candraw strength and wisdom and understanding. The recognition of this phase ofyour work is perhaps the most important lesson you can learn at this time. Youwill experience a new power, the upwelling of new spiritual fervour, the joy ofseeing others competently handling the mechanics of the work whilst you teachand aid them in their spiritual undertakings. Above all else, endeavour to reachand interest the young people. They are the hope of the future and are cominginto incarnation subjectively aware of their predestined task of worldreconstruction; you will find them acutely responsive to spiritual contacts,particularly if presented in non-religious terms. Count, therefore, on this andtry to reach them.I am going to give you a somewhat brief meditation exercise to be done by youtwice a day—on arising in the morning and the last thing at night, prior togoing to sleep. It should not take you long to do, but—if done correctly andwith as much of your first ray soul integrated into it as you can invoke—it willgreatly aid you.1. Sound the OM inaudibly three times.2. Then, having achieved inner quiet and relaxed mental focussing, seek, with analert consciousness, to contact:a. Your soul.b. My Ashram.c. Me, your Master.You thus, through the imagination, create a triangle of energy:[509] As familiarity with this meditation is developed, you should eventuallyarrive at a contact, at a registered sense of spiritual power (expressed throughyour second ray personality) and at such an increase of love and light that yoursphere of service will recognise it, even if—at first—you do not.3. Then, after quiet acceptance and a period of silent reflection, you willdeliberately pour out the inflowing spiritual power into:a. Your immediate environment,[Image00019.jpg]b. The Arcane School, of which your work in South America is an integral part,c. The Goodwill Movement you have aided in starting in South America.This type of meditation constitutes a definite act of service and should—whendone in the morning—prove pronouncedly strenuous. It involves some practice invisualisation and (where I and the Ashram are concerned) the use of yourconfident, creative imagination.4. Then say the Great Invocation, slowly and with much mental intention, pausingafter each of the four stanzas for quiet thought and reflection.5. Then again link up in thought with me, your Master. Sound the OM inaudiblyagain three times, and then proceed about your daily work.My blessing continues to rest upon you.~MY BROTHER OF LONG STANDING: November 1948It had not been my intention to send you a communication, since the personalcommunications have been largely discontinued. I am, however, prompted to do sotoday because as I contacted you in my thought life this morning, I decided thata word from me and the touch of my hand [510] (symbolically speaking) would giveyou strength and comfort.There comes a time in the training of any disciple when he must stand alone andfeel sometimes that he has been deserted by his Master and by the other membersof the Ashram. It is the higher and occult correspondence of the mysticalexperience of the true mystic and to which he has given the name of “the darknight of the soul.” All this is nevertheless only a part of the great illusionand has to be overcome and dissipated. When this victory has been achieved andthere has been evidenced the willingness to work alone and apparently with noashramic direction—except a general knowledge of the Plan—then the disciple hasdemonstrated that he can be trusted; he becomes available for a higher ratingand more responsibility can be placed upon him—if not in this life then in thenext.You are not young, my brother, but you can have the rare joy of looking back(when the time comes to pass through the Portal into clearer light and life andknow ) to know that you have served and helped thousands, through the radio andthrough the translated material of the teaching I have tried to give; what youhave sown has not fallen on sterile ground. This remains true, even if you donot register the fact. Since first you responded to my vibration, you have notturned back; this has been recorded and recognised by us.Praise and commendation is an unusual line for me to take but a disciple has tolearn to respond correctly to that as well as to correction. You have earnedcommendation and we withhold from no one their just due.Go forward, my brother. These are troubled times, and steady centres of light inevery land are sorely needed.May the strength of your own soul and the knowledge that your place in theAshram is secure enable you to complete the work which you have begun.NOTE: This disciple has persisted faithfully to serve as a steady centre oflight, and in September, 1951, he passed into clearer light and life in theinner Ashram.~TO I. S. G-L.MY FRIEND AND BROTHER: August 1940[511] For several lives we have been associated, though this is only the secondincarnation wherein you have been definitely regarded by me and by my Associatesas a pledged disciple. I am pointing this out to you as it infers a consecrationand a dedication which you have preserved inviolate and evokes a response whichonly increases as time goes on.You are pledged as a disciple to further our plans and to occupy yourself withdefinite group work. Our disciples learn the processes of initiation in the fireand heat of the daily life battle in the world of the present. They graspeventually the processes also of group work and the rules which govern groupendeavour. These rules govern the Hierarchy. They recede increasingly into thebackground as the group grows in function, purpose and usefulness but thiswithdrawal into the silence of the Hierarchy is not based and never will bebased upon any outwardly imposed silence by the initiate or disciple upon eitherhimself or his group. The silence concerns himself, and is based upon a humbleappreciation of the whole of which he is simply a part and is not based upon asilence and a technique which simply emphasises mystery. The only true mysteriesare those points of revelation for which the mechanism is inadequate and which,therefore, find no response in the one whom the initiate or disciple contacts.Of these mysteries you, the teacher and leader, may be aware but the pupilremains unmoved when presented with them. He simply does not recognise them. Theouter imposition of silence and mystery is focussed consequently around theteacher in the mind of the taught and only serves to distract his attention fromthe reality to an imposed glamour surrounding the teacher. I would have youponder on this, my brother, for your service is needed, but is today—if you willpermit me to say so—handicapped by the intensity of your devotion and thepsychic pulsation of your solar plexus. [512] You will recognise the conditionto which I here refer. It affects also at times the quality of your impact uponpeople and occasionally the fruitfulness of your service. The careful andconsidered following of the group meditation should do much to relieve thesituation and so release you for fuller service.You would find it useful also, once and for all, to face up to the complexitiesof your own nature and to do so joyfully. You could also try to simplify yourown approach to truth, to me and to humanity. There lies your immediateproblem—simplification. This involves the elimination of imaginative reactions,all hinted implications and a withdrawal from the centre of your group life (Irefer here not to the group which I am here teaching) just in so far as you feelyourself a centre. It involves also the effort to become a potent livinginfluence radiating from above and not from the centre and yet without any senseof being above.I wonder, my brother, if I am making my meaning clear. It is not clear to A.A.B.who is taking down my words but it should be clear to you, for it concerns yourestablished technique of service and your group activity. You have accomplisheda good and fruitful life service. You have aided many towards the light and havedemonstrated a physical plane selflessness which has been powerful in releasingothers. You need now to demonstrate an equal selflessness upon the plane ofaspiration and of devotion. There lies for you the battle ground, and victorymust be yours prior to taking the initiation for which you are being prepared.Your capacity for suffering is abnormal; this must be ended through thecultivation of that divine indifference which changes or shifts the presentalmost too violent emotional reactions into that calm, understanding,compassionate wisdom which—through identification with the soul of those youseek to help—inevitably aids suffering personalities. I think you realise thesignificance of my remarks. Your intense desire to serve Us and your deep lovefor humanity must be preserved but not forgotten in the strenuous activity ofyour life.You are as yet a comparatively young man. The crux of your whole problem is tobe found in the shift which you [513] are supposed to make this incarnation fromthe minor ray, the sixth Ray of Devotion, to a major ray, the second Ray ofLove-Wisdom. When you have accomplished this, you will take initiation. The taskis however a stupendous one because as an accepted disciple in the technicalsense of the word, the characteristics of the sixth ray—owing to your having asixth ray astral body—are very pronounced and dominant. This condition isaggravated (if I might so express it) by your having a first ray personality.When, as in your case, the polarisation is in the astral body and so the energyof power pours in, the situation becomes acute, which is to be expected.Fortunately, disciples are driven by intensity and devotion to take the neededsteps which will bring release and a consequent moving forward, and theincarnation wherein they do this is always peculiarly circumstanced,subjectively at least, even if the exoteric life is of no major interest. Thisis not so with you. In your case the following conditions embody your problemand hence your opportunity:1. The intense difficulty of shifting from one ray to another ray. Theaspiration of your sixth ray astral body must be lifted on to the plane ofknowledge. The power of sense realisation must become divine wisdom throughsurety. Vision must give place to intuitive focussed perception—a very differentthing, my friend.2. You were born in the sign Gemini which again presents its own peculiarproblems. You vibrate between the pairs of opposites in a very pronounced anddefinite manner—as does A.A.B. The point of balance and of equilibrium is ever adifficult one for the disciple to achieve in this sign.3. Your first ray personality works through a physical body which is on the sameray so that a triple first ray energy again complicates your life theme becauseall these forces are concentrated in the lower nature. This could lead (in thecase of a pledged disciple) to a powerful and distracting spiritual ambitionwhich in a group leader—such as you are—would be a detriment to the group. Wherethe astral body is on the sixth ray [514] and devotion is dominant, the glamourof devotion can veil the reality of any existent ambition.4. The present world conflict enhances your problem and makes the whole lifecycle one of the utmost pain yet one of prime importance.There are, my brother, many lives of such a negligible nature that they warrantno comment. Then may come a life when the attention of the soul, of the Masterand of the group upon the physical plane are focussed upon the strugglingdisciple, thus bringing intensification of his situation and forcing him to“struggle into the light of day,” watched by those who understand and by thosewho do not understand. This causes much suffering to the sensitive worker. Allthis applies to you. You hate publicity and yet much that you do courts it. Youare sensitively humble and yet can be trapped and misled sometimes bypersonality pride; you love deeply and sincerely but are apt to express thisthrough devotion instead of through wise identification.I have for you, however, no real concern. I tell you that you need haste indiscarding impediments upon the Way but am assured, through study of your soulcontact, that you will not be hindered.I ask myself what I can do for you and so aid the process of transmutation andrelease through right meditation. I would suggest the following experiment insubjective attitudes. That, in the last analysis, is a definition of meditation.The end of all meditation is concerned with:1. The attitude of the personality to the soul.This is self-control.2. The attitude of integrated man to humanity.This is service.3. The attitude of the disciple to the Hierarchy.This is intuitional sensitivity.4. The attitude of the hierarchical worker to the Plan.This is selection of activity.Ponder on these points. particularly the third which concerns [515] aptly yoursensitive reactions to Us. This reaction will be felt in your soul as a completesurrender in time and space; in the personality it will register either as aglamour or a purificatory process, and in the group as a force, having either agood or a bad effect, according to its colouring by the higher or the lowernature and the activity it will succeed in evoking when it impinges upon thepersonnel of the group.The following exercise can be done four times and repeated three times each day:1. Stand with your arms outspread in the symbol of the Cross.2. Take six long slow breaths, thus establishing a rhythm.3. Then take one long breath and gather up by the power of imagination theenergy of the solar plexus. Then carry it along the spine and upward to thehead, not to the heart as is usually the case.4. Focus the dedicated aspiration and emotional energy in “the secret place” andthen sound the OM. Breathe it down into the throat centre.This can be regarded as an act of breathing in and breathing out and constitutesan activity carried forward on one breath with an interlude of consciousfocussing. You will notice that, in combination with the group meditation, youwill be working actively upon the solar plexus, the head, the heart and thethroat. It will require careful watching of process, results in the centres andconsequent activity.Let me be ambitious for you, my brother of long standing. That I am. I havewatched you with loving understanding for a very long cycle. My love ends notand my care of you is all-surrounding.~August 19421. One there has been. The second lies ahead—not far ahead. Prepare.2. The simplicity of the soul opens the Way to Shamballa. [516]3. Be simple, clear as day and full of love.4. A glamour settles down because a separating wall was built on falsefoundations. Destroy this wall and let the glory in.5. Be not so troubled, brother. Close to my heart you stand and close to that ofMorya. Talk to F.B., for you and he and I are close, and close to Morya.6. Your field of service needs a certain note of quality. Learn to reject andthus discriminate the best.~MY CO-DISCIPLE: September 1943My relation to you is slightly different to that which I face when approachingthe bulk of the members of my Ashram; you belong, as does F.B., to the Ashram ofthe Master Morya. You have been assigned to my Ashram on account of the natureof the vibratory activity of your astral body, and because—owing to your owndefinite soul choice—you are shifting on to the second ray of love-wisdom. Youmight well ask, therefore, how it happens that your orientation has been towardsthe Master M. and that you have been affiliated with His Ashram. The reason isto be found in the fact that your personality, your mental nature and yourphysical body are all upon the first ray, and that consequently the power ofyour intelligent and focussed mind has driven you into the aura of the leadingfirst ray Ashram, and has held you there. Closer participation was not possible,owing to your sixth ray soul, whose natural and predetermined destiny was tofuse its secondary energy with the energy of the second ray, thus opening thedoor for you into a second ray Ashram. It was felt, therefore, that I (throughthe medium of my Ashram) could provide those conditions which would facilitatethis transition and at the same time prepare you for the next great spiritualexpansion of consciousness—the initiation of which you know. This will mark theconsummation of this major life cycle.As you know, and as I have before pointed out, you have a profound task ofbalancing to carry out, owing to the ray [517] energies which at this timecondition your life. Three aspects of the first ray and two aspects of the sixthintensify each other. Were you not the advanced disciple which you are, theywould be liable to produce a life and karmic expression of a fanaticalself-will. To this difficult situation of balancing must be added thedifficulties always entailed in a transitional life wherein a major transfermust be effected. To all this again must be added the present world condition,wherein the Shamballa force is abroad and potently affecting those natures whichhave a preponderance of first ray aptitudes. You have thus no easy time, mybrother. This you realise, and I too know it, and stand by.It was for this reason that I have urged you for some years to concentrate uponthe book “The Way into Shamballa,” knowing that an intelligent and lovingconsideration of the problem would do much to bring your first ray personalitynature into line with the purposes of your second ray soul, and thus facilitatethe transfer of your egoic consciousness off the sixth ray of devotion on to thesecond ray of love-wisdom. The first and the second rays work closely together;love and will are closely identified on the higher levels of consciousness andservice; the two basic energies in reality constitute one great expression ofdivine planning and purpose.It is in this connection too that your relation to F.B. and A.A.B. is no idle ortemporary matter, but one of real import to all of you. This A.A.B. hasrecognised. Several forces—inherent in your own nature or engineered andmanipulated by the ignorant or the less advanced upon the Path—have endeavouredto interfere and prevent the desired relationship. The matter is, however,entirely in your own hands and the amount of contact between the three of you isyour personal matter, for there is no impediment upon the side of the other two.The three of you together could do potent work, and the need of the Ashram atthis time for workers is great—workers who are, as H.P.B. has put it, “as thefingers of one hand.”I would remind you that the potency of disciples and initiates is out of allproportion greater than that of a similar [518] number of aspirants. Theinterplay of loving understanding and of fused wills produces an exceedinglypotent reservoir of energy. This is a point which all disciples should study andupon which they can count as they work together in united effort in any Ashram.As I study you, my brother and my friend, and as I look ahead at your life ofservice and of right intention, one word stands out in my consciousness for you.To it, I referred in the six statements which I earlier gave you. That word is:simplicity . I stated in that earlier writing that the simplicity of the soulopens the way into Shamballa. That was and is an essential key statement foryou. Those upon the second ray fall (as you know) into two groups, generallyspeaking; there are, naturally, numerous exceptions. Souls on the wisdom aspectof the second ray go to Shamballa and join the great Council in some capacity oranother. Such a one was the Buddha. Those on the love aspect of the second raytread one or other of the various paths, primarily that of the World Saviours;They become the divine Psychologists and World Teachers. The Christ combined inHimself all these three great traits.Those in this second group of souls upon the second ray likewise fall into twogroups: They follow the way of specialised detail and of a comprehensiveinclusiveness, and are the outstanding occultists; the other group isdistinguished by pure love. Of the group which finds its way into Shamballa adeveloped simplicity will be found to govern all relations.Simplicity and unity are related; simplicity is one-pointedness of outlook, freefrom glamour and the intricacies of the thoughtform-making mind; simplicity isclarity of purpose and steadfastness in intention and in effort, untrammelled byquestioning and devious introspection; simplicity leads to simple loving, askingnothing in return; simplicity leads to silence—not silence as an escapemechanism, but as an “occult retention of speech.”For you, simplicity is a major essential practice in this next cycle of yourlife, but you will have to decide for yourself [519] what it means for you, andI shall be interested to note your reaction to this word and practice and thechanges it may make in your life and thinking. Simplicity connotes the blueprintwhich “substands” the outer structure of creation, of living, of loving and ofservice, and this is true of a solar system, a planet, humanity or theindividual. It consequently has its immediate application to your ownrequirements and your mode of approach to life and to people. This lovingsimplicity—free from complicated thinking, from mystery and from selfishintrospection—should provide the theme for your meditation work until I nextcommunicate with you. To this I would add an increased concentration upon thepreparation of the book which I seek to have you write and to complete.You see, my brother, it is a book which will take much intuition and spiritualperception to write, and it can only be written by someone who has been trainedin an Ashram. The theme of Shamballa is new, and little is yet known about it,its way of life and its governing laws. Only initiate-disciples can get aglimpse of some of the more exoteric significances, whilst the inner meaningmust be drawn forth by you in deep and concentrated meditation and by thedetermined use of the will. There is no one who can aid you in preparing thisbook except some group brother or someone working consciously in an Ashram. Youwill look in vain for cooperation and help among those you seek to aid and amongthe orthodox and theological esotericist. Some key thoughts I can here give toyou, and if you use them as the theme of your meditation, light upon the subjectmay break forth:1. Shamballa is the place of purpose. It is a purpose which cannot be understooduntil the Plan is followed. Herein lies a clue.2. Shamballa is not a Way, but a major centre of related states and a relativelystatic energy—energy held ready for creative purposes by the focussed intentionof the Great Council, acting under the directing eye of the Lord of the World.[520]3. Shamballa is the major point of tension upon the planet. It is a tension thatexpresses loving intelligent will, free from all self-will or mental bias.4. Shamballa is the major receptive agent upon the planet, from the angle ofsolar inflow, but at the same time it is the main distributing point of energy,from the angle of the kingdoms in nature, including the fifth kingdom. From thepoint of tension the life pattern of the planetary Logos and His will becomeembodied and finally matured through the processes of evolution.5. Shamballa receives energy from various solar and extra-solar Entities orcentres of emphatic and energetic life; i.e., from Venus, from the CentralSpiritual Sun, from the current conditioning constellation through which our sunmay be passing, from the Great Bear and other cosmic centres. Sirius, soimportant a factor in the spiritual life of the planet, brings its energies tobear direct upon the Hierarchy, and energy from Sirius does not normally enterour planetary life via Shamballa.6. Shamballa is the head centre, speaking symbolically, of our planetary Life,focussing will, love and intelligence in one great and fundamental Intention andholding that focussed point throughout the entire life cycle of a planet. Thisgreat Intention embodies current purpose and expresses itself through the mediumof the Plan.These statements may be somewhat familiar to you, but they could provide the sixseed thoughts for your meditative work during the coming year. Will you thusconsider them? Out of the work which you will accomplish thus in meditation(using the heart centre as a balance for the head) you will greatly enrich theproposed book.This coming period of deep reflection upon Shamballa, entailing as it will theentire problem of the Will (in its various aspects), of purpose as it works outin the planet, and of will as it conditions the human being, will bring to thefore in your consciousness the various relations existing between the differingaspects of the will: the relation of your individual self-will to the lovingplan of the soul, of that will to [521] the divine Will, of your spiritual willto the group will, of the group will to the Hierarchy, and of the hierarchicalwill to that of Shamballa. Such are some of the ideas which can govern yourspiritual thinking, reflection and meditation until you again hear from me. Youwill find all these to be intensely practical considerations. The question ofmotive will immediately enter in, for motive underlies will in a most curiousmanner, and motive “substands” purpose. Therefore, your personality motives inlife and service will have to come under review, and their relation to soulmotive. The result of this entire process of thinking will be the subjugation ofyour motives to soul motive, and again, therefore, we shall have thesimplification of your life and the opening up of a wider vision into Shamballa.Shamballa and simplicity, will and motive, will become the directing currents ofthought which will sweep you on your way, closer to my Ashram, nearer to myheart (and here I am speaking both lovingly and technically), and nearer andcloser to humanity.~MY BROTHER AND MY FRIEND: November 1944What I have to say to you today hinges upon one single question: Are you readyto pay the price which the taking of the next initiation entails? All accepteddisciples are preparing for initiation. All are therefore under test. You knowthat you are preparing for initiation; you know which initiation it is. It isbecause of this preparatory period that the past three years have seen youseriously tested, and tested in every aspect of your nature. There is,nevertheless, little that I have been able to do for you because loneliness isone of the assets and also aspects of this work of preparation. Disciples evertake initiations alone, even when preparing for and taking group initiation.This is one of the paradoxes of the occult teaching which is not at all easilyunderstood. It sounds entirely contradictory but is not so at all. It has notbeen easy to reach you either, because you have taken refuge from the tests inthe work of your own group, rather than in the Ashram. In your own group youhave sought forgetfulness [522] and have not sought the protection and the loveof your ashramic group. That is your privilege and your inalienable right. Iwould like, however, to point out to you that it is safer and wiser to takerefuge in both the higher and the lower places of service, and to do thissimultaneously. One place safeguards you as a soul and the other as apersonality.The call of Shamballa, the call of my Ashram, and the call of your own exotericgroup (mark those words, my brother) have sounded forth in your ears and youhave been bewildered; you have forgotten perhaps that if you stand at the midwaypoint (which is my Ashram) you have immediate access to both “points of call.” Ihave here given you an important hint and want you to endeavour to grasp itssignificance.You have been drastically tested in your physical vehicle, and that is hard, mybrother, because it is difficult to preserve one’s equanimity and one’s balanceunder those circumstances. You need, however, to understand better than you dothe “distortions” for which physical sickness is responsible, and thus learnmore wisely to discount yourself and to pay less attention to the glamours ofthe lower self. This would simplify your life, and I told you earlier thatsimplification was a needed attribute for you. You have also been sorely testedin the emotional nature; surely, my beloved brother, you know by this time thatwhen a definite transition is being made by the soul—as is the case where youare concerned—from one ray to another, that abnormal testing is automaticallyinevitable? This will be particularly the case when a disciple is moving on tothe second ray, owing to its close relationship with the emotional-intuitivenature, and when also you have—as you know—three first ray controls in yourpersonality equipment.This necessarily engenders a serious problem. You have also been cruelly testedin your mental nature by the war and through your intense grasp of human pain,as well as by your understanding of psychological reactions. These have servedto enhance your problem, and your entire emotional and mental reaction to warand its happenings has well-nigh crippled your essential (not your apparent)usefulness. You [523] have, within yourself, questioned the foundations of allthings, and life has been most complicated for you—physically, emotionally andmentally. Owing to the dominance of the first ray in your equipment, you havesuccessfully withdrawn yourself from your group brothers; you have consideredthat they had naught to give you, and you realised that—feeling this way—you hadnaught for them. Detachment is the path of least resistance for a first raynature, and (if you will permit me to say so and will accept this statement)indicates definitely the dominance at this time of personality reactions. Yoursecond ray soul does not sanction detachment, and hence the conflict being wagedwithin your consciousness.Yet, my brother and my comrade, the deep and lasting love of two of your groupbrothers has steadily protected you during this time of trial and of difficulty,as has the love of A.A.B. She asks me not to tell you this, indeed she begs menot to do so, for she is sensitive interiorly to all that affects you. It is,however, right that you should know.So, brother of mine, we come back to the question of the reason for all thisharshness in life and to the initiation for which you are preparing. Inconnection with this I would say: Get back to the “midway point” and to theprotecting love of the Ashram. Then the strength of Shamballa to which you soeasily respond can safely pour in; then, too, will come the wisdom which willenable you to render better service to the world. See therefore how simple isthe message which I have for you at this time, and remember that I told you lastyear that simplicity held for you the key to all success. You are not trulysuccessful just at present. Simplicity does not rule.Relinquish the thoughtforms which seem at this time to stand between you and theAshram. You will know what these are if you will take three days of quietretirement and during that time refuse to think about your work, about yourgroups, their personnel or about yourself and your past activities, as well asabout your group brothers. Aim simply to achieve a point of orientation towardsme and the Ashram; endeavour to respond consciously to hierarchical impression,[524] shutting out (at least for those three days) every kind of reaction tohuman happenings. Aim at a point of tension from which new endeavour and newenterprise can become possible. Then rededicate yourself to the service ofhumanity; reconsecrate yourself to cooperation with the Hierarchy, and regainyour early enthusiasm in relation to Us and Our work. Then again resume yourworld contacts. There will be three letters which you will find it necessary towrite if these days are productive of renewed contact with hierarchical force.You will know to whom these letters should go and what they will state.Take proper medical help, brother of mine. Take time to get the physical vehiclein better condition. The reflex action of the body upon the emotional nature andupon the mind is great. As a psychologist you know this, but fail to apply toyourself what you so helpfully apply to others. Have confidence in my belief andtrust in you, and let the remaining years of your life be triumphant in love ;let them be negative to criticism; all your group brothers are handling problemsequal in difficulty to yours; proffer rich cooperation to them and to theHierarchy. My love and blessing is ever yours, and this you know.~MY BELOVED BROTHER: August 1946I would like to start my communication to you with a clear and definitestatement: You are in process of taking some of the final tests which precedethe taking of the second initiation. For that reason, I feel the need of writingto you with clarity, of bringing you some measure of comfort and of strength,and of indicating certain steps which—if you will take them—may hasten theprocess.Yet I feel very great difficulty in approaching you, though not for the usualreasons. Oft a Master cannot at some particular time reach a disciple because heis surrounded with too much activity, or with activities of the wrong kind; insome cases, the thought-life of the disciple has created so many thoughtformsthat temporarily he cannot be reached; [525] or again, he is absorbed in someform of service which he deems essential and which looms larger in hisconsciousness than the work of the Ashram with which he is affiliated. These,however, are not the things which hinder an easy contact with you. What dohinder are the results in your consciousness, at this particular stage, of thetests of the initiation themselves. It is the emotional glamour which hasengulfed you, and freedom from glamour has to be demonstrated at the secondinitiation; it is the intense awareness you experience, at this time, ofyourself—the central factor. This again is a necessary but distressing preludeto this initiation. This glamour comes between you and me. The self-awarenesscomes also between you and the Ashram, as well as between you and the groupwhich you have gathered around you upon the physical plane.Having read this far, will you, brother of mine, continue? There is someprobability that you will not. You may take the position (I say not you will)that you repudiate as false all relations to glamour. You may declare that ittouches you not, which assertion itself would indicate that it does. Your deeplyseated sense of spiritual superiority to your group (an attitude which is sadlyaffecting them) may prevent your listening to me, your friend and brother formany years—nay, lives. I would, however, ask you to read what I have to say;perchance I may throw light upon your problems and aid you to take theinitiation which was your destined goal this life, but which you may yourselfpostpone until the next. For this postponement there is no need, if you graspthe significance of what is happening in your life at present.The second initiation is a profoundly difficult one to take. For those upon thefirst or second rays of aspect it is probably the most difficult of them all.The astral nature is deeply self-centred, and this the inflow of soul energy inthe initiatory period intensifies; it is endowed with acute emotionalism andswift response to glamour. Where there is so much first ray energy to be found(as in your case) there will be a strong conviction of destiny, a pronouncedsense of power, and the feeling that you can see through people—from a superiorposition—so that their faults and failures [526] and their little human failingsloom large in your consciousness.You are at this time in a state of intensely irritable sensitivity to all andsundry; you are overwhelmed by acute glamour. All that is in you of a first rayquality is drawn to the surface and conditioning all your contacts. Your soulray of outgoing love is not much seen, and there is little love shown by you toyour brothers in the Ashram or to the members of your own group.You may here ask me at this point how I know this to be so and why I emphasiseto you this knowledge. You have been taught by me that the Masters concern notThemselves with the personality details of a disciple’s life expression;therefore, why do I concern myself with what is happening to you? Those are justquestions and I will answer them.I concern myself with your problems because you are taking the second initiationand—because of its intense difficulty—I have watched over you for the past fouryears with more than usual care. I know the inner turmoil, theself-recriminations and the self-rationalisings, the deep subjective discontent,the longing to be free, and the atmosphere of acute suffering in which you live.Your spiritual morale is not high because your solar plexus is wideopen—responsive to every astral suggestion, disturbed by world pain as well asby your own, in a state of irritation and constant inner explosion over yourbrothers in the Ashram and over the members of your own group. Many of thelatter are also of an emotional type, for forget not, my brother, we draw toourselves those who respond to our major quality at any given time and—at thistime—yours is emotional.I would remind you that the emotion to which I refer in connection with you isnot that of the ordinary person. You are confronted with the emotion which thesecond initiation stirs up. This is a very different matter. You should realise,therefore, that my rating of you is high. It is a spiritual rating and hasnothing to do with the rating of yourself behind which you hide your hurt andsuffering soul and which you seek to impose upon your students everywhere. Myrating is true, and you will weather these stormy waters and arrive in [527] thequiet land of realities, free from all emotion, yet at the same time, full ofunimpeded love. This is the reward of perseverance throughout the tests andtrials of the second initiation.What I am seeking to do is to help, to indicate the nature of the tests andpoint out to you the reason why these tests and trials have overtaken you.Everything may seem to fail you—your knowledge of psychology, your groups ofstudents, your friends and your brothers in the Ashram. Think not that thisindicates the fourth initiation, the Crucifixion. That initiation has to befaced clear-eyed, free from glamour, with a heart full of love and a mindreleased from all criticism. For this, the second initiation prepares thedisciple. Today, you know you are full of emotion and that it almost sweeps youoff your feet at times; you know you are more prone to criticism than not; andyou know that under the influence of glamour you oft wield the weapon of speechin a destructive manner and not constructively; you know that—deep withinyourself—you are not satisfied with the work you do or the words you write.The book you have lately published I have psychometrised and find it to be sixthray in nature; it will prove most helpful to probationary disciples, and theyneed such help; it will not help disciples, for it deals with that which theyknow well. The call went out to you from the Ashram to write upon the theme ofShamballa, the centre where the will of God is known and from whence the love ofGod flows forth. This you rejected, owing to the emotional turmoil in which youfound yourself. Yet I had a purpose and a reason in suggesting this theme. Itwas not just to have a book which would be of service to disciples, but becauseit was essential—as part of the pre-initiation tests for you—to bring in some ofthe Shamballa force to your consciousness. It was the impact of this Shamballaforce (which you can touch and to which you can intelligently respond) which wasthe main factor in bringing to the surface all the latent emotion and all theglamour which are today enveloping you. As you considered the theme of Shamballa(and later rejected my suggestion to write upon it) you brought yourself [528]in contact with the energy emanating from Shamballa. Yet, my brother, had youoccupied yourself with my suggestion and dealt with the theme The Way intoShamballa much of that Shamballa force would have been transmuted alongconstructive lines and creative endeavour, and your condition would not be whatit is today.You may well ask here: If all this is so, what then shall I do? Have I failed inthe tests for initiation? What do you suggest?Most certainly you have not failed . You are at the climax or peak of thetesting period. The only point to be determined is: Can you overcome in thislife and free yourself from astral control, or will the tests be prolonged untilnext life?These are questions which only you can answer. In order to answer them youshould enter into a cycle of intense quiet and—if possible—of peacefulnormality. Can you free yourself for two years, my brother, and at the end standfree? You would be well advised to do this; you should relinquish your groupsand stand alone. At present you are not working along new age lines, for yourwork is along the old lines—of superior teachers, gathering their groups aroundthem , of mystery where there is no mystery, because there is no mystery inesoteric teaching, and this is a lesson which you sorely need to learn, and ofcriticism (openly critical) of the student, which is sadly lacking in love. Nonew age teacher gathers a group around himself, exacting their loyalty andobedience, nor does he shut the door to other aspects of truth, as you havedone. He offers the teaching, and regards himself as only a student.So I would urge you to give up your group for two or three years (you can laterresume it and with power) and study the handling of energy for yourself—freefrom emotion, desire for recognition, and in response to human need. I wouldalso urge upon you a meditation, built around the words:1. Occult Obedience.2. Occult Meditation.[529] You would profit greatly. Seek to find me and walk with me in my Ashram,where your soul ray will be fostered into greater expression and yourpersonality rays will retire into the background. If you have the strength to dothis you will—at the close of the period of self-imposed discipline—enter into acycle of very great usefulness. I foresaw this cycle of useful work when I firstcontacted you. There is still time for this emergence into wider world service.It need not be postponed until next life.You have suffered much, my brother, and have few to whom you can go. My love andmy blessing are around you always and I have held you specially close latelyduring these difficult post-war days. Disciples such as you react not only totheir own tests and problems, but also to those of suffering humanity. You willfind me near when you need me.NOTE: This disciple chose to withdraw from the Tibetan’s group and, until theclose of his life in 1953, carried on his own established line of service.~TO L. F. U.BROTHER OF MINE: August 1940I scarce know what to say to you for the body is tired, the mind is bewildered,the emotional nature is striving to assert itself whilst the soul is pouring ina stimulating energy which is responsible for a very definite crisis in yourlife. It is of interest to me to know how many members of the group are nowbeing tested—a thing which was foreseen by me but refused consideration byseveral of you. Several members of the group are undergoing the painful test ofwar, with its inevitable nervous effects upon the constitution, its strain uponthe astral body as well as the physical, and the reactions to noise, suspense onbehalf of others and the general psychic atmosphere in which they are forced todwell. P.D.W., D.E.I., and L.D.O. are thus situated and the test is great.You, my brother, and W.O.I. are likewise being tested in [530] the world ofideas, and you particularly are faced with an acute problem in discrimination.Earlier—years ago—I gave you three words which were to be the keynotes of yourlife—Love, Fearlessness and Understanding. The first two have preoccupied youmuch. You have worked hard to express love and have materially sweetened andbroadened your nature. As a result you are aware today, as never before, howlack of love betrayed you and brought untold suffering to three people in yourlife. This is known only to you. Fearlessness is now a glamour in your mind foryour sixth ray brain and astral body have suddenly betrayed you. Your earlierfreedom from glamour led to carelessness—and as you well know we are oftbetrayed at the point where we judged ourselves the strongest. Nevertheless, thepast few years have seen real progress, pronounced liberation and truedevelopment.Have you, my brother, reached your high water mark for this life? Can you gofurther still along the Way? That is your problem. It will be solved and wiselydetermined and you will enter upon a new cycle of spiritual life ifunderstanding and a search for meaning begins to parallel your reaction to loveand fearlessness.Your understanding is not deep enough. That which is academic and the result ofreading, listening, and of your response to the work of the Arcane School is aptto take the place of true understanding. True understanding involvesidentification with humanity.Your theories, your ideals, your fixed beliefs come between you and humanity asa whole, and the good of the form side of life looms unduly large in yourattitude to service. You are, under the glamour of idealism, apt to sacrificethe spirit of love in order to preserve the form of your ideal. Ponder on thisfor it is basic in its teaching value for you if you grasp rightly theimplications. May I ask you to reflect upon the esoteric significance of a truthwhich as yet seems to you most questionable: Ideals must go as they are nowformulated because we are entering into a new age wherein all things will becomenew. They can safely be relinquished when their place is taken by a real soullove for humanity—[531] inclusive, sane and practical. Ideals are formulationsby the human mind. The Hierarchy has no ideals. The Hierarchy is simply thechannel for pure love and where love exists there is no danger of harshness, ofcruelty, of misunderstanding, of evasion of facts or of harmfulness. Much alsothat many regard as harmless is definitely harmful in its general effects.Ideals, as usually held, feed pride, lead to stubbornness, and engender aseparative superiority; they produce impractical attitudes and negativeactivities. The one who thus holds them frequently serves only in the limitedfield, conditioned by his chosen work and coloured by his idealism. He excludesthe Whole and thinks in terms of the past and as he wants to think. There is noreal understanding of an opposing idealism and often no real attempt tocomprehend its basis. His emphasis upon his own ideals (in his own consciousnesseven when not imposed on others) prevents understanding, and he is so busyupholding them and defending them (oft again to himself) and being conditionedby them that the larger human issues escape his attention. He settles downwithin the limits of his own beliefs. This makes him immediately a theologianand his usefulness then rapidly evaporates, except in the intimate circle of hisfellow idealists. As time goes on, crystallisation takes place. A “crystalbarrier” is set up between the personality and the soul. The soul is seen butits influence is insulated. But—because there is a vision of the soul stillpersisting—the disciple is deeply dissatisfied. The crystallisation eventuallyaffects all aspects of the nature. Emotions settle into “grooves of crystal”;the mind becomes set and brittle. The physical body crystallises also and getsold rapidly because there is no free flow of life.One thing only will prevent this happening: Loving understanding and aconsequent sacrifice of the life to humanity as a whole. The greatest good ofthe greatest number becomes his life theme and to this the whole man issubordinated.Can you grasp this vision and let everything go? Only two types of ray energyare expressing themselves through your lower nature: intellect and idealism.Ponder a little on the effects of this unbalanced condition and consider what it[532] will engender. Be not satisfied with your mental activity and yourdedicated idealism. Reach beyond them to the soul whose nature is love and whoseidentification is with humanity and not with a school of thought or a group ofideals.You stand at the parting of the ways, my brother. Will you come on to renewedservice, to new ideals, and to a fresh cycle of creative living? Or will yousettle down into a crystallised condition and to an ardent struggle to becomecreative and to express ideals which are perhaps already superseded in order tomake room for higher and better ones. Thus you might stand still within the auraof that which is old and make no further progress, waking up later to therealisation that creative living is a spontaneous happening and that your idealshave been superseded by greater and more spiritual ones.I give you no personal meditation. The one assigned to the group in the groupinstruction is peculiarly adapted to bring about in you the needed changes,provided you follow the meditation with regularity.I would, however, ask you to take two points of reflection every day when itsuits you best and for your reflective theme I would suggest “Understanding ofthe New Age Ideals,” remembering that the new ideals concern the life and notthe form.My blessing rests ever on you for I have much for you to do. I would remind youthat in your last instruction I asked you if you were strong enough toparticipate in the world distress with no barriers up. I asked this because Isaw in you a glamour and a weakness (based on your true ideals) and a negativitywhich hid itself behind a fearless idealism. I pointed then—if you willrecall—to the need for “active understanding.” I reiterate again this call.~August 19421. From where you stand I see a point of light, a shimmering thread of gold. Itpasses from your heart to mine and strengthens day by day, each year. Passonward on this bridge of light. [533]2. Ever to you my message has gone forth: Love and more love. Again I send itforth and with my love.3. You restrict your field of service, brother of old. Expand again.4. My brother, the need of your heart is the need of my heart and the need ofyour brothers. This fusing of need will call forth the sun and shadows willdisappear.5. Men climb a wall, the sage remarked, and sit athwart the top. Then they climbdown. Ponder on this.6. At the foot of the wall lies a well, added the sage. Love lies at the bottomof the well. It cannot be drowned, but men love not deep water.~BROTHER OF OLD: September 1943There are certain key points in all lives which are deciding and frequentlyreleasing factors. A major one for all disciples occurs around the age ofthirty-five, and still another at the age of forty-two. It was when you reachedthat age that I intensified my observation of you. You had, if I may so expressit, wandered (unconsciously to yourself) to the very edge of the aura of myAshram. Later, when you entered the Arcane School and became one of its workers,you penetrated deeper into the Ashram in response to a certain drawing powerwhich I deliberately exerted. I had long registered your “seeking vibration.”Another key point comes ever at the age of fifty-six, and as you neared thatage, the pressure exerted on you by the conflicting pull of the Ashram, of yourown soul and your personality mental processes created a dominant test in yourlife. In consequence of the reaction of the personality, of the soul test thusdrastically imposed, and of your response to circumstances, your life is todayconditioned as it is. You will understand whereof I speak and there is no needfor me to be more explicit. The age of sixty-three will see another and lessercrisis, and upon the decision then made by you (and it can be physical,emotional, mental or of soul origin) [534] will depend the future of your lifein this particular incarnation.If your decisions—then and now—are made esoterically within my Ashram and wherethe focus of your life does persist, all will be well; if they are made throughthe use of the lower mind and under the influence of its rationalisinginfluence, you are liable to make mistakes. Always in your life crises, you havebeen confronted by the way of love and by the way of mind, and usually yourdecisions have been the rational decisions of a somewhat aloof and self-focussedpersonality. Your last decision and chosen line of activity (which was of adefinitely determining nature) was, for you, quite the most difficult, becauseyou did not see as clearly as usual; your concrete lower mind did not apparentlydisplay its usual keen vision, and the “alternatives which love presents”—as oneof the Masters has oft expressed it—blurred the usually clear lower vision butmade decision on a higher level than heretofore possible. You underwent a periodof much training and inner adjustment. Is this not so, my brother?I watched with love and understanding, for that emotional disruption (wellconcealed from the outer world) was not concealed from me. I rejoiced, for itlet in so much light that you have made more progress in the past three yearsthan at any previous time in your life. You might ask me: Along what line? Myreply would be: Along the line of an inclusive vision which sees the future ofhumanity more clearly in the light of the present than has ever before beenpossible to you. That is a great step onward.For years I have emphasised to you the need for heart-love, and consistently andsteadily you have tried to develop it through meditation, by theorising and by aconscious effort to love. Love, my brother, when present and of the right kindengenders a sense of personal responsibility. These are phases of responsibilitywhich are based on love and not on work to be done, positions to be filled,people to be laboriously understood and the performance of your duties as acitizen, as an executive, or as an employee. Such phases have been curiouslylacking in your life. You have evaded them, and this evasion has had its rootsin an unrecognised fear of [535] failure should responsibility (through love forothers) be shouldered by you; you have reacted to a profound distrust ofyourself and to a fear of the intrusion of others unduly (not altogether, butunduly) in your ordered, planned life.Most things can be viewed as too late for changing if approached in terms of oneincarnation, but the soul thinks in terms of life cycles. A full and rich lifecycle will open up for you as a consequence of this present incarnation, if youwill handle your remaining years in a spirit of selfless responsive love—askingnothing for the separated self.I have no fears for you, my brother. I would recall to you that the disruptingof life processes and the upheaval of an ordered point of view and of a plannedand reasoned approach to daily living is in a measure a great releasing—areleasing of hidden beauties, unsuspected and seeking the light of day. Have younot read that the bombing of London by high explosives produced great upheavalsand that ancient layers of soil—hidden for centuries from the light of day—werebrought to the surface? As a result, strange, rare, unknown and beautifulflowers have this summer appeared to excite interest and investigation and tohide the ruins with beauty and colour. Ponder on this, for so it can be with ahuman life. Beauty is beginning to flower in your life, bringing its ownresponsibilities, engendering its own magnetic field, bringing to you those whootherwise might not have ventured to come, and who will give you a love whichmay at first arouse questioning in your mind but which will greatly enrich yourlife. It will also evoke responsibility. This responsibility will definitelyextend your field of service. Be willing, therefore, to descend into the deepwater to which I made reference in the last of the six statements given to youlast year. The higher the wall, brother of mine, from which you fall, the deeperinto the water you will go, and that, paradoxically, will be your salvation—mybeloved brother. Look for this development and welcome it.In view of all the above remarks, I am going to ask you to write—during thecoming year—three short papers. In the first will you give seven concisedefinitions of love—not of emotion or sentiment or feeling, but of soul or heartlove. [536] Make three of these definitions practical and four of them abstractand esoteric. This will not be easy, and this distinction itself will increaseyour difficulty. Then write a short paper on love as it expresses itself throughemotion. I mean the love of the soul as it defines itself astrally and uses theastral body as a medium of expression. Finally, write another paper on themental expression of love. For this assignment of work much occult andpsychological knowledge will be needed; you are however adequate to the task,and these distinctions and interpretations are badly needed by aspirants todayand by disciples everywhere, struggling with the practical application of occulttruths; you can help much by clear thinking upon this theme and consequent clearexposition. Ideas become individual possessions as you think them and write themdown, and this is the way, par excellence, for you to learn, to absorb and todemonstrate.Guard your physical health, my brother. Be not unduly concerned and cautious,but be reasonable whilst unafraid. There is work for you to do and your nextunfoldment of work will come to you through the means of a breaking down of awall of pride, and a conversation—and in that order.The thread of gold which “passes from your heart to mine” is now anunshatterable chain of golden links, and there is work for you in my Ashram.~MY BROTHER: November 1944In my last instruction to you there occurs one sentence which could convey toyou the key whereby you can unlock the door of the future. It is a sentencewhich has probably escaped your notice; I doubt if it ever registered itselfadequately in your mind. I now recall it to you. I said: “If your decisions aremade esoterically within my Ashram, all will be well.”Life, as you know theoretically, is one long series of presentedopportunities—opportunities to make decisions. As a disciple is drawn closerinto the focal point of his Master’s [537] sphere of influence, the Ashram, andas experience proceeds, these decisions become increasingly drastic, constantlymore frequent and more crucial in their general trend; they lead, when made, tomore eventful results. With a disciple at your stage of development, the linesof choice become clearer and better defined. The questions with which you arefaced are simpler and yet more important: Is this presented activity the way mysoul would have me go? Will such or such a decision lead to the fulfilment of mypersonality trends and bias? Herein lies much clarification plus increasingdifficulty, because the decisions made are apt to affect many others besidesyourself. Watch for the proof of the correctness of this last statement of mine.In all times of decision enumerate to yourself the number of lives apt to beaffected by what you do, and remember that (as you travel the Way of theDisciple) your sphere of influence and the number of those affected by yousteadily increases. With the average person who is kind, well-meaning andendowed with a normal sense of responsibility, decisions are made upon the basisof the effects which are liable to work out in the family, in the business oroffice or within the radius of a relatively small circle of friends. In the caseof a probationary disciple, decisions have oft a somewhat larger result. Wherean accepted disciple is concerned, such choices affect many, for those relatedby united service are included with the other groups, and these can oft beunknown or include people who react to the aura of a disciple, plus his group ofco-workers.This whole question of spheres of influence is one upon which you need toponder. It is closely related to the problem of the aura and its esotericcircumference; it concerns the “sound” of a disciple’s life and the nature andquality of the radiations which emanate from the “place where he stands.” It istied to the whole theme of orientation and of spiritual location and to themagnetic effects of the at-one-ing of soul and personality. The problem ofradiation and of magnetic influence is apt to be viewed from the one-sided pointof view of the disciple who considers the results of his radiation and of hismagnetism upon those he contacts. There is however another point of view; thesequalities—inevitable [538] and inescapable—lie behind the entire theme of karma.They draw to the disciple that which can hinder him as well as aid him; hisaura—which is a combination of radiations, energies and arranged forces—canrepel the good or attract the bad, and vice versa; it can determine—through thecontacts made and the relationships set up—the trend of the disciple’s life. Itis one of the main factors in the presentation of choices, and I would have youthink on this.As I write this instruction I would call your attention to the subject of karma.There comes ever in the life of a disciple and in the soul’s experience some oneparticular life wherein the Law of Cause and Effect assumes importance in theconsciousness. From that life and that moment, the disciple begins to deal withkarma, consciously and definitely. He learns to recognise it when events andhappenings come which require understanding and which evoke questioning; hebegins to study the quality of his radiation as a karmic agent, and therefore hebecomes the maker and constructor, in a new and important sense, of his owndestiny and future. His reactions to life and circumstances cease to be simplyemotional in nature and become deliberately dictated by conscious observation;they then have in them a significant quality of preparation which is absent fromthe life of the average man. For the remainder of this life, therefore, I wouldask you to carry the theme of karmic decision and of preparation for the futureever in your consciousness; I would ask you always to take action with as fullan understanding of the probable following effects as you can manage to achieve,and to make a real effort to study the Law of Consequence and Compensation.You are perhaps wondering at this time why I am thus emphasising a somewhat coldand difficult consideration. My reason is as follows: During your past life youhave five times made certain definite decisions. By means of these decisions youhave directed your energies in some one specific direction. You have therebyshort-circuited these energies in another direction and you have brought by youraction other lives than your own within your range of influence. I am going tosuggest that you take each of these five points of crisis, if I [539] may callthem so, and (for your own aiding and help) analyse them, define accurately toyourself the conditioning motives which impelled you to action, measure thenature of the consequent results as they worked out in your life, and gaugethese results in such a manner that you come to a realisation as to whether theywere good enough to warrant the choice you made. I would ask you to see wherecauses for encouragement or regret may lie and thus, my brother, arrive at aclear comprehension of yourself as a directing agent.I believe that it is essentially necessary that you discover—alone and byyourself—whether these five choices were made as a conscious result of soul orpersonality decision, and that you should understand the reasons why you thinkso. You have reached a point in your present incarnation where it is alsoessential that you undertake the summing up of the various conditioning factorsin your life. If you can do this, you will be enabled to bring this particularincarnation to a finish on a high note of intelligent and useful living. Whenthe time comes, therefore, for you to pass over to the other side, you will findthat you can do so with a full realisation of what should be the theme of yournext earthly experience. I would have you realise that this is no morbid orunwholesome line of thought. I would like to indicate to you the fact that inyour next incarnation you will find that the theme of “conditioning motives andassumed responsibility” will be incessantly present with you from the moment ofyour birth.In this life, your theme has been largely that of expediency and of expressionto meet the expediency; these motives are in no sense basically wrong; they haveenabled you to be soundly motivated; carefully implemented, these themes shouldcarry you far. You have, however, definitely over-emphasised creativity; youhave made it a motive for your life, but you have forgotten that the expressionof the creative faculty is radiation and magnetism. These bring to its possessorthe material for creation and a magnetic capacity which arranges in due form andbeauty that which radiation has evoked. Creativity is a consequence of aparticular state of mind and a specific state of being; it signifies a point in[540] evolution wherein the disciple is definitely radioactive. He can no morehelp creating in some form or another than he can help living. After all, mybrother—returning to the original comments in this instruction—karma is ever thesource of physical plane creation, happenings and events; it is the instrumentof the soul in producing a personality.We come now to the recognition that (where you are concerned) three words are ofmajor importance, if you are to take what is for you your next spiritual stepforward, karmically considered. These three words are: Karma, Radiation,Creation. For the remainder of this life you must earnestly aim at a closerrelation to me and to my Ashram, for that is your karma. Fundamentally, nothingcan interfere with this karma except the time equation, and you can thereforemake this closer contact either with rapidity or slowness. It is the time factorwhich lies within the scope of your decision and it is in relation to time thatyou must do some careful thinking. That which will impel you to make a closercontact with your ashramic group will be an intensification of your radiation. Adisciple is not drawn into a close rapport with the Ashram by the magnetic,radiatory power of the Ashram alone. Disciples need to grasp the fact that they,themselves, have to draw the Ashram to them, symbolically speaking, by thepotency of their own magnetic radiation. It is necessary, therefore, that youintensify your radiation and that you carefully bear in mind that, as your karmacarries you towards hierarchical contact, and as your radiation produces itsindividual effect upon the ashramic group, the consequent display of creativitymust and will lie along the line of personality fulfilment and the meeting ofdeep-seated desire. Therefore, search your motives and the nature of yourdesires.For years, my brother, I have sought to help you. You are in my Ashram, thoughyou are not as yet in the inner circle; you belong to a group of brotherswho—along with you—are struggling earnestly for spiritual fulfilment and whohave been clearly told that their karma has brought them into the ranks ofaccepted discipleship and who are preparing for the next step ahead of them—thetaking of an initiation. Each [541] of you, in his own place, is facing thisinitiatory process. I might add that every member of the Hierarchy, from Christdown to the disciple who is preparing for the second initiation, is standing inthe knowledge that initiation in some degree must be taken and may not beignored or denied. Will you understand me, my brother, if I say to you: Takethis consciousness into your thinking and let this idea or knowledge conditionall your activities. Say to yourself each morning before you go forth to theduties of the day: “I am preparing to move forward upon the Path of Initiation.”Let this affirmed realisation show itself forth in the quality of your dailyactivities.Love more, my brother. You only deeply love two or three people; let thatlimited love be the seed which will produce the flowering forth of a lovingspirit. Disciples need to remember that love brings all earthly karma to an end.Love induces that radiation which invokes and evokes not only the heart of Godbut the heart of humanity also. Love is the cause of all creation and thesustaining factor in all living.Make your remaining years expressive of radiating love, which is not at all easyfor you. Remember ever that my Ashram enfolds you, without cessation, in itsradiation. Work steadily in cooperation with your group brothers. Even thoughthe personality instructions come to an end, the group instructions will giveyou all the help you will need. But you must act upon these instructions andhold with steadfastness your relation to the life of the group. This is all Ihave to say to you, but if you measure up to these instructions, you will gofar. My constant blessing rests upon you.~MY BROTHER OF THE STEADFAST HEART: August 1946I do not find as I approach you today that there is a great deal that I have tosay to you. You are now accurately self-directing (like you not that phrase?)and your direction is right. The various suggestions which I have made to you,and which were of major importance, you have carefully followed, [542] and Ibelieve would testify to the good results attained. That occult obedience whichsignifies freedom, spiritual freedom, within a world of natural law, hasgarnered for you sound results. You have moved forward from the periphery of theAshram to a position nearer the centre. See that you hold that position; it willgive you a wider field of service, a greater spiritual influence and anunderstanding which grasps essentials and sees life in a truer perspective.The disbanding of the outer Ashram need in no way disturb the rhythm you areachieving and many of your group brothers and fellow students will look to youfor aid and comprehension. Say not always the nice or loving thing, but learn tosay the hard things with unalterable love. This is not easy for you.Being now the sannyasin and free, I would ask of you something practical andneeded. The Arcane School stands at a point of real expansion; it is adequatelystaffed at its key points. I would ask you undeviatingly to stand by A.A.B. (asyou do), and also by F.B., when need arises. The work in the world will grow inevery land, and behind all the various activities stands the Arcane School. TheTriangles and the Goodwill work will spread. But the Arcane School must continueas the heart of all the other activities. The staff is sound and can do much,but all of us need the cooperation, the co-inspiration and the use of asustaining mind other than our own. Will you act in that capacity with them?This will require on your part extended vision, for that has been somewhatlacking in your general attitude, as I think you would be the first to admit;you have prided yourself (and rightly) on being realistic and factual, but yourrealism must extend also to the inner realities and to the subjective, which aremore important than the objective. You need to live more subjectively. It isthis blended realism which I would ask you to cultivate, for it creates—whenachieved—the understanding work with vision, a capacity for long-range planning,and yet withal the feet are truly planted on the earth.I would suggest to you, my brother, a less intense consideration [543] of theway you go and of the “demonstration” you make. That way is now established; youwill not be deflected and you have wrought into the garment of your nature manynew qualities and have rid yourself of many handicaps. Let that suffice, and foryour remaining years be the worker, the guide, the serene watcher, and astrength to your co-workers—without fear, with confidence in the law, but—aboveall—with a much more inclusive vision than heretofore. Learn to think in wideterms and world planning, aiding F.B., when due time comes, in formulating thepolicies and the blueprints for the expansion of the work.Make yourself accessible, my brother, and more and more people will seek youout. Your work in the future, as you well realise, lies with the Arcane School,and your field of service is unlimited.As regards your meditation work, I would like it to centre more definitely onthe Ashram and be less occupied with yourself and the formation of your owncharacter or with your own development. As I said above, that is now stabilised.Meditation on the Ashram—having dealt with the suggested theme as the soul,functioning through the mind—will deal practically with the effects of ashramiccontact on the emotional nature and on the daily life on the physical plane. Igive you the following themes, covering a year’s work which, if diligentlyconsidered for several years, will produce a factual life of real value.Themes for Meditation.1. The fact of the Ashram . You like facts, brother of mine, so apply thisfactual consciousness of yours to this subject.2. The Ashram as a centre of life. This will involve the use of the antahkarana.3. The Ashram as a centre of love, wisely expressed.4. The Ashram as a centre of perfected intelligence.5. The Master of the Ashram.6. The Ashram as a centre of living energy. [544]7. The relationship of the Ashram to world affairs.8. The responsibilities shouldered by members of the Ashram.9. The eventual externalisation of the Ashram and how it is achieved.10. The qualities fostered by ashramic life.11. The service rendered by the Ashram.12. The Ashram and the Arcane School.I am pleased with the progress you have made during the past few years. Failurehas not deterred you and appreciation will not hurt you. My strength andunderstanding are ever at your service on just demand.~TO I. B. S.MY BROTHER: August 1940There is a question concerning the future and your responsibility which is atthis time much disturbing your mind. It intrudes powerfully at times into yourconsciousness. Up till now—after a period of inner wrestling and consequentdecision—you have evaded the full facing of the implications and the effectwhich action may have upon the future. The service of a disciple is frequentlyaffected by his inner worries and defensive suppressions. The free flow ofinspiration is halted in the astral body and there stagnates (if I may use soinappropriate a word). He is conscious of the inspiration but is puzzled at thesmall effect it appears to have upon other people. He wonders constantly wherethe difficulty lies. Often it lies in an unsolved problem which serves tobewilder the subconscious nature, as the psychologists call it; it may lie in ahalf-realised inability to work out right relations with people, fretting andgnawing at the lower layers of unformulated thought; it may be found in a stateof inner rebellion against life, against people, against the disciple’s owndecisions, leading thus to a most definite orientation or focus of the entirepersonality.[545] When the personality ray is the same as the ray of the astral body (as inyour case) a most difficult situation is apt to arise, handicapping the serviceuntil such time as right inner adjustments are made. In a curious way, you areisolated from many people by the power and focus of your third ray physicalbody—a thing which you are the last to desire but which is due to the dominanceof the first ray element in your nature, for it conditions your soul quality andthat expresses itself through the third ray physical nature. Intense focus is,therefore, the continuous theme of your life expression for—as you know—you havethe first ray and the sixth ray continuously interrelated in your nature.The offsetting factor is your mind which is governed by the fourth ray. Thisinfluence too is frequently found in this seed group, for ten of the groupmembers have the mind as the battle ground of conflict—a conflict which is thusplanned in order to produce an eventual harmony. Disciples such as yourselves,therefore, will not find release from conflict through the control of desire, orthrough evasion or through inhibition. They will find it through the right useof the thought processes and through the mind itself, for it can throw upon theproblem the light which shines through it. This will bring right solution andcorrect understanding. You do wrestle with your problem, my brother, for yoursincere desire is to follow the path of spiritual development but you make theastral body your battle ground whereas the whole problem should be elevated tomental levels. Think this out and then carry forward right action in twodirections: on the mental plane for guidance and down to the physical plane fordemonstration.You will know to what problem or problems I refer. None of your group brotherswill understand to what particular condition I now make allusion. It is aproblem which you must handle in isolation and when handled, it will open foryou a perfect floodgate of relationships and opportunities. Your aim shouldtherefore be the intensification of the illumination of the mind so that thesearchlight of the mind can be turned upon the fogs and difficulties of theastral body.Of one thing we who are watching the disciples of the [546] world today areconvinced, and that is that you are a sincere and intelligent devotee;intelligence and devotion go hand in hand in the accepted disciple, balancingeach other and then producing a definite focus of power. For all of you this isan incarnation wherein the life focus becomes either irrevocably oriented towardthe soul, as must be the case with newly accepted disciples, or powerfullyexpanded and inclusive as in the case of older disciples. In your case, theachievement of a definite focus is now essential. In the manifestation of soulsin time and space, there come lives wherein—at times—a soul problem (as thepersonality embraces it) becomes a dominant theme and the whole incarnation(with definite points of intensive crisis) is given to the understanding of theproblem and its solution. In the orientation of your life towards the soul, thekeynote of renunciation is wisely clear but you need to see to it that evenrenunciation is not over-emphasised and that its conditioning power is notapplied to that for which there is no call, because such renunciation wouldconstitute an error.I am giving you, therefore, a personal meditation. I too must have this in mind,reminding you that renunciation itself can be a glamour and a sixth ray idealistis prone to over-express. I shall not give you what you would call a realmeditation. That which will aid you the most at this time is a visualisationexercise on Light.1. Sit quietly and relax. Deal not with problems but during the period of thisexercise endeavour simply to be a point of focussed vision, with the eye of themind directed towards the soul.2. When your focus seems adequate then see (by the power of the creativeimagination) a distant peak or pyramid and on its summit there shines a clearpure light of great intensity.3. With that light you seek to identify yourself, to merge within and thus toavail yourself of its illumination in order that in it the lesser light mayshine. You say, after some minutes of careful identification: [547]“Dim light am I and yet the pure light shines. Not distant is that light butdaily, hourly drawing nearer.The light that is my little self must disappear within the greater Light.So with that Light, that all-pervading, all-consuming Light, I blend and merge.I can no longer see the two—the greater Self, the little self, the pilgrim andthe way, for only one is seen—the greater lighted Whole.”4. Picture the fusion of the light of the personality and the light of the Souland see that light focussed in the personality upon the astral plane.5. Then produce stabilisation of the light appropriated by the sounding of theOM.Seek not to use the light directly for the clarification of problems, teachingor ideas. That will take place automatically once the light is focussed; it mustinevitably bring release and knowledge. Seek simply to visualise the process,knowing that “as a man thinketh so is he.” Then forget about the acquiring ofthe light and endeavour to manifest that which exists as the result of your owneffort. Light is within you. Seek not for immediate instantaneous solution ofyour problems. Look not, my brother, for results. Remember ever that as youcontinue faithfully with the indicated exercise, the results are sure or I wouldnot waste your time or mine in giving you this work to do. Regularly and withoutanxiety do as you are told. The results will in due time manifest.~August 19421. As the hours of service pass around the clock of time look for the soundingof the hour . What hour is that?2. As the minutes tick away the passing hour, watch for the minute when My voiceis heard. When will that be?3. As the seconds note the passing of the minute hand upon the clock of time,expect the second when My face appears. Why has it not appeared? [548]4. When you think freedom lies within your grasp and when you think that youhave done the utmost that you can, Beware! Obedience lies ahead, with freedom inits hand.5. Within the Ashram you must work. Cycles of speech transmute themselves intoperiods of silence. Yet both must play their part.6. You are passing on the Lighted Way, my brother. You have placed your hand inmine. I hold it firm.~MY BROTHER: September 1943You may have noted that there is a slight difference in the type of instructionswhich I am now giving to this group of disciples in my Ashram, of whom you areone. It is not that each of them is not definitely personal in their applicationor that they do not carry a meaning of very real import to the disciple for whomthey are intended; this they do and should. It is now, however, my intention toconvey certain principles and certain aspects of truth which have more of agroup implication than a personal one. The previous two cycles of teaching towhich you have all submitted yourselves were primarily concerned with thetraining of the threefold personality and with an effort to bring it into acloser relation with the soul, and therefore with the Ashram. This waspeculiarly so in the work of the Groups of Nine, and in the first cycle of theNew Seed Group work this was continued, though in a lessened degree and with aspecific emphasis laid upon the required training for initiation. It was not somuch the training of the personality which was under consideration. All this isa part of a definite plan, and the teaching which I intend now to give will havea clear group import, even though adapted to the disciple’s personality and tothe particular individual to whom the instruction is given. In spite of theindividual usefulness, it will profit each member of the group also to read andstudy and apply the teaching from the group angle .There are, of course, three basic principles governing all work in an Ashram. Irefer not here to occult principles of [549] life, but to governing principlesin training. These three are: Occult Obedience. Group Integration. Right ofAccess. Let us consider each of them for a minute with a view to groupinstruction, but with an individual application which will be purely your own.Occult Obedience. In the six statements given to you in the precedinginstruction I used the words, “Obedience lies ahead with freedom in its hand.”Upon these words I presume that you have pondered. The disciple so often givesobedience within limits. His personal sense of liberty (due largely to a rapidlydeveloping mental grasp of life and living) prompts him to concede certain formsof obedience to the Master Who has him in training, but to refrain from acomplete surrender through fear of losing his sense of free action, free thoughtand free choice of relationships. The older the disciple, the less is this thecase, for the life of the Ashram and an increasing steady contact with theMaster demonstrate to him the complete and utter freedom which governs theentire circle of ashramic life—both within the Ashram and within the field ofits interior and exterior service. But the development of this discreetappreciation takes time, and the neophyte is always on guard against anyintrusion into his organised field of determined self-government. Let meillustrate in a manner which I believe will convey to you a much neededsuggestion.The beginner and newcomer in the Ashram, new in his service (from the angle ofhis present life experience if not from the angle of the soul), new in hisregistering of a sense of power which relation to the Ashram always conveys, andnew in his joyous reaction to the recognition given him by those to whom heseeks to give help, speaks increasingly of “my work, my group, my teaching, mypeople, my plans,” and in so doing stabilises himself in his chosen field ofservice. This is a temporary phase, oft unrecognised by the disciple, thoughannoying to those who hear. As he proceeds in the spiritual life and intensifieshis understanding of the Master, as he enters more deeply into the life of theAshram and into the aura of his Master, and as his vision grows—revealingpossibilities of service and the limitations of his equipment, plus a [550]divine indifference—he drops the possessiveness of his approach to service andregards all that he does as his response to the life of the Ashram, as hiscontribution to the work of the Ashram, and thus eventually comes to the pointwhere he himself fades out of his own picture and from the centre of his work,and only the need to be met and the power of the Ashram to meet that needremain.This marks a definite step forward, and it is this attitude of selflessness andthis capacity to be a channel for the power, the love, the knowledge and thelife of the Ashram which constitute in the last analysis what is meant by occultobedience.You, my brother, are now at a point where you need to fade more definitely outof your own picture of yourself as a worker. The first indication of thisdeepened approach to service will appear in your speech when in company of yourgroup brothers and of other workers in the field of general human service. Istated in the last instruction to you that “cycles of speech transmutethemselves into periods of silence.” What does this mean? Something very simple,my beloved chela. Your service in the world and in your chosen and useful fieldcould at present be characterised by the term “cycles of speech,” could it not?Yet within the Ashram, if those cycles of speech are to be eloquent of truth,the quality which will distinguish you will be the balancing “periods ofsilence”; in order to acquire this quality of silence (ashramic silence) youwill have to learn to practice silence within the ranks of your brothers andco-workers.Speaking symbolically, and without enlarging upon the significances, it might bestated that an Ashram has three circles (I refer not here to grades or ranks):a. The circle of those who talk and who stand close to the outer door. Theirvoices may not penetrate too far and thus disturb the Ashram.b. The circle of those who know the law of silence, but find it hard. They standwithin the central part and utter not a word. They know not yet the silence ofthe Ashram. [551]c. The circle of those who live within the secret quiet place. They use notwords and yet their sound goes forth and when they speak—and speak they do—menlisten.This triple presentation of the balancing potencies of speech and of silence arethe comprehended effects of occult obedience—in itself a voluntary response tothe power of the life of the Ashram, and to the mind and the love of the Masterof the Ashram. It is upon these potencies I would have you reflect during thecoming interlude between this instruction and the next. Make the results of yourreflection practical, and thus learn to know when to speak and when to besilent, remembering that the elimination of possessiveness and of self-referencewill reduce speech to its spiritual essentials.Your next incarnation holds for you a peculiar form of service, for which thislife has been preparatory. It is related to speech, to words, to the voice, andto the creative power of sound; for the remainder of this life, the theme ofmuch of your thinking should be concerned with the occult meaning of silence, ofvoiceless interludes and of the “spiritual retention of sound.” This may, andprobably will, manifest itself in an increase of voiced teaching of those youseek to help, but its quality will be different.The teaching of the ones you seek to help will blot out the picture of yourself,the teacher, and obliterate it from your mind. This will happen automaticallyand not by planned intent. Some years ago I could not have told you this; youwould not have accepted it. Today you will and will profit thereby. Some yearsago you would have wasted time and strength in inner worry, in self-condemnationor in refutation. Today you know better the meaning of occult obedience and theacceptance of the statement and expressed wish of your Master—and this becauseyou know me better and trust me more.Let me give you a visualisation exercise to be followed by you each Sundaymorning, every Friday morning, and for the five days which come at the time ofthe Full Moon each month. In company of your group brothers, you have for [552]years visualised me standing by an open window, and you have thus sought contactwith me. This trained facility forms the basis of the following suggestedexercise, the procedure of which is as follows:1. Picture to yourself a wood of pine trees, a purling brook, a winding,mounting path, and at the end a low built bungalow of undressed wood, in which Ilive. With you are walking your group brothers, and all of you are talking onthe way.2. You stand before the door, the outer door, and pass inside and hear a voicewhich says, “You stand within the circle of those who talk and, talking, cannothear the Master’s voice.” Stand there. Listen. Reflect and cease from speech.3. Picture a curtain, hanging across the space near to the place where youstand. Imagine yourself achieving, with effort, that complete silence which willenable you to hear a voice which says, “Move forward into the circle of thosewho know the Law of Silence. You now can hear my voice.” Then imagine yourselfobeying the summons and passing beyond the partitioning curtain into the centralroom within my place of retreat. There sit in quietude and contemplativereflection, and listen.4. Then across the silence and breaking into the current of your quiet thoughtwill come a voice, inviting you to enter the circle of those who live within thesecret quiet place.You will note, my brother, how I emphasise for you the need to listen. That mustbe the keynote of your inner life for the remainder of this incarnation. Whenyou can thus listen, the two other principles to which I earlier referred asgoverning the life of the Ashram—Group Integration and Right of Access —willtake on new and vital meanings to you. Within the circle of those who talk thereis no group integration. Right of access comes to those who know the Law ofSilence.[553] This exercise will deepen your life, increase your capacity to serve, makepregnant every word you speak to those you teach, and bring you to a point ofgroup usefulness next life. Then you will carry out certain work that you and Itogether have already planned.~MY BROTHER: November 1944If you will reread the instructions which I gave you last year, I think you willrealise that there is little that I need add to them. I gave you an instructionwhich through its directive injunction covered the remainder of your lifeevents—as I foresaw them.You have lived for years at the high point of tension. Fire has been the qualityof your life. This fire was at first destructive, but in later years it has beenwarming and nurturing. I think you know that sound and fire are closely allied.I think you know also that disciples are gathered by the Masters into TheirAshrams when their sound has gone forth and when the fire that is in them hassuccessfully burned away the intervening barriers between the soul and thepersonality. Then their sound can safely be added to the sound of the Ashram,enriching its volume, adding quality to its tone, and conveying the neededcreative qualities.The next few years will not be easy ones for you, my brother. Be notover-anxious over anything that may eventuate. Speaking symbolically, I mightexpress your future thus: The nature of fire will be brought more clearly andessentially to your attention; fire will be the subject of your thinking. Do notinfer from this that I am indicating to you the way of fire, of pain or ofsorrow. Such is not my intention. I do not mean that the future holds for youany passing through the fires of purification. You have moved across theburning-ground—as have all your group brothers. The whole of mankind is passingen masse through the fires which precede the first initiation. Every disciplecreates his own burning-ground; he then takes his stand within it, andeventually [554] passes out of it to stand before the Angel of the Presence, atthe very door of initiation. These are to you the platitudes of the Path andrequire from me no explanation.There is one fire, however, with which you should now concern yourself. I wouldcall it “the fire of comprehension.” It is closely related to the blinding lightof realisation, but ever precedes it because it destroys all the glamours whichmay hide or veil the immediate point of illumination for the disciple. You haveapproached this fire from the standpoint of the emotional nature and it has beenassociated in your mind with the waters of the astral plane, thus producing thesymbols of mist and fog which are ever caused by the bringing together of fireand water. This concept has conditioned your thinking. I would have you nowconsider glamour in the light of the fires of comprehension. There comes a timein the disciple’s life when he must assume that he knows; he must take theposition that he comprehends, and must proceed to act upon the comprehendedknowledge. That is definitely the point that you have now reached.The results of this definite assumption, and of the activities which itinitiates, are oft surprising and apt to be painful; that is why the symbol offire is again appropriate at this point.Act in the future “as if” there are for you no more glamours, and see, mybrother, what will eventuate. Endeavour always to live within the Ashram, whichis insulated from glamour, and act “as if” the consciousness of the Ashram wasintrinsically your consciousness. Go forth to the service which you arerendering “as if” you remained immovable in the Ashram; live always “as if” theeyes of the entire Ashram were upon you. For the remainder of your life let theesoteric philosophical concept “as if” actuate all you do. It is this constantawareness which the two words “as if” embody that will produce in you a freshuse of the creative imagination.Some time ago I told the group that initiation was simplification . Therefore,simplify your remaining years by ever acting “as if.” Through this livingprocess you will let loose the fires of comprehension. I wonder if I am makingsome idea of value clear to you? Govern yourself always “as if” [555] yourdivine comprehension was perfected and the result in your daily life will be “asif” all concealed glamours and all hiding deceptive veils were non-existent. Thedisciple acts “as if” he were initiate and then discovers that “as a manthinketh in his heart so is he,” because the heart is the custodian of the powerof the imagination. The imagination is released into creative activity when thedisciple acts “as if” he were the soul in full expression, “as if” the Masterwere ever aware of the doings of His disciple, “as if” he walked in fullliberation consciously. For you, these two words will bring release andhappiness.The trends of your life and service are established. Seek not to change them.The fund of knowledge which you have accumulated in this life is very real.Draw, however, what you need for your teaching work from the ancient reservoirof wisdom, and not so much from the pool of knowledge. Deepen your meditationand intensify the inner silence within which it is desirable that you shouldlive. Think humbly, speak wisely and work ceaselessly. The opportunity today isgreat for all disciples everywhere, and the potencies at their disposal are morevital than ever before. Link up with me each day and count on my sustaininglove.~MY FRIEND OF MANY YEARS: August 1946I know how greatly distressed you will be at the termination of our outer (notthe inner) fellowship; forget not that the outer fellowship was only the sign ofa strong, vital and unshatterable inner fellowship. The inner relation of thegroup to me and to the Ashram and towards each other is as strong as it has everbeen; it is in no wise altered. Because of the very real progress you have madein freeing yourself from glamour, that fellowship can now become even moreintimate. I can reach you more easily than in the past. I am telling you thisbecause I know it will reassure you and because I know you will not takeadvantage of it. The further a disciple penetrates into the Ashram, the lessneed he finds for contact with the Master; he comes to realise the extent of[556] the Master’s responsibilities and arrives at a juster value of his ownrelative unimportance. He then submits himself to “the sustaining aura of theAshram.”In my last two communications to you I left you with the impression that I hadalready given you as much teaching as would serve to carry you through thislife. I urged on you a steadfast adherence to established spiritual habits.Enough emphasis is seldom put on the necessity for such a stabilisation ofspiritual rhythm, and too much emphasis is frequently laid upon that which isnew and on progress. Yet disciples have to learn to turn their spiritual habitsinto instinctual spiritual responsiveness; this is the higher correspondence tothe instinctual animal reactions with which we are all familiar. When this hasbeen achieved, the disciple can then depend upon himself automatically to do orsay the right thing; more important still, the Master can count upon him,knowing that he can be depended upon. He is then “permitted to move throughoutthe Ashram without impediment, and all the Plan is safe with him.” This is whatI want you to aim at in your remaining years, so that you will (in your nextlife) from childhood, express the way of the disciple.In my last instruction to you I gave you the injunction to act as if the idealwhich you have set before yourself was an accomplished fact. This as ifbehaviour is one of the most occult of practices. It in reality presupposes theimposition of the highest grasped aspiration upon the normal personality in theform of changed behaviour. This injunction is not the same in meaning as theinjunction “as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.” That injunction, ifrightly followed, brings about the imposition of mental control upon thepersonality; it affects the brain, and therefore the two lower vehicles. The asif type of behaviour (for the disciple) brings in a still higher factor thanthat of thought; it involves the constant attempt to live as if the soul (notthe mind but through the mind) is in constant control and the dominating aspectof expression.This may involve close thinking about the soul and its relation to thepersonality, but it is a great deal more than [557] just that. It necessitates,when correctly applied, the growing automatic control of the entire lowerthreefold man by the soul. I am going to give you six themes for meditationbuilt around the as if idea. These will cover one year’s work. I would like tosee you take these themes and give them full consideration for three years. Atthe end of that time you will probably wish to go over all the work again, on ahigher level and with a deeper intent.1. Sound the OM inaudibly three times, as a physical person, as an emotionalperson, and as a mind.Then sound the OM as the soul.2. Themes for meditative reflection:a. What, in your life, would happen if you really acted as if the soul weresounding the OM?b. If you are truly thinking as if the mind were the instrument of the soul,what lines of thought will you have to eliminate, cultivate or express?c. If you are realistically living as if the soul were visible in your dailylife, what will happen to the astral body?d. Provided the as if theory were controlling your physical brain andconsequently your daily activities, in what way would it alter your mode ofliving? (This is not the same as question a.)e. Do you understand clearly the difference between the “as a man thinketh...,”and the as if modes of procedure? How do they differ in application?f. What qualities would your particular mechanism or personality demonstrate ifyou acted as if you were anchored in the Ashram and not just on the periphery?Do not be vague in this reply, but be extremely personal in your analysis of thesituation.3. Then, as if you were consciously standing before your Master and definitelyaware of my presence, dedicate yourself to the service of the Ashram for thislife and the next.4. Say the new Invocation, sounding the OM after each stanza. [558]5. Sound the OM at as high a point in consciousness as possible.Then, my brother, go your way in peace, knowing the ferment of living energieswithin you will enable you to act as if you were the soul. This will be agrowing, conscious experience. Know too that I, your Master and your friend,will also be aware of it. My love surrounds you and the link remains unbroken.~TO R. V. B.September 1943It is, my brother, a source of satisfaction to me to have you functioning againas a recognised member of my group of chelas. You and I knew always that thelink was indissoluble and that the interlude of interior work and the periodwherein you worked out karma (engendered many years ago) was both needed andfruitful. It is of great value to the soul when the personality consciouslyrecognises the activity of karma and adheres to the complete working out of theeffects of earlier relationships so that to that relation the word “finis” canbe written. Disciples should remember that when a karmic relation has beenrecognised upon the physical plane and the needed action has been taken, twopossibilities are presented, according to whether the karma entailed wastemporary or the relation enduring. One possibility is that spiritualidentification takes place and the relation can then never be broken, or thetransaction ends in an entirely correct manner by the cessation for all time ofthe relationship. These periods of decision and adjustment are most difficult,but curiously enough, when the disciple interiorly holds the right attitude(even if bewildered) the decision is seldom his. Life, circumstance, events orpeople take care of the situation and—holding on to his soul—the disciple standssteady until the problem or relationship disappears.You stand now within my Ashram with clearer knowledge [559] and a more assuredfaith. Fuller service opens up before you—service which you can render in theplace where you are and in spite of a physical vehicle which at times gives youmuch trouble and difficulty. Let not the physical limitation unduly control you,but pass courageously along the Lighted Way in spite of, as well as because of,the problems and difficulties. Forgive my twisting the old phraseology in thismanner.The link between you and A.A.B. grows closer each year and this you haveyourself inwardly recognised. There is much that you can do to help her, for herconfidence in you is great and she needs the kind of help which you can give.Her work grows heavier, her health is seriously impaired, and the needs of theworld press heavier upon her than any of you—no matter how close—can ever guess.She values your cooperation and you can do much to interpret the work thatemanates from my Ashram and thus aid seeking souls. To this work I call youafresh.The meditation which I am going to ask you to do is in the nature of an act ofservice. It has little reference to yourself, but much to something that isclose, very close, to my heart. I would ask you to take the new book,Discipleship in the New Age, and each day meditate upon its significance, itsusefulness and its teaching value in this coming post-war period. Read itcarefully, e’en when you know much of what is said; build a thoughtform of thebook and see it going forth to the very ends of the Earth. This book, if rightlydistributed, can act as a great magnet, drawing people from all over the planetinto the Ashrams of the Masters, and thereby increasing the potency of theworkers for humanity as well as increasing them numerically. This book should goforth upon the wings of meditation, and you can be a potent focal point upon theinner planes of such a meditation process, if you so desire. Will you join withme, my brother, in this launching of this book upon its career of service? Iknow that you will render this service to those who seek for the Light, and tome, for I am one of the distributors of the Light.Increasingly must your life be filled with this kind of [560] service; it willlead to the establishing of lines of relationship; these, in later lives, willbe less tenuous and will demonstrate to you as the nucleus of that group whichevery disciple begins to gather around him, preparatory to forming his ownAshram in a still later life. Thus the whole question of radiation and magnetismlies at the foundation of the hierarchical method of work. A disciple becomesspiritually magnetic; his radiation begins to make itself felt; this mustinevitably be the case when head and heart are consciously related. Graduallythat magnetism and that radiation make their presence felt in the disciple’senvironment and evoke response from others. Not only so, but themagnetic-radiatory vibration attracts the attention of the Master, and thedisciple finds his way into the Ashram along the line or the beam of his ownradiatory activity, which has been akin to that of the Ashram. There, theintensified training he receives makes him still more spiritually efficient and“esoterically attractive” in the world of men. He continues with his task ofgathering to him those whom he can help and who recognise him as their chosenhelper and guide. Thus is an Ashram formed—each on its ray vibration, and eachtaking much time and lives of choice and of radiation. Today sees manydisciples—such as you—being trained to handle this phase of the hierarchicalwork among men. This might be stated to be the underlying motive andhierarchical purpose for the Arcane School. Each disciple in my Ashram should beaware of the intent that this life and the next should see him beginning togather to himself his own. This new book is intended to aid in this process, andit is upon this aspect that I would ask your aid in meditation.Let me now give you six statements which can form, if you so desire, six seedthoughts upon this particular theme during the coming year.1. The Ashram pulsates with life. Its radiation penetrates the outer gloom anddark; waiting aspirants, one by one, and all alone, appear within the beam oflight.2. Along that beam the chela travels towards the central [561] point of light,the Master in His Ashram. The Master waits. He moves not forth but quietlyradiates.3. The chela enters through the door into the Ashram and stands before theMaster of his life. He knows himself to be a soul. He knows that now his mindand all the lower natural forces must radiate the light he has attained.4. As one by one the chelas find their way into the Ashram and to the centralLight, the light therein intensifies. The radiation of the Ashram waxes to agreat intensity. The tiny beam of light focussed within the chela’s heart,directed by his eye, penetrates in turn the outer gloom and is seen by those whowait.5. Within the Ashram I have taken my place. My little light is merged andblended with the greater light, for thus I best can serve. I face the Master andknow His light and mine to be the same. I turn and send my light into the dark,to guide some wanderer home.6. Grant me the light that I may shine. Let me throughout the world of time andspace radiate light, create a light, transmit the light, and treading thus theLighted Way (which is my Lighted Self), enter the light and so return the lightto those who need, to Those likewise from whence it came.Thus, my brother and my friend, travel life’s way; work in my Ashram; aid yourfellowmen, and know the joy of constant service and sacrifice.~MY BROTHER AND FELLOW-WORKER: November 1944Your spiritual life has deepened during this past year and your light within theAshram shines brighter. I think that it is only fair to tell you this for yourencouragement. The loneliness of your life warrants at times my endorsing anyspiritual confidence of which you may be possessed. Disciples need to learnsometimes that their spiritual status is not always [562] evocative of a life ofviolent outward activity. For such as you, with the handicap of a frail body andthe limitations of karma, the place of triumph has to be exactly where you standand within the circumference of a somewhat limited physical sphere. There—withno outer stimulation—the disciple himself, alone, becomes a focal point ofpower. His influence can then reach out to points unexpected and oft unknown tohim. Frequently, prior to a definite step forward of a pronounced kind which isnot due simply to a normal progress of a persistent aspirant, the soul of thedisciple forces him into a quiet place where he has both the inclination and thetime to deepen, to integrate more consciously into the Ashram, and to focus withdefinite intention upon work in mental matter, under clear, inner impression.Such is now your opportunity.But, my brother, to make this duly effective and to get true and real benefitout of the opportunity, the disciple must accustom himself to a completenegation of concentration upon the physical vehicle and upon his physicalsurroundings. Note, I did not say neglect of concentration. It is his path anddestiny in life to enter upon what has been called “the higher way”; he has tolearn on those levels and to live constructively there, without reducing theeffectiveness of normal, practical living upon the physical plane.You might ask: To what specific end? You know that such a mode of daily lifeshould not and must not last for several lives, because the goal thus expressedbecomes increasingly active in its outer service and form. You will rememberhowever, my brother, that there are times when the Master, speaking technically,goes into a state of consciousness which we call samadhi. This means that for astated and qualified time, He quits His created threefold lower vehicle and“travels in consciousness” to those levels whereon the spirit aspect can communewith Him, wherein the force of the Spiritual Triad can re-stimulate andrevitalise Him. On these levels, His vision is renewed and He draws from theforce of Shamballa—according to His degree—the inspiration (again speakingtechnically) for a new cycle of service. This requires on His part absence or astate of withdrawal, [563] for the space of several hours as we count them onEarth, from His body of manifestation. In the case of a disciple in training,true samadhi is not possible. The cycles of enforced quiet and of consciouswithdrawal from the pressure of daily life out in the world of business and ofmen have to be of great length, though—as progress is made—these periods getshorter and shorter. On the lower turn of the spiral, the Ashram is to thedisciple what the courts of Shamballa are to the Master. That is why, mybrother, I gave you that special meditation last year upon the theme of theAshram. I trust you have followed it with care.The objective of this life of interlude and of a somewhat drastic, hamperingexperience, plus repeated frustration, is to fit you in a later life (next life,if you profit by the presented opportunity) for transfer into the Ashram of theMaster K.H. As you know, one of the tasks I undertook in this time of worldcrisis was to relieve several of the Masters from the task of instructing andwatching over Their junior disciples. The senior disciples and those that arecalled world disciples have retained their position in the older and more potentAshrams. One of these senior disciples, A.A.B., as you well know, has aided mein this task. I also undertook to prepare certain disciples who had never beenin the Ashram of either the Master K.H. or the Master M. so that they couldtransfer out of my Ashram into Theirs; among these you will find yourself. Inyour case you have here the chief reason for your present circumstances.Another reason has been that you also brought about a great transfer of energyfrom the sacral centre to the throat centre, and here you have one of the causesof your present physical condition, but only one of them, my brother. A transferand centralisation of the lower fires into a higher centre is oft the cause oftrouble in the physical body; you can be thankful that it has worked out thisway with you, for a centralisation in one of the subtler bodies is far moredifficult to handle.Thus you have presented to you a clear statement as to the goal ahead of you,and also the corroboration of many thoughts which have passed through your mind.You can [564] now cease from all questioning as to the future, can you not? Andin exactly the same place where you now are, you can use in a new and a freshway the creative power of the mind and begin to use your pen in a more potentand dynamic fashion.The above statement gives you, also, the incentive which you need for theremainder of your life; further detailed instruction from me will not benecessary—unless you make such important progress that I shall have to watchmore closely over you. That also lies in your own hands. I would have youremember that I am not urging upon you a too intensive pushing forward, for Ihave due regard for your physical condition.One thing, however, you will have to watch with care. As you know, and as Ipointed out to you some years ago, you have an undue number of rays along oneparticular line; your equipment of energies is therefore somewhat unbalanced,and this will require the process of obtaining equilibrium before you can moveon to the more potent Ashram of K.H. The potency of an Ashram is necessarilydependent upon the status, the degree and the experience of the Master at itscentre or heart. The more advanced the Master, the more of the energy ofShamballa which will pour into the Ashram. The Master K.H., being a Chohan andone of the senior Masters (ranking next to the Christ Himself), can “walk intothe courts of Shamballa” at will. Masters of my degree can only make contactwith Shamballa at certain stated periods, and one of the goals of our trainingis to move steadily forward into a closer relationship with the Christ, andthrough Him with the Lord of the World. The Ashrams for which Masters of mydegree are responsible are not, therefore, so potent.It will be necessary for you to bring into your outer experience more force, andthat of the first ray; it is necessary, also, that you should develop thoseconditions which will enable you to assume and work through a first raypersonality when you next come into incarnation. To do this I would suggest thatyou study the instructions of I.S.G-L., given by me to him last year. There Igave him six statements anent [565] this mysterious and holy centre which wecall Shamballa. For this year’s meditation, I would ask you to take the thirdstatement and ponder it deeply, relating it to the sixth statement andendeavouring to arrive at an understanding of both of them. This you can dothrough the key which you will find in the first sentence of the meditationwhich I gave you in that same series. In these three statements and in theirtrue comprehension you have the mode whereby you can put yourself en rapportwith the Shamballa force. No disciple can do this without establishing a tenuousthread along which he can some day travel towards those sublime levels where theplanetary Logos and His Council function. The first step is to respond to firstray energy; later you will come to use it consciously and constructively—notemploying its destructive aspect—and thus learn to use first ray energy as achannel of approach; that, however, constitutes a much later stage.The above three points for reflection will suffice for your meditation work forthe coming year, and you should profit greatly by it. Every Sunday, however, Iwould have you take the meditation which I gave you last year and give thirtyminutes to it, thus each week establishing a closer link with my Ashram and withme. My Ashram might be called the doorway to the Ashram of the Master K.H., andsome day you will pass through to the higher and more potent centre.~MY BROTHER: August 1946You have profited much from the attention you paid to the last instruction Igave you; you have also done a good and creative task, aiding A.A.B. Even thoughit did not involve your own rays, I suggested your working temporarily alongfirst ray lines because it would strengthen you greatly and bring the Willaspect more definitely into expression. You will have realised that it has beennecessary for you to develop more will and fiery determination and powerfulunderstanding, prior to transfer into the Ashram of K.H. This transfer willeventually take place, but you are not yet ready [566] to stand the strongShamballa pressure which is ever to be experienced in the Ashram of a Chohan.Mine, as you know, is an Ashram subsidiary to His.Why, therefore, did I direct you towards the will aspect when both Ashrams areon the second ray and you are predominantly a second ray disciple? Because thesubsidiary Ashrams deal with the ray qualities in action and in service, whilstthe major or senior Ashrams concern in all cases the will in action through theray qualities. This is possible because the major Ashrams are presided over bythose who have achieved the sixth initiation; Ashrams such as mine are under theguidance of a Master or Initiate of the fifth degree.You have needed much to study the nature of the will. A disciple’s ideas on thissubject are apt to be far removed from the reality; the understanding of thewill is a progressive matter and disciples on all rays have to arrive atcomprehension of Will activity as they move forward.Perhaps some idea of what I am trying to convey anent the work done in theAshram of a Master or that done in the Ashram of a Chohan would come to you ifyou meditated upon the two words: Goodwill and the Will-to-Good. The first isworked out as qualifying the life in all Ashrams under the care of a Master ofthe Wisdom; the Will-to-Good is developed and understood in the Ashrams of Thoseof still greater attainment. The first concerns the Plan whilst the second dealswith Purpose. Again, in this same connection, you have: Vision and Illumination.I have here given all of you a vital hint as to the distinction between the workof the two types of Ashrams.You can also, if you so choose, work out the same idea in the linking of thethree periodical vehicles, finding a third word, allied and descriptive, to forma sequential educational picture:1. Sight Vision Illumination. 2. Action Plan Purpose. 3. Self-will GoodwillWill-to-Good.[567] You would find the creation of similar combinations of spirituallyexplanatory words a valuable exercise.I infer not here, my brother, that your will is weak. It is constantly orientedtowards that which is good and towards the Hierarchy. But the use of thespiritual will as it can affect and direct the affairs of the personality isanother thing altogether; it is here that you must seek to learn the directaction of the will of the soul as you face the opportunities and crises of life.I would therefore suggest to you the following type of meditation. You knowenough of the meditation process to work it out through the years into your ownreflective pattern of living, as it gradually takes effect and you see deeperinto the subject of the will.1. Sound the OM consciously as:a. The physical body, using the brain as the centre of dedication,b. The astral body, “lifting up the heart unto the Lord” thereby, in reality,ignoring the existence of the astral body, c. As the mind, orienting it with directness towards the soul.2. Then sound the OM three times as the soul, flooding the triple instrumentwith light and love.3. Then give some time to the expression of goodwill by the personality.4. Centre the consciousness anew in the soul, orienting your soul-infusedpersonality towards the Spiritual Triad. This will require the use of theimagination, until such time as it is factual.5. Then take the following themes sequentially into meditative reflection,taking one each month and— when completed—resuming the sequence.a. From the centre where the Will of God is known.b. Let purpose rule the little wills of men.c. The purpose which the Masters know.d. The purpose which the Masters serve.e. Let Light restore the Plan on Earth. [568]f. Let Love restore the Plan.g. Let Power restore the Plan on Earth.h. Let His Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.i. To the accomplishment of His Will, I dedicate myself from now until eternity.6. Sound the OM three times inaudibly.Call on me when you will , but only at need. The words “when you will” have anoccult significance. It is the use of the will which is needed when theattention of the Master is needed, in the case of a chela at your point ofashramic contact. Your link with me remains unbroken.~MY FRIEND AND BROTHER: November 1948There is relatively little that I have to say to you in this year’s “touch ofrecognition” which I am giving to all who are actively affiliated with myAshram. The circumstances of your life are such that you are eminently capableof handling its issues and dealing with its crises yourself; that ordains foryou, therefore, a somewhat unusual state of affairs in the life of discipleship.You have been vouchsafed an interlude wherein you can perfect your work forindividual souls; you have been provided full preparation. I would have youponder deeply upon these conceptions.You have not in this life functioned in any way as a member of your race, onceyou had reached due years of understanding; you have been held possessively byno binding family ties, though you have always been in touch with yourrelatives; you have had no difficulty in assimilating the Ageless Wisdom and youhave served the Hierarchy consciously for many decades; you are giving real helpto A.A.B. and she is, I know, going to ask for a deepening of the nature of thathelp though not necessarily for an increase in its quantity. . . . You have hadthe handicap of poor health which is not, in your case, a real handicap but apronounced and definitely [569] planned role whereby the disciple learns certainlessons of detachment and above all registers—as he learns—the relativeunimportance of form. These things have happened to you and these lessons havebeen presented to you for assimilation; you are now faced with a greatlydeepened esoteric service which you still perform in the place where you are.So you see, my brother, your life is rich and full and free and promises to beeven more so. Your need is to acquiesce in the limitations of the physical body,which need not necessarily increase until old age is upon you, and at the sametime to refuse recognition of that body so that it in no way impinges upon yourconsciousness in such a manner that it curtails or hinders your pledged service.You have progressed beyond the stages of set meditations and definite forms;your requirement at this time is to start each day of your life with a steadilydeepening period of spiritual recognition. In that period, you do four things:1. You render recognition to your own soula. As one with the souls of men.b. As steadily fulfilling its life purpose.2. You render recognition to the Ashram with which you are connected and to thegroup of co-workers with whom you are determined to cooperate.3. You render recognition to me, your Master, D.K., by a flash of thought and oflove.4. You recognise your personality as a divine server.If you follow this apparently very simple procedure in the morning and at nightprior to sleeping, you will discover for yourself a renewed dedication and avery deep insight into another layer (if I may so call it) of esoteric truth andof the divine consciousness.We are forever linked as workers in the one Hierarchy and under the leadershipof the Christ and His Successor in a distant century. Count heavily on this, mybrother, and go forward with my love and blessing. [570]~TO S. C. P.MY BROTHER: August 1940It is often difficult to know just how to approach you on account of yourexceeding sensitivity both to lack of love or understanding and also tocriticism. Your first reaction is one of intense pain of being misunderstood—asyou think—by me. This is caused by your complete identification of yourself onmental planes with your spiritual objective—an identification which is true,sincere and lasting. You are apt to think that you now are what you want to be.This is a thing impossible if the law of achieved progress is of any importance.Your resentment of criticism (which is sharp and glamour-producing) is not basedon pride in fancied achievement but is more a fierce resentment over failure.You add your own criticism of yourself to my proffered suggestions and thiscreates a glamour. Forget not that contact with disciples older and moreexperienced than yourself will ever produce a stimulation. That stimulation willapply to any innate glamour as well as to your spiritual life.Your second reaction is a silent acceptance of the criticism or suggestion, anda silent effort (once the emotional crisis is over) to change what isundesirable and to make the desired progress.Can you, my brother, think of a single instance which did not (in the earlystages after reading my instructions) produce a turmoil in your consciousness? Icannot, nor can I remember any time when you did not see the matter more clearlyand profit by my words.I make this preamble in the hope that this time you will waste no time in anyfutile reaction or self-defence and for the good of your group brothers, thatyou will see directly that which I—in love—seek to make clear to you.Nothing matters these days (when the bulk of humanity is in such dire distress)except to aid in its liberation at any personal sacrifice. The temptation ofmany people these times is oft to evade the issue and find in the daily task and[571] karmic responsibilities as well as in a type of satisfaction with theiremotional reactions a way of escape from direct and practical action on behalfof humanity. They employ a forced preoccupation with their own concerns—in ordernot to think, not to realise and subconsciously to evade doing anything whichadds to their present load. When I speak of emotional reactions, I refer to thedistress and sorrow and anxiety engendered by having those for whom one cares inthe besieged or occupied countries. From that you, with thousands of others,naturally suffer and this is quite unavoidable though it can be controlled. Irefer to definitely constructive interest and help upon the physical plane and Iwould ask you:What do you do of a practical nature to add your burden-bearing capacity to thegroup of world workers everywhere who are attempting to absorb the world’ssorrow, who are giving time and thought and effort to bring the war to an end orto alleviate in some practical way what you can of world distress and thephysical plane needs of the unhappy? Maybe you are doing something of apractical nature. I take not the time to search into your daily activities.There is a symbol which flashes out from the heart of all who serve theirfellowmen for which we look at times; when found, it indicates a world server.This symbol should flash with greater frequency into my vision. You serve withfealty those you love. I thank you myself and on behalf of K.H. for what youhave done for A.A.B. and ask you again to continue to stand by her. But I wouldask you again: What do you do of a practical nature to bring your quota ofeffort to the present world need? Because your creative enterprise deals withthe luxuries of life, you need to offset it with an equally potentexpression—again on the physical plane—of your service to your fellowmen. Thatis the first question which I put to you.The second question is to ask you if you feel that you are freer from the tiesof those who are regarded by Us as a basically selfish and self-centredgroup—those who belong to the so-called social set? I told you in my lastinstruction that you were making definite progress in this respect and I believethat you yourself are becoming conscious of your own [572] reactions in thisconnection. Humanity, and not the group of so-called cultured people, shouldtake your time and attention as well as your work along your chosen creativelines—those on which you are now engaged. Are you freer from the fear of whatthey would say and what they might think, or are you still guided by the massedself-interest of that group of men and women whose lives are preoccupied withpossessions, with the social amenities and who regard doing Red Cross work asdemonstrating adequately their usefulness? You, along with others, have refusedto identify yourself and interests with any set except the one in which yourdestiny or your ambition placed you, and this proves an obstruction often totrue spiritual growth. It is a problem and takes years to learn the lesson ofgeneral human interest. It is not easy to be a “fool for Christ’s sake,” and, mybrother, the social set is one of the cruellest in the world. They need defyingfor their own sake and their own awakening.Learn to stand free and unafraid, and as a soul include all with whom you arebrought in contact within the dynamic vibration of your soul-directedpersonality. Seek to tune in on world need mentally and not emotionally; add toyour service in meditation that which can practically help in this appallingworld emergency. The problem of all disciples today is to achieve successfulactivity in their chosen task of competent citizenship and life occupation andyet, at the same time, to add to that at any cost a practical life of service.Such is not the duty or dharma of average man. It is sufficient for him to makegood (as it is called) upon the physical plane, leaving to a later life cyclethe development of a more dynamic and inclusive inner life. All disciples haveboth objectives, one outward and one inward, with also an ordained integratedexpression. In your case, this situation is peculiarly ordained by the soul inorder to bring about a needed bridging between your powerful astral nature andyour definitely illumined intuition. This I pointed out to you some years ago.The world of competitive business and the struggle with the financial situationcalls for all the resources of your lower mind and this strengthens and bringsyour mind into practical [573] effectiveness. The process is therefore one of apronounced technique for the integration of soul and personality. The sameprocess in the case of the average citizen produces an integration of thepersonality—what we might call an integration downwards . In the case of adisciple, such as yourself, it produces an integration upwards, leading to adefinite reorientation of the life forces and the calling into creative activitythe centre at the throat.I will give you a short personal meditation which will aid in this developmentand increase your vision, effective service and usefulness. Do this meditationprior to the group meditation and do it with dynamic brevity.1. A quick rising act of alignment.2. A moment of poised attention.3. Then sound the OM as the soul.4. Arrest the downward flowing soul energy and effect its fusion with theuprising aspiration of the personality on mental levels. Hold the consciousnesssteady at that point.5. Visualise then a golden band of light, extending from the soul—via themind—to the physical brain. Attempt simultaneously to see a thin thread of lightascending upwards from the soul towards the Hierarchy, passing through themembers of the group.6. Then breathe out the OM again and see it going to the throat centre at theback of the neck.7. Focus your consciousness there and at the same time hold it in the head. Thisactivity corresponds to the dual life of the disciple to which I referred above.8. Sound the OM six times as the soul, sending the energya. To the mind, and there focus.b. To the brain or the highest head centre.c. To the throat centre and there focus.d. From that centre, imaginatively breathe out the OM throughout thepersonality.e. Then breathe it out over the group of your brothers. [574]f. From thence to humanity.If you will do this simply as an exercise in the direction and right flow ofenergy, via the throat centre, you will find much instructive value emerging andincreased usefulness and effectiveness in every aspect of your life, in theworld and on spiritual levels as a disciple. You have learnt much, my brother,and I do not regret adding you to my group of accepted disciples.NOTE: This was the final instruction given to the disciple whose personalinstructions are included in Vol. I. The footnote therein on page 341 stillapplies.~TO P. G. C.BROTHER OF OLD: August 1940I wonder whether you have sufficiently realised that for you to bring throughthe love of your soul is the line of least resistance, owing to the fact thatyour personality ray is the seventh ray—the ray of consummation, the ray ofexpressing adequately on the physical plane the form through which thesoul—whose nature is love—can express itself. This is particularly easy also inyour case because the ray of your physical body is also the seventh. The line ofdescent, therefore, for the form building energy is direct. To this again youcan add the fact that your personality vehicles are on the fifth, the sixth andthe seventh rays; these follow each other in sequential order, producing again adirect channel. You should consequently (if you are truly to understand themechanism through which your soul has to function) make a much closer study ofthe seventh ray. It is also the incoming ray for the next immediate cycle. Aknowledge of the ray influences, techniques, mechanics and objectives will beascertained by disciples in whom these rays are pronouncedly manifesting.It is not possible for anyone under the degree of accepted [575] disciple tofind out much. The type must be definitely pronounced and the investigatoradvanced enough to have reached the stage of a detached observer. Thisdetachment you can frequently attain. Temperament and training have developed itin you. The second ray disciple has to learn detachment while at the same timehe remains “attached and inclusive” esoterically, and this must be consciouslyachieved and the attitude preserved. The first ray disciple has to remaindetached and at the same time to learn attachment and to admit entry into hisaura of the entire world in a series of progressive attachments. This makes fordifficulty for it involves that training in paradoxes which is the secret ofoccultism.Your ray combination and the points of focus in your case explain your greatinterest in the centres, in their significance, vitalisation and conscious use.It is the unfoldment of an awakened consciousness which is the goal of alltraining for initiation and of this the training of children to develop anawakened conscience is a symbol. This awakening is brought about by:1. Integration the coordination of the mechanism. 2. Synthesis the fusion ofpersonality and soul. 3. Appropriation the inflow of energy from the soul intothe centres. 4. Awakening the response of the centres to this inflowYou will note the sequence, therefore, of this staged development in the way ofwhite magic. Usually among the ignorant, the centres are first studiedobjectively, psychic exercises are undertaken in order really to produce feelingin the centres and so make the man conscious of their locality and quality.Later an effort is made through meditation to contact the soul. This order iswrong. Man should become aware of the centres as a final stage and this becausehis emphasis and identification is with the soul and not with the form aspect,of which the centres are a part. Be careful in all instruction that you maylater give on these matters to make this point [576] adequately clear. I wouldcall to your attention another point. You may perhaps have noted that I havegiven some of you meditations which are concerned with certain of the centresand their relation. This I will increasingly do. Most of the meditations which Igave to the group members in the earlier stages of the forming of the groups,are in reality ray meditations and can be so adapted and reference to thecentres later inserted; but—at this stage—only A.A.B. knows enough to make theadaptation and necessary insertions. I have instructed her to ask R.S.U.gradually to copy the entire file of meditations and you can then, during thecoming months, cooperate with A.A.B. in their changing and assembling under thecorrect rays.This service and this expansion of the teaching is of importance and shouldconstitute the service of you and R.S.U. in collaboration with A.A.B. Theassembled meditations and the knowledge gained will serve to provide some of thepractical side of the teaching to be given by the Arcane School in the moreadvanced courses to be given in the future. After the war is over—provided thatit terminates as desired by the Great White Lodge—many will provide evidencethat they are ready for this advanced training and for this you, as a group,must be prepared.You may wonder why I am dealing with this matter in my instruction to youpersonally. Simply, my brother, in order that you may aid in the preparation forthe coming development of the race of men and because—owing to your training andthe field of your daily work—you are equipped to provide that measure oftechnical knowledge which will guarantee the sanity and freedom from fancifulextravagances which is so needed in connection with teaching to be given on thecentres and their development. It must always be borne in mind that evidence ofthe centres is to be found in the nervous and glandular systems and these threemust ever be related if modern science is to appreciate and appropriate the newknowledge.For yourself, my brother, I have but a word. Deepen your understanding andremember that owing to the fact that you have two rays upon the first line ofoutgoing energy, [577] aloofness must be carefully avoided by you. It is thefirst step towards isolation. Disciples must ever remember that anyover-emphasis of the energies which govern the personality lays the foundationof the form nature in the next incarnation. In your case, for instance, an undueemphasis of your fifth and seventh lines of force in this life might produce apowerfully dangerous form nature in your next incarnation—one which wouldprobably bring about a personality upon the first ray with a third raymentality, the same sixth ray astral body and a fifth ray physical body. You cansee the danger of this combination where a disciple is concerned and the problemwith which he would be confronted. I have here given a hint as to the mode ofunfoldment in connection with karmic responsibility for the future. Such a hinthas not hitherto been made available to the public. In this paragraph I havegiven you much food for thought.The objective of the personal meditation which I suggest that you should follow,is to bring into increasing activity the two head centres. It is a simpleexercise but should only be done every other day because you are at the stagewherein you could unfold too rapidly, and so bring about needless difficulty....It is a general preliminary exercise in facility and in the manipulation of theenergies within the body.~August 19421. The stabilisation of your life along the line established is the next step.But, my brother, permit not crystallisation.2. The secret of triplicity is yours. Work on it so the mind is clear.3. Love more. Wisdom is yours, yet speed it out to others upon the wings oflove.4. Learn to transmute. Suppression is more easy but transmutation is more safe.Transmute.5. The active double life of the disciple is your next goal. Your duty and yourgoal go hand in hand. You must walk with both at once. Thus can the rainbowbridge be built.6. Go out among the sons of men and heal and lift, but balance keep and breadthof view. All ways are good. [578]~BROTHER OF MINE: September 1943It seems to me that so oft I have to say this year to hard-pressed chelas: Theway has been difficult. But so it is, and your way in life has been noexception. Great waves of karmic impact have beaten upon our Earth—that littleship adrift in time and space and sailing the great ocean of the cosmos. TheLords of Karma have looked towards our planet. Energy follows thought and that,my brother, is all that karma is—the impact of directed energy upon the Earth,upon the kingdoms in nature, upon man and upon the individual disciple. Much ofthis karma, especially now, is not individual in purpose, nor is it generated inany way by the individuals affected by it, be it an individual disciple, or anordinary human being. It is largely incident at this time to the karma of theOne in Whom we live and move and have our being. It is primarily also in thesphere of Shamballa, and has small relation in the first instance to humanity atall. This means but little to you, I realise. This karma working out inShamballa has, however, led to the vitalising of the activities of certain“will-full” men; they have loosed great evil upon the Earth. But this karma willalso produce the stimulation of goodwill, and thus lasting good will offsettemporary evil. This must not be forgotten.The problems which have confronted you as an individual, as a disciple and as amember of the New Group of World Servers have been difficult, but you areweathering the storm and your little ship will live through the gale. All ispreparatory to an increased output in service—service which will developnormally without undue planning, and which will be accessory to your life taskof meeting your home and your healing responsibilities.This, as I hinted in your six seed thoughts last year, is summed up in the wordsthere found: “Your duty and your goal go hand in hand.” This condition is apt topresent more difficulties than a definitely clear-cut distinction. Relationshipshave to be more carefully adjusted and the time equation most carefullyorganised and planned. Your second ray [579] nature makes the first possible,your first ray attributes aid in the second. Your major emphasis this yearshould be the establishing of the most loving “right relations” with all in yourimmediate environment.What I am referring to, my brother, is deepening , and this deepening must beconsciously carried forward. One of the things which I desire to see in all themembers of this group in my Ashram is a process of deepening, carried forwardthrough realisation, silence, loving understanding and inner synthesis. That iswhy it is essential that all of you read and study each other’s papers andinstructions, so as to arrive at this depth of insight, vision and source ofactivity. All the outer relations will then—both of the individual disciple andof the group—be implemented from this inner centre, and will therefore belasting, sound and constructive.Your particular work in my Ashram is (as well you know) connected with theNetwork of Light which must be created in the world, and with the furthering ofthe Triangles of Light. . . . I would ask three of you . . . to form the innercentral triangle, and together and in constant consultation establish someuniformity and continuity of work. Continue with the work you are now doing andin the way you are doing it, but deepen (again that thought) the content of whatyou give to the people who read the notes you send out.I feel no need to give you any set meditation. The group meditation, your ownreflective work upon your task as a disciple (and this should be intensified),and your subjective meditation upon the Network of Light with your two Trianglemembers will provide you with adequate focal points for soul emphasis. Here Ihave given you a definition of meditation given by a Master to a group ofdisciples. He is not one of the Masters known to you or the outer world, for Heonly takes into His Ashram those who are in preparation for the thirdinitiation, and then only those who are pledged to undertake certain definiteactivities for which He trains them. These “focal points of emphasis” are ofmany differing kinds and should distinguish your type of meditation throughoutthe coming year. Such focal points are brief, dynamic, potent and emphatic andare only possible when [580] the antahkarana is in process of definiteconstruction, as is the case with your work along this line.I find little more to say to you, my brother. The reason for this is that wework in a peculiarly close manner at all times and you are very active in thework of my Ashram. You do not require, therefore, to hold lengthy discussionsand to receive long instructions from me at various annual points. We talk attimes throughout the year, and this again you know. Hence the brevity of thiscommunication.~MY FRIEND AND CO-WORKER: November 1944Ever since my last communication to you, you have worked assiduously andearnestly at the task assigned and have laid a good foundation for future work.You have, I know, realised within yourself the value and the nature of what youhave accomplished. I would ask you to read with care the instructions given asregards the work in connection with the Triangles; I need not, therefore,duplicate. The creative work of bringing these Networks of Light and of Goodwillinto being is well upon its way. It might be said that the form (esotericallyunderstood to be the vital body) is now strong enough to warrant an organisedbody upon the physical plane. I have consequently suggested that the emphasis ofall your effort should now shift to the networks per se and away from a constantconsideration of the quality aspect. You should now find it easier to promotethe growth of the networks than to educate people in the nature of light and itsuses, or even to bring them to an understanding of goodwill—though the latter isfar easier than the former. The growth of a network (through organisedenterprise) is something that the average man can understand.The work has hitherto been complicated by the attitude of those who have soughtto help but who have regarded it as a seriously difficult matter to formTriangles. What a man feels subconsciously conditions the success or thenon-success of his endeavour; this effort of mine started handicapped by thecomplexities which the concrete minds of my disciples [581] wrought around it,by their failure to grasp its basic importance, and by much initial criticism.It is a very simple plan and can be “put over” (to use a familiar phrase) withsimplicity. I hope to make this clear in a statement shortly to be written by meanent this work.I would call your attention to the fact that statements emanating from anymember of the Hierarchy, such as myself, have in them a potency which may not bearrested. This has oft been noted. Let me give you an illustration. The veryfirst communication I gave to A.A.B., asking her to send it out to the public,was entitled The New Group of World Servers. This was followed by one called TheNext Three Years . These were sent out exactly as dictated by me, without anydeletions, with their occult implications intact, and with little or no editing.They immediately reached thousands of minds and were received with simplicityeverywhere; their influence culminated in the highly successful campaign of1936. The tendency to adapt such writings to what you and others conceive to bethe capacity of the public mind detracts from the magnetism inherent in—if I mayso express it—the unadulterated article. That, however, is the responsibility ofall who seek to spread this phase of the Ageless Wisdom which I have beeninstrumental in revealing, and this A.A.B. has always understood. She hastherefore been unresponsive to all suggestions to cut down or to simplify thewritings. She will, I know, insist that the article or paper I propose writinggoes out to the general public exactly as I dictate it, without Christianisingit or rendering it innocuous by the deletion of all occult reference. I knowthat you also will cooperate. In the last analysis, the responsibility for thearticle is mine and that of A.A.B., and past history justifies the belief thatthe sensitive response of the public mind to esoteric truth is dependable.Coming back from a consideration of the work to you yourself, my brother and mydisciple, what can I bring to your attention that will give you strength andunderstanding? For those are two qualities which disciples need at this timeabove all else. You have an interesting combination of ray energies with the rayof order, permitting of the physical [582] establishment of relationship betweensoul and form strongly controlling you. This dominant energy should render yourouter work effective upon the physical plane, if you will remember thatesoterically the form nature is the vital etheric body, and this automaticallyand easily conditions the physical organised vehicle. When your work is noteffective, brother of mine, what is the reason? Note that this seventh raypotency is concentrated in your personality, and when your second ray soulenergy sweeps into prominence, the initial effect is oft to negate the activityof the personality. This is oft forgotten and is most confusing to the neophytein its earlier manifestations. Later, the disciple learns from experiment andexperience that all the rays are subrays of the great second ray. This you knowtheoretically, but that is different from the wisdom which comes fromunderstanding as the result of action. Once this fact is grasped, you can beginto use all the forces in your equipment as the implements of loving service.Here lies your major technical lesson. Your line of least resistance is that ofestablishing relationship with the end in view of building a form. This is alsothe line of pure magic and—as you know—it can be either black or white. Thereare two modes of creative work: One mode is that which is implemented by seventhray potency. This builds and creates within matter and within the periphery ofthe three worlds; it is exceedingly forceful when it is wielded through themedium of a seventh ray personality and a seventh ray physical body, as is thecase with you. The other mode is that of the second ray, which is applied fromwithout the three worlds and from soul levels; it works through radiation,magnetic appeal and coherent energy. Ponder on these two modes.Through your ray energies, you are in a position to use both methods under theinspiration of the Ashram. The result should be most effective service and thesteady growth of any work you may undertake for me and for the Ashram. You wouldfind it useful to make a study of the relation of the second ray to the seventh,for there is a close creative reaction or impulsive interplay between the two,and one which you need to employ consciously.[583] It is not for nothing that eleven of the particular group of discipleswith which you are associated in my Ashram have the seventh ray as thecontrolling agent of the physical vehicle, whilst thirteen are upon the secondray or have the second ray powerfully present in their equipment. The entiregroup has, therefore, within its ring-pass-not all that is required to make iteffectively creative; this divine creativity will express itself when all of youin the group begin to study your rays from the angle of group service, and notso much from the angle of your own individual conditioning. Which of youinvestigates his ray equipment of energy from this standpoint? Do not themajority of you regard the subject much along the following lines: This ray inmy equipment enables me to be and do thus, and so this ray complicates my life;this ray needs stronger emphasis in my life; such and such a ray gives me thisor that quality or capacity. Disciples must learn to study the group equipmentas a whole, and discover where a potency of which they may be the custodian canenrich the group life, enhance its effort and round out its presentation as aserving unit in the world of men. The responsibility of wielding force is a factto be emphasised in the consciousness of all disciples; it will lead to a moredeeply conscious and intelligent use of ray energy.It is needless for me to outline for you any set meditation work. All in thisgroup (unless expressly forbidden by me) are in a position, as a result of yearsof teaching and of practice, to control and regulate their meditative thoughtand reflection. For you, certain phrases should condition such thinking, and Iwill give you four which can be revolutionary in their effect upon you and ofmajor importance in the moulding processes of your life:1. Loving relationship.2. Conformity to the idea (not the ideal, my brother, for that is incidental).3. Perception of reality.4. Creative manipulation.These four phrases have in them the seed of all right service [584] and can beapplied to your individual life theme in the home, in your business, in yourwork with the service of the Triangles, and in all your group undertakings. Theygovern, if you study them with care, the life of the Ashram—of all Ashrams. Thatlife is one of inner and outer relationship, of sensitivity to the impression ofthe Hierarchy and the hierarchical idea at any given time, of correct perceptionof truth as it underlies relationship and impression, and of a true creativeactivity in the world of forces.You are definitely penetrating closer to the heart of the Ashram and are nowknown there and recognised by the senior workers. This you have accomplishedthrough the dynamic one-pointed energy of your emotional nature,which—fortunately for you—is balanced by your concrete mind. This is good andnecessary, except when your mind wanders into the realm of criticism; this,however, happens far less than in years gone by. You have every cause forencouragement, my brother, and my blessing rests upon you. This thought ofblessing has in it the idea of the transfer of spiritual energy.~BROTHER OF MINE: August 1946The past twelve months have been difficult for you in every aspect of your lifebut—what else can a disciple expect? The instructions I gave you last shouldhave done much to carry you steadily forward, for an inner surety ever enables adisciple to surmount difficulties. The monotony of life itself, the cares ofhome and practice, the anxieties incident to the times and the constant sense offrustration have all contributed to what I might call your almost grimdetermination to stand steady in the light. Now comes the disbanding of thegroup, and a sense of failure which it naturally engenders.I cannot too strongly urge upon you and upon all your group brothers therelative brevity of life. I say this not from the standpoint of the Christianministry, which so frequently urges upon its members the remembrance of death,nor am I [585] referring to the imminent passing away of any of you in thegroup. I refer simply to physical plane living from the angle of the soul, whosees in it but a fleeting experience, leaving a residue of learning. Someparticular life in some particular cycle may indeed be momentous and ofoutstanding importance, dignified by a reorientation, a decisive moving forward,the initiation of some service, the taking of some major initiation; but suchlives are rare until somewhat late in the soul’s experience.For you, this present life has two factors of prime importance: the working offand termination of karma in relation to some people, and secondly, theattainment of the control of your sixth ray astral body. You entered life as adisciple upon the verge of acceptance and upon the periphery of the Ashram, eventhough your consciousness registered it not; you will enter your nextincarnation having advanced in discipleship, and will rapidly achieveconsciousness of the fact. For the remainder of this life there is for you abeautifying of all experience, the conscious rendering of that service to otherswhich obliterates karma, the widening of your point of view, particularly in therealm of healing, where you are as yet still somewhat controlled by your sixthray idealism, and the increasing admission of your second ray energy so as tocontrol your organising personality. Does this seem what you call a “tallorder,” my brother? Forgive my use of slang, but it is oft curiouslydescriptive. If you study carefully what I say you will see that you are alreadydoing all these things and that all that I am asking is an intensification ofpresent action.I have therefore nothing spectacular or unusual to say to you today, and that initself indicates much. You can be trusted to proceed as heretofore, but I wouldask somewhat more.I would ask you to undertake a special piece of work (of integrating work forme), and to do it in such a way that it does not become a formal service but aliving process animated with purpose. I would ask you every Sunday to endeavourto contact the Ashram and myself (expecting no outer indication of success), andthen—in my presence—name each [586] of the people in the groups of nine and inthe new seed group, as well as the three other people who have been in receiptof “the Ashram papers,” the Fourteen Rules for Disciples and Initiates .This will take some time, as there have been many. It will be like picking up alinking thread and tracing it to the Ashram, thereby definitely strengtheningthe inner link. Even those who have passed on should be mentioned, for they arestill active in the service of the Ashram. I give you this task because of yourtrained persistence and because of your seventh ray ability to link the world ofform with the world of spiritual reality.I have no fears for you, my brother. You are a sound and self-directingdisciple. My care and attention, when you need me, are always available. Whenneed arises you can seek my aid—your Master, friend and teacher—remembering thatit will take you at least seven days to reach me. Ask A.A.B. to tell you why.But reach me you can.~MY FRIEND AND BROTHER: November 1948I have registered and then recorded on your ashramic chart your strong andconstant effort to fulfil requirements as I have presented them to you in mylast two communications. Particularly have you—in this incarnation—mastered thelesson of occult obedience. Have you ever realised that occultobedience—correctly understood and applied—is the royal route through the astralplane, particularly in connection with glamour and with sixth ray tendencies, tothe very heart of the Hierarchy? People are apt to regard obedience as thecarrying out of rules and orders, imposed upon them by some authoritativesource. This, as you well, know is not the case in any true hierarchicaltraining. Obedience, for the disciple, is a quick spiritual reaction to the Planas it emanates from the Hierarchy, rapid and correct sensitive registration ofthe quality of the Ashram with which he may be affiliated and a consequent andin time almost automatic undertaking (with speed) the required task. It is atask which [587] the disciple assigns to himself and is not one ordered by theMaster. The acceptance of the task is simply evidence that the disciple is anashramic worker, pledged to the welfare of humanity.You are, as I feel sure you know, in process of shifting your entirepolarisation in preparation for your next incarnation. When that comes, you willrenew your service with a first ray astral body, provided, of course, you havein this life reduced the usually obdurate sixth ray tendencies and arecontrolling them. This you are doing with real success and I have no question inmy mind as to your ultimate success.I seek to change your rhythm of work. I asked you—as you know—each Sunday tohave in mind all the members of the personal group with whom I have worked withthe aid of A.A.B. Did you realise, as you carried out my request, that I wasseeking the aid of your one-pointed attitude to reality? Or that I needed theassistance of some of the disciples in my Ashram in producing a consolidationand integration within the Ashram itself? It is a new Ashram; there are onlythree as new as is this one. I realised that it needed a more closely knitrelationship within the ashramic aura of some of its members; such a relation isbrought about by the construction of the needed thoughtform. I would recall toyou and to your group brothers that an Ashram is in reality a dynamic spiritualthoughtform, vitalised by the Master of the Ashram and by the initiates anddisciples associated with it. The initial structure and consolidation is nowconcluded and I can assign other work to you.Your work must now be more closely related to the Christ. I refer not heresolely to the preparation work in which you must all be engaged; I referspecifically to the Christ Himself, as a living Individual, attentive to thereactions of disciples who possess sufficient strength of purpose, clarity ofintention and dedication to enable them to touch the periphery of His aura(referred to in The New Testament as “the hem of His garment”). By thisstatement I do not mean the aura of the Hierarchy. You are all of you alreadysensitive to that to a greater or less degree, for His quality impregnated theentire aura of the Hierarchy. I [588] mean His individual aura . A disciple has“the freedom of the Hierarchy” (as it is called) and can now make this attemptto reach within the individual aura of the Christ; success is entirely dependentupon the disciple’s persistent but non-fanatic (or do I mean frantic, brother ofmine?) and selfless effort. Make this attempt each morning for just fiveminutes, but not for a longer period. I can in this case give you noinstructions; you will eventually find your way alone, as must all disciples.Those who are seeking to attain the degree of Master have—at some definite stageof their training—to make this attempt. A line of contact must eventually bebuilt, and those of you who are now disciples in my Ashram can begin to make theneeded effort. It will bring its own difficulties, such as over-stimulation andthe arousing of glamour but—if you are watchful and alert—you can soon becomeaware of it.This must suffice for today, my loyal friend and brother. There is much to do.Proceed with the work to be done, following the light which is in you and whichwill increasingly generate more light.~TO J. W. K-P.MY BROTHER: August 1940I have not much to say to you at this time and the reason thereof you know. Letnot the pressure of work at this time and world strain overcome you in any way.The task of world reconstruction still lies ahead but the disciples in the worldand the dedicated groups can begin to take the needed steps of preparation. Thereconstruction must begin in the place where the disciple at this time findshimself, and this will involve on a small and relatively unimportant scale thesame processes, the same eliminations and changes, the same discriminativeidealism and the same conformity to the new emerging pattern as will be requiredin world reconstruction. I would ask you to ponder on this, for [589] alldisciples throughout the world can begin to prepare themselves for increasedfuture activity.There are three outstanding aspects of the new age pattern which must be bornein mind:1. The aspect of healing. I would express it thus, for humanity will take muchpatient care before the shock and the pain of the present has been transmutedinto gained experience and understanding. Compassionate lovers of humanity cando this healing work.2. The aspect of clarification. The bewilderment of humanity as a whole requiresrecognition by the forces of reconstruction. Time and effort must be given toclear explanation and to the pointing out of the law of cause and effect.Trained interpreters are required.3. The aspect of reorganisation. Rebuilding is needed and this will require adedicated, spiritual insight. The New Age will not be ushered in and find trueexpression of its latent energies through the medium of old and patched upforms, or through the preservation of ancient techniques and attitudes. It willcome into being through entirely new forms and by means of the intelligentdiscarding of old modes of religion, government and economic and socialidealisms. The need for sensitive intermediaries who can sense the new emergingrealities and can take the needed constructive steps is great. They must createthe forms which these subjective ideas must utilise. I make these fewsuggestions to aid you and other workers in the task of reorganisation byindicating the type of worker needed today in the world, and much needed in thetask you are seeking to do for humanity and incidentally for Us.Sound business methods must distinguish the physical plane aspects of therevitalised organisations for which you are responsible; a potent note of loveand understanding must express the desire and sensitive subjective aspects ofthe active working group. Intelligent adaptability should be the mental note.These things I think you already know and I reiterate them not merely toemphasise them in your consciousness but also to weld the efforts of your groupbrothers [590] in the same united determination which will render them activecooperators in the plans laid down by Us for the helping of the world.It is always difficult for the disciple who is working in the world of humanaffairs to strike the happy medium between sound physical plane techniques inexpression and the measure of the vision which he sees; it is never easy toadapt and to relate the old to the new, thus producing that which the presentrequires. The task of the disciple, as you can see from the three words—old, newand present—is therefore primarily concerned with Time . This rightcomprehension of the time element requires the eye of vision, plus rightinterpretation of that which it sees. For this purpose I would give you ameditation based on sight and its suitability for your particular need will, Ithink, be immediately apparent. I make it very brief, for long meditations(reduced to form) are not adapted to your nature.1. Sound the OM three times, withdrawing your consciousness as you do so to theajna centre between the eyebrows. Hold it steadily there.2. Then look forth imaginatively in three directions:a. Upward to the world of the soul, to the kingdom of God and to the Hierarchy.Seek as you do this to link up definitely with your own Master, of Whom I am,with His permission, at this time the chosen representative.b. Inward to the world of men, seeking to contact the subjective world of humanthought and aspiration—the world of ideals and of human aspirational vision.c. Outward over the world of events, over the exoteric objective world oftangible happenings.3. Still holding the consciousness in the ajna centre express to yourself indefinitely formulated thought, the duty of the day in the light of this tripleinterrelation.4. Then focussing the light that is in you, send out the dedicated energy ofyour personality into the sphere of your chosen work through the medium of yourleft [591] eye and the potent energy of your soul through the right eye . Thiswill prove potent in effect.5. Then—as a soul—draw from the realm of soul life a fresh supply of soul energyand concentrate it in the head and heart , holding it steadily there for useduring the day’s work.6. Sound the OM three times inaudibly.This should only take a few minutes but it must be done dynamically and withfull control over thought and activity.My blessing rests upon you.~August 19421. Hold in your hand the thread of all my outer work and hold it there for me.2. The symbols of the hands and feet hold a secret that you need.3. Your Master says this word to you and through my lips: You know the pointachieved. Move on.4. Three groups there are which you must aid and fuse them into one. And thisupon the inner side.5. Joy comes through pain and not alone through strength achieved or in theservice wrought. It takes all three. These three you have.6. The gift of play must come to you, my brother. Play upon the earth and playin the hidden place and sport yourself within the playground of the Gods.~MY BROTHER, FRIEND AND CO-WORKER: September 1943Have you lately read the statement which I gave you in my previous instruction?It carries for you your instructions for the future and gives you—as you nowread it—far more of teaching value than it did a year ago. These instructionsstill hold good. You have had a most difficult year, my brother, and those of uswho are working with all of you on the inner side are not unmindful of it. . . .[592] The work, planned and outlined by me during past years, has been largelyat a standstill. But what did you expect, my brother? There is one point whichyou have perhaps failed to grasp, but which is to me a source of continual joyand satisfaction. The work of the Goodwill movement has been so eminently andessentially successful that today it demonstrates in the form of a myriad plansfor post-war helpfulness, in the form of thousands of groups and of millions ofwell-intentioned people, forward-looking and kind, of all races andnationalities, who are preparing to do their share in salvaging humanity and inre-establishing (on sounder and better lines) the needed security and happiness.I refer not here to the work done by all of you since I published my firstpamphlet, The New Group of World Servers , in 1932. That was only a part of thelarger effort. I refer to the outpouring of the Christ consciousness and thespirit of love upon the world. This was initiated in 1825, and brought about themajor welfare movements, led to the organisation of the groups which wrought forhuman betterment, aided in the founding of the labour movements which werefounded on right motive, inspired educational processes, philanthropicenterprises and the great medical expansions, and which today is seeping intoworld government and beginning to condition all the plans for world peace andinternational relations. Success is assured, though movements may progressslowly....It is the massed endeavour which will release humanity in the coming cycle. Youhave worked better than you know or care; you are and can increasingly be achannel, for the simplicity of the first ray type of person is a terrificpotency. Use it, my brother, free from isolation. It is ever easier for a firstray worker to proceed alone upon the way of his decision, but I would suggestthat you work in closer cooperation with your fellow disciples. It is essentialnow that the projected work receive an intensification of vitality, that itshould expand through the potency of its innate life, and that there should be astrengthening of the integral parts already built. It is of immediate importancethat each cooperating server should be fired with a new and fresh enthusiasm,[593] and should get the picture of the world-wide scope of the desired plan.I suggest that the emphasis during the coming year be laid upon the objectiveaspect. The subjective quality has been presented, and this has been rightbecause the subjective aspect of any form of expression must be living andexpanding if the objective form is to take its place in world phenomena withpower and usefulness. The potentialities of organised services for the spiritualstrengthening of the world of men, the technique of their growth and theprocesses of their development—individual, group, and eventually a veritablenetwork of interrelated groups—should now be elaborated. The more subjectivework, emphasising the spiritual growth of humanity along the lines of the newapproach to divinity has, as you can see, a definite relation to the new worldreligion and can eventually be focussed around the various full moons.In the coming year let “joy be your strength.” This is only possible when power,will and strength are blended with love, wisdom and skill in action and speech.My strength is yours, and the overshadowing care of your own Master rests everon you.~MY BROTHER: August 1946(And I mean this in its fullest sense.) I start this instruction for you withtwo statements: First of all, in the discussion of the work which I undertook in1919 and upon which I reported to the Hierarchy—the twenty years of work and thesix years of that work during the war—your name necessarily came up as did thatof your fellow disciples. The discussion was between the Master Morya (yourMaster), the Master K.H., and Master R. in whose hands lies the rehabilitationof Europe, and myself. The comment made by your Master was, “I am genuinelysatisfied with him. A life of selflessness has fitted him for world-widehumanitarian work for the remainder of this life and the next.”The second statement I wish to make is that—given life [594] and health—you facea period of service unprecedented in your experience. I have watched yourdevelopment during fifteen years since you passed into my Ashram to get thetraining which will enable you later to take a position in the Ashram of yourown Master—a position similar to that of A.A.B. in the Ashram of K.H. You havelearnt rapidly and moved fast, and it is only right and just that you shouldknow it. You have certain difficulties to overcome in the use of first rayenergy, and any mistakes you may have made in harsh judgements and in itsphysical expression in speech are simply incidental to the learning of the rightuse of soul energy. This is your immediate problem.Every time that first ray energy pours through you it leads to a trifling or atrue crisis in your relationships with others. You need to acquire a moregeneral and genuine liking (as a means to understanding) of your fellowmen,particularly of those who are your co-workers in my work. When the time arrivesthis development will pay you good dividends if your fellow students welcomeyour leadership. They are prepared to do this but will miss the love andnonsense (frequently teaching nonsense) by means of which A.A.B. is apt tohandle situations. Be not ruthless or dissatisfied with their efforts to makegood. Many of them are in the preliminary stages of being trained so as to fitthemselves to be on the periphery of some Ashram and there trained fordiscipleship.You need, my brother, to be more appreciative of effort and less critical ofaccomplishment. With true failures you are ever kind and understanding and havedemonstrated this often, but you are apt to despise (behind a kind manner) thosewho appear satisfied with what they have done. You need also to learn withwisdom to choose your workers when it is your task to do so. It is not easy foryou or for any first ray disciple to get close enough, or want to get closeenough, to a person to really know him. You may remember the episode when theMaster M. was at one time asked to handle the pupils of the Master K.H. so as torelease Him for some brief job, and found himself unable to understand them orto do anything with them. It lies in the natural isolation of the first raytype. Have this in mind.[595] Be sure to choose the workers (when the decision lies with you) who are onthe second ray, or first ray people in whom the love element is highlydeveloped, but not over-developed. You are apt to be suspicious of people’smotives. Give them due credit for sincerity and for having something as yet tolearn, and help them learn their lessons—by loving them and trusting them;confine your chief attempt to establishing a measure of intimacy with yourworkers—friendship and a working partnership; this will guarantee the success ofyour work.Your mind and brain are full of the work to be done. You work as do all firstray workers and as the Master Morya. First ray workers provide the substancewith which the second ray workers build and the other ray workers qualify andmodify. You inspire substance with the energy and purpose and with the lifenecessary to render it responsive to the plan—the Plan of goodwill which theMasters are at present implementing and for which They seek workers. Write more,my brother; you have the vision and your meditation is sound. It has always beenalong first ray lines as taught in the Ashram of the Master Morya. This fewpeople understand. Any other form of meditation would be false to you. Thoughyou oft chide yourself for not acceding with exactitude to my demands, I judgeyour meditation nevertheless to be perhaps the most satisfactory of any in thegroup. I am, therefore, giving you a passage from the Old Commentary which has adirect reference to the work you are attempting to do.“He stands in strength who sees the Will of God behind the Plan. Thewill-to-good substands all true goodwill. That will is he.The Plan for this cycle of the sixth objective crisis is goodwill for all men,and through all men, goodwill. That Plan starts now.The Plan, within our planet as a whole, is the changing of the energydischarging unit (the etheric subplanes—A.A.B.). The fourfold form must assumetriangular relation. Ponder on this. [596]The objective of the Plan is to reproduce upon the plane of earth the innerkingdom of the soul. This has the Master of the Masters long foretold. Preparethe way.”My blessing rests upon you for all the work which you have done. I—your friend,brother and teacher—ask and need your still continued help.~BROTHER OF MINE: November 1948Today in the ordinary course of events and as part of my final planning inrelation to the work preparatory to the coming of the Christ, I have certainitems of information to impart. The keynote of the next few years of your workis—as well you know—the making known and the steady and intelligent preparationof the human consciousness for His reappearance. With the subject of thatreappearance I deal not here, but there is somewhat which I seek to say anentthat which may be done by all of you upon whom I have kept a supervisory eyeduring the past few years.There are five Masters and five Ashrams involved in this preparatory work. Firstof all, there is the Ashram of the Master K.H.; this is the presiding Ashram inthis work owing to the fact that it is a second ray Ashram and, therefore, uponthe same line of energy as that of the Christ Himself; another reason is thatthe Master K.H. will assume the role of World Teacher in the distant future whenthe Christ moves on to higher and more important work. Next comes the Ashram ofthe Master Morya; the reason for this is that the whole procedure is projectedfrom Shamballa and the Ashram of the Master Morya is ever in close touch withthat dynamic centre. The Master R.—as the Lord of Civilisation—is also closelyinvolved; He is also—and this is of major importance—Regent of Europe.I have also at times referred to the Master Who is responsible for thereorganisation of Labour; this work He began to do in the latter part of thenineteenth century but left it to [597] carry forward on its own momentum whenRussia entered the field and laid its emphasis upon the proletariat or theworkers, to the exclusion of all other members of national groups. This producedwhat we might call the workers’ revolution in the latter years of the firstquarter of the twentieth century. I myself am the fifth Master concerned in thiswork and am—as it were—the liaison officer between those disciples who areworking in the field of the world and Those Masters Who are directly responsibleto the Christ for the needed work of preparation.Certain picked disciples from all these five Ashrams have been or will betrained for the work of contacting the public. Many of them (perhaps themajority) are totally unknown to you. Some of them you know. I refer not here toA.A.B. whose exoteric work is known to you whilst her esoteric work is wellknown to Us. Her exoteric work is drawing to a close and this also is an idea towhich you are well accustomed.You, my brother, have ahead of you the consolidating of all the work whichA.A.B. has started for Us. I refer specifically to the new teaching, embodied inthe books which she has published, to the work of the Triangles and the work ofGoodwill. I refer also to the counsel and help which you will give to theyounger key people, as they endeavour to adapt the Arcane School to the patternof the new teaching which I have given and which will eventually sweep the world(if the work is properly handled) and thus prepare the people for the new worldreligion. R.S.U. has also been designated for this work of preparation and—in myinstruction to her—I shall indicate certain basic attitudes which she mustdevelop and hold as she stands steadily with you and with the younger keypeople. I particularly want her to work with them because she is a trueesotericist and the Arcane School is fundamentally an esoteric school. Anotherdisciple, D.H.B., is also entrusted with a share in this special field ofpreparatory work; he is not, however, to be concerned with the Goodwill work,but in another field which I will indicate to him in his own instruction. I amnot doing much more than mentioning W.W. because this is his first [598] cycleas an accepted disciple; the service which he has to do is already recognised byhim and will provide a serious and important life work. It is my intention togive him a word of encouragement and of advice. I am mentioning all thesedisciples to you as they should all work in the closest cooperation with you andthat lays upon you much responsibility. R.S.U. has for years worked side by sidewith you; she has come through her test triumphantly, and in the task of servingas a channel for esoteric light and information she is competent and likewisehumble in her attitude.There is little else that I can say to you, brother of mine, save to tell youthat you are trusted and that you will increasingly demonstrate the strengthwhich comes to you from Shamballa, via your own Master. On that strength you maynow draw. A.A.B. is quite correct when she says that your major hour ofopportunity is now upon you as slowly she withdraws into that service which will(within the Ashram) enable K.H. to do more deeply spiritual work incollaboration with the Christ. It was to train her and thus enable her to dothis that she undertook—alone and without my help —to found and organise theArcane School; it gave her much needed training and experience and enabled herto demonstrate the quality of the teaching and that esoteric psychology which isthe major task in each Ashram and particularly in the second ray Ashram.You ask if there is aught that you can do. There is above everything else, thehandling of the energy which is now streaming forth—the energy of Love in itsdynamic or electric form. It is the Will aspect of Love which the Christ will ofnecessity use this time when He comes; when He earlier came He employed theteaching aspect of the second ray and not the Will aspect. First ray disciplesare peculiarly susceptible to the Will aspect of Love, and for these reactionsyou must watch and endeavour always to lay your emphasis not upon the Will—ofthis latter quality you have (for this incarnation) an adequate and full supply.Let your fellow workers catch from you the radiance of Love. That, my brother,will release the financial supply so sorely needed; it will be the harmlessnesswhich you and your fellow servers [599] can demonstrate which will prove theneeded agent. Proceed as usual, my tried and trusted brother.This instruction may perhaps disappoint you. I asked A.A.B. what she believedconditioned my response to your question. She replied: “You trust in hisunderstanding, self-discipline and consecration.” She was right. I have nodistrust in you at all. So, my brother, I can advise naught, for you need not myadvice; I—your friend and companion—can only suggest that you proceed as usualupon your way, remembering always to keep a recognised and conscious link withyour Master.~TO R. S. U.January 1940You and I, my brother, have worked together for long years—longer perhaps thanyou know. There is little that I can say to you along the line of revealing toyou the glamours which hold your personality in thrall. These you well know.Often I have told you what they are. In your case, it is not so much aparticular glamour but the presence of several smaller ones. The more sensitivea person is the more responsive he is to others.You have wisdom, beauty of purpose, devotion and sincerity—all characteristicsof the advanced disciple. The glamour which holds you is inherited from otherlives. You have immersed yourself in no new glamour in this life, and this israre indeed and for this I commend you.But certain ancient glamours—racial and personal—still hold you, and it is theovercoming of these that constitutes your life problem and your present failureto do so that keeps you where you are. If perhaps I define or indicate to youtwo glamours which intrude into your soul expression and prevent the entrance ofthe full light of the soul, and if I give to them names which are not usual youmay, perhaps—by due pondering—arrive at the point where you will be able todissipate them.The glamour of “the flight into safety of the racial consciousness” [600] is oneof your dominant glamours, even if—in your own consciousness—you repudiate it.Every individual, without exception, is subject to this racial glamour and itspotency is unbelievable. The subjective life of any nation, producing as it doesracial psychology, national inclinations and traits and characteristics, liesbehind every single individual and into it he can at any time throw himself, andinto it he can retreat thus taking refuge in the past and emphasising certainracial attitudes. The overcoming of inherited traits and attitudes is, in yourcase, essential. You are really cosmopolitan. But in your life demonstration noone would know it. Disciples need to remember that it may only be in this lifethat they have been born into any particular race or nation and this only fromthe personality angle. Being, however, thus temporarily affiliated they may—ifsensitive—become so identified with racial problems and relationships, withracial history and qualities that this ancient inheritance (which is racial andnot personal and therefore not theirs) overwhelms them and constitutes a majorconflict. So it is with you. In every race and nation there are those who—downthe ages—have again and again incarnated in certain races and groups. There arealso those who have incarnated in a particular race in order to acquire eithercertain valuable qualities with which a race or nation can endow a man, or touse that racial and national experience as a means whereby there can be thebreaking of such bonds, a consequent release and a subsequent entering into thefreedom of humanity itself. Ponder on this, my brother, and be not separative inyour sensitivity and set as to your personality origins, to your so-calledracial loyalties and characteristics, acquired through environing circumstance.Is this too hard a lesson and a task, my brother? If so, determine withinyourself if it is so or if it is not. Another life, the issue may be clear toyou. It could be clear in this life if you accepted my suggestion.Upon the second glamour I need not enlarge. We might call it the “glamour ofcontinuous frustration.” In your case and in the constant failure to achieve thefullest expression of your spiritual aims and goals, because of small andunimportant [601] personality qualities (most of them tied up with your racialinheritance and your environing circumstances), you are constantly aware of lackof achievement and of failure to do what your soul has made quite adequatelyclear to you is possible. Here I cannot help you. The issue lies in your ownhands. Do you realise, my brother, that a week’s perfected discipline wouldcarry you further than a year’s aspiration, accompanied as it is (in your case)by a constant sense of failure? Go forward therefore, my beloved brother, andrest not content until liberation is yours.~MY BROTHER: August 1940Since my last instruction to you, you have attained to a certain measure ofrelease and that means much and for that achievement I would indicate mypleasure and commend you. You are freeing yourself for service. All that Iearlier said as to your problems still holds good and I would ask you to rereadprayerfully and aspirationally what I said then. To the injunctions there givenI would add some further suggestions. I seek further to clarify the issue inyour mind. Once a disciple sees clearly, he can then take intelligent action.You have not really liked my reference to racial limitations and yet, my brotherand I can say my friend, why resent them? All national heritages lay theirimpress upon their peoples. A.A.B. is typically British in her personalityattitudes and with her pride of race, heritage, ancient lineage and caste, withher stubborn persistence and dogged determination, with her sense of truth andher attitude of inner solitude. These qualities she has had to learn graduallyto transmute into the dignity of soul consciousness, intelligent direction,clear expression of her sense of truth and a wide and general inclusiveness.This has not been easy though you, not possessing her particular problems andtendencies, may fail to realise that they are (or rather have been) as grave asyours. Some day I will give the group members a diagnosis of their racialcolouring and consequent tendencies. Today I deal only with your peculiardifficulties because your battle [602] ground lies right there and it is mainlyyour racial faults which hinder you.I would add also to the above—which I rarely do—that you are likewise freer fromthe imposition of physical control than at any previous time in your life story,except once when you were much younger. Your second major limitation has been,as you know, a physical one and is incidentally also a part of the racialtrouble, and of racial polarisation. Every disciple has to achieve completefreedom from racial limitations and to break down certain separative barriers;otherwise they remain and hinder, as I hinted elsewhere to S.C.P. This ishowever an attainable attitude for you. You have, secondly, also to release yourpersonality from the control of that which is the most potent personalityvehicle, owing to the focus of the thought and life being largely there. Thevisualisation of yourself as one who is unlimited in soul expression physicallywould aid you. It is usually only in the brain (not in the mind) that racialreactions and racial vibrations make their presence felt. The brain cells, theatomic lives of the brain organism, respond to the racial brain and thuscondition physical plane activity. A conflict is then apt to take place betweenthe mind and the brain as in your case, but brain-responsive habits are apt toremain powerful for a long time and hence the problem. I am explaining, mybrother, as you can shift the emphasis if you so desire and become entirelyunconscious of racial control and racial karma. At present you seldom forget itand it conditions you unduly. Will you please not misunderstand me here if I saythat once you relinquish that emphasis, the integration of the personality willbe complete and you will be ready for a major step onwards.A Master watches His disciples long before they are aware of the inspection, forthey themselves take the needed steps into His presence long before the brainregisters the contact or the response of the Master. All in this group have beenwatched by me for many years and in three cases for several lives (so slow werethey to register inner spiritual impression) before I communicated to them myintention to train them. This inner direction definitely precipitates situations[603] and difficulties and engenders problems and none of you are unaware ofthis. The lot of disciples in these days is particularly hard owing to the factthat sensitivity and a conscious reaction to the impress of all the vehicles inthe personality simultaneously is so rapid and direct. This is the result of ameasure of alignment and of conscious aspiration. But the compensation isadequate if disciples would be more occupied with the inner realities and lessengrossed with the outer difficulties. But this, as you know, is most difficultof achievement.You ask me: What would I have you do in regard to your own attitudes to thegroup and to the work with which you are all engaged? It is not hard to answeryour enquiry because for you the task is uncomplicated though not simple ofachievement. Be, my brother, on the outer plane, what you are interiorly. Youhave much knowledge and wisdom. Use it as much as possible because you have asphere of usefulness in this connection right in front of you, ... Your destinyis that of teacher. Begin, therefore, to fulfil it. You have been much occupiedwith organisational work—a choice of vocation made by your soul which wasintended to offset the limitations with which I have sought to make youfamiliar. Such a task was intended to provide scope for expression upon theouter plane and this it has done. Now pour your energies into the work of thegroups with which you are affiliated. Give to A.A.B. the aid which you are wellfitted to give, making yourself increasingly responsible for certain aspects ofthe work which will make their appeal to you, and which call for yourconditioning. I am choosing my words with care. Above all else give love withimpersonality and true understanding. It must not be the impersonality of aplanned and forced achievement but the impersonality of completeself-forgetfulness. The task is so vital that you and all your group brothersmust lose sight of the little self in the need and the opportunity of themoment. Oft have I told you this. May I now see the result of this oftrecommended truth?As regards your personal meditation, I seek to give you one which will intensifythe activity of the ajna centre and which will produce new vision and, aboveall, integration. [604] The ajna centre becomes active increasingly asalignment, leading to integration, is achieved. I would have you use thismeditation twice a day, laying the emphasis upon the exercise angle or aspect ofthe work and paying no attention at all to the possible spiritual value. I wouldremind you here (and when I say this I am speaking to all the group members andnot only to you) that work in connection with the centres is incidental to truespiritual development and is or should be purely mechanical and automatic. Thecentres are physical, being aspects of the etheric body and constructed ofetheric matter, and their function is simply to express the energy which flowsin from the astral body, or from the mind or from the soul (in three aspects).After the third initiation, they will register energy flowing in from theMonad—again through three types of force. If this can be grasped, disciples intraining will not over-emphasise the system of centres through which theexpressive energy must come.The object of this particular exercise is to centralise the consciousness (plusthe energies of which it is aware within the physical body) in the centrebetween the eyebrows, the ajna centre. When this is done, you have a secondaryform of integration made possible, i.e., the integration of forces coming fromthe outer world of impression, via the five senses and the synthesising sense,the mind. You have, therefore, energies seeking outlet and expression, via theetheric body as it conditions and renders active the dense physical body, and atthe same time energies making known to the man the world of spiritual being. Ofthese two worlds of sense perception, the two eyes are the symbol, as you know.1. Achieve quiet. Relax with as much rapidity as possible and with little mentalactivity. Then raise the consciousness to the ajna centre.2. Sound the OM, visualising the integration of the personality with the soul.In doing this, link the pituitary centre with the head centre, above the pinealgland.3. Then pause and after a mental grasp of what is to be done proceed as follows:[605]a. Take a long breath and draw the energy from the throat centre in so doing.b. Repeat the breathing and draw the energy from the heart centre, holding thesetwo withdrawn energies imaginatively in the ajna centre.c. Repeat the process in connection with the solar plexus.d. Repeat also in connection with the sacral centre.e. Recognising then that four types of energy have been centred in the ajnacentre, take another long breath and draw the energy of the muladhara centre tothe ajna focus.f. Then consciously endeavour to hold all the energies there.4. At this point, dedicate the energies of the personality (which expressthemselves through these five centres and the ajna centre, making six centres inall) and breathe them back again—by an act of the will—into the centres to whichthey belong. Do not do this sequentially and piecemeal but as one dynamicoutbreathing; see these energies travelling down the spine to their respectiveresting places, carrying new life, pure stimulation and dynamic will to each andevery centre.5. Then, as the soul informing the body , sound the OM and proceed with thegroup meditation.This meditation should definitely aid in increasing the activity of the physicalbody along the lines you have for so long desired, and make the discipline forwhich you have striven, no longer a discipline but a life of unconscious,automatic spiritual expression.~August 19421. Your feet have onward marched. The Path stands clear revealed. You know thestep ahead.2. I would ask you not to backward look, my brother, but [606] tread withconfidence the Lighted Way. It leads to Me. Your soul and I are One.3. Yet I am always near thee—nearer than breeze, or breath or air. Your soul,your Master and yourself are truly one. Reflect.4. Stand free. Let naught disturb your calm. Yet seek not peace. Keep poisedupon a pinnacle of love.5. I seek to have you come closer into the work. Seize upon opportunity when itmay come.6. Move forward in my Ashram; the middle Place within that Ashram is the outerPlace within the centre of K.H. You know your place.~MY FRIEND AND HELPER: September 1943It has been under discussion between K.H. and myself as to whether you should atthis time move into His Ashram or whether you should still stay within my Ashramwhich—in the last analysis—is a part of His. I hinted at this fact to you in oneof the six statements which I gave you in my last instruction. It has beendecided between us (subject to the approval of your own soul) that the work inmy Ashram calls for your cooperation and help, particularly as A.A.B. is nowworking at her own post within the Ashram of K.H. This decision was reached forcertain definite reasons which it is only fair should be communicated to you:First: It was felt that your present type of physical vehicle could notadequately take the heightened vibration which distinguishes the Ashram of aChohan from that of a Master. It would require too much adjustment andconsequent delay in the work to be done, especially in this time of world crisiswherein every disciple has to contribute all that is in him. You yourself knowthat consistently you have been told by me that your major hindrance was thephysical body—a body equipped to render the service and complete certain karmicadjustments during this life. People seldom appreciate adequately the fact thatthe physical body is a definite channel of contact (and sometimes the only oneas it expresses [607] physical plane relationships of a karmic nature) betweenthemselves and the people with whom they have to work out certain relationships.This has been pronouncedly so in your case; this is a fact which you will graspwith greater facility when no longer limited by that physical body, as are allwho are in incarnation, particularly disciples at your stage of expression. Haveyou not realised that one of the lessons which every disciple has to learn isthe lesson of limitations? Usually this lesson climaxes in some one incarnationwherein—again as in your case—there is full and free inner expression and at thesame time definite physical limitations. If you were now transferred into theAshram of K.H., it would necessitate too much expenditure of protective force onthe part of K.H. in order to prevent the disruption of some of the atoms of yourbody, to offset a too rapid purification of the cells of the physical body, tostem a too direct stimulation of the centres in the etheric body, and aconsequent arresting of the work you are doing—and doing so well. Your personalkarma still demands that you stay where you are—and I still need your aid, mybrother.Second: This particular group of disciples in my Ashram, with which you are andwill be affiliated, needs your help and service. That is another phase of karma(this time the karma of a pledged disciple) which you have assumed. The yearshave proved your staying power, your unswerving devotion and your stable lovefor your co-workers. All that is still needed and will be increasingly required.An understanding heart and a steady application to the work to be done are greatattributes, and speaking esoterically, both I and your group brothers “knowwhere to find you.” The part that you have to play will slowly emerge and becomeclear to your mind and you, I know, will meet requirements as they arise.Third: Your work must increasingly be that of the teacher, and you must learnmore and more to bring through, for the use of the many, the knowledges storedup by your soul through many lives of training; this knowledge, rapidly beingtransmuted by you into wisdom, must be made available for your personality touse as it seeks to help and train other personalities to become soul conscious.If you were to [608] move into the more advanced Ashram you might find that youcould not do this, for you would not only be occupied in making certain neededadjustments, but would also have to apply yourself to fresh learning. It hasbeen felt by Us, therefore, that for the remainder of this incarnation youshould develop the facility to make full use of what you have acquired, so thatthe stream of outgoing teaching can become so direct that you will establish ateaching facility and technique for your next incarnation which will stand youin good stead when the work your soul has planned for you opens up in front ofyou.You have, therefore, three things to do as the future unrolls:1. Continue with the discipline and right control of the physical body so thatit can increasingly become a better and more usable instrument.2. Form a steady and stable focal point of loving attention to which your groupbrothers can turn in years to come.3. Give out to others more and more of what you know. You have a good field ofexpression in the work for which A.A.B. tells me you are responsible. Use thisincreasingly—with firmness and judgment. Let not your heart always determine theissues at stake, but call in the balancing head increasingly. The so-called kindimmediate thing or the thing which the student wants is not always the wisething or that which will help him the most.The remarks which I have made anent the two Ashrams will have awakened interestin your mind and you will be pondering upon the relation existing between thevarious Ashrams. Scattered throughout these personal instructions, as well as inthe group teachings, will be found much that has hitherto not been given out orwhich is relatively new, and hence the value of reading with care theinstructions of the individual group members. There was much of esoteric valuein the various statements given last year to the group members, [609] and thesixth sentence in yours embodies a new and interesting truth.There are many Ashrams upon the various rays. My Ashram, being a second rayAshram, is naturally closely related to that of K.H., which is the central orthe most important Ashram upon the second ray line of energy as it penetratesthe hierarchical centre. K.H. is at this time, under the Christ, the workingRepresentative of the second ray in the Hierarchy. The Christ is the linkbetween the second ray as it expresses itself in the Hierarchy and Shamballa.Initiates of high degree and Masters on all the rays have Their Own Ashrams, butnot all are teaching centres; this is a point to be remembered, as well as thefact that all of them are not concerned primarily with the unfoldment of thehuman consciousness and with the needs of the human kingdom. There are othertypes of consciousness of deep and real importance in the great chain ofHierarchy stretching from below to far above the human kingdom. This is a pointapt to be forgotten.I, as a Master upon the second ray, have an Ashram which is a branch, anaffiliate, an outgrowth or a specialised part of the Ashram of K.H. It isbecause of this that the services of A.A.B. have been made available to me fortwo decades and more than two decades. Words here are limiting and confusing. Inthe statement of six sentences which was given to you last year, you were toldto move forward in my Ashram. The meaning is that in the great interlockingdirectorate of the Hierarchy and in the basic relation between the Ashrams (as,for instance, all Ashrams upon the second ray) there arises a point where thecircle of an Ashram overlaps or interpenetrates the circle of another Ashram,and at their point of contact and of overlapping an increased intercourse andinterplay becomes possible. It is here that you have to find your place. Itmight be pictured somewhat like the diagram [below], as regards my Ashram andthat of K.H.[Image00020.jpg]At this Middle Point there is a coming and a going; there is relation andcontact; there is increased opportunity and inspiration; there are focal pointsof transmutation, of transition and of transformation. It is towards this areaof merging [610] and of fusion that you are now asked to move. Reflect upon thisand get the deep spiritual implications which this picture of relationshipbetween the Ashrams can convey to you. By your effort, your determination andyour understanding you can form part of the group which stands in this “MiddleChamber” (to use Masonic terminology) and can work from this point in theashramic life. This important little diagram can be applied also to the relationbetween the Hierarchy and Humanity—the New Group of World Servers occupying thislower midway point.It will be obvious to you also how the symbolism of an eclipse will come intoyour mind, for when the merging is complete, humanity and the Hierarchy will beone; there will be no outer or inner and no middle chamber, but only completeunity. Later in our planetary history, this design will also depict the relationof Shamballa to the Hierarchy. It can also be applied most usefully to therelationship between soul and personality, wherein the “encroaching light of thesoul obliterates the dim light of the personality, and within that lighted areathe disciple learns to stand.”There is much more that could be said, my brother, but reflection and prolongedthought upon what has been said will enable you to add that much more.I would suggest that you take these thoughts into your meditation, and that youalso use this little diagram as the theme for reflection during the coming year.Draw up your [611] own meditation form, embodying these concepts and preservingsteadfastly in your consciousness the imperative command of your soul to “moveforward.” Look for indications of this moving forward in the growth of increasedunderstanding, in a sense at times of a greatly heightened vibration, and alsoin a greatly increased facility in imparting knowledge. Learn to know yourselfas the disciple, and be not so intensely preoccupied with yourself as thestruggling aspiring personality. Personalities enter not into Ashrams— onlysouls.There is no need for me to ask you to stand by A.A.B. The rhythm of years cannotbe disturbed and you have always stood by her and you always will.~MY BROTHER: November 1944The past year has seen much change in your life, and for this I earlier soughtto prepare you; it is change which is largely in the nature of release and of afreeing for more effective service. In reviewing what I said to you last year(and this I have carefully done in order to help you more effectively in theprocess of adjustment which faces you) I am impressed with the nature and scopeof the information which I saw fit to impart to you. I wonder if theimplications of what I said made due impression upon your mind? The followinginformation was given you:1. That the Master K.H. was aware of you and of your relation to Him.2. That it had been decided, in view of A.A.B.’s recall for more definite workin His Ashram, that you would continue to work in my Ashram for the remainder ofthis life. A.A.B. had temporarily given up some of her work in the Ashram ofK.H. in order to be of assistance to me in the specialised work I was attemptingto do and which she was equipped to aid.3. That the “middle point” between the auras or spheres of influence of therelated Ashrams should form your [612] immediate objective and the goal of yourendeavour. This would mean, in your case, that when you have achieved the“freedom of the middle point” you would be sensitive to impression from me andfrom my Ashram with which you are now affiliated, but you would also besensitive to impressions from the Ashram of K.H., via A.A.B.4. It was also indicated to you that the vehicle which you should seek todiscipline and subject to refinement was the physical body. The density of yourphysical vehicle is both an asset and a liability; it is for you to discover thenature of both and offset the liabilities through discipline and employ theassets in active service.These are four of the more important facts which I earlier gave you and I recallthem to your attention, owing to their major significances in providing visionof possibility and of necessity.The future holds much of true service and opportunity for you, and in the placewhere your heart lies. When you have successfully and rightly freed yourselffrom other claims, I would urge you to look forward with joyful anticipation toa fuller and a richer life. A great Law of Compensation comes into play in apeculiar manner and along special lines where accepted disciples are concerned.The emphasis laid upon discipline, upon purification, upon hard demanding workand upon relinquishing that which the personality holds dear, is a needed phaseof occult development. This is generally and often sadly recognised.But—paralleling the period of pain and difficulty—is a compensatory activity ofthe soul which brings all life and circumstance into true perspective andchanges attitudes so completely that the recognition of adequate rewardsupersedes the realisation of pain. The Law of Sacrifice and the Law ofCompensation are closely allied, but the first to become active in the life andto become a recognised factor in daily living is sacrifice. Compensation comeslater into recognition.You have, my beloved brother, lived a full and rich life; you have been broughtinto contact with thousands of people [613] of all degrees, religions and pointsof view; you have known a family life, oft of great pressures but also offrequent happiness; you have fulfilled your duties and adhered to yourobligations. Along with all the many impacts upon your life and the many demandsupon you, you have successfully endeavoured to live the dual life of thedisciple, to serve me and participate, as far as you could see it, in the workof my Ashram. There have been failures, and of these I have not hesitated totell you oft.There still remains the conscious refining of the physical vehicle in order toenable you, in your next incarnation, to step into the ring-pass-not of theAshram of the Chohan K.H. No one can do this for you. In your presentcircumstances it should be easy for you to apply that desired and recogniseddiscipline—a discipline of such a practical nature that you need not that Ishould outline it for you. It is one that can and should be gradually applied;this method is more likely to be successful than a rigidly outlined andforcefully demanded procedure and life of physical sacrifice, which mightsucceed but which might, however, land you in another “field of failure.”Your place in relation to my work in the world is well recognised by you and Iwould have you remember that your major spiritual responsibility is essentiallywork that is close to my heart. Each soul you touch in the carrying out of theseduties is placed in a particular and peculiar relation to you. Why, my brother?Because, as a member of my Ashram and as one who is approaching the moreimportant Ashram of K.H., you can and do, by the fact of your relation to theseaspirants and students, bring them en rapport with hierarchical force. This youshould remember, and also bear in mind that the effects of implementing thisrelationship will be both good and bad. Contact with any disciple acts as aprecipitating agency, evoking that which is good and bringing to the surfacethat which is undesirable and which needs revealing, in order to bring about itsrejection. This force and responsibility you need to handle with more consciousunderstanding. Shrink not from the results, but see to it that reaction tocontact with you and with your band of associates, [614] does have definiteresults. To handle these reactions was something which A.A.B. had to learn bothto understand and use; you must learn also, brother of mine.I will be in touch with you increasingly as you bring the physical vehicle intoa greater degree of purity and refinement. You are, in any case, sensitive to myimpression. Move onward into light and find me ever there.~MY BROTHER: August 1946I would ask you at this time to reread the instructions which I gave you last,and to read them in the light of the present circumstances. This is a painfuland rather dreadful testing time for you and—to date—the immediate issue isuncertain, though the final issue is not.The problem with which you are faced falls, in your mind (if you would onlythink clearly), into two parts: the problem of your reaction to the minoritiesquestion, and the problem of your relation to D.R.S. The first problem you saydoes not exist; the second problem you consider entirely the fault of D.R.S.,and therefore, my brother, you stand clear of all blame and responsibility onboth scores. As you are still dwelling in a personality and have not yet takenthe third initiation, such complete innocence is far from likely.What really lies at the root of your reaction? Let me tell you. It is a latent,unsuspected and quite unconscious jealousy. This you will naturally deny, andthis matters not if you will attempt to establish immediate contact with yoursecond ray soul. Look back over your instructions. I have often told you, have Inot, that you need to love more?I have stated the above in order to help you to see and think clearly. Rightdown the years, my beloved brother, I have taught you that your major limitationis your physical body; that necessarily means that your physical brain is acentre of limitation. I have begged you for nearly fifteen years to disciplineyour body, to attempt to refine it and to endeavour to make it more sensitive tospiritual impression. [615] It is on the seventh ray and therefore its task isto relate the inner to the outer. This it cannot yet do properly as you havetaken few steps to refine it and change its quality. Your brain, therefore,responds easily to your first ray mind, and very little as yet to your secondray soul. Had it done so, truth and love would have distinguished you duringthis testing time, and little of these were seen. Your handling of this dualproblem should make clear to you your limitations.It is not my habit to touch upon the relations on the physical plane ofpersonalities; however, this attitude of yours has created an ashramicsituation, because of your relation in the past to the Ashram of K.H. and to thework which it had been planned that you should do as liaison officer standing atthe midway point. A.A.B. has a definite position in K.H.’s Ashram and wouldnormally be the one to act in collaboration with you. The situation is,therefore, changed, and becomes something to be adjusted. It has to be adjustedfrom your side, and herein lies the difficulty.This is enough on this distressing subject. It relates at present only to thislife, but it has its roots in the past, and—unless you clear it up—will have tobe dealt with again by you in a coming incarnation. Again I reiterate, this islargely due to your failure to refine the physical body.You are an earnest disciple, my brother; you are oriented to and serve theHierarchy; you are dedicated and have much, very much, to give. Fit yourself,therefore, for a richer giving. Drop self-pity and the sense of magnanimoussuperiority you have lately been cultivating, and just (how can I put it to youin such a way that I can help?)—just be sorry, truly sorry, for the trouble youhave caused.I am giving you no meditation outline. What you need at this time is a period ofquiet reflection. I asked K.H. if He had any word for you, as He had sensed thesituation, though He has no time for the details. He replied: “Tell R.S.U. tomove the periphery of your Ashram, away from the midway point, and there learntruly to love—and love the little ones.”[616] I can leave you with no better thought at this time, my beloved brother. Iam steadily standing by—as is A.A.B.~MY BROTHER: November 1948You are no longer in my Ashram. I wonder if you have realised this fact? LikeA.A.B. you are back in the Ashram of K. H., understudying—to some extent—A.A.B.so as to free her for work definitely connected with the coming of the Christ.You know that it is the rule in all Ashrams that all senior disciples have thoseassociated with them who can take up the work that they are doing if needarises. When A.A.B. expressed the wish that you train for her work (to be takenup by you in certain aspects though not her work in direct relation with K.H.)the transfer was made. Your present work in . . . provides a fine trainingground for this future work, provided that you lay the constant emphasis uponthe esoteric aspect of all the teaching which you must increasingly give, andlearn yourself always to live in the world of meaning.Last year you passed through a terrific test and it looked for a while as if thetrue significance of it all would escape you; the national thoughtform of anynation is necessarily a powerful entity. You can observe an instance of this inthe thoughtform of the Jews which is the most powerful of all because they arenot a nation in any true sense but an ancient religion; they have resurrectedsomething which has been dead for many, many centuries and are now attempting tocall it a nation. It is as if the ancient Incas and Aztecs suddenly announcedthemselves as nations in South America and sought to gain recognition; they weregreat nations and as civilised as were the Jews, possessing a great andbeautiful religion. There is always trouble when that which should be past andgone seeks recognition along ancient lines, and this is a lesson which theZionists must perforce learn.But you, my beloved brother, belong to no nation; disciples of your standinghave no national allegiances but stand [617] for the One Humanity; this was thebasic lesson which confronted you last year. You learnt the lesson and earnedthe right to undertake advanced work. It is hard for disciples to realise whatof beauty and opportunity lies ahead when confronted with a situation inwhich—at the time—they see no light and which involves the testing of theirmental perception, their emotional reactions and their physical relationships.All these three were involved in last year’s testing and it took some months foryou to see with clarity the trend of events.All that is past and over. Today you stand clear—a disciple who can pass backand forth into all second ray Ashrams, carrying benediction as you go. Theparting of the ways has come for you this life as regards the family with whichyou have been associated through physical birth—with the exception of those fewwho are—perhaps as yet unconsciously to themselves—associated with my Ashram.The members of one’s family upon the physical plane may or may not (in anyparticular incarnation) be also one’s spiritual family. . . . This incarnationhas for you one major lesson: the lesson of standing free from all environinglimitations, whilst steadily giving love where association exists but doing sowith complete detachment. That is the concept or idea behind the apparentlypeculiar episode in the life of the Christ where he repudiated His mother; it isa symbolic story and probably has no basis in fact but it nevertheless carries alesson for all disciples.The lines of your life have fallen for you now into those which your souldesires, for your brother travels with you and you are doing the needed work.Those who bear or have borne the same family name as yourself invoke your lovingsense of responsibility and obligation but only temporarily and only for thislife. Is this a hard saying for you? Think not about it unduly, brother of mine;your next incarnation is necessarily duly arranged, the needed relationsretained and the unneeded discarded.One of the great lessons to be mastered by all disciples and perhaps one of thehardest is that trained recognition [618] which recognises the spiritual familyto which one belongs and this is seldom the same as the earthly family. A.A.B.had to learn that none of her earthly family were related to her and it was notan easy lesson for her, particularly as she had to learn it while quite young.It is a lesson which I am now with deliberation bringing to your notice.Your work lies in training the senior students and for this you are wellequipped and need not to handicap yourself with self-depreciation as A.A.B. hasdone for years. It is, as she has learnt, a form of false humility and a desireto have people realise that you are not proud and so that they will then likeyou. Put it from you, brother of old, and move forward with confidence intofuller service both in this world and in the Ashram of K.H.I indicate to you no meditation work. In the doing of the meditation work of theadvanced group and your presentation of the problems, you bring to them bothlife and substance. That is the service which you can render and one that A.A.B.has quietly rendered for many years. Each group—through its meditation work—musthave its focal point and its energising area and these you must attempt toprovide. This is one of the most deeply esoteric arts. In the Groups of Nine andin the New Seed Group, it was the cause of much difficulty. I myself was thecentral focal point and the energising centre, and my vibratory quality was toopotent for the majority; more than half of those chosen reacted in such a mannerthat they threw themselves out of the group. I may deal with this in greaterdetail when communicating with P.G.C. who has always been deeply interested andconcerned with the causes of the various defections. A handful remain profoundlyattached to the work and to the purpose. Another handful is still in receipt ofthe group instructions but lack dynamic. The rest have moved temporarily to theouter periphery of the Ashram awaiting another life.This, my brother, is all that I have to say to you at this time. My love goeswith you and you may call on me for strength when the pressures of life seem tooheavy. [619]~TO W. D. S.BROTHER OF MINE: August 1940A strenuous winter’s work lies ahead of all disciples who are engaged in ourservice which is, as you have ever been told, pre-eminently the service ofhumanity. This service is intensively preoccupying us at this time and only ingroup formation can it be adequately handled. In spite of this, for some reason,my brother, you stand peculiarly alone. As I realise this, I find myselfwondering in what manner I can bring you to a knowledge of this situation inyour life, for you need to change conditions so that you can become an integralpart of the group life. When I say group , I mean neither your immediate circleof co-workers nor the group of my disciples who are recipients of theseinstructions. I mean the entire group of serving disciples who are at work inthe world and are the hope of the world at this time.Of your desire to serve, of your inherent determination to serve and of thehonesty of your dedication there is no possible doubt. Two factors which almostdefy definition contribute to the fact that esoterically you stand alone,spiritually repulsing contact from the inner side of daily living (andconsequently on the outer side also). It is not your willingness to cooperate,for that is proven; it is not your effort to understand, for that is evident; itis not intrinsically anything which you do which surrounds you as a wall, forthat is really not the trouble. It is the fact that you yourself—as apersonality—have for too long placed yourself in the very centre of your pictureand also because your first ray personality militates against your identifyingyourself with the world of relativity in which you find yourself. Yourpersonality is always in your way. It is never forgotten and conditionseverything you do and say. The realisation of this is not evident in your mindbecause all the time you yourself are the most real factor in the situation andyet—as you would yourself teach people—that personality attitude is the [620]great deceiver and essentially illusion. This condition of personality emphasisgives to other people whom you contact a sense of insincerity and thus evokesfrom them a reaction that leaves you alone. This in its turn evokes a responsefrom your personality which is in the nature of self-defence, plus an effort toforce cooperation, a willingness to go the way that the majority go, to do theexpedient thing and also to attempt to prove to yourself and to others that youare what you know yourself to be and that they are not right in their reactionto you. Having pointed this out to you, is anything really clearer in yourconsciousness? I doubt it, for words—requiring as they do rightinterpretation—can mislead as much as they can help. I might however put it thisway. Your second ray soul and your second ray mind are stepped down inexpression to such an extent that they are expressions of personality love and aloving manifestation (apparently, though not in fact) of a mental attitude. Withthese you delude yourself and make a wrong impression on others for there is noreal expression of truth in any of this. There is also no soul strength in yourexpression of life but only the determination of the personality and this youmisinterpret as strength. This shows itself in various ways, according to thetype of person with you at any given time and does not demonstrate the steadyforce of the soul, centred in spiritual being and illumined by soul light, beingdedicated to group work and not to personality aspiration and personalityambition.What then can you do? I would remind you that one of the things which it is thetask of the Master to demonstrate to His disciple is the particular “blind spot”in his life which it is the purpose of the soul to illumine and bring into thelight of his consciousness, thus dispelling the darkness and the blindness. Thisis done by stimulation and suggestion. The stimulation you have been subjectedto for years and it has had its dual effect in stimulating the personality to ameasured (but inadequate) response to the soul and also by stimulating thepersonality tendencies to fuller expression. These tendencies, when evoked,registered and recognised for what they are and so handled rightly can then beeliminated. [621] The task however becomes more difficult as progress on thePath is made, for the subtler qualities and weaknesses emerge and are not soeasily detected as are the cruder forms of personality reaction. I wouldsuggest, therefore, that you study the weaknesses of your position in connectionwith your fellow-workers and your group brothers and so discover the cause ofyour “aloneness” by registering daily your effect upon people. That means thatyou study them and not yourself. Do you evoke in your friends and associates agood and happy response or the reverse? Do they show a disposition to seek youout and spend much time in your company? Do they tell you their difficulties inhappy discussion and seek your sympathy? How will you discover and be able toanswer these questions? That is for you to find out. I can but indicate, fortruths accepted on the statement of others are of no real service save assignposts on the way and are not often convincing. It is that which you know foryourself, which is self-ascertained and which is found out through pain,failure, suffering and hurt pride which will bring you to liberation and the endof your (as yet) largely unrealised loneliness.Let the strength of your personality and of your emotional nature (which istoday building around you an isolating barrier) be transmuted into that lovingunderstanding which comes because its possessor is identified with others andnot so much with himself. He does not take the attitude: “I am identified withothers” and so watch to see if he is, being at the same time focussed on himselfand his reactions and so seeking to achieve identification because he wants toend isolation because it is wrong, and he seeks to be happier in his work and soin his consciousness. He says to himself instead: “What is my brother feelingand thinking?” and he does this because he is more interested in the happinessof his brother than in his own feelings or thought and so forgets himself inascertaining the situation in order to aid, stimulate and love with wisdom.These, my brother, are the platitudes of the spiritual experience and these arethe platitudinous truths of which you need to make experimental use, thusturning them into the ascertained facets of your daily experience andexpression. More I cannot say to you at this [622] critical time. There is muchthat you can do in the work if you will face yourself by forgetting yourself; ifyou will be strong by rendering the personality weak; if you learn to love bynot caring whether you evoke love or not. Such are the occult paradoxes whichyou must resolve and which—when resolved—will greatly increase youreffectiveness in service.If you care to talk to A.A.B. who is an older disciple than you are, you mightfind it suggestive and useful. But A.A.B. begs me not to suggest this and addsthat she knows that a hint from me is worth more than a multitude of words fromher or from anyone else. She will not speak of this matter to you or even makean opening for this discussion; but if you speak to her and seek light upon mywords, she will do what she can.One of your group brothers asked a rather lengthy question which I should liketo answer here, for it has psychological implications which may be useful toyou. His question was as follows:“What precisely is the relation between thought and emotion? Can thought be bestdescribed as sublimated emotion? Do not our thoughts, however remotely, ariseout of our feelings, past as well as present? As reflecting past emotionalreactions, may not thoughts be described as ‘fossil feelings’? In theconnotation of the present, are not our thoughts but our finer feelings? Doesnot the mental grow out of the refinement of the emotional body?“In this sense, the evolutionary, is not the emotional body itself but asublimation of the etheric, as that in turn is but the sublimation of theinorganic chemical? As we progress on the Path of Return, do we not butsuccessively ‘gather up our bodies within us,’ raising each into the Light ofthe next one above, and is not this the meaning of culture, education,refinement, purification? Is not that the personal work we should constantly beat, and is it not what is symbolised, in Roman Catholic Doctrine, by theAssumption by the Christ of the body of the Virgin Mary, His Mother, intoHeaven?” [623]My reply to him is:In the above enquiry, my brother, you have asked nine questions, all bearing onthe same subject. Some of them would not have needed a reply had you had thetime to study A Treatise on Cosmic Fire, for in that book much of your questionis answered.The difficulty in distinguishing between thought and emotion is due entirely totwo things:1. The point in evolution of the Observer, which determines very largely thefield of his observation and the focus of his directed attention.2. The present status of the human race. Most of humanity is not, at present,thinking but is actively feeling.The quality of mind, which is primarily discrimination, is largely lacking inthe bulk of mankind. The quality of emotion is however becoming understood asthe mind develops. It is the result of a measure of discrimination which enablesthe Observer to realise that he is undergoing an emotion, or passing through anemotional crisis. This emotion is, in its turn, the result of sensoryperception. There can be much feeling reaction without emotion. There can be noemotion, as a result of feeling, without some measure of mental unfoldment andof thought being present. Therefore, the relation between thought and feeling iscalled by us emotion. Your question is therefore answered by saying, in a largeand general way, that feeling can be (and frequently is) present where there isno thought at all. But when thought enters in, then the result of the interplaybetween thought and feeling is the production of emotion.We pass on then to your second question where you seek to describe thought as“sublimated emotion.” Here you are putting the cart before the horse, as thesaying is. Thought is the medium whereby emotion can be sublimated. It isfeeling without thought which has produced the world of illusion, of glamour,and of delusion. It is thought, with its [624] discriminating and analysingfaculty which makes us aware of this maya in which we are ceaselessly walking.Thought throws a clear light into the fog and mists of the astral plane. Astralenergy—the energy of sensitive feeling reaction—has for millions of ages beenthrown into activity by all the forms of life in all the kingdoms of nature.This has produced the world illusion. Only in the human family, however, is itseen for what it is, and the power of thought and the white light of the mindbegin to play upon the matter of that plane, producing emotion, but the emotionis an astral condition recognised by the mind and later seen to be one of theeffects of the steadily growing mind power of the race.This is the thought underlying the phrase found so often in the theosophicalbooks, kama-manas—desire-mind—for all feeling-emotion inevitably evokes desire.If the emotion evoked by the mind’s recognition of the feeling (registered inthe astral body) is pleasurable, then desire is evoked for the continuance orthe repetition of the experience. If it is not pleasurable, but painful, thenthe reaction is desire for the cessation of the experience and thereforeliberation from it. This is the basic human desire, leading to desire forliberation (in the first and earliest instance) from the womb into life on thephysical plane, on and up to that great and final desire which is for liberationinto life itself. This thought leads us into the world of the most technicalesoteric psychology.It is very difficult for the beginner to grasp the basic differentiations whichhe has welded into unities through his innate capacity to identify himselfsequentially with that which is revealed. Feeling and mind are, for theindividual, the two basic differentiations in time and space. That which isregistered in the interplay between the two is emotion and, later, thought. Butthought is a later realisation and reveals emotion; it is not however emotion.It discovers feeling with which the soul has consistently identified itself foraeons, and—if I may so express it—it is the turning of the searchlight of theslowly developing mind into the world of feeling, of glamour and of illusionwhich reveals man’s reaction [625] to it all, and this we call emotion . In adeeply and truly esoteric sense, it is the intuition which is sublimatedemotion, and not the mind.Therefore, in answering your third question, I would say that thoughts do notarise out of our feelings, but that when the mind begins to be active, ourfeelings stand revealed and the result of that revelation we call emotion.Thoughts, again, are not “fossilised feelings,” but emotions which can beregistered by the image-making faculty of the mind, and the thoughtforms thuscreated (embodying the mind’s reaction to the world of feeling) can be sopowerful that they can persist in the treasure-house of the memory and can beconstantly revitalised by a recurring emotion. It is the mind’s activity inrelation to feeling or to the range of feelings which reveals emotion. In thepresent time when the average human being and the average aspirant cannotdistinguish accurately between mind, emotion, feeling and the thoughtforms whichmemory guards, it is impossible for a clear line of demarcation to be drawn. Butthis is owing simply to the point of evolution of the race. Such lines anddifferentiations can be drawn clearly by the developed disciple and theinitiate. He then discovers that thoughts are the product of the principle ofintelligence, dealing with life and enabling a man to say: I am not my body. Iam not my feeling apparatus. I am not that which is developed through theinterplay between myself and my environment. I am something other than all this.I am.In connection with the sixth part of your question, my brother, you haveforgotten your technical occultism and the ancient teaching anent theinvolutionary arc, wherein the various bodies and forms are created by thedescending, involving Spirit, and the consciousness appropriated in a greatmoment of crisis, when each kingdom in nature came into being. The mind existsand needs to be consciously used. Few are yet aware of that quality in matterwhich is called the mind. But, as on the involutionary arc Spirit created as itdescended, and appropriates as it reascends, so each appropriation marks a newpoint upon the Path of Return and so the Eternal Pilgrim, the soul, does thesame in a lesser [626] way. On the path into physical manifestation, the bodiesor forms are built. On the Path of Return, they are appropriated and used, andthe consciousness of their use steadily grows. For the evolved human being, thegoal is a clear and conscious appropriation of that which has been built and itsuse in the service of the Plan.Forget not that all aspects or externalisations which the soul uses and throughwhich it expresses itself are constituent parts of the vehicle of expression ofthe One in Whom we live and move and have our being. Therefore we appropriatethat which we earlier “earmarked” (if I may use that ancient phrase in itsdeepest and truest occult significance) on the Path of Descent. We learn to useit consciously. We hear its note as we descend; we see it as we ascend. Weidentify ourselves with the form as its sound reaches us during the process ofinvolution. We distinguish it on the evolutionary arc, and when the stagewherein we identify ourselves with form begins to die out, we then “see” it andenter the stage of duality.Yes, my brother, we do indeed raise our bodies into heaven, but the raisingtakes place within the realm of conscious effort, for when the distinctions ofthe lower mind fade out, and the work—the necessary work—of discovery and ofdifferentiation has played its part in teaching us the lesson of desirelessness,we find that the form and consciousness are one, the light is one , and theenergy is one. But we find also that “one star differeth from another star inglory” because there is One Flame but many sparks of differing brightness withinthat Flame. Such is the glory of the great Eternal One. This realisation is thesoul’s aspiration and the goal of its great enlightenment. It is, as you rightlypoint out when viewing the subject from the angle of mother-matter, theassumption of the Virgin into Heaven, there to be glorified. Much of the mysteryconnected with “the three vestures of the Buddha” is related to thisglorification of the three bodies. Much can be learnt by a careful study of theconnection between the three bodies of a human being and the vestures orvehicles of the Lord Buddha. The whole story of Sublimation, of Purification,and of Transfiguration is hidden [627] in this relationship. The correspondencesremain, however, to be pointed out. It is a task that has not yet been done.Let me now return to your own specific instructions. I am going to give you noset meditation form to follow. I am however going to give you something to dowhich, if successfully done, may bring you release.Seek each day for ten minutes to get into touch spiritually, mentally andemotionally with one or other of your group brothers. Take each of them onsuccessive days. Seek to establish a definite rapport and pour out love andhelp. Forget yourself in so doing and drive out of your consciousness therealisation that you are an emanating centre of force. Ponder upon thecircumstances of their lives as you may know them; try to comprehend theirproblems of time, character and of aspiration. Write to them, if you care to doso, and try to get them to help you. Let them draw from you the very essence ofspiritual service, which means that they will draw from your soul that whichthey need; in giving thus, you will be enriched yourself.My blessing rests upon you, my brother.~August 19421. At the centre of a great tornado is a point of peace. Thus does the story go.It can be found. And thus it is with all the storms of life. They lead to peaceif you are not a leaf.2. Hold to your old established links and with your brothers walk. Walk as agroup upon the Lighted Way. The chain of Hierarchy firmly stands.3. The light that streams from out my Ashram is a part of the Lighted Way and onthat thread of light you move and with you move your brothers.4. Loneliness—such as you think you know—is but a glamour, brother of mine. Youare not alone. But loneliness such as you can know is a light that lights thedarkness. Seek that out.5. Upon the pinnacle of loneliness is the sole peace where truth is known. Standon that pinnacle. [628]6. And when the truth is clearly seen (blowing away the cobwebs and the dust oflower life) then can your service carry fresh truth to men.~MY BROTHER: September 1943I have watched with interest as you have made many drastic adjustments in yourlife during the past two years. I have noted the increased strength of yourspiritual links with your own soul, with the Ashram and with me, your Master andyour constant friend. Of this you may not be constantly or inspiringly aware,but you have done one surprising thing—surprising because it is not usual. Youhave made these drastic adjustments without losing temporarily any ground. Thisis a thing rare indeed. Usually during these basic life changes, and duringperiods wherein the pattern of a daily life is altered, there is a temporaryloss of time and of ground. It is seldom permanent but it usually exists for ashort time until the new arrangements and adjustments have been regimented intorhythm, and then the threads are picked up, the old spiritual habits arereinstated, and the disciple again proceeds upon his way. This has not, however,happened to you. You seem to have gone steadily on, with no great or vitallyimportant spiritual experience but with a pronounced stability. This shouldindicate to you something of importance. It means that you have reached thatpoint upon the Path of Discipleship where you need no longer ask yourself if youare going to fail as far as a steady and undeviating moving forward isconcerned. You may and will fail on details, techniques and methods; you may errin understanding or in prompt reaction to spiritual opportunity. That isinevitable, and the method whereby a disciple learns. But you will not fail ingoing on; for you there will be no turning back nor any real tendency to doso—only moments of unutterable fatigue when temptation may appear, but to it youwill pay no attention.I wonder if you can realise, my brother, what this means to the Master who has adisciple under training and guidance. [629] It means that one possible dangercan be definitely discounted and that along one line at least He can feel sureof His disciple. He need no longer question his staying power; He knows that itis good and that the disciple will take what is coming to him withsteadfastness.As you move forward you must, for the next twelve months, come to a clearunderstanding of my injunction to you, given earlier, to “seek the pinnacle ofloneliness which is the sole place whereon truth can be known.” This is aninjunction to increase your capacity to withdraw into the focussed point in theillumined mind where no one else can accompany you, and there await the arrivalof the truth—that particular truth which your personality demands from your souland which you feel—at any given time—it is essential that you grasp if yourservice and your progress are to be properly furthered. This demand, based on asensed need, will vary from year to year, but there will always be some truth,some aspect of understanding and some immediate revelation which you know (pastall controversy and discussion) that you must grasp and know if you are to moveforward as desired—by your soul and by your Master.At this particular time what is that immediately needed truth, information andrevelation which you must have? It is not for me to tell you, even though Iknow. It is in the formulating of that need and that requirement that yourprogress will be made. I would ask you, on receipt of this instruction, todetermine in your mind, upon quiet reflection, what is your one immediatespiritual need. Then seek the pinnacle of truth within yourself and there awaitthe revelation. It will inevitably come if you care enough and have adequatepatience.The past two years have been preparatory years for you, even if you do not yetknow for what ends they are the preparation. They have taught you much. But hereI would remind you that all the teaching, training and experience which you haveundergone has now to be brought to a point of synthesis within the illuminedmind; it then becomes a potent seed thought, capable of bringing much intuitiveperception and later revelation.[630] Will you therefore do the following things and follow the procedureoutlined below:1. Summarise in your own consciousness, and in the light of your soul, thenature and purpose of the experiences and changes to which you have beensubjected. Endeavour to see the big sweep of the intention and be notpreoccupied with the detail. Formulate to yourself in clear concise sentencesyour conclusions, so that the lessons of the past can stand revealed to you.2. Determine then within yourself what is the next needed truth, type ofrevelation or requirement which will enable you to move forward with increasedpotency, clearer vision and truer insight. This will not be as easy as itsounds, because this next truth must relate the past to the future of service,as you see that service.3. Then with these two lines of thought held quietly and clearly in your mind,seek that “pinnacle of loneliness” which is to be found if due search is made.There the desired truth and revelation can be expected and awaited. Then wait.4. When your intuition begins to move and your patient waiting, quiet reflectionand steady mental poise bring their reward of clarified perception, thenendeavour to apply the recognised truth and the germ of the revelation to thepractical affairs of living. You will then find taking place a steady enrichmentof your entire life.This will constitute a richly rewarding exercise and—could you but graspit—constitutes a definitely advanced form of meditation. You will find thismeditation project a most interesting experiment.Another thing, my brother. This war period will not last indefinitely. Alreadythe end is in sight, and for its termination you must be prepared. This is notonly worldly practical wisdom but also spiritual prevision. Your work in myAshram must some day be more definitely an aspect of my work [631] in the outerworld than it now necessarily is; I would have you ponder upon what you can do.Disciples in all Ashrams (and mine is no exception) are pledged to the work oftheir Ashram, and this you have always known. E’en though it is true that allwork is spiritual, given right motive and intention, yet disciples aredefinitely pledged to certain hierarchical forms of service which must takeprecedence in all life activities even whilst—at the same time—the disciplefulfils his other tasks in the outer world, based on his right obligations andresponsibilities and upon his citizenship. Have this definitely in mind, andremember that I need the assistance of this entire group within my Ashram. Ialso need their individual cooperation and understanding of the problems to bemet. It is permitted to me to give a general call and to state specificprinciples and lines of activity which should govern the work of my disciples.It is not permitted for me to say when or where that service must be rendered.The group work and the four stages of reflection which I have outlined for youwill suffice for your spiritual enterprise at this time. These and the work youare doing in your present field of labour present adequate opportunity forliving and progress. My love and blessing are yours and upon that you can count.~November 1944There is within your consciousness at this time, a major question. You have beentaught by your soul to question; you have absorbed the injunction that a Masterarrives at His goal through a process of questioning and of finding, alone andwithout any outer aid, the answer. With you, this is a fixed belief andunderstanding, and that is good. The question in your mind which still lacks ananswer is evoked by my statement in the last instruction I gave you that thework of the Ashram is ever the prime obligation of the disciple.Necessarily, this work varies according to the status of the disciple and hisplace within the Ashram. I have given you (in various group instructions) thestages of discipleship. [632] These were stages within the consciousness of thedisciple and concerned his relation to the Master. They detailed his progressfrom a rare contact to a position close to the Master. It is of value now to addto these individual steps those which concern a disciple’s position within theAshram, and this from the angle of his ashramic duty and service. This is adifferent matter, and though related to the interplay between him and hisMaster, these stages are concerned with action and with the results of hisexpanding consciousness within the hierarchical awareness; they are related tohis perception of truth as response to the Master’s radiation evokes in himcertain developments, stimulates certain qualities and new characteristics, andbrings to his mind enlightenment.These stages in service and in recognition of duty and obligation are related tostatus more than to soul growth and control, though this growth is one of thedetermining factors as regards his position in the Ashram. Let me enumeratethem, leaving you to place yourself in the category of servers to which youbelong, and leaving you also to demonstrate to the world the nature of yourashramic position. I will give you the esoteric names and symbols of thisdifferentiation:1. The stage of the “awakening urge.” Of this stage, the half-opened eye is thesymbol. The neophyte, just admitted into the Ashram, becomes (as the Book ofInstructions for Neophytes expresses it) “the victim of a dual sight. With theright eye he sees a shaded way into the central Ashram; from point to point,from light to dark and dark to light as the pillars point the way, he sees anarrow corridor and at the end a room; within that room the passing figure ofthe Master appears and disappears. With the left eye, a world of mist and fog,of gloom and shadowy forms is seen—a land of woe and dire distress, with lightand shadow moving back and forth. From within that gloomy land a cry comesforth: We need your aid. We cannot see. Come hither with the light.” In thesephrases is embodied the first reaction of the new disciple to the dual life to[633] which his admission to the Ashram has committed him—the life of ashramicinstruction and of steady approach to the Master, plus the life of outer servicewhich must come as a response to need and not as a fulfilment of an enjoinedduty. He sees in neither direction with clarity. Remember ever that approach andservice must be self-initiated and self-implemented. The only help which thedisciple gets at this stage comes from the stimulating effect of the aura of theAshram.2. The stage of “advance.” By this I do not refer to progress in understanding.That is inevitable in time and incidental in space when the disciple isimmovable in his determination. I refer to the process of his moving forward(technically understood) along the pillared corridor, simultaneously with hisappearance in the outer world as an ashramic worker. You have a phrase which isusually employed in a derogatory sense of “social climber”; it refers to aperson who—dissatisfied with his social position, his social contacts and hissocial relationships—uses every and any method to penetrate into those socialmilieus which have seemed unattainable. It is a platitude to say that allunworthy goals (because incorrectly motivated) are the lower correspondence orsymbolic expressions (e’en though distorted) of higher aims and aspirations.This thought should clarify your thinking. A disciple at this stage is a manwhose character and capacities have permitted him to enter the Ashram with thefull consent of its membership. He hovers, however, on the periphery of itsactivities; he knows that here are action, contacts and relationships—within theashramic ring-pass-not—which can be his some day. Yet he also knows that he hasto master the meaning of the paradoxical statement with which his voicedaspiration was met: “Go out the door and leave the Ashram as it was and as youare; seek for another entrance; find what you seek by leaving it behind; moveforward through the art of moving back.”In the blazing light of the Ashram the disciple realises that he has not yetearned the right to pass along the corridor to the Master’s sanctum, but mustneeds go forth [634] into the world of men, of darkness and of pain; then he canreturn to the Ashram for strength to continue his work outside. What liesoutside the door of the Ashram, symbolically speaking, becomes to him of greatermoment than his own success in passing along the corridor. What has happened tohim, as both his eyes “function in the dual light,” is that his sense of valuesis adjusted and his own progressive satisfaction becomes of less importance tohim than what he can do to ameliorate the pain and distress outside the door.3. The stage of “leaving each pillar behind its own shadow.” Is it only a truismto point out that as service proceeds, and the effectiveness of that serviceincreases, the disciple when he enters the door of the Ashram, discovers he isno longer standing upon the inner side of the door but has already penetrated adefinite distance along the corridor? Certain pillars are left behind. One ofthe Masters—using the word in its correct sense—has called these symbolicpillars the “pillars of propriety,” meaning that each pillar passed indicatesthe attainment of certain aspects of appropriate conduct. When these aspects ofbehaviour are developed, the disciple can pass up and down the corridor at will,which symbolises to him the, as yet, undeveloped phase of ashramic conduct.These pillars embody the final phase of illusion—those illusions which bewilderthe disciple but have no effect on anyone outside the Ashram. These you mustdiscover for yourself. There are five more pillars which you must develop theability to pass before you have the complete freedom of the Ashram. You havealready learnt to pass seven of them and they, for you, are now non-existent.4. The stage of the “withdrawing alcove.” I have to put these aspects ofconsciousness into material symbolic forms so as to bring pictorially to yourattention the phases of approach which you and all disciples must follow. Thepillars (again symbolically) no longer stand on either side of your way ofapproach. Though there for others, for you they constitute no longer anyconcern. The way stretches clear before you. The hope of free admittance intothe [635] room where the Master works is a present possibility. But within theAshram, protecting the seclusion of the Master, is the antechamber to the placewhere He works and in that antechamber His senior disciple presides. Thisdisciple protects the Master from undue disturbance, is responsible for the careof His physical vehicle when He goes into “samadhi,” has the right to interruptHim in moments of emergency, and can be trusted to pass in and out of His study,whenever he deems it desirable. This arrangement requires the advancing discipleto recognise the senior disciple; it is this process of recognition which oftconstitutes the final test, prior to being allowed through the inner door.5. The stage to which is given the name “the right of entry.” When this stage isreached, the disciple can come and go as his soul and the need of his service inthe outer world may dictate. He has developed the sensitivity to know when, orwhen not, he may intrude into the presence of the Master. He finds, when he hasarrived at this point, that all desire to contact the Master for his ownsatisfaction or help has left him. One thing only sends him on the wings oflight along the corridor and strengthens his hand to open wide the door, andthat is world need.You will discover, my brother, under these symbols the lesson which I am seekingto convey to you. I enjoined you in my last instruction to realise the need ofachieving a pinnacle of loneliness, for on that pinnacle lies for you that whichyou need. What that is, you must find out for yourself. Have you learntsomething anent this lonely spot? If so, the next development for you mayinvolve (I did not say “would”) the lonely moments spent as you, from pillar topillar, advance along the corridor, spurred by the needs of those you seek toserve. Then will come the moment when the senior disciple will symbolise for youthe end of loneliness and greet you as a brother. What takes place later betweenyou and the Master is your own individual secret, shared with Him.One point I seek to emphasise to you at this time is the [636] need for you torecognise more definitely that the way into the inner sanctum is the way ofouter service. This service must not be motivated by the exigencies of theperiod, or by financial considerations or the behests of the personality. It mayor may not include the place where your outer work is being done; it maynecessitate a change in your setting and circumstances, but the disciple—if trueto his soul and the Ashram—serves his fellowmen as an esotericist as well as ahumanitarian and a psychologist. This is a point which you must grasp. You mustthen fit the tasks assumed and undertaken into the symbolic picture which I havegiven you. I count upon your understanding because I am not speaking idle words;I count also upon your giving consideration and quiet reflection to my nextstatement.There is some definite work planned by me which must be implemented by themembers of my Ashram; it is work which you can undertake. It is related to themajor task of goodwill which is so close to my heart; it will necessitatesacrifice upon your part and maybe a relinquishing of lesser goals. Ifrecognised by you, it will mean that the “pillars which guard the approach tothe sanctum” of your Master can be left behind; you will have reached the pointwhere you can enter the “room of withdrawal.” Again I speak to you in symbols.You are nearly sixty years old, my brother. The sixty-third year of your life,as in the life of all disciples, will be one of crisis and of supremeopportunity, and towards that point you should look and for it you should makepreparation. The interim should be a time wherein you pass the pillars, whereinyou go from point to point with your consciousness held steady within the Ashramand your personality activity adhering to the task imposed by your soul.A basic decision will shortly confront you, and upon that decision will dependyour right of entry, technically understood. I may not even indicate to you thenature of the coming crisis, nor may I give you any hint as to what yourdecision should be. I have, however, confidence in you, for you have learnt muchin the past five years; you have gone from strength to strength and have passedfrom pillar to pillar, even if you did not realise it. You will discover the[637] quality of your strength when the need for decision confronts you. I awaityou in the inner room.~August 1946I have nothing to say to you today, my brother, of major moment. My lastinstruction to you was long and of vital importance; you have not yet absorbedits full significance. In that instruction there were two sentences which I seekagain to emphasise in your consciousness. They are:1. The way into the inner sanctum is the way of outer service.2. The sixty-third year of your life—as in the life of all disciples—will be oneof crisis and of supreme opportunity.These two statements are closely related. Crises, my brother, can be objectiveor subjective; they can take place on the physical plane, and are then not ofsuch great significance from the spiritual angle, even though they cause muchsuffering and pain to the personality: they can emerge into consciousness on theemotional or the mental planes, and they then present opportunity for action,but mostly for action connected with the personality; or they can be the resultof soul intent, registered by the personality and recorded in the brain. Theyare then of supreme importance, but very frequently remain unrecognised unlessthe disciple is very alert and constantly aware of the cyclic flow of spiritualenergy.Such a crisis confronts you. Has your spiritual sensitivity increased during thepast few years so that you can be sure that you can recognise the crisis for theopportunity it is, when confronted by it? Here are the points I would have youconsider, for upon your recognitions and your decisions rests much of theusefulness of the rest of your life—that is, from the angle of the Ashram.There is a peculiar difficulty connected with the realisation that there arerelatively only a few years ahead for the [638] majority of the group. Here arefour of the difficulties which prevent the sensible and happy realisation of thefuture transition:1. The tendency to settle down and take the position that one has done the bestone can and that that is all one can be expected to do. This renders the fewremaining years simply an expression of habit and of established character, andprevents the undertaking of any new spiritual adventure.2. A recognition that one has reached one’s high water mark for this life andnothing more can be expected. This may be true from the personality angle, butthe soul remains eternally young and unsatisfied, knowing no static point.3. A preoccupation, growing year by year, with the processes of growing old,with its liabilities, its physical symptoms and ugliness, and its required (?)withdrawals. This is a usual and ordinary way of approaching one’s decliningyears and the regular procedure with the great majority. See that it is notyours as the next decade elapses.4. The recognition that the soul, enjoying the full richness of life’s garneredexperience, is now free to serve. No new problems are tackled; no newdisciplines are applied; but the disciple uses all that he has in the service ofthe Ashram, and that for the remainder of his life.I am seeking to bring all these points to your consideration, for they embodychoices which await you, and it is your right to know what they are. I will makeno further comment beyond emphasising that there is a definite and consciouschoice to be made, and leaving you free to think the matter through.You have in the past done much to help the work I planned. You are today amongthose interested in discovering their spiritual enterprise. Discover it, mybrother, and have an enterprise which will count in the realisation (I use [639]not the word manifestation) of the Kingdom of God on Earth. Be interested anewand alertly in the hierarchical plans, and fit yourself into the time scheduleof my ashramic purposes. Adjust your sense of values, which have shiftedconsiderably lately (I say not whether for good or not, for that is youraffair), and make your life count in the hour of humanity’s need.I have the following suggestions to make as regards your meditation work:1. Orient yourself dynamically towards the Ashram and towards me, your Master,and ponder for a while upon your relationship with me and its variousimplications.2. Orient yourself towards the spiritual enterprises (for there are several)which emanate from the Ashram, under my direction, and reflect upon yourresponsibility to them.3. Orient yourself to your chosen daily work and consider where opportunitythere arises which can be fitted into the spiritual vision which all disciplescarry with them.4. Orient yourself to your own soul and consider what are the duties andresponsibilities and relations of that soul in all the three worlds ofexperience.5. Then sound the OM three times in order to clarify the mind; quiet allemotional reaction and endeavour to make your brain receptive to the higherspiritual impression.6. Then in your own words, and as the soul, speak to me and discuss with me yourlife and spiritual intention. I shall not respond, but (bear this in mind)record will be made of that which has the power to penetrate into the Ashram.7. Say the New Invocation, sounding the OM after each stanza.8. Close your meditation by saying—as the personality and with emphasis—”May Ido my whole duty as I journey towards Thy sacred feet.”[640] You have known me for many, many years now, my brother. I remain the sameand unaltered; therefore my love, strength and understanding are factors uponwhich you can at all times assuredly count.~TO E. E. S.BROTHER OF OLD AND CO-WORKER: August 1940This year and in fact during the past three years, many problems have arisen inyour life and these have been complicated by the fact that the physical vehicleis not functioning as it should. With that condition you must learn to live,treating it with due wisdom and at the same time ignoring it in the service ofhumanity and in ours. One attitude infers right physical care; the otherattitude sets the note for the mental reaction. This I think you know and areworking successfully towards this way of living. I mention it because one of thethings all disciples have to achieve (prior to initiation) is a right mentalattitude toward that aspect of the physical body which is not regarded as aprinciple and which is only the automaton of the inflowing forces and of theinner man. The energy which governs the physical body emanates from that aspector integrated aspects where lies the focus of consciousness. Perfect health willcome, therefore, when the focus of consciousness is permanently in the soul.This is not possible for any of you at present because of the point in evolutionand because of the mass relation and the mass karma, superimposed upon theindividual karma.You are handling the situation adequately, my brother, and where there could bean imposed expression of soul life, you need not for me to tell you, for you areaware of your own limitations and of your own weaknesses. Your first rayphysical body is of service to you in many ways. See to it that the tendency ofthe first ray to withdraw from contact to the isolated aloofness of the firstray does not unduly condition you upon the physical plane. You will know to whattendency [641] I refer. Your whole life goal at this time is to give lovingstrength to others through tapping the source of all love yourself. There arethose you can aid. You will do so at this time through giving them increasedloving understanding.As regards certain problems of activity known to you, I would encourage you topersevere with much caution and wariness. The early stages of the work you areseeking to do are fraught with some danger, as again you know. Thesedifficulties, if successfully surmounted, will lead to greatly minimising otherrisks later in your planned work. A.A.B. will talk with you about this matter ifyou so wish, and will convey to you my suggestions whenever you want them. Ihave spoken to her and made them known, hence the brevity of my communication toyou at this time. You will comprehend.I have however a meditation which I would ask you to follow and to do sodynamically. By that I mean: Become simply a point of concentration when doingit, with all personal problems and conditions temporarily obliterated from yourconsciousness. To produce this concentration, I will give you a breathingexercise with the meditation.1. Relax and turn the eyeballs upward. The Hindu system of rolling up theeyeballs does aid in this matter, and the point where the quivering of theeyelids ceases or is forgotten indicates the point of relative physical poise.2. Take seven long breaths, slowly and without strain and as you do so visualiseyourself as mounting higher and higher with each breath. To do this the moreeasily, picture yourself as mounting seven steep steps.3. Then, at your highest point, sound the OM, retaining its force in the head byan act of the will but without any strain or pressure. The retention of energyis not a physical matter but a mental process. This is a subject of importance.4. Then, holding the consciousness as high in the head as possible, see how longyou can achieve the position of listening without becoming negative or losingthe [642] recollection of who you are or what you are doing. Never relinquish inthis work the sense of personal identity. Until I give you permission, do nothold this listening attitude for more than three minutes.5. Then breathe out the OM through the ajna centre, the centre between theeyebrows, and say:I choose the way of the interpreter, and therefore ask for light.I choose the way of loving guidance, and therefore ask for lifting power.I choose the way of inspiration, and therefore ask for flowing life.I choose the way of integrating, and therefore ask for the seal of silence.6. Then sound the OM seven times and proceed with the group meditation.These phrases have each three esoteric meanings. Take one of the above sentenceseach for one month and then repeat the process of reflection twice, thuscovering a year’s work. See if you can arrive at deeper significances than thosewhich appear on the surface.NOTE: This final instruction to this disciple follows immediately upon the onewhich is concluded in Vol. I, page 649, and the footnote there still applies.~TO D. P. R.January 1940Life has been so difficult for you, brother of mine, that I hesitate (because Ihave an understanding of much that you are enduring) to lay upon you any furtherburden of self-discipline or more of the life of introspection. You have stoodin the midst of your world and watched it come down, crashing around you; youhave stood as a tower of strength to those who are tied to you in the closestlinks and have not [643] failed them; you have preserved your values clearwhilst seeing the material values dissolve into thin air. That you still have afew personal glamours and are still taken in by your own high grade reactions tocircumstance and people is of course true but I question whether anything is tobe gained through your focussing your attention upon them at this time.Stand steady, therefore, and be not unduly distressed. Avoid at least oneglamour and that is the glamour that it is your task to shoulder allresponsibilities and make all final decisions. Leave people, brother of old, theopportunity which you yourself so much welcome, of learning the needed lessons.Seek not unduly to lift and shield, for the shielding mother-complex is initself a glamour.My love and strength is at your service.~MY BROTHER: August 1940One of the outstanding characteristics of the pledged disciple is that he learnsto stand steady and unmoving no matter what may be happening to him or aroundhim. Much is happening to disciples these days for they bear the brunt of theworld’s cataclysm. You may perhaps find this an astonishing statement but Iwould ask you to remember that they meet the prevalent conditions on all threeplanes simultaneously and are at the same time endeavouring to live as souls.The accuracy of my statement is, therefore, apparent if you will ponder for afew minutes on the implications. There is appalling suffering everywhere.Physically and emotionally, people throughout the world are handling the maximumof pain. The accepted disciple, however, is suffering also mentally and to thismust be added his capacity to identify himself with the whole; his trainedimagination also presents special difficulty for he can include possibilitieswhich others may not envisage, and his sweep or grasp of the plan is presumablygreater; he is also endeavouring to apply his knowledge of this plan to theimmediate environing [644] situation and is strenuously attempting to understandand at the same time to interpret to others, no matter what he may be undergoingin his own personal life.In many cases, such as yours, environing conditions and chosen associates tendto complicate matters and you are, therefore, today facing your major lifecrisis and, I would add, you are facing it satisfactorily.There are many types of crisis in the lives of all aspirants, but in the case ofthose who are pledged disciples there are always two major crises in theirlives: There is first of all the crisis of opportunity and its wise recognition.At some time, every disciple is faced with some determining choice which leadseventually to the distinctive nature of his life service. This usually takesplace between the ages of twenty-five and forty, usually around the age ofthirty-five. I refer not here to the choice which every able bodied and sane manhas to take when he determines his life work, his place of living and his lifeassociates. I refer to a free choice made when these other lesser choices havebeen made. Such a choice came to you in your earlier years. This crisis ofopportunity relates ever to life service. This is true in spite of karma orenvironing conditions. It is not a choice of the personality, based uponexpedient or earthly motives, necessity or anything else. It is a choice basedupon the relation of the soul to the personality and only confronts disciples .The second crisis is the crisis of expression. This usually comes towards thelater years of a disciple’s life. It concerns his stabilised life tendency andputs to the test all that he believes and for which he has stood and foughtthroughout his life experience. It is ever a hard and bitter test, going to thevery roots of his life, and for those in preparation for initiation it ispeculiarly acute. The conditions of the test may apparently seem no worse thanthe tests and difficulties which assault other people but, as I have pointed outabove, they have to be met on all planes at once. Soul energy is ever involvedthereby and this intensifies the response of each individual body in the lowerman and also the personality as a whole, the integrated man. The stage ofresponsiveness which every disciple has achieved in relation to his environment,[645] his associates and his service greatly aggravates his difficulties. I amexplaining this somewhat in detail as I am anxious to have you comprehend thenature of your problem and so be able to handle it with increased poise,understanding and triumph. Behind you lies a crisis of opportunity; you met itwell. Today you face your crisis of expression and you will come through; truetriumph is dependent upon specific achievement upon the inner planes and uponwresting the true values out of any situation, and of these, values based uponthe physical plane are by far the least important.If you will, all of you, study the instructions given by me to the individualmembers of the group and to the group itself, you will find that I am giving youdefinite instructions in the Way of Initiation. Your response and your searchlies, however, in the field of esoteric recognition more than in the field ofthe reception of new facts. So much has been given out in the past few years anddecades anent initiation; it has largely been made exoterically, and receivedexoterically and the true import of the teaching has been veiled. My task withyou is not so much the impartation of new facts, truths, points of view andinterest, but the awakening into reality of that which your mind already hasreceived as theory and hypothesis.You stand today, my brother, at a major point of crisis and you stand alone.Those in your immediate environment are of no special service to you for theyare not yet upon the path of discipleship. They are in the earliest stages ofthe path of probation and are unaware of it also. You have, therefore, onlythree sources of strength:1. First and foremost, your contact with your own soul through meditation,reflection and joy.2. Your contact with me, your Master, because through me some of the strength ofthe world of souls and of the Hierarchy can reach you.3. Your group brothers in this new seed group.I would like to point out that in these three contacts you have the threeaspects of divine expression appearing—from [646] the angle of stimulation andof vitalising power—and so three types of power are made available. Beginningwith the lowest contact, your group brothers, you have the intelligent activityand consequent stimulation upon the physical plane of your contact with them;through your soul contact, the love aspect of divinity can be made manifest inyou; and through your hierarchical contact, the will of God can pour into you.Thus all the three aspects of the divine nature can pour into you and meet withresponse from the three aspects of your lower manifested expression; thus youcan become subservient to the divine. Ponder on this and seek to establish thesecontacts firmly and upon sound non-emotional lines.You have a particularly interesting group of life forces or energiesconditioning you, interesting because of the specific combination. The savinggrace of your life expression has been your second ray astral body because thecombination of a first ray soul, a fifth ray personality and a third rayphysical expression might have resulted in a hard, concrete materialisticperson. These rays are the ones which have produced what is called the Prussiantype of mind. Incidentally, this ray combination produced your karmicrelationships in this life. Fortunately for you, your past immediate incarnationas a personality was overwhelmingly second ray and of this you brought over asecond ray astral nature and a fourth ray mental equipment. Hence the balancingin two directions and hence also the general trend of your life conditioning.It was your first ray lines of force which placed you in the particular localityin which you live and brought your life partner to you. It was your second raybackground and its effects in your present life expression which hastened youraffiliation with myself and brought to you your particular group of brothers inthe new seed group. This information may prove of use to you even if it onlyserves to strengthen your faith and to indicate to you the reasonableness of thesituation which your circumstances are forcing you to meet.Therefore, your major need is to strengthen and preserve the three contactswhich form the background of your spiritual [647] life: your soul, your relationwith me and your connection with your group brothers. By so doing, the sense ofuniversality and of an expanded consciousness will grow and deepen and enableyou to achieve that sense of proportion which will reveal the little self as anintegral part of the great Self or Whole. By this statement I refer not only toyour relation between the soul and the personality but to your relation—as aliving entity—to the greater whole of which Humanity and the Hierarchy areintegral parts. I would suggest, therefore, a line of thought or of meditationwhich will deepen and strengthen these attitudes. To this end I am going tosuggest five points of recollection for you each day:1. On awakening in the morning, before rising.2. At noon.3. At sunset, whatever hour that may be.4. On retiring at night.5. At the time of the group meditation, whenever you may decide to do it.Thus a living continuity of sensed relationship will be established in yourconsciousness.1. On awakening, sound the OM inaudibly and say: “I am one with the light whichshines through my soul, my brothers and my Master.”2. At noon, again sound the OM inaudibly and say with deep and slow reflection:“Naught separates me from my soul, my brothers and my Master. My life is theirsand theirs is mine.”3. At sunset again sound the OM and say: “Naught can dim the love which flowsbetween my soul and me, the little self. Naught can come between my brothers andmy self. Naught can stop the flow of strength between me and my soul, between mybrothers and my soul, between the Master of my life and me, His pledgeddisciple.” [648]4. On retiring, before you fall asleep, you again sound the OM and say: “Fromdarkness lead us to light. I tread the way of life and light because I am asoul. With me there walk my brothers and my Master. Therefore within, without,and every side, there is light and love and strength.”5. When doing the group meditation, begin to capitalise on this growingconsciousness and before doing the work, link up with as much consciousrealisation as possible with your soul, your brothers and myself, realising theindestructibility of the tie.This work carried forward as a definite exercise will produce in you a deepenedavailable strength and poise. It will only take a few seconds at each point orstated time, but those seconds will serve as points of crisis and of inpouringstrength.~August 19421. I come to Thee, Lord of my Life, and from that point achieved, close at Thyfeet I work.2. Between me and the outer world there appears a haze of blue. That blueprotects and hence I have no fear. Through it, I may not pass.3. And from this hour and henceforth upon the Way , I seek to Be . I seek nomore to know, because this life has taught me how to know and with thisknowledge gained, I now can serve by Being .4. Before me streams the Path of Light. I see the Way. Behind me lies themountain path, with stones and cobbles on the way. Around me are the thorns. Myfeet are tired. But straight ahead stretches the Lighted Way and on that Way Iwalk.5. Pain comes from form-attachment. It takes two forms: Attachment to the formsof earth, of men and place; attachment to the truth. They both bring pain andpain must cease. Ask your soul how ? [649]6. The threefold load, the blazing star, the path of light, the greater Star andthrough them all the throbbing of the heart of love, streaming from out theAshram of D.K. enfolding all and thee.~MY BELOVED BROTHER: September 1943A.A.B. has just called my attention to the six statements which I gave you toreflect upon more than a year ago. Knowing all that you had been through in theinterim and are now passing through, she realised how extremely apposite andsuitable they had proved to be. Pain has engulfed you and yours; anxiety alongmany lines, and all of them severely testing, has been your lot. Had you notbeen “close to the feet of the Lord of your Life,” you would have reached whatmight have been regarded as the valley of desperation.Yet you have not been truly desperate because the “haze of blue” has protectedyou, your group brothers have stood as a shield around you, and the strength ofmy Ashram has been at your disposal. People often fail to realise the nature andthe potency of that strength—a strength that comes from a deep impersonal loveand from the realisation that, in the light of the eternal verities, all pain isbut temporary, all trouble and struggle ephemeral, and that we have passed oftthis way before upon the unhappy little planet of suffering which we call theEarth. We come to know that we shall not pass this way so oft again. Did yougrasp the significance of that sentence, my brother?Just as there are days in a year which seem to stand out because of theirdarkness and to be overcharged with blackness and agony, so there are liveswhich equally so stand out in a cycle of lives because of the varied experienceswhich they convey, the bitter piling up of pain and distress, and the handlingof an accumulation of unhappy and oft agonising karma. But, my brother, alllives are not like this, and the fact that your present life has been for yearsso hard is the guarantee that you have worked off much karma, that you [650]stand infinitely freer and are less handicapped. The fruits of all thissuffering you will reap as you enter your next incarnation.So be of good cheer, and look forward and out towards a future of service and ofjoy, and this because you have endeavoured to live selflessly and to carry yourload bravely, and because your life and deeds and your entire career have helpedso many.I would remind you that pain, when it is lived out mentally for others, is theworst kind of pain. This you know. But I would remind you that the capacity soto do and so to identify yourself with pain that is not specifically your own issomething that all disciples have to master, because it is one of the firststeps towards shouldering world pain and the agony of the human family, thusbecoming a participant in the “fellowship of Christ’s sufferings” and a lifterof world burdens. We work and live on a planet of pain. Until a man is aninitiate of high degree he cannot even begin to sense the reasons why this isso; he must perforce then take refuge in the trite platitudes that sufferinghumanity has evolved to account for things as they are. None of these in any wayapproximate the true reasons or give any real insight into the problem. Men mustwait for understanding until they can no longer be hurt or limited by the painof others. This follows when we have learnt to handle our own pain. Then andonly then can they begin to lift the burden of humanity as a whole and do theirresponsible share in lightening it.We come again here to those contradictory and beautiful words: Isolated Unity.When one is isolated from form attachments and when one is freed foridentification with the life aspect, then one can know the true meaning ofunity, then one is released from pain and one is free to release others also.This you are learning, and it is the last great lesson for you this life. Ittakes some time to learn it, because it is one of the very few basic lessons,implicating principles which are inherent in the planetary life and requiringthe implementing of the soul to arrive at true understanding. You have made muchprogress along this line during this life and [651] have no cause forself-depreciation or regrets. I tell you this for your assurance, and would askyou to rest back upon my words.Keep busy with my work, my brother, for there is naught left for the truedisciple but the work of the Ashram, which is the work of the Hierarchy, whichis work for humanity. Such is the outgoing sequence. For you now, it is not somuch the eager, active, outer service, of which you have done so much in thepast years, but it is the standing steady, and so becoming a channel and a link.Remember with care the words I gave you last year: “I now can serve by Being.”Do not strive so much, my brother. Accept life conditions as they are; acquiescein the situation as it is; relax for the remainder of this incarnation, andexoterically rest from your labours and esoterically enter into light. Work notunder such a sense of inner strain and effort. I refer not to the outer strainsand stresses to which you are subjected for they exist and are hard anddifficult. I refer to your own inner attitude of recognition and acquiescence,of Being and attainment.Those are the four key thoughts for your personal reflection during the comingyear. The year that is on its way will hold great changes for you but you arestrong enough and experienced enough to carry through triumphantly. The comingmonths will hold for you revelation, and that revelation will enhance the lightupon the Lighted Way which stretches out before you; they will hold opportunityfor you also, if you learn the hard lesson of relinquishment, and when next yearcloses you may find yourself surprised at the distance you will find you havetravelled, the enlightenment you may find you have gained, and the increasedsphere of your subjective usefulness.Remember—you are not alone. I stand by and carry you consciously within my aura.~MY BELOVED FRIEND AND TRUSTED DISCIPLE: November 1944My heart has gone out to you during the past year as you have struggled withfatigue, with loneliness, with foreboding [652] and with anxieties of manykinds. You have stood with constant steadiness and you must know by now howhighly steadiness is regarded by the Hierarchy. These culminating years of yourlife have been years of great difficulty and much pain—not only for yourself butfor others. They have been years wherein everything has been wrested from you,leaving you upon that “pinnacle of loneliness” about which I spoke to yourbrother, W.D.S., in my instruction to him last year. I would have you regardthat pinnacle as an exalted place from which the new vision can be seen. Thatpinnacle can be turned into a mount of initiation.You have passed the three score years and ten of ordinary living and you areprivileged to look back upon a life of great usefulness and of much innerspiritual progress. You have disposed of much karma and are far freer than whenyou entered into incarnation.The crux of the lesson which you are now in process of learning is to refrainfrom expectation—from life, from people and from circumstances—except thatexpectation which concerns spiritual opportunity and your relation to my Ashram.Disciples need to regard the Ashram more definitely as a place of spiritualenveloping, if I may use so peculiar a phrase. They need to regard it as acircle of protection, remembering that if their consciousness can escape intothe Ashram, they are in a place of complete security where naught can reach orhurt them. Neither pain nor anxiety can overwhelm the man who dwells in theconsciousness of eternity; this sense of the eternal, coupled with therealisation of essential unity, marks all dwellers in an Ashram.Herein lies your safety in the vicissitudes of your life. I am not speaking idlyor symbolically, nor am I referring to the usual platitudes expressed in theinjunction “dwell in the eternal.” I refer definitely to the place of a disciplewithin an Ashram of one of the Masters, and in particular to your place withinmy Ashram. This place is a reality and not a dream or a figment of wishfulthinking; it is a sphere of focussed awareness where the minds, the love, theaspiration and the spiritual consciousness of many meet, and meet in truth. Ofthis meeting you can—as many have and do—[653] become conscious. Avoid vaguenessas you think of the Ashram with which you are affiliated. Oft I warn and urgedisciples to concentrate upon their service and upon their outer contacts, andthus avoid concentration upon the Ashram and upon me, the Master of the Ashram.Knowing your circumstances and seeing into your future, I reverse the injunctionin your case and urge you to make the Ashram a reality in your life and to countwith greater definiteness and surety upon my presence there and my understandingwelcome. Your natural diffidence and humility will permit this and protect meand the Ashram from any undue pressure on your part, even if—in the stress ofcircumstances—you were prompted to make it.I would outline for you a meditation which will suffice for your needs for along time to come. I am not putting it in the ordinary form, for all of you inthis group should now have reached the point at which you can formulate your ownmeditation and reflective approach. I only indicate to you the setting forcertain seed thoughts.I suggest that you think, first of all, of the Ashram, my Ashram, as a greatcentre of energy with which you (in your place and in your own way) areprivileged to establish contact. See the Ashram as a sphere of radiant, magneticlight; then see me, as you know me, at the centre of that sphere, both emittingand receiving light, via the Christ and via the Ashram of which I was at onetime a part—the Ashram of the Master K.H. See yourself also as a soul in contactwith first ray energy, and thus contributing some of this energy, reaching youvia the Ashram of the Master M., to the light and power of my Ashram. Havingthus served and been served, and having taken your group brothers into yourconsciousness and recognised them as within the ashramic light, you can proceedto take three ideas or symbolic sentences as your theme for reflection, duringthe next few years. They will suffice to meet your need and to evoke in you thenecessary spiritual attitudes.I. The Cross, erected high, reaches from the pinnacle [654] upon which I standinto the place of light, where dwells my Master. Against that Cross there restsa ladder. The golden Cross and the ladder of pure light are one, and by theirmeans I rise. Upward I look and see an outstretched hand. Downward I look andsee the many hands demanding aid. With gladness and with hope, I recognise thepurpose of the two hands I possess. I climb the ladder, hard as it may seem,with both my hands outstretched—the one above my head to find it clasped withstrength, the other down below to find it full of power to lift.II. A burning sea of flame. Beyond, a radiant sun. Behind, a world of darkness,gloom and heavy rain—a rain of tears. There, in the centre of a fire I stand, myeyes upon the sun. The vortex of the fire, the flaming rays of heat cast outwardby the sun, blend with my fire and lo! it disappears. The greater fire blendswith and consumes the little one. I turn and pass back—out of the light andwarmth—into the world of gloom and mist and, as I turn, I hear a voice cryingaloud: “Well done. Pass through the gloom; enter the mist; dry up the rain andtears and find yourself upon the other side, and near my heart.”III. A garden full of flowers, of bees and glowing light and sun. I see a wallwhich separates the garden from the world of men. Beyond its gates I see theforms of those who long to enter. Into my heart there come the words, spoken Iknow not when: “The key is in your hands; open the gates and let the crowd in.This you can do, for the garden now is yours and yet is theirs, though you haveentered first. Open the gate and welcome with a smile and words of love andcheer the sad, unwelcome, miserable crowd. The garden stands between the outerworld and the inner sacred place you call my Ashram. Within the garden take yourstand. There rest. Move forward to the gate at need, returning ever to the placeof rest. Open the door when called upon, [655] but retain the key. The surgingcrowd will touch you not nor hurt the garden in its loveliness.”Behind these three symbolic stanzas, if I may so call them, are veiled threeneeded lessons which you must learn and master. I am not telling you what theselessons are, for the joy of discovery must be yours.I do not need to tell you either that I send you with constancy thoughts ofstrength and sustaining understanding. Long years have taught you that mystrength goes out to you when your own inner strength is called into play and isused by you consciously and rightly. I give not what you yourself can provide,but I can and do supplement your strength when need demands. Rest, therefore,brother of mine; be not unduly concerned at the plight of those you love. Trusttheir own souls and know that they, alone, must learn the needed lessons. Restin peace.~MY TRIED AND LOVED DISCIPLE: August 1946The last few years have been years of agony and distress for you, bothphysically and mentally. You have endured almost to the limit—in pain of body,in agony of anxiety, through financial stringency and its wearing uncertainty,and in the distress which comes from watching others suffer. You have stoodsteady, and in your steadiness, serenity and staunchness you have brought joy tomy heart and strength to the Ashram. I would have you know this.You have worked off much karma, and whilst so working you have served. In you Inow have a disciple upon whom—in your next life cycle—I can depend and layresponsibility, and whose service therefore can be great. Disciples are apt toforget that when they reach a point of complete dependability (because the lowerself has been obliterated and no longer obstructs the vision) they lift a loadoff the Master’s shoulders.It is your due to tell you this, for your sufferings, unselfishly endured, haveearned you the right of recognition. The [656] Lighted Way stretches ahead instill greater brightness, and you can enter into the brightness with confidenceand surety.This is the sum total of my brief word to you today; it will, I know, suffice.Take what I have said exactly as I say it and for what the words exactly mean,and know that I, your Master and your friend of many lives, am satisfied.NOTE: Seventeen months later, this disciple entered “into the brightness” of theinner Ashram.~TO D. H. B.January 1940This has been for you a hard year, my brother, and (as with your brother,D.P.R.) I seek not to add any fresh complications or considerations to the loadwhich you already carry. You are, likewise, a clear-sighted disciple and thereis small need for me to indicate the glamour which at this time disturbs yourservice. One thought, however, I would give you for careful pondering. Thepersonality with its aims and ambitions, its intelligence and experience, initself constitutes a glamour and one with a most potent effect upon you. When—asin your case—the personality is of a relatively high order and well integrated,the problem is then very real. This you realise, but in moments of service youare apt to fall into personality glamour without being aware of it, and thosearound you, serving with you, help you not.Walk in the light, my brother. Let the light and radiance of the soul illumineyour service and let your intellect not prove to be the dominating factor. Letspontaneous love and not a cultivated kindness condition your relations withyour fellowmen. Be not glamoured by your own grasp of spiritual realities and byyour spiritual knowledge. You have much to do in this life, and particularly inthe next when this life’s lessons have been learnt and assimilated. For this youmust consciously prepare by the development of clear-sighted vision. I shouldperhaps point out to you that illusion more than glamour is your majordifficulty for you are mentally polarised. [657]~MY BROTHER AND MY FRIEND: August 1940So much have I said to you anent glamour that in this instruction I shall notdeal with it. If you have not developed an instinctual reaction to it at thistime, then there is little that I can say. This instinctual recognition of afault, a quality, a tendency and, eventually, of a revelation is one of thefirst steps that the disciple takes towards the transcendence of the astralplane. I would point out to all of you (for glamour is general as well asparticular) that the dissipation of glamour brings revelation.For you, this is a time of interlude in service on a large scale and it is noteasy for you to accept it. The conflict of the nations has brought about anexoteric interlude in spiritual action on earth. It is also causing (and thismust not be forgotten) a deepening inner growth and a subjective spiritualreorganisation which—when the war is over—will bear much fruit. It is a periodof preparation for disciples and is an opportunity for greatly increased inner,spiritual relation which later will produce that outer synthesis for which allmen wait.My message to you at this time is to retreat inward and achieve a deepeningwhich will, in its turn, produce wisdom and truth. I do not urge you to ceaseany of your exoteric activities, but I urge you to carry them forward in aspiritual silence. Pursue your physical plane activities and your spiritualdharma but live within yourself an intense life of aspiration, of questioningand (if I might so express it) of questing. Become, brother of mine, spirituallydissatisfied for this will produce in you an intensification of the majorqualities which I suggested you cultivate many years ago. There comes a time inthe life of the disciple when he goes through a process of detaching himselfesoterically (though not necessarily exoterically) from his chosen anddesignated task and from all past achievements and thereby learns his next stepupon the Path of Liberation. This detachment, based on a phase of spiritualdissatisfaction engenders also humility of heart—a quality you much need tocultivate. Humility of head is [658] largely theoretical and imposed; humilityof heart is practical and inherently spontaneous. I would have you ponder onthese distinctions for you will learn much thereby.Consecrate therefore the period until the war ends to the cultivation of depth ,of detachment, of humility. This process you will never regret, and in thecoming period of reconstruction you will then bring to the task much that youcannot now give. As you know, it is the heart quality in you which needsintensifying and purifying. Your first ray astral body and mind produce too muchof the will nature in all your activities. You need to bear this in mindparticularly in connection with the astral body, for it is through that bodythat the love energy of the soul must pour on its way to the heart centre. Itis, therefore, the second ray quality which must—in connection with your firstray astral body—be imposed and that means two things in relation to you:1. That your soul contact must be intensified.2. That your life problem today involves primarily three factors:a. The soul . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . second ray.b. The personality. . . . . . . . . . . sixth ray.c. The astral body. . . . . . . . . . . first ray.This constitutes an interesting and somewhat unbalanced triangle of energy, forthe sixth ray personality is quick to respond to soul energy but the effectswork out in a fanatically oriented and powerful astral body. The consequentinterplay produces much of the glamour which besets you and which it is the taskof your first ray mind to dissipate.You are perhaps surprised at my use of the word “fanatical” in connection withyou for you in no way regard yourself as a “fanatical devotee.” Nor do I soregard you. The fanaticism which you display is in respect to your own judgmentwhere other people are concerned and it involves also an almost proud dependenceupon the wisdom which you have undoubtedly developed during many lives. Thistends to give you a surety of opinion, in relation to others, which conditionsand your decision do not always warrant; it produces [659] also a willingness toimpose your own ideas and your judgment upon others when, my brother, it may beneither your duty nor your right so to do. This quality (oft found in discipleswho are learning the nature of true spiritual humility) is esoterically called“the fanatic opposition of the wise person to the facts.” This statement is mostparadoxical but it is one which it would profit you much to consider and study.Disciples like yourself (and they are fairly numerous and constitute some of themost promising material for training that we possess) are apt to be hard andunyielding—both to themselves and others. They have learnt much and surmountedmuch in the crucible of suffering and nothing has prevented them from asteadfast pursuit of reality. This capacity leads them to judge with harshnessthose who do not, apparently, achieve results or possess their own stayingpower. When such a disciple is naturally upon the teaching line as you are, hethen handles opportunity on the basis of his truly enlightened personality buthis methods are nevertheless personality ones and when—as in your case—thepersonality is on the sixth ray, one is apt to have a disciple fanaticallyidentified with his own way of approach and one who expects others to go hisway; he will be wedded to his own methods and anxious to impose them uponothers. He is convinced that the techniques he employs are the best for all. Alldisciples have to learn to recognise the many ways, the many methods and thewidely differently developed techniques. Their attitude (when they have learntthis lesson) is ever the fostering, the interpreting and the strengthening ofthe ways and the methods which suit those with whom they are associated andworking, or those whom they are endeavouring to help. Remember this, my brother,and aim at decentralisation without diffusion. Think about this statement andseek to understand it and make it practical. If you can learn this lesson, therewill open for you a wider field of opportunity. Decentralisation in mind fromyourself and identification with the self in all should be your steady andpractical objective.To aid you in this, I suggest the following short meditation exercise whichshould be done each day at the close [660] of your group practice. Its objectiveis the increase of the flow of energy to the heart centre, remembering alwaysthat the heart centre is a twelve-petalled lotus.1. Visualisation exercise.a. Achieve alignment as rapidly as possible.b. Hold in the mind, imaginatively, the straight line of the spinal column, thehead centre, the sutratma and the antahkarana—thus linking the centres in thebody with the soul.c. Then carry the line which your imagination has constructed, from the centreat the base of the spine to the closed lotus bud in the centre of thetwelve-petalled egoic lotus.2. Having done this, recognise your identity with all souls who constitute—intheir entirety—the One Soul.3. Then sound the OM as a soul, as far as in you lies, breathing it out fromsoul levels with no fixed objective in your mind. Do this six times.4. Then sound the OM again after a pause (thus making seven in all) sending itout into the ajna centre and from there carry it down to the heart centre andhold it there for later use . Do this as a soul whose nature is love.5. Then, bearing in mind that the heart centre is the repository of twelveforces or energies, seek to develop them by pondering upon the twelve virtuesthrough which these energies express themselves, taking one each month for ayear.a. Group love, embracing individuals.b. Humility, signifying your personality attitude.c. Service, indicating your soul’s preoccupation.d. Patience, signifying the embryonic immortality and persistence which is asoul characteristic.e. Life, or expressed activity which is the manifestation of love because it isessential dualism.f. Tolerance, which is the first expression of buddhic understanding.g. Identification with others, which is embryonic [661] fusion, carriedeventually to synthesis when the head centre is developed.h. Compassion, which is essentially the right use of the pairs of opposites.i. Sympathy, which is the consequence of knowledge and of the unfoldment of theknowledge petals. Such energy then is in touch with the heart centre.j. Wisdom, which is the fruit of love and indicates the awakening of the lovepetals of the egoic lotus.k. Sacrifice, which is the giving of the heart’s blood or life for others.6. After a quiet meditation on one of these qualities of soul expression as theymanifest upon the physical plane, sound the OM three times.I would remind you that these soul qualities, which express themselves throughthe heart centre, must be interpreted esoterically and in terms of relation.Bear this in mind and as you meditate, seek ever the inner significance and notjust the assembling of thought upon these qualities. Most of the thoughts andideas which will come to you in this connection will be well known and so purelyexoteric. There are, however, secondary meanings which are of real significanceto the disciple though almost unknown to the average man. Endeavour to findthese.I would ask you, my brother, as a service to the group, each month to write ashort paper on these twelve qualities as expressions of soul energies, thusgiving your brothers the fruit of your month’s meditation. Be of good courageand let not physical liability hinder your inner life and joy. Seek closercontact with me, your Master, and look for response.~August 19421. The call to some disciples is to live the triple life: to serve withoutsurcease, to suffer on the plane of outer things and always dream. This is thecall for you. [662]2. Ponder the distinction between the dream, the vision and the plan. They formthe world of meaning.3. To understand impels the heart detached. And with that understanding thereawakes the will to dissipate the pain of those who tread the darker ways ofearth. On these you do not walk, yet know and see.4. The pen, when dipped in love and understanding, must be used by you forseveral years as your major mode of service. I tell you therefore, Write .5. Search for the younger members of my group whom yet you do not know.Recognise them when you meet them on the way of life, and from your point ofgarnered wisdom and your trained experience give them a helping hand. Threeawait your service.6. Stand by A.A.B. and aid her in the service of the Plan. The link is closebetween the Ashram of K.H. and mine. The lines of interplay must closer be.~BROTHER OF MINE: September 1943The call has now gone forth from your soul and from my Ashram to develop andevolve your own definitely planned service, and therefore to begin the task offinding those whom you can help—not only in this life but primarily in the next.I start with this statement because I seek to say something which will arrestyour attention and give incentive to the next few years of your life.The sixfold statement which I gave you last year was, if you have notascertained this for yourself, full of information, indicative of your soul’sdesire or plan for you, and full also of esoteric symbolism. It is a symbolismwhich holds for you the key to the future. I would like to take these sixsentences in this instruction and give you a deeper insight into them. They holdfor you the blueprint of your future, and particularly are they the blueprintfor your next incarnation. Study them afresh from that angle.What, my brother, has been the keynote of your present life? I refer here to theobvious personality keynote. Is it not [663] perhaps and above aught elsefrustration ? Plans which have not materialised; dreams which have not cometrue; friends who have consistently failed to understand; lack of appreciationfrom those who should justly have given it to you; apparently no situation inwhich your deep knowledge and understanding could be made available. Learningand esoteric knowledge have both apparently (I said apparently, my brother)failed you. A home life which has not measured up to your earlier dreams and aphysical body which limits all you have sought to do. You likewise see the yearsslipping away, and from the angle of the personality there seems little to showfor it all. Such is one side of the picture, is it not?But what about the other side, my friend and co-worker? This, it is easy tooverlook, because from the angle of personality appraisement it appears sonebulous and evasive and dependent for verification upon those rare moments whenyou contact consciously your soul, and then suddenly know. But this happens nonetoo often. Let me tell you in words what that other side appears to us, knowingthat you will believe me and that what I say may give you a fresh and livinggrip on life and enough confidence to enable you to make the coming yearsincreasingly fruitful.This has been for you an incarnation wherein certain major happenings have takenplace. Your soul has, for one thing, taken possession of your personality andgripped your mind (a major determining factor in all processes connected withreincarnation), and has done this in such a way that you will return toincarnation when the time comes with a sense of convinced awareness. Secondly,you have stepped upon the Path of Accepted Discipleship and are definitely inpreparation for initiation—which initiation it is for you to discover. A hintlies for you in the fact that frustration has been the keynote of yourpersonality life, and that divine indifference is your quality objective. Do yourealise the importance of those two major happenings? Again, you have learnt themeaning of pain, and again divine indifference is your goal. You have made manycontacts and helped many more than you know, and you have thus establishedlinks—for what purpose, my brother? May it not be that each life that you [664]have touched with helping and with strength indicates to you those who may formthe nucleus of your own group in a later life experience?One of the things which I shall have to indicate to the senior members of thisparticular group of chelas in my Ashram (as their teaching is carried forwardafter the preparatory personal processes have been duly taught) is the Techniqueof Magnetism, which is the clue to the manifestation of all Ashrams. It isthrough spiritual magnetism and through pure love, impersonally applied, that anAshram is assembled. It is a technique which you must learn and are beginning tolearn, but the motive for so learning is now presented to you. You have mademany friends and evoked much love, and that is a lasting process entailingresponsibility which may not be ignored. You are learning to know me and youhave ever the staunch love and confidence of A.A.B., who has a peculiarly deepappreciation of you based on ancient work together in past lives. You have alsogained a little knowledge as to the intent of my Ashram, as far as you areconcerned. You have worked off much karma (far more than you think) and standmuch freer than was deemed possible when you entered into incarnation this life.From the angle of your soul your life has been triumphant. From the angle ofyour personality it has been frustrated. Which matters, my brother? Perhapsneither matters from the angle of the initiate vision and the attitude of thetrained disciple.“In neither pain nor joy is liberation found.In neither dark nor light will the spiritual sun appear.The pairs of opposites distract the eyes of men.Only the single eye directs the stepsOf the initiate upon the Way.”Will you ponder my presentation of these two contrasting aspects of your life,and then pass on to fuller light and service?I told you in my last instruction that you were called to live the triple lifeof ceaseless serving, of constant pain, and [665] of endless dreaming. I startedoff in that statement with the enunciation of that which is factual in yourlife. Let us see which are the other statements of fact pointed out by me, forin their sum total your future integration, development and service lie hidden.Let me, therefore, enumerate:1. Service and pain and dreaming are your present lot.2. You do not walk as yet the darker ways of earth. For that hard task you arein preparation, for some must serve this way and only the strong and tried canthus he trusted. Regard all that has happened to you as special training, whatmight be called “basic training,” in order that your future initiate service maybe carried out according to plan. That service is the choice of your soul. It isnot imposed upon you by me or by the will of the Ashram or by any other factorsave your soul.3. The use of the pen in writing is at present your major mode of service. Findyour own people, and write that which will inspire and help. Let love speed yourfingers and light travel between you and those you seek to serve. Therefore, mybrother, write. You have the gift and the time and a wide open door forimpersonal service.4. Search for those who are not yet in my Ashram, who are still probationers,and lead them on. Prepare them for the transition which they face when they stepoff the Probationary Path onto the Path of Discipleship. Have you found andrecognised the three who await your guidance and your help?5. Continue, as ever, to stand by A.A.B. The reason for this is that my Ashramis an affiliate of the Ashram of K.H. I would ask you to study what I say toR.S.U., for it applies also to you.I have here clearly given you certain instructions which will only prove theireffectiveness in your development and their ability to open doors for you whenaccepted and obeyed. I [666] can but indicate and suggest from my standpoint ofgreater knowledge, but it is for you to recognise the usefulness of thesuggestions and to move forward in line with them.I have a most interesting theme for your thought on the distinction between “thedream, the vision and the Plan.” There are many ways in which these distinctionscan be approached, and the interpretations will be dependent upon the status ofthe thinker. For you, a disciple in preparation for initiation, as are all in mygroup—accepted disciples in training—I will suggest the following lines ofapproach.To you, the dream is the reaction of a high grade imparted knowledge and worldneed for service. The personality dreams of using that knowledge and meetingthat need, and as he thinks of serving he thus becomes a server and a teacher.The vision is the realisation of the goal (embodied by the particular initiationfor which you are being prepared); according to the status of the initiate, sowill be the vision. It is the sensing of the united purpose and the spiritualintention of those who have already taken the initiation for which the discipleis being prepared. I cannot express this more clearly, as it is not permitted,but once you are clear in your own mind for which initiation you are beingprepared, you can then ascertain for yourself (and will, perforce, have toascertain) the objective, secret scope and field of service, plus the esotericquality of those who have passed through a certain door and undergone a certainexpansion of consciousness. Remember that initiation does not simply enhance anddeepen the soul quality; it does not simply enable the personality to expresssoul powers, and thus emphasise and draw out the best that is in the discipleand his service, but it makes available to him, progressively, forces andenergies of which he has had no previous knowledge and which he must learn touse as an initiate of a certain degree upon the Lighted Way. It reveals to himworlds of being hitherto unsuspected and unrecognised, with which he must learnto cooperate, and it integrates him more definitely into the “lighted area” ofour planetary life, bringing fresh revelation and vision but making theunlighted area dark indeed.[667] The Plan is as much of the hierarchical intent (as an entire and wholepicture) as the initiate can grasp, plus an understanding of the part which he,as an individual server, must play. There is more to it than that, but I fear tocomplicate certain simple truths which I seek to have you grasp. The clarity ofthe vision and the grasp of the Plan, it might be added, are dependent upon theconscious and intelligent construction of the antahkarana. You will see,therefore, why I have asked this group within my Ashram to study the antahkaranainstructions as given in the papers of the advanced section of the ArcaneSchool. All of you have already begun to build this bridge; I seek to have youcomprehend how and why.So, my brother, see your life pattern more clearly. See the underlying purposeof all happenings in the past, and endeavour then to grasp the picture of thefuture, and thus make your dreams come true, because you see the vision and arecooperating with the Plan; thus materialise the vision and work at intelligentunderstanding of the Plan. Let naught—fatigue, frustration, people orcircumstance—deflect you from your purpose. Carry all forward in silence andwith love.Take the four words: Dream, Vision, Plan, Realisation, and make them the themefor your meditation work during the four quarters of the coming year. If youwill, write during this year four papers on these four words, but only writeafter three months’ quiet reflection upon each word, and from the angle of thepersonality—illumined by the Spiritual Triad. I would have you note the wordingof this request with especial care. This will tend to bring in more than justsoul wisdom, for the angle of the spiritual will and of spiritual love (of whichboth soul will and soul love are only the reflection) will begin to enter in.Go forward with joyful expectation. Get ready for your future service in thislife and in the next; seek to fulfil instructions and learn to come and gobetween my Ashram and that of K.H., for in the one your service will appear, andin the other your love will be deepened and your heart become moreunderstanding. [668]~MY FRIEND AND CO-DISCIPLE: November 1944I would have you note this mode of address. That we are friends you have knownfor many years. That we are co-disciples may be, as yet, a somewhat new idea. Asa wide generalisation, the theory is accepted that all in or affiliated with theHierarchy are disciples, and therefore in a close relation to each other. I amhere, however, using these words in a new sense—new, I mean, to you.There are within the ranks of disciples certain of them who have been singledout for a peculiar and particular relation to the Christ. Such a one is theMaster K.H., Who is slated (is that not the word I should use?) to fill higheroffice when the Christ moves on to other work than that of the World Teacher. Imyself hold a similar position to the Master K.H. Through K.H. and throughmyself and through two other Masters, a number of disciples of high standing,and some neophytes or disciples of lesser rating, are upon the line of thiscontact or designated service. By the training given, these disciples of high orlow degree (yet all accepted in the technical sense) are rendered singularlysensitive to the Christ force. Curiously enough, these particular disciples areselected to take this training because of their interest in esoteric values, andnot because they possess a particularly loving nature, as might have beenexpected. They are usually on the wisdom aspect of the second ray and not on thelove aspect.The work which it is planned for them later to undertake will eventually proveso difficult that it is essential that they start with a strong bias towardswisdom . Contact with the “Ashrams of loving intent” (as certain Ashrams closeto the aura or periphery of Shamballa are called) suffices later to evoke thelove aspect in greater fullness, enabling the disciples, therefore, to present abalanced instrument to the Divine Organiser of their future work. Just what thiswork will be is not for me to say. It is connected with the training to be givenneophytes and aspirants in the next race, where the [669] average aspirant todiscipleship will be expected to be as intuitive and motivated by pure reason asthe aspirant today has to be mental. Technically speaking, that means that thebuddhic plane will be the focus or place of growth, and those who traindisciples will work from the plane of atma or pure spiritual will, just as todaythey work from the plane of buddhi or of rational unity. Ponder on that lastphrase.The relation of the Christ to the entire Hierarchy is that of Supreme Master.His group of disciples includes all initiates over the third initiation. Butthrough these initiates and certain of the Masters, and at their suggestion, Heis slowly selecting a band of lesser disciples who can be trained for specialwork during the next two or three lives. Of these, you can be one. The firstphase of the training given is to impose at least one life of most drasticdiscipline and difficult circumstances, not karmically ordained but of aneducational and disciplinary nature. You have had two such lives and haveconsequently built up and established a persistent endurance and a trainedresponse to events which is a guarantee to the watching Master that yourstability is assured and immovable.Much further training necessarily is demanded, but there is little that you canadd to that already given during this life. The next life will see a continuanceof the teaching. You can, however, develop within yourself a more consciouscomprehension of the nature of “wise love.” This is love free from emotion ordevotion; it is love aware of the objects of love as they essentially are and alove which is able to see in character and temperament the working out of karma.It is difficult for even an advanced disciple at this time to comprehend thenature of man when he has dropped all physical conflict out of his consciouslife experience and when the urge to combat (upon the physical plane) has fadedcompletely out of the human consciousness. The field of battle then shifts toother realms of awareness, and the effect of this—within humanity as a whole—isthe cause of the choosing of this special group through whom the problemsemerging out of the changed conditions can be solved and handled. [670] Men willhave to be trained for a state of discipleship even newer and different to thetype which I have presented at this time and which intrinsically differs fromthat previously given.One of the major needs in your nature is the evocation of a new and fieryincentive. For this reason, I have (as I seldom do) indicated the future aheadof you. You and F.C.D. are both numbered among the “friends of Christ,” as thisspecial group is called, and are upon a peculiar path of training. Step by step,the nature of this Path will be revealed to you, and, little by little, you willperceive the quality of the unfoldments which presented opportunity can giveyou.Be not mistaken, my brother. This does not mean that in this present vehicle andwith your present equipment you can contact the Master of all the Masters; nordoes it mean that your advancement is ahead of that of your group brothers.There are those in this group and in my Ashram who are ahead of you, if suchinexact terms can be used. The Christ, through your own Master and in no otherway, knows you. Not yet can you know Him. You can, however, ponder upon thesignificance of what I have said; you can learn to distinguish within yourselfthe dual aspects of your soul ray energy, love and wisdom; you can record wheneither of these two forces is functioning, and which one it is. A closer studyof your five rays (literally only four) will aid you to do this, particularly asyour seventh ray physical vehicle will greatly facilitate the process. Thisseventh ray is a ray of a dual activity, because through its means the energy ofthe soul and of the personality can be brought consciously into relation, andthis more easily than on the other rays, once the disciple is freed fromglamour. Thus there can be built a true expression of the life content—from theangle of a long soul experience. This may sound to you somewhat ambiguous, butthe statement is by no means as vague as it appears. It should provide you withideas for reflection.For the remainder of your life twelve seed phrases can provide the theme of yourrecurrent meditation—either for a year of twelve months or for twelve years. Thelonger and [671] the more earnestly you reflect upon them, the richer will beyour life expression, and that I know is what you yourself desire.1. Relation to the inner Ashram.2. The friendship of the Christ.3. The way of the intuition.4. The source of your life expression.5. Wisdom, blended with love.6. Reaction to the consciousness of the Hierarchy.7. The “Ashram of Loving Intent.”8. An out-going consciousness, esoterically understood.9. The “Lighted Way of the Buddha and the Christ.”10. The pinnacle whereon the thorny crown is won.11. The moment of perceptive understanding.12. The quality of the perceptive race of men.(This refers to the future race.)These phrases have a significance which is not immediately apparent; they arewhat I might be permitted to call “sparking” concepts, and they can berevolutionary in their effect, if you reflect upon them correctly andpersistently. They are intended to make you responsive to the different currentsof energy to which those who are to undergo a special training to fit them toform the special group of the “friends of Christ” must submit themselves. Thisright you have earned. It is my present task to aid you on this way of peculiartraining.Have you ever thought, my brother, that just as there is a discipline of painand of sorrow, there may also be a discipline of joy and of achievement? This isa thought worthy of attention. Men need these days to learn this new truth, andits perception will greatly change human consciousness. That which is bliss istoday here or on its way, and the disciples and aspirants of this present timemust be taught how to recognise and implement it. Again—this is a right whichyou have definitely earned.I shall be in touch with you, my brother. This instruction [672] is not long,but—coupled with that last given to you—it gives you a prospect of a possibilitywhich should cheer you on your way. You can regard what I have told you as thereward of a life of patient endurance, of overcoming and of acceptance. Itshould also enable you to bring a fuller tide of loving understanding. You willthus enhance your usefulness.~MY BROTHER: August 1946I approach you today with such complete understanding that I believe you willimmediately recognise its reality. My last instruction to you is distant andremote in its implications, and you are today wondering if I meant all that Isaid there and if your spiritual status is as I stated. It most certainly is,and on that statement I would have you take your stand. Will you understand meif I say that one of the guarantees to you of the truth of the past instructionis that this instruction will be relatively short? The last instruction was theimportant one. In that instruction I emphasised two things:1. That you were at the point in evolution where a definite rapport with theChrist was possible.2. That you were in process of preparation for taking a certain importantinitiation (as, my brother, are several of this group).Your reaction to this was normal—as far as your human nature was concerned—butdistinctly undesirable. It evoked in you a realisation that was false in manyways, but you have often been susceptible to glamour; you felt that your statuswas ahead of the majority of your brothers and that (because of this) you hadspecialised work to do for me. You took the position that, in the eventuality ofA.A.B.’s passing over, you were slated to take her place as far as this group isconcerned. You gave that impression to some of the group members you met lastyear and you gave that impression to A.A.B. She was deeply concerned over this,for she has for [673] you a very deep love and understanding as well as a clearperception of your status as a disciple.Since that time you have yourself been inwardly disturbed, because you arefundamentally sound and correct in your reactions; for this reason I would askyou to forget all this past history and any past reactions to glamour, and toregard the present as the only factor of importance.The new seed group is discontinued. My contact with you and with some othermembers of the group is exoterically not disturbed, and therefore (as long asA.A.B. is alive in the physical sense) you may, at intervals, hear from me.Subjectively, you are ever in touch, as is F.B. and three or four others in thegroup. The rest of the group members are linked with the Ashram, and thereforewith myself, and because time is of no account esoterically, their relationremains unimpaired and is preserved intact over whatever years are necessary tore-establish their occult obedience or their true interest.You need to bear in mind, my brother, that your second ray emphasis is that ofwisdom and not of love. Therefore the love quality is not so potent, and thispresents difficulties to you of which you are curiously unaware. It is yourtask—at any cost—to develop the love quality. The wisdom attitude makes youhard, and you have not yet balanced it—in intensity—by the love quality. Thishardness you must transmute on a large and general scale. You can transmute forindividuals you love or for whom you feel a sense of responsibility. It is thisquality of love which you must develop before you see the Christ—not simply asan initiate taking an initiation, but as a disciple warranting His attention.You see now the purpose of my remarks in an earlier instruction? Today, fewdisciples realise that the Christ has two relationships to them: that ofinitiation, and another—far rarer—that of One Whom they may consult inconnection with their work. This permission to approach is only accorded whenlove and wisdom are balanced and equal. This is not so in your case as yet, andI would have you bear this point in mind. Your personality ray is a serioushandicap to you, not [674] because of its developed aspect but because of itscrystallised assurance aspect. A sixth ray personality is ever sure of hisrecognition of truth, and is consequently very easily glamoured, and when thisis coupled (as in your case) with a first ray astral body, the difficulty whichconfronts you as a disciple is very great.Therefore, brother of mine, your immediate problem is one of glamour, plus afeeling of distress because you know that A.A.B. and I have recognised thisglamour. We have, but may I assure you that it makes no difference in ourunderstanding, love and appreciation of you. It may be a long time since I,personally, was overcome by glamour, and it may be a short time since A.A.B.succumbed, but neither of us has forgotten the difficulties encountered or lostour horror of glamour; we are therefore not critical, and upon that fact restback.May I recall to you an instruction I gave you in 1938 upon indifference? Ponderupon it again.Go ahead, brother of mine, in our service. Every contact has its unrealisedimportance; give of yourself , therefore, and not only through others. You caninduce others to work, but give of yourself and see (as far as is possible andcommonsense dictates) everyone who seeks to contact you, and this with love andwilling understanding. This is hard for you, but it is essential for thedevelopment of that loving understanding which is the complement of wisdom.F.C.D. needs to develop wisdom as the complement of love.As regards your meditation during future years, build up its structure yourself,laying emphasis upon three points: the Christ, the need for the balancing factorof love, and outgoing service. I give you no outline. You have outgrown thattechnique and are capable—as a soul—of formulating your own.Above all else, curb your critical mind and cease all harsh judgements. When indifficulty, go or write to A.A.B. She knows from wide experience, and sheunderstands.You will again hear from me, either through A.A.B. or through the medium of yourown soul. [675]~MY BROTHER AND MY FELLOW WORKER: November 1948I am deeply concerned in this communication to say something which will be ofreal service to you at this crisis in your life of discipleship. Disciples ofall degrees are now being tested and tried out in preparation for the work theyshould do, prior to the reappearance of the Christ. Your whole life has been inreality a preparation for the work which it is hoped that you will do. This lifehas been for you what we call in the Hierarchy “a life of dual possibilities.”When that is the case, a most difficult setting upon the physical plane ispresented to the disciple and he faces two possible lines of activity:1. He can decide to adjust himself to the circumstances and give his wholeattention to their surmounting (which in this case means changing them) and he,therefore, submits to the wear and tear of life, and to the constantconsideration of karmic unfoldments within his personality scope. He has no timefor outstanding service but regards the period of incarnation as an interludewherein karma is worked off.2. Or—he accepts the seemingly impossible situation and determines that nothingin his personality or his circumstances shall deter him from the active serviceof humanity. He, therefore, handles both the situations and opportunity from aninner point of enlightenment and from a sustained peaceful position within theAshram.In what I am here saying, I am considering only an accepted disciple such asyourself.You chose and have faithfully followed the second method of handling thispresent incarnation. With a frail and seriously injured physical body and apartner who is ever the cause of constant concern (though withal you owe hermuch), you have gone ahead with the task of a working disciple; you [676] havedone much good and have helped our work greatly and—as the Master said—theHierarchy is never ungrateful, for gratitude is the hallmark of an enlightenedsoul and a basic releasing agent from an occult and scientific angle. I am notungrateful to you, my brother; I hope to move you on into a closer relation tomyself provided you succeed in handling a somewhat difficult situation withwhich you are now confronted and dominate an aspect of your nature which must becontrolled before the move I contemplate in connection with you can beconsummated.At this time I have the responsibility of deciding whether you will accept whatI say and then set in to change certain attitudes or whether you will refuse torecognise their existence and go your own way. That would make it impossible forme to offer you an esoteric possibility which will next life orient you in sucha manner that, when you face the Initiation of Decision, the Path which you mustfollow will clearly appear to you.I wonder whether you have ever studied the reasons why the various members ofthe groups of nine stopped their work with me and are not (for this shortperiod) participants in the work of my Ashram. Please note that I do not use thephrase “participants in spiritual work.” Many of them are still just asspiritually motivated. An Ashram exists for work and not primarily for trainingdisciples. That training is necessarily given, but the prime object of an Ashramis to accomplish a particular phase of work. This is a sentence which I wouldbeg you here to pause and reflect upon. It is of prime importance to you at thistime.The work of the Hierarchy is an integrated whole; each Ashram within theHierarchy is dedicated to that whole and to that particular aspect of it whichcan be best carried out through its members of all degrees—the disciples intraining for some initiation or another. To insure that the work goes forward asdesired, necessarily (as I said) the individual disciple or initiate receivestraining, injunctions as to character development and personality attitudes. Aclose study of Discipleship in the New Age (Vol. I) will disclose to you that itwas on this point of personality correction—if I may use so [677] harsh a wordfor the hints and suggestions I gave—that defection occurred. In spite ofsincerity, dedication and wide knowledge, and even a subjective recognition ofthe accuracy of what I said, they would not accept it; rebellion set in;self-justification through rationalisation took place and temporarily—verytemporarily—they became inactive, though still disciples on the periphery of myAshram.If I now address to you certain comments upon your attitude the past threeyears, towards the work which has its spiritual focal point in New York, do Irisk losing you after all these years? Will you, for the remainder of your life,go your own way? I am going to believe that such will not be the case.As you well know, my work in the outer world has taken the form of three majoractivities.... You have done much to help with this work and the door ofopportunity stands wide open to you, provided the work is held true to theoriginal picture, given prior to World War II. There are, however, one or twothings you are apt to forget.1. The centre from whence the Goodwill work goes out and the source of itsspiritual potency is located in New York at this time, though later—if deemedwise—it may be moved to London. This I mentioned several years ago and I wouldremind you also that both these cities are among the five focal points ofspiritual energy through which hierarchical activities can be set in motion.Your city is not.2. The major task of the Goodwill work is threefold:a. It must mobilise world goodwill.b. It is responsible for the distribution of the message The Reappearance of theChrist and for a great deal of the work preparatory to His coming.c. It must aid in drawing the attention of the masses as far as may be—to theproblems of humanity, and thus help create the thoughtform of solution.This F.B. and A.A.B. have already realised and are laying plans in line with theabove. All over the world before long [678] (and already in different countries)much is being accomplished by students and others, always under instruction fromNew York, so that their work fits in with the general picture and the plans ofthe New York workers.3. There are, my beloved brother, three things in connection with your relationto the work which I would like to call to your attention:a. You have a strong feeling that all the Goodwill work should be completelydivorced from what you choose to call occultism. Do you mean from the spiritualcentre, the Hierarchy? If this is done, in what way will the goodwill work youpropose to do differ from the thousands of goodwill movements so ardently andactively working in the world today?This A.A.B. told you, since which time you have never spoken to her, bade herfarewell even by phone or written her a letter. These personality details matternot to her and are of no importance except as they indicate a strong reaction onyour part of almost violent disagreement. F.B. and A.A.B. have done what theycould to “absorb” you into the work of the new cycle, but hitherto quiteunsuccessfully.b. You tend to emasculate the work and rob it of all potency by a drasticelimination of any word or phrase or paragraph which could be considered to havean occult meaning or implication. Yet, my brother, in the years 1932-1936 thegoodwill literature went out practically as dictated by me and it met withenormous and overwhelming success. It had the spirit and the rhythm of theHierarchy behind it. Today the demand for things esoteric and occult and of thenew era is greater still, and the unique thing which the Goodwill work has tooffer is the Plan for humanity which the Hierarchy is seeking to implement.c. Then, my co-disciple, you have lately succumbed to [679] two personalityfaults or weaknesses which seriously hinder your work for me, and in the Ashram,and for humanity.You are again intensely critical of all who do not see things your way and—whentheir ideas do not coincide with your conception as to how the work should bedone—you refuse to cooperate. I would remind you that the Members of theHierarchy are highly individual even though relatively free from personalityreactions. Each Ashram has its part to play in materialising the Plan and someproject to carry through connected with that Plan. Sometimes this will requirethe joint cooperation of two or three Ashrams. All the senior workers called into help may not see eye to eye with the Master responsible for a certain aspectof the Plan, but (when united in a cooperative task) they work under thedirection of the Master Who is responsible. Here lies a great deal of yourdifficulty.You want to work your own way many thousand miles away from Headquarters where Ihave established my work, instead of working out the plans as proposed to you.We come, therefore, not only to the field of criticism in which you findyourself stranded but we come to that latent ambition which, you have oftadmitted over the years, is perhaps your deepest rooted failing.... You areanxious to see the new seed group members take control of the organisationalsituation should anything happen to A.A.B., forgetting that the work of thatgroup is mainly to create a subjective channel of spiritual love, light andpower—a point to which few of the members pay any attention at all. You wouldlike to run the work with your own chosen group of workers. You are not workingwith love and in cooperation with the workers at Headquarters; you areforgetting, are you not, that unless such a plan as the Goodwill work is foundedand engineered by a group of disciples [680] who are working in the closestrappor t with each other and (in the case of world goodwill ) with the Hierarchy(via my Ashram and the Ashrams of the Masters M., K.H., and R.), the work cannotgo forward as desired.My brother, your choice is clear and one of two paths is open to you. You canwork with loving cooperation with F.B. and the other goodwill workers so thatthere is unity of approach and uniformity of technique, or else—you can create,engineer and run your own goodwill movement, which may turn out to be a bigthing numerically but a poor little thing specifically because you are not inyour place and doing your work in my Ashram as had been your soul’s decision.This latter choice is not what I seek to see happen but at present you standisolated and relatively useless between these two alternatives.The new cycle is upon us, brother of mine; there is no time now for personalityplans, for criticisms and for disagreements. I have asked you to cooperate withthose who have been asked by me to undertake the task of bringing the Goodwillmovement to the world.An era of frustration has swept the world, due to certain planetary influences;the work that I have sought to do has consequently suffered. This period willnot last. I need you in the new cycle and in the new expanding work. There is noplace today for personal ambition, personal criticisms, hard feelings orself-pity.Deepen your spiritual life, my brother. Much that interests you is notconstructive. Also the cleaning up of your country by ardent search forundesirable citizens can well be carried on by others than yourself. Your workis and must be for the Hierarchy and the furthering of its plans. Take againyour place as an outpost of my consciousness in the activities of myorganisations. Be humble. F.B. needs you but he knows that the Goodwill work isnot an American movement but an international one; he has travelled much andseen the need. This you cannot really know as your life circumstances and yourkarma have confined you largely to [681] one single and distant locality.Broaden your horizon and bring in Europe, Australia and distant Asia and—as yourvision quickens—you will arrive at understanding. Contribute your ideas andsuggestions to the reservoir of plans at Headquarters and learn to consider andtake part in other people’s plans besides your own.What more can I say to you, my brother? We are ancient co-workers and those withwhom you are associated with in New York are your true co-workers, far more thanthose well- intentioned aspirants you seek to dominate in your environment. Workclosely with your co-disciples and with the Ashram members. They all love youand want your cooperation. A.A.B. wants to see certain things accomplished inthe relatively brief interlude which is left to her. Will you help? F.B. isgoing to need you and many like you as the work expands in the new cycle. Willyou stand by him, by my work, and by me?My love goes out to you. Much in your present situation and spiritual dilemmareminds me of myself when I was in preparation for the third initiation;therefore, I understand and with this thought I leave you and will not fail you.~TO D. I. J.January 1940For you, my brother, I have somewhat the same message as I gave to S.C.P. Freeyourself from the glamour of inherited ideas and national concepts andprejudices. The world picture is clearer and more beautiful than you know,seeing it as you do today through the windows of prejudice, pain and limitation.If I sound harsh in so speaking, it is simply because I, the Master D.K., valuewhat you will be able to do and be when you have released yourself from theglamour of prejudice. You have made real progress in this condition but there ismuch still to be done and this your heart of love can accomplish once you seeclearly and with understanding the true nature of your glamour. There are manypoints of view, coming from the many types of men, the many races [682] and themany nations and grades of human beings. Who, my brother, are you to determinewhat is right and which point of view is correct? The Hierarchy sees the beautyin them all. Ponder on this and seek to see it too.~MY BROTHER: August 1940A.A.B. has told me of your comment on the quality of my communications with thegroup, that you felt the need of a greater expression of love. There was no needfor her to tell me as I had “listened in” on the group (as you call it in radiolanguage) and I saw your thought, but she wanted to ask me to deal with thismatter as it will be of service to the group; she also sensed your sinceredesire.I wonder, my brother, if you realise that the basis of your feeling lies in yourreaction to the short instruction I gave you earlier in the year? This you didnot like, nor did you truly agree with what I said, nor have you really freedyourself from the prejudices to which I referred and for two reasons:1. Your judgment is clouded by your resentment to what you, perhaps naturally,regarded as a criticism.2. Your sensitivity and your reaction to glamour tunes you in very frequently ona certain section of public opinion and when this happens (as it is happeningtoday) you are no longer a free agent.My underlying thought when giving you that instruction was to awaken you to thefact that your feelings and loyalties are based on a class idea and on classresentment and not on clear thinking through to the facts which should conditionall loyalties and partisanships. It is not the objectives or the decisions ofthose loyalties with which I am dealing. Those are entirely your own affair andare of no real importance in the light of eternity, but I am endeavouring toawaken you to the condition of your emotional reactions and to the quality [683]which motivated you—not clear thinking and then decision, but prejudice,resentment and fear.But today I shall not deal with this. You know enough to deal with it yourselfor at least to realise the truth of my criticism of your attitude but not ofyour decision. That which works out into expression upon the physical plane isnot the concern of the members of the Hierarchy. They concern themselves withmotives and predispositions and it was with these that I was dealing.Brother of old, we have worked together for some time—for some years. I havechosen you for instruction and to be part of my group of disciples and thischoice, being accepted and responded to by you, indicates relationship,activity, and an allegiance which will confront you for many lives. Have I ever,since the time that our relationship started in this life, failed to meet yourneed when that need was of a spiritual nature, determining character andconditioning the future? Is not such a response on my part an expression of truelove? Love is not making the object of the love feel comfortable superficially.If I induced that reaction in you, I would not merit your confidence and trustand in the long run I would not thus hold your respect. Love is far-seeingwisdom which seeks to keep alive in the object of that love those sensitivitieswhich will guarantee safe progress. Love is, therefore, guarding, stimulatingand protective. But it is not a personal matter. It is a positive protection,but does not lead to a negative attitude of being cared for on the part of theone who is the recipient of the love and protection. It is the stimulating powerof divine love which I seek to pour out upon you and upon all whom I serve asMaster and Teacher. This will lead you wisely to protect yourself from glamour,illusion and personality reactions, also from error and prejudice in order thebetter to serve both Humanity and the Hierarchy. Ponder on this.These are days of terrific stress and strain, far greater and more far reachingthan you can guess or grasp. We who work on the inner side of life and who dealwith the mass movements and reactions of humanity, and who have kept [684] thelight shining with radiance no matter how dark the night of human affairs maybe, have ourselves to rest back on the understanding selflessness of ourdisciples. We have not the time or the inclination (in the light of greaterneed) to waste in useless gestures or loving phrases, of teaching so tactfullyworded that much of its import might be lost, and in making our disciples awareof their personal relation to us. There is a personal relation or you would notbe in my group, but it is of secondary importance to your group interrelationand activity. There is no need for me thus to explain but it seemed advisableonce and for all to make clear that my failure (should I call it that, mybrother?) to express love in words to any of you and also my expressed intentionto waste no time in indicating weaknesses in character and areas of failure inperformance must not be and should not be interpreted by you as harshness,failure to understand or a detachment so cold that my very impersonality woulddefeat its own ends. What all of you need to grasp with greater clarity, both asindividuals and as a group, is the present need of humanity and the law ofcycles. The urgency of the time and the uniqueness of the opportunity seemlittle understood by most of you.Again, my brother, have you realised that if I evoked from you a personalitydevotion I should be hindering you and in no way demonstrating to you that soullove which actuates all my reactions to each and all of you. Your sixth raypersonality would respond to such an attitude on my part and then—what wouldthat feed and develop in you? Just self-satisfaction and a settling back uponthe fact of relationship and not upon the fact of the soul. It would produce anincrease of the glamour to which you are prone. In past lives, your progress hasbeen from one devotion to another, from one position of pledged fealty toanother. In this life, you are faced with the opportunity to free yourself fromsuch personality reactions and relations and become stabilised in soulbehaviour. It is to this end that I help you. Disciples would do well toappreciate somewhat the problem of the Master. He has to watch the effect of allthe energy which flows from Him to His disciples and to guard against itsstimulating [685] unduly their personalities, and thus tend to the evocation ofpersonality reactions.Will you therefore rest back on facts and lived experience and waste not time inwishing and in emotional reactions? You have made much progress in this life, mybrother. You are not young but that, in your case, need not deter you fromfurther search for liberation, based on a planned relinquishing. Sixth rayaspirants have a particularly hard task at the close of this Piscean age, due tothe sixth ray expression of the Christian era. Today the energies areconcretising and working through that which is old and honoured, that which is“conditioned by gold” (as the saying is) and that which belongs to a passingage—an age which should pass. This affects also your sixth ray personality and,consequently, from many angles your allegiances and your loyalties are motivatedby the sixth ray and based on personality decisions and not on the illuminedvision of the soul. The fact, however, that you have broken with orthodoxy wheretheology is concerned indicates (to us who watch) a great measure ofemancipation and of emerging soul control. You will find, if your intuition getsmore dynamic and your first ray astral body (the ray of government and politics)does not unduly affect you, that an increasing measure of thought release willbe yours.In this connection and in order to enlarge your perspective, I would add thatChristian Science is a fifth ray expression of thought and was one of theeffects of the incoming fifth ray life. A very large number of ChristianScientists are either fifth or sixth ray egos, for this particular school ofthought was one of the means whereby the fanatical emotional idealism(engendered by the potency of the sixth ray influence dominant for so manycenturies) could be offset, and the mental grasp of truth and of life carefullyfostered. Under its influence, the stage was set on which many mystics couldbegin to organise their mental bodies and discover that they had minds whichcould be used, and thus be prepared for the occult way. It is therefore amasculine or positive influence in its general effect, but its positivity is inrelation to the personality—the mind as the factor dominating [686] the humanexpression. It can, and eventually will, be negative to the soul, revealing thehigher mind. It is interesting whilst considering the pairs of opposites (thenegative and positive factors) to study the following groupings:Spirit Positive I. Soul Balancing Personality Negative ~ Higher mind PositiveII. Soul The point of balance Lower mind Negative ~ Lower Mind Positive III.Emotional nature Field for balancing Brain NegativeYou have, in the above groupings, three great fields of reflection. Thesegroupings can also be worked out in many ways. It must be borne in mind that (asH.P.B. points out) any such groupings, such as the seven principles, will varyaccording to the point in evolution of the investigator.I will give you now a personal meditation which will serve, I hope, to lift thelife of the astral body out of the solar plexus into the heart centre, thusbreaking down some of the limitations which will disappear when the astral bodyand the sixth ray astral force are transmuted and love of the whole takes theplace of love of the part.1. Take up the position mentally of the Observer. Your fourth ray mind shouldenable you to observe with detachment the conflict between the personality andthe soul.2. Then, noting the dim light of the personality and the bright radiance of thesoul, observe then another duality, i.e., the bright and powerful light orinfluence of the solar plexus and the wavering, fluctuating light of the heartcentre. [687]3. Then, through the power of the imagination, focus your consciousness in theradiant soul and hold it there steadily, linking the soul and the head centre,again by the power of thought.4. Then sound the OM three times, breathing out the energy of the soul into thethreefold personality and bringing that energy to rest (as in a reservoir offorce) in the ajna centre. There hold it, enhancing the light of the personalitywith the radiance of the soul.5. Next say:“The light of the soul puts out the dim light of the personality as the sun putsout the flame of a small fire. Soul radiance takes the place of personalitylight. The sun is substituted for the moon.”6. Then, definitely throw the light and energy of the soul into the heart centreand believe—through the power of the creative imagination—that it evokes such apowerful, vibratory activity that it acts like a magnet in relation to the solarplexus. The energy of the solar plexus is lifted up or drawn up into the heartcentre and is there transmuted into soul love.7. Then still as the Observer, see the reversal of the earlier process. Thesolar plexus is dimmed. The radiance of the heart is substituted. The light ofthe soul remains unchanged but the light of the personality is greatlybrightened.8. Then again as the soul, united with the personality, sound the OM seventimes, breathing it out into your environment.This, my brother, is more of a visualisation exercise than a meditation, but itsefficacy is dependent upon your ability as a spiritual observer to preservemental continuity as you do it. Energy follows thought and this is the basis ofall occult practice and is of prime significance in this exercise. You willdiscover that if you do this exercise with regularity and with no biassed ideaas to results, that changes will be [688] wrought in your consciousness of alasting nature and the light of the group will also be stronger.~August 19421. Much you have learnt, my brother on the Way, and closer to the centre of alllife you stand. Let knowledge now be shown as lighted wisdom and gentle lovingpoise.2. Let tenderness emerge like a stream of healing strength. Ponder therelationship of tenderness and strength when devoid of selfish interest andunrestrained devotion.3. Guard well the servant of the soul, the bodily frame, and shorten not theterm of service. There is much for you to do.4. Prepare for changes and welcome each departure from the normal way. Cultivatea fluidness of living when demand arises.5. Two there are upon the inward way whom you must carry in your heart and seekto reach. C.D.P. is one; the other is more easily attained.6. Each Thursday night, when sleep descends upon your eyes, seek Me and knowthat I am there.~BROTHER OF MINE: September 1943The years slip away, do they not? And each year sees and should see changes. Inmy last set of injunctions, if I may call them so, which I gave you a year ago,I asked you to prepare for changes. I have an idea, my brother, that youinterpreted that to mean physical changes in your life—the changes whichenvironment and circumstance impose upon a person, which cannot be avoided. Butit was not to this kind of change that I referred. Let me see if I can make whatI intended to convey to you somewhat clearer.There are certain changes which disciples must themselves initiate; these maynot touch environing outer conditions, but concern inner developments, attitudesand mental processes. These self-initiated decisions can and do lead to [689]basic inner unsettlements (is there such a word?), and these inner disturbancesare necessary to and preparatory to great inner crises. These inner crises leadto points of tension, as well you know, and from a point of tension the mergingsoul-personality can then move onward into greater light and a more surelyrealised Love.With devotion and steadfastness you have stood, down the years. Of this I amaware, and for all that you have accomplished I am happy. The question I now askyou, my brother, and am wording in a current phrase in order to arrest yourattention is this: Where do you go from here? What is your next step? Can youtake another step this life? Can you put your finger on something in yourconsciousness—subtle perhaps and unseen by others except by those with a trulyperceptive attention—which, if altered or developed, discarded or intensified,would bring about a great and surprising unfoldment—an unfoldment much to bedesired, prior to entering upon another incarnation.You are probably now assuming that I am referring to faults, handicaps orlimitations. Perhaps I am. I might, however, be indicating the need to fostersome divine quality, to move some latent spiritual attribute into a moreprominent position in your life, or suggesting that you intensify some spiritualcontribution that you are or could be making. That is for you to discover in thesecret place of your own heart. At any rate, my brother and my tried friend, youknow that until the final initiation is taken, all progress is a series ofreleases, and that from stage to stage of liberation we pass onward into light.You are not young. You have a somewhat frail body. You take with pain anddistaste the impacts of life, and you seek ever to measure up in truth andsincerity to the presented opportunity. You are prone to think that life must befor you now largely a process of waiting; that there is little that you canfurther do; in this you are wrong. You can most definitely love more—with lessdevotion to the few and with a greatly increased inclusiveness and depth for themany; you can free yourself from certain thoughtforms which condition much ofyour thinking; you can learn more easily the [690] lesson that to be a truedisciple means desiring what is best for all humanity, and not what you think isbest in terms of some group, some school of thought, or some historical, orpolitical sequence. You must learn to think in larger terms than those of somenational group or group of nations. That means an intensified study upon thePlan and this means quiet reflection within yourself, not reading books orsubjecting yourself to deep meditation; it means the breaking down of ancientprejudices and preconceived ideas, so that that which is new and totallydifferent to what you have surmised or thought can enter into your thinking andcondition your future.Unless you can do this (and it is not easy for you to break loose from traditionand background) crystallisation is apt to set in, and that is something which Iknow you fear and which need not happen. The great preventive to any growinghardness or rigidity of perception is Love, and the great lesson for alldisciples is to love more and more until the Day be with us.I am not being very definite and specific with you, my brother. You need it not,for you are an experienced and tried soldier and you are singularly free fromglamour, though susceptible to established and powerful thoughtforms. Theselatter can always be dissipated by love—developed and consciously expressed—butit is not so with glamour. That is a much harder task, as you know well, havingwatched the struggles of L.T.S-K. for so many years with sympathy andcomprehension. You have given him more of that than almost anyone else in thegroup and in his immediate circle of co-disciples. It is because glamour has nolure for you.As to your meditation, I am only going to give you certain words which you canincorporate into the general meditation at any point which you may deemappropriate. I would ask you to give five minutes at least to a dynamicconcentration upon these words. Study them—as far as you can—from the angle ofthe world of meaning and in relation to your attitude to humanity as a whole. Donot consider them from the angle of your personal relationships or your personalenvironing circumstances. All that I have said indicates your need to [691]relate these ideas to universal concepts; that is for you the next practicalstep. I give you six words or phrases, and during the coming year you cantherefore deal with them twice:1st month . . . . . Humanity. The framework of Experience.2nd month . . . . .Fluidity. Reaction to new Impression.3rd month . . . . .The Ashram. The centre of radiating Love.4th month . . . . . Money. The medium of loving Distribution.5th month . . . . . Recognition. The mode of divine Relationship.6th month . . . . . Identification. The key to Understanding.These words are probably not what you might anticipate, but they will open up toyou a group and mental approach to realisation, and that is the way for you toproceed. Your keen analytical mind will know what to do with these matters. Iwould suggest, for the process to be employed, that you approach each phraseeach month with three questions. Let me illustrate for you what I mean by takingtwo words out of the six:Humanity What does humanity mean to me in reality? What new development facesthe human family? Can I contribute by my thinking to this new unfoldment? Whatdoes recognition mean to me? What new recognitions confront all disciples? Howcan I develop the power to recognise the new, the divine, and the reality whichis already here?From these suggestions you can adapt three questions to each of the remainingwords.It will be apparent to you, my beloved brother, that what I am really doing istraining you for a special piece of service—the service of thoughtform buildingin the New Age. This you can do if you will free yourself from prejudices and[692] from criticism of certain individuals. This service you can do in thequiet of your home and without undue effort, and you will learn to do thisbecause you love and will love increasingly.I enfold you within my aura and with security, and from that point of safety Iask you to go forth upon the work of the Ashram.~MY BROTHER AND MY FRIEND: November 1944I would like to start this instruction with a word of commendation. The enteringstream of love is much more potent now than it was. Years ago and even monthsago this was not so. Today, the second ray strains (if I may call them so) inyour equipment are far more dominant than heretofore. Had you realised howover-potent was your first ray astral body? It conditioned you unduly and ithindered you from seeing all around the picture of your relation to humanity. Itforced you almost fanatically to adhere to certain ideas and concepts which wereemotionally aroused and which were related principally to the people and therelatives with whom you associated. You frequently failed to see life from theangle of the ordinary man and from the effect which karma produced in the lifeof the average citizen. You thought in terms of one group. This you are learningto negate and the loneliness of your present life has greatly aided yourwithdrawal from this astral concentration upon a group thoughtform.I have earlier told you that you are being trained to work with thoughtformcreating processes. Hence, another reason for the long hours by yourself whichcharacterise your life at this time and which will be expressive of your daysfor the remainder of your life. To this desire of your soul you must happilyreconcile yourself. Because of this planned training—planned with the consent ofyour soul and of me, your Master—you are already peculiarly susceptible to groupthoughtforms; you must learn increasingly to work under the influence of the Lawof Abstraction.[693] This is a law which is ever present in the world in relation to theprocesses of death. The aspect of its importance in connection with physicaldeath is deemed of slight importance in comparison to its emphasis in connectionwith the world of thought. The training given to a disciple when he enters theperiphery of an Ashram lays an emphatic emphasis upon the need of abstractingone’s consciousness from phase after phase of thought. The lesson of detachmentin relation to one’s possible emotional attachments is hard to learn, but adisciple must have mastered much of it, prior to entering the Ashram. When hedoes this, the inference is that detachment is now one of his establishedprocesses. However, the process of abstracting one’s mind from all imposedthoughtforms—imposed by one’s background, one’s tradition and one’s socialgroup—is a very difficult and subtle undertaking. It must definitely be learned,prior to mastering the science of thoughtform building. The disciple has tostand free from mental impression and mental concepts before he can successfullycreate under direction of the Ashram.When the Law of Abstraction is wielded consciously by you from within theAshram, you will discover that it has (as it might have been expected) variousmeanings and policies which will function on the different planes ofconsciousness, such as:1. Death or the effect of the Law of Abstraction upon the physical plane. Thiscan refer to the abstraction of the life principle from the physical body inresponse to soul command; it can refer to the death of an old physical planerelationship; it can also refer to a cycle of physical plane conditioning orcircumstance, to the termination of a relation to a physical plane group, or tothe abstraction of an interest regarded hitherto as basic.2. The termination of an outgoing affection towards a person or a group ofpersons upon the astral plane. This can precipitate a definite emotional crisiswhich brings about the withdrawal of devotion to people or causes. Thisstatement covers the intensity of the emotion, [694] expressed in many andvaried directions. Emotional abstraction is the hardest lesson which a disciplehas to master.3. The severing of connection with specific lines of thought. This may refer tothe preconceived need which may dawn increasingly upon the disciple as he drawscloser to the Ashram to which he is assigned; it may and will lead him to severconnection with schools of thought and with social, political, religious andcircumstantial thoughtforms (using the word “circumstantial” to mean the mentalconditioning brought about by circumstance), prior to being immersed in anyashramic thoughtform.These specific abstractions are being rapidly learned by you; you shouldtherefore enter your next life infinitely more liberated than you now are, andshould function freer for service. Your present life condition is veryfavourable to your progress along these lines, and this I think you know, evenif it displeases you to recognise the truth.The entire process is one of abstraction, involving pain. There is a closerelation between pain and the law with which I am dealing. It is the Law ofAbstraction which lifts a disciple out of the three worlds of human endeavour;it is this same law which brings about the upward drive which all units of lifeexpress and the search of all of them for identification with the ONE; it iswith this law that you—along with all disciples—must learn to work.I would give you the following words for meditative reflection:1. Abstraction 5. Renunciation 2. Detachment 6. Withdrawal 3. Liberation 7.Negation 4. Relinquishment 8. Rejection 9. The OMAll these words embody certain major preparatory lessons. You will note howincreasingly, as this particular group [695] develops, I have ceased to givestanzas and symbolic phrases and have endeavoured to centre your attention uponwords . I would have you deal with these words from the purely physical angle,from the quality angle, and from the purpose angle, as well as that of divineidentification. Please use the process outlined for disciples in The Yoga Sutrasof Patanjali. (The Light of the Soul, Book I.17.) In these words you haveadequate work for the remainder of your life. Approach them with considerationfrom the angle of personality detachment, from the angle of soul detachment,particularly when the antahkarana can be consciously used. In this way, greatdivine potencies can be used, and as one abstraction after another is masteredan increasing liberation will be sensed by you. Keep full notes and in a year’stime (if you care to do so) bring these monthly notes all together and write apaper upon the Law of Abstraction as it makes its presence felt in the mind of atypical disciple. This will be of service to you and also to your groupbrothers.Strive to cultivate a happy spirit. Let not life, loneliness or anycircumstances unduly depress you. Dwell not too much upon world horror, butaim—in meditation—at conveying strength and wisdom to the world leaders as theyseek (as they do) to bring order out of chaos. I would like to see you resumeyour work in the teaching group. You have the time, my brother, and a definiteservice which you needs must render would be good for you. Your help is needed.You can, if you so desire, move forward into a clearer and closer relation to meand to my Ashram. You must, however, bear in mind that every step forward intothe light and into a closer relation to the Hierarchy is made under theinfluence of the Law of Abstraction. Be strong, therefore, and know that thepowerful qualities of your second ray soul relate you to D.H.B. and J.S.P. Takethem into your daily meditation upon the plane of the soul, and remember thatyou three form an inner triangle which has certain spiritual activities for anesoteric objective for which this present incarnation is only preparatory.My thought is yours, my brother, and I am not abstracting [696] or withdrawingmy love or my attentive care of your interests.~MY BROTHER AND LOVED FRIEND: August 1946In publishing the book Discipleship in the New Age , your friend and teacher,A.A.B. made the remark at the end of your instructions that you “still persistin your endeavour to work in the Tibetan’s Ashram and remain steadfast andsure.” A.A.B. knew what she was saying, but I wonder if you yourself realise theesoteric values of steadfastness and surety? The rarest compliment was knowinglymade to you by A.A.B., but you probably did not understand its significance. Astable vibration is the keynote of the universe; surety is the sign of theKnower. These are two qualities of which you are in possession to the point ofexpression; I would have you realise it and count upon their registration in theAshram you so much love.In your hours of loneliness, and when you realise that life for you is mainly awaiting process, you are apt to forget these two facts which I have brought toyour attention. Fight not against disability or against what the world calls“old age.” This is a thing you are very apt to do, and it is a normal reaction.Why not welcome Transition? Learn to glory in experience, which is the gift ofwise old age, and look forward to the Great Adventure which confronts you. Youknow well—in your highest moments—that that Transition means realisation withoutany physical plane limitations.My brother, the ray of your astral body is the first; the failure, weakness orsin of the astral body is delusion. In your case, it is the delusion ofpride—social pride—and of this you must rid yourself. It is not a mentalquality, for if it were, sound thinking would soon show the futility of socialpride. In the eyes of the Masters of the Wisdom, there are only human beings atvarious stages of unfoldment, of developing selfishness or of unfolding service.There are no classes such as the world recognises, neither is there any age,except the age of the soul; that need cause you no concern; your soul [697] isold in its expression on the physical plane, and you know this to be so.Pay not undue attention to the physical vehicle. Its preservation is of nomoment and can—as in your case—become of too prominent importance. The time ofyour liberation is set by karmic law; this ever determines the demise of thereal man within the body, but if the physical body is unduly nurtured, and if itbecomes the recipient of undue care, it can hold that real man in prison indefiance of karmic law. That is a sorry spectacle to watch, for it means thatthe physical elemental is assuming power. Be careful in this connection, for theray of your physical body would easily produce this situation.Not so long ago—two years ago, I believe—I gave you nine words for your matureconsideration. Today, I will give you twelve seed thoughts which (for theremainder of your life) should govern your morning reflection, following adefinite process of linking with me and with my Ashram. Here are the seedthoughts:1. Looking forward. 7. Life purpose, persistent ever. 2. Hope. 8. Friendship. 3.Immortality. 9. The triangle: yourself, D.H.B., J.S.P. 4. Radiation. 10. Eternalpersistence. 5. Freedom from partisanship. 11. Quality. 6. Anticipation. 12.Future Mastership.These ideas are suggestive and would prove fruitful and lead to much expansivethinking.You are in my Ashram and for ever have naught to fear.~TO L. U. T.August 19421. The path of the pledged disciple is one of constant rending. The discipledoes the rending. You have not yet [698] achieved the beauty of acceptance—theacceptance that releases.2. Project your values to a higher sphere and know that nothing mattersconnected with the earthly role of life, save learning understanding. To thatattain.3. There are three souls who can in differing ways lead to achievement of yourliberation: one, close to you, because she needs a guiding, loving understandingheart; one you will meet and needs must save; the other is Myself. For threelives now I have sought to serve your need. Respond in love to all these three.4. Break through the double cloud which has so long erased the vision from yourheart. You have the vision but it is ever on ahead. When will it pierce thecloud and settle in your heart?5. Health, strength and opportunity confront your steps. A new departure cantoday open the door to greater, fuller life. Move on.6. Let the ray of your soul dominate the man of everyday and become a radiantcentre of saving force.~MY WARRIOR (OR SHOULD I SAY “WARRING”?) BROTHER: November 1944I call you this, for never do you cease fighting and struggling, sometimes underthe urge of your soul and oft under the influence of a restless and unhappypersonality emphasis. Can you not begin to cease from strife and struggle, andthus give opportunity for the evolution of that loving spirit which your firstray isolated personality seeks to hide, and often quite successfully? There isan aspect of the relationship between the first and second rays which is veryapt to be overlooked. The second ray is outgoing, inclusive, friendly and proneto attachment; the first ray is isolated, exclusive, antagonistic and prone todetachment. It is the conflict between these two energies—brought together inone incarnation—which has brought about the distorted and unhappy lifeconditions which have characterised you, which you [699] recognise, and whichcause you so much real distress. It is time that this clashing of the two forcesshould end, and the conflict can only be determined by the subjugation of yourfirst ray personality by your second ray soul. That is a clear statement of factand indicates your immediate and essential endeavour. Your focus ofidentification has been the personality, but so strong is your soul quality thatit leaves your personality constantly disturbed. Your aim, therefore, should beto cultivate all the characteristics which are the most distasteful to yourlower nature—contact with other people, particularly with your group brothers,friendliness to and interest in all you meet, inclusiveness and the developmentof an outgoing spirit of goodwill to strangers and to friends. I have instructedD.I.J. to learn to work with the Law of Abstraction; I tell you to practise areverse attitude to all life circumstances and contacts and to lose yourself inthe interests of your associates and of humanity. Can you do this, my brother?At least you can try.How can I help you to bring in the power of your loving, intelligent soul sothat it can release your personality from its fever and bring about an orderedquiet in your life? There is so little that I can tell you that you do notalready know; you have been under my instruction for many years, and you stillare. One of the major linking and blending processes is the creative work ofmusic. I would suggest to you that you bring music into your life far more thanyou have hitherto done, particularly orchestral music . In these days of radioprogrammes this is easily accomplished, and the effect of blended instrumentsand broad sound productions upon your personality will be to break down theopposition which it presents to soul contact and impose a different note and keyupon your life.Does this injunction surprise you, brother of old? You are on the verge ofrelease from the struggle of the past and can enter upon a more constructive andhappier phase of living if you permit music to play a major part in your liferhythm; choose only the best music, such as that played by the great symphonyorchestras. God created by the power of [700] sound, and the “music of thespheres” holds all life in being (note that phrase). The soul on its tiny scalecan create “the new man” by the power also of sound, and a musical rhythm canusefully be imposed upon the personality life by the disciple.This is what you need—music in your life, literally and figuratively. I havehere given you a most important hint. Let the great music of the masters ofsound enter (in a new and powerful way) into your consciousness. If you takethis advice, in three years, if you insist on subjecting yourself to the musicalimpact, I suggest great and significant changes will be brought about in yourlife. Once you get away from self-pity and irritation, there is little that iswrong with your thinking. That, my brother, can be said of few.I would like to see you enter within the inner place of the Ashram, yet youpersist in remaining on the periphery of its sphere of influence. Let love andlight and music enter more definitely into your daily life. Spurn not thispractical suggestion, but give your mind the opportunity, through the massedsound of music, to break down the personality-imposed barriers between the freeflow of soul life and you.There is little else that I can say. This is a short instruction. I standunchangingly ready to welcome you to a greater ashramic intimacy, but the movingforward into this closer relation must be accomplished by you—alone and unaided,except by my suggestions. There is naught more that I can do but to stand behindyou with love and understanding.~MY BROTHER: August 1946There is little I can say to you. For the remainder of your life you have onlyone thing to do: to prepare yourself for successful spiritual enterprise whenagain you return to incarnation. Surely you would like to re-enter physicalplane existence with a different and more adequate desire nature—a desire naturewhich has ever conditioned your physical body and militated against higherconditionings? Desire has ever driven you; at the same time, high aspiration hasgoaded [701] you, and between the two your life has been one of misery andfrustration, and frequently of despair.In spite of the profoundly unsatisfactory demonstration which you register inyour consciousness and of which I am also aware, you are still hovering on theperiphery of my Ashram; you are still linked to your group brothers and to me,even if you ignore them and me and go your own way, following your inclinationsat any cost. It is always hard when two major rays govern both the personalityand the soul. It indicates past achievement of a high order, for the transferfrom a minor ray is involved, and this is ever indicative of preparation—at somefuture date—for initiation. It indicates also great struggle, particularly whenthe first ray personality is strongly linked to the desire nature.All this you know, for there is nothing wrong with your intelligence, mybrother. What is wrong is that—in the face of knowledge—you will not use thewill to force the spiritual issue and to emerge once and for all into the clearlight of the soul. Nevertheless, it should not be hard for you to use the will,once contact can be more firmly established with the soul, for you are a firstray personality, and therefore the will aspect can be more easily contacted andcomprehended by you than by those on the other rays.R.S.W. helps you not, much as she has attempted to do so. She does not accept orrecognise you for what you are—a man whose lower nature dominates most of thetime, but whose basic intent is identification with the higher nature; she seesyou differently and her surety along this line is no help to you.I, your friend and teacher, know you as you are, and I understand; thatunderstanding forces me to stand by you (with steadfastness) behind the scenesready, at any moment, to make my presence felt when the higher triumphs and thelower is negated. You might ask me why this is so? I would answer that in thedistant past—a past which lies behind all of us—you made, at a terrific cost, asacrifice which permitted entry of the soul as a thread of radiant light. Bythat sacrifice much good came to me, and we, the Masters of the Wisdom, lay muchemphasis upon gratitude. It—with service—is [702] deeply scientific in natureand closely related to the Law of Karma. Gratitude is something about which youneed to learn, or the steady friendship of F.B. and A.A.B., as well as that ofyour group brothers, would evoke from you some recognition. Their friendship issoundly founded on the mental plane, and there is little that they can do tohelp in current conditions.What, then, my brother, shall we do? What shall I say to you in this my lastinstruction? First, let me say that I am hoping to see, in the next few years ofyour life, a complete reversal of the past. I look to see you apply, with willand spiritual insight, those physical disciplines which will feed youraspiration and negate and render futile all desire. I look to see you strengthenthe tie between yourself and me, your Master.Do you realise what is the task that confronts me where you are concerned? It isthe task of aiding you to transmute your personality nature into such aninstrument that your soul can remove you out of my Ashram into that of theMaster K.H. Such is my task with several of you in this group; you and they donot essentially belong in my Ashram but stay and work there until the spirituallaws control, the vision is firmly established, and the soul is in control. Willyou, with constancy, bear this in mind, and for the remaining years of your lifewrestle with the lower nature until it is purified, disciplined, enlightened andintegrated?I give you no set meditation. I enjoin upon you the prime necessity of linkingup with your soul, with the Ashram and with me three times a day. I would askyou to do this with a definite act of the will. This triple exercise, carriedforward in the morning, at noon, and when you retire at night, will be morepotent in transmutative effect than anything else that you can do. Forget notthat by means of this exercise you train the will, and you likewise bringspiritual energy into your personality in order to help you with the task, thespiritual task, ahead of you.On my cooperation you can ever count, but this is dependent upon your ability to“get through” to me. [703]~TO D. E. I.August 19421. As a chela in my Ashram you move through life with all the power which flowsout from that centre. Forget it not.2. The future opens up with much that must be done. Let not the doing intervenebetween the loving.3. Love all, as love all chelas, and let pity rule your acts.4. The noise and turmoil of the way of life is great and you respond with unduepain. Others escape in many ways and build a wall. For you, compassion is theway. Face facts and have compassion.5. Lift up the weak for you are strong, and strength from many comes to you.Attract that strength, then forward move with power to love and lift.6. Question not the staunchness of the strength and love which comes to you fromthree: Myself, your brother A.A.B., and one other, little guessed by you as yet.~MY BROTHER AND MY FRIEND: September 1943Since you entered the cycle beginning with your forty-second year, life has heldfor you constant change, many and drastic adjustments and much responsibility.To this must be added the turmoil and the chaos of the war. This has made greatdemands upon your strength and your judgment. You have responded well. You havehelped many and have grown in wisdom. You have shouldered responsibility forsome phase of the work initiated in my Ashram or by my co-disciple, A.A.B. Sheis not a member of my Ashram. You have my understanding and her unfailingsupport.Inevitably, my brother, this situation which you have had to handle in relationto the work for which you are responsible, in relation to your personal andfamily life and to the future which lies open before you, has entailed muchstrain. To these factors must be added another one which is that you areessentially alone. This basic loneliness is due to several [704] things: First,that you are in training for leadership, and leaders have to learn to standalone, and can ever do so if they love enough. Secondly, the force ofcircumstance and the need to work off certain karmic relations has increasedyour daily contacts, and at the same time has left you far more alone than youwere six years ago. Thirdly, because the greater can always include the less isa lesson which all leaders in training have to grasp; the reverse, my brother,is not true, and the result is loneliness. Ponder on all this and accept it;stand free and move forward on your chosen path, refusing to be limited by thosewho cannot go your pace. This again means loneliness. And finally, a need for amore loving understanding at times isolates you from your fellowmen,particularly from your co-workers, and you need to beware of a growing criticalspirit.The lessons of leadership are hard to learn, and with these lessons you will beconfronted as the years slip away—if you so wish and can face the music. Themusic is there and will emerge in full tonal quality once you have resolved thediscords and established the theme and the rhythm.What are the lessons which all true leaders have to learn? It might be ofservice to you if I put one or two before you—very briefly, so that you can (iftruly in earnest to serve your fellowmen, as I believe you are) begin to masterthem, to understand their need and to apply them to yourself with a view tofuller and more useful service.The first lesson is the lesson of vision . What are your goals? What is thespiritual incentive which will be and is strong enough to hold you steady to thepurpose and true to the objective? No one can formulate the vision for you; itis your own personality problem, and upon the strength of the vision and thebeauty of the picture which you paint with your imagination will depend muchthat you do and become.The second lesson is the development of a right sense of proportion . This, whentruly developed and correctly applied, will enable you to walk humbly on theWay. No true leader can be anything but humble, for he realises the magnitude ofhis task; he appreciates the limitations of his contribution (in the light ofthe vision) and the need for constant [705] self-development and the cultivationof the spirit of steady inner spiritual learning, if he is ever to make hisproper contribution. Therefore, keep learning; keep dissatisfied with yourselfand your attainment, not in any morbid sense, but so that the principle ofgrowth and of pushing forward and onward may be fostered in you. We help othersthrough our own effort to attain; this means clear thinking, humility andconstant adjustment.The third lesson is the development of the spirit of synthesis . This enablesyou to include all within the range of your influence and also to be includedwithin the range of influence of those greater than yourself. Thus is the chainof Hierarchy established. You still hold a somewhat isolated position, and thiswith the best intent in the world; but you need to love more deeply and moreunderstandingly. The hindrance here lies in your personality, which is more wisethan loving. Let your soul control your first ray personality more, and many ofyour present difficulties would disappear.Another lesson which in reality grows out of the above is the avoidance of thespirit of criticism , for criticism leads to barriers and loss of time. Learn todistinguish the spirit of criticism from the ability to analyse and makepractical application of the analysis. Learn to analyse life, circumstances andpeople from the angle of the work, and not from the angle of your personalitypoint of view; analyse also from the angle of the Ashram, and not from the angleof the executive or the schoolmaster upon the physical plane.In the six statements which I gave you a year ago were three sentences to whichI would call your further and close attention. They are:1. “Let not the doing intervene between the loving.”This has much to do with the distribution of time.Study the value of the heart at leisure from itself and its problems.2. “Lift up the weak, for you are strong, and strength from many comes to you.”This has to do with recognition. Be not entirely occupied with helping, but bewilling to be helped. [706]Study the value of the imagination in this connection.3. “You move through life with all the power which comes from out my Ashram.”This has to do with the handling of energy—and with energy of great potencywhich will not only invoke the best that is in you but will also evoke thelatent seeds of difficulty, which must perforce be removed.Study the task of living ever consciously in the Ashram and working from thatpoint of power and peace—going without, yet ever staying within.I am speaking thus directly to you, my co-worker, because the future holds muchof useful service for you, if you continue to be a learner. It takes time,humility and certain recognitions, within yourself, of place and position in thechain of Hierarchy. I cannot too strongly emphasise that to you. Let not thepressures of family life (and no family life is devoid of pressures) and theexigencies of the work, plus the activities of an active mind, interfere withthe inner learning process which is so essential to all teaching-leaders. That,my brother, is what you can be.A.A.B. has spoken to me of you from the standpoint of your place in the work ofthe School. She has not touched upon the personality angles or the need forspecial developments and growth, for no trained disciple, such as she is, everinterferes with the relation between a Master and His chela. She knows that yourrelation to me is that. But she has spoken to me about you from the angle of thefuture. I asked her what she felt was your major need and one that you must meetas you prepare for a larger field of service when she passes over. She made anunexpected reply. She said: “The need for a more fertile imagination.” She isentirely right.The imagination is a creative faculty. Wherein are you thus creative? Can youpicture to yourself by any flight of imagination the task ahead of the ArcaneSchool, for instance, in the post-war world, and your approach to the problemfrom the angle of what you would like to change or see altered? Changes meannothing unless they are the result of new vision, for if they emerge out of acriticism of the past [707] and of what has been done, they will prove uselessfrom the angle of the spiritual life, no matter how useful they may be from theangle of the organisation.Have you the perception to realise what an esoteric school essentially has tobe? It is not an organised method of meeting world problems, of organising neworders and ways of living, or of underwriting the efforts of the men and womenof goodwill. It goes far deeper than that. All the above are only effects of theesoteric life. Can you imagine your position when—from the teaching angle, theesoteric angle—you may have to be a source of inspiration, and not A.A.B.? Fromwhence will you draw inspiration, and how will you make the world of meaning andthe spiritual realities real and provocative to the neophyte?Can your imagination picture to you your reaction when—because you are theleader—you have to shoulder all the blame for any failure, even when notpersonally responsible; you have to accept without retaliation the attacks ofthose you are trying to help, who expect too much from you and who force you tolive in the blaze of public opinion; what will you do when your chosen workersfail to understand or prove disloyal or criticise without warrant or pit theirambitions against you, and wilfully refuse to see your point of view, and talkabout you among other people and whip up resentments against you—resentmentswhich are probably without foundation? These are not the kind of things thatyour personality easily accepts, and your creative imagination had better begindealing with these problems so that the emerging principles of conduct may standclear before you. Have you the inner grace of heart to admit error and weaknessor to say that you made a mistake in technique or method or approach, injudgment or in speech, should need arise to heal a breach and in the interestsof the work? That has never come easily to you either, my brother. It is a thingyou seldom do.And having said all this, let me point out your assets and the valuable giftswhich you can bring to the work and have for years contributed; they are thequalities which make A.A.B. your loyal friend and ambitious for your progress.[708] You have a recognition of principles which is vital and somewhat rare, andon principles all true work is securely founded. You have a gift ofimpersonality, as a general rule, which is a great safeguard; and in those timeswhen your personality impulses have controlled, the phase has not been lasting.You have a gift of teaching, clear insight and executive ability and a lovingheart when it is sparked into compassion. You have a steadfastness of purposeand an unswerving adherence to duty and dharma and a capacity to shoulderresponsibility which has, in the past, and will in the future, prove invaluableto the work required. You have the gift of the written word and an increasingability to speak, and these are valuable assets indeed when wielded by the soulon behalf of others. You are impulsive, and this at times creates temporarydifficulties, but the general trend and tendency of your impulses is right andtruly oriented. This is a major asset in your life. You are a pledged andaccepted disciple, with the power of your Master’s Ashram behind you and thelove of your co-disciples with you.You have the understanding and loyal affection of A.A.B., and will—from life tolife. Against her wishes, I ask you to give her in some small measure what shehas so largely given you. At times you fail to grasp the strength of her beliefin you. Her health is precarious and she counts much on you. Fail her not, andseek to understand the problems with which she is faced.You have also my belief and trust, my confidence that you will carry on—learningand living and loving—and again I repeat, on the strength coming from my Ashramyou can count, but it reaches you through your soul, and therefore a closer soulcontact is increasingly needed by you as the work grows and develops.~MY FRIEND AND CO-WORKER: November 1944I intend to be in touch with you with constancy, and you must train yourself toan increased sensitivity to my presence and to the contact of my mind. Contactwith me will affect [709] your heart centre; contact with my mind will bringabout changes in your head centre—probably (at this stage of your development)in the ajna centre. Sensitivity is one of your major needs. That involves afreer use of the imaginative faculty, as I told you in my last instruction. Youneed badly to develop sensitivity not only to me, your Master (for that youyourself desire), but a greatly increased sensitivity to your co-disciples.Above everything else, you must develop a much more sensitive response to allyou contact in your life of service. That is primarily what you lack; it isbased upon a definite lack of true love in your nature. You earnestly, andusually successfully, do your duty to all you meet, with certain exceptionswhere your personality is almost violently antagonistic; but more than this isneeded in a leader upon the second ray line of teaching.You are one of the people (relatively few) who have a sound and beautiful groupeffect, but your individual contacts are not so constructive, and it is alongthis line that you must work. You must learn to set up a helpful and anunderstanding relation with all who come your way—high and low, rich and poor,the socially important and the under classes, the likable and unlikable. Theneed to develop this was one of the reasons, plus incorporation in nationalkarma, which has temporarily removed you from an active participation in thework you have done so well for years. You are being given an interlude whereinyou can enrich your life, add something needed to your equipment, and thenreturn to your previous work and service with far more to give than heretofore.This I know would be your own desire; I have here given you the clue to itsfulfilment.One of the ways in which you can arrive at this deeper comprehension of humanitylies in the unfoldment of the creative imagination; this will enable you to tunein upon the background and the consciousness of people contacted. You are a manof strong likes and dislikes; you have also prided yourself upon the fact thatno matter how much you might dislike a person, you would endeavour to do rightby him and you usually succeed in so doing, with the exception of threepeople—dislike of whom renders you unreasonable [710] and often unkind. Who theyare you well know, and it is not my intention to mention their names, as thisrelationship is entirely your own affair.But, my brother, a working disciple entrusted with a definite task by hisMaster, and working from within the Ashram (as you do), must work not only froma sense of duty and deep intense devotion, not only from a sense of karmicresponsibility and a knowledge that the task undertaken is, by reason of soulinjunction, obediently followed, but he must work also under the inspiration oftrue Love. You have a second ray soul, and when it is in control, your attitudeis all that could possibly be desired; you have (which is unusual) a second raymental nature. This enables you to realise theoretically what should be yourattitude and to know exactly when and where love does not control. Your firstray personality and astral vehicle provide barriers to the free flow of love andimpede a constant contact with the soul, imposing themselves between the souland the three lower vehicles. They also come between the soul and the physicalbody, stopping or hindering the downflow of the energy of love into the vital oretheric body, from whence it would automatically control and actuate thephysical life expression.The existence and the possibilities inherent in the concentration of these twofirst ray energies in your personality should have the effect of adding strengthand potency to the inflow of the love factor, and they should enable you toisolate the energy of love with facility and apply it one-pointedly. I tell youthis for your encouragement.One other thing I would point out. It should be recognised by you that yourentire ray equipment is so well balanced that your capacity to serve the Ashramand humanity is very great, provided that you unify all these forces into oneintelligent, serving and constructive unity. You are singularly well equipped;you have a dual capacity to use second ray energy to enhance and implement theuse of the teaching ability; you have also a third ray contact with the physicalplane which should enable you to focus and utilise all this inherent capacityupon the physical plane in outer effective human service. You have made greatstrides in so doing, [711] and it is only when your first ray isolationism,implemented by your personality and emotional natures, obliterates for a moment(in relation to other human beings) your second ray qualities that your physicalplane output is affected, and it is sometimes affected quite seriously. Unlessyou consider this matter and remove the impediments to the free play of yourlove nature, you will always be a trusted server, but your field of service willbe needlessly circumscribed and you will not be able to serve as generously andsuccessfully as you otherwise might. Always you will serve; always you will havethe freedom of the Ashram, and always you will have access to me, earning myconfidence, and always you will persist. But I seek greater things for you, andso does A.A.B.The work of the Arcane School holds in it much of promise—far more than atpresent appears. Workers will emerge who will be entrusted with wideresponsibility, and A.A.B. will give them a free hand as she has ever given youwithin the limits of the School’s principles and objectives. The leadership ofthe Arcane School must be that of a group, when A.A.B. is not with you and haspassed on to other and more important inner work; this group will necessarily beunder the general direction of F.B., but certain of you will have muchresponsibility and power, provided there is potent and correct motivation, andthat you work with self-effacement; love ever produces the retirement into thebackground of the personality and its attitudes.I would thank you, my brother, for all that you have done, your influence hasbeen good and useful to many, and I am well aware of it; A.A.B. has alsoexpressed her appreciation to you on several occasions.The interlude of work upon which you are now engaged should give you the timefor much inner reflection; it should deepen your power to live the dual life ofa disciple. Get ready, therefore, for a resumption of my work when the righttime comes, returning to it with a wider understanding, a more expressive love,and a more enthusiastic dedication to the principle of service. A.A.B. (if I mayagain point this out) has a deep appreciation of you and love for you, bothpersonality and egoic in origin, and you can do much to lift [712] burdens offher shoulders, if you so desire. She never troubles about the inevitable andunimportant mistakes that her workers make. She has made them herself and knowstheir relative unimportance. She troubles greatly when there is amisinterpretation of principles, a side-tracking of major issues, or a generalinertia. Stand by her. With the unfailing love of F.B. and the developedunderstanding of yourself, of R.S.U. and F.C.D., she can round out this lifecycle with satisfaction to her Master—which is all that she cares about. She hasearned this from all of you. She has, I may add, refused to take down this lastsentence (as she thinks not in terms of reward or recompense), but has done sowhen I enjoined upon her the need for impersonality.The three Arcane School centres, New York (the major centre), London and inSwitzerland, must become more potent and should constitute three major points oflight in the world. At the centre of each should work a disciple. Later, I shallsuggest that the work in Australia be extended, and that in Sydney anothercentre or power station should be opened.Your meditation during the coming year should be focussed around the effort tobring through second ray energy—the energy of your soul and of your mind—intothe physical brain, via the etheric body. You must do this through the power ofthe creative imagination; you must act “as if” ; you must see this energypouring in, literally, to the head centre and from thence to the brain. You mustwork out your own way of doing this, for that will be for you the best way. Twosuggestions only will I make: See this energy of love as a great descendingstream of light substance, pouring down from the soul into your threefold lowerequipment, and from thence out into the Arcane School, enveloping itsmembership. Secondly—and here you must endeavour to understand my meaningwithout any elaboration from me—you must take the people you do not like,particularly the three who so painfully disturb you, into your heart , thinkingof them (as far as in you lies) in their own terms and from their own point ofview and not from yours.The way into the Ashram stands ever open to you and I [713] am ever accessibleto those who, like you, have worked and served in difficulty and distress andunder the drastic circumstances imposed by this world war. You have servedwithout any deviation from the path of duty. Forget this not, and avail yourselfof “the privilege of entrance.” You will ever find me at the inner point.~TO H. S. D.September 1943MY BROTHER:This year has seen certain liberating processes taking place in your life. Youstand much freer from entanglements than heretofore; you face fresh opportunityfor service and for growth. My problem is how to help you to capitalise on thepast, thus enabling you to make the future a more fruitful period than everbefore. You have been connected with my Ashram for some time now and have beenreadmitted into the new seed group. The reason that I mention this is because Iwant to emphasise to you the word “seed.” It is the germ, and only the germ, ofthe spiritual life with which you have to deal, and I want you to withdraw yourthinking and your emphasis from the concept of the flowering of your life in thecoming years to the concept of nurturing and fostering the seed or germ of thenew life which is just beginning to emerge. The Old Commentary says:“The seed develops five flowers and five only. One flower long precedes theothers. The second flower is hard to grow, the third is harder still. The fourthflower dies and, dying, gives forth light and in that light the fifth flowerblooms.”I leave you to interpret this for yourself.The future which lies ahead of you—be it long or short—must be approached by younow in a different manner to the past. You stand alone. You stand, however, withyour brothers in the Ashram, and are therefore not alone. What [714] lies aheadfor you? How can the coming years be constructive, organised and creative? Thesethree words—Constructive, Organised, Creative—have been chosen by me with careand I would ask you to reflect upon them. What is the constructive contributionwhich you can now make to the work that your chosen co-workers are doing? Howcan you organise your life so that there is a definite result and something toshow for any activity instituted? How can the intense activity of your mind beslowed down and channelled so that something creative and worthwhile may emerge?These are the problems which must be faced, and these are the points where I canbe of service to you, my brother, if you will accept my suggestions and carrythem through.It is the carrying through of any one settled project which has always been themajor weakness with your group service. You work a little bit in some departmentof the group activity, and then you turn to something else; your basic purposeis steadfast and true and your steadiness in adhering to my work in some phaseor another is unbreakable and real, but the surface effort is unstable, and fromthe angle of time, never persists long enough to show results. Why is this?The answer lies in two directions: Your overactive mind flits from this to thatand back again, and over-organises everything it touches. Secondly, the physicalbody under this intense mental tension and constant movement is necessarily verynervous and constantly depleted, for seldom is anything carried through, and thecarrying through of a project and adherence to a plan bring through energy on tothe physical plane and consequently into the physical body. Your vital bodyfeels the constant pull upwards of mental force, but that mental force is notexpressed through activities which are carried through to concluded expressionupon the physical plane. Your mind is like a whirling humming-top which isconstantly toppling over and has to be set in motion again, accomplishingnothing of value.This, brother of mine, is not your intent or desire. What then is wrong? Let metell you simply what the fault is. [715] There is a constant overstimulation ofthe mind, of such a potent nature that there is no time or energy left forphysical plane expression. What is the cure and what shall we do to prevent thisoverstimulation and slow things down so that there will be time foraccomplishments? My answer is: Complete cessation from all meditation work for ayear at least, or until I again give you permission to resume. You areconstantly withdrawing and escaping into the meditation process, and you do itso successfully that the result is that all the energies you contact becomefocussed in the mind. You do not need to do this. You need now to garner theresults of past meditation work through active service, chosen with deliberationand carried through steadily without any meditation at all but on the strengthof the stored-up knowledge you have, and which you have never used.I am asking you, therefore, to stop all meditation, even the group meditation.You can give fifteen minutes to dedication, consecration and contact with yoursoul and with me every Sunday morning and at the full moon period. You canparticipate in the group meditation at the School, but see to it that the groupmeditations are regarded by you as acts of service and not as means whereby yourown nature is stimulated and refreshed. You can take part in the group held byA.A.B. on Friday evenings, for there is much that you can there learn. But I donot want you otherwise giving any time whatsoever to meditation—particularly inconnection with any work you may be doing. I want your active cooperation on thephysical plane along some particular line connected with my activities, and Iwant that work adhered to at any cost so that a finished something emerges. Whatthat work shall be, what phase of the undertaking you can do, and whatresponsibility you can shoulder should be, I feel, talked over with A.A.B., butonly if you so desire.If you will follow out these instructions, you will be surprised to discover howmuch easier life will be for you. Your mind will gradually become yourinstrument and not your master, as it is at present; your etheric body willstabilise and your general health will improve; your interests will grow [716]and your usefulness increase, and that I know, my brother, is what you yourselfdesire. I am only attempting to help you to measure up to your own idea.One other exercise I will permit. I give you below certain sentences orstatements, one for each month of the coming year. Every morning before you riseout of a recumbent position say the one for that particular month aloud—justonce—thus striking your keynote for the day. But do not proceed to meditate,ponder or reflect upon the sentences.1st month . . . In quietness and in confidence shall be my strength as I walktoday the ways of earth.2nd month . . . I descend in thought unto the plains whereon men walk, and thereI work.3rd month . . . In spiritual being I stand upon the Way. It is the way of men. Iam. I neither think nor dream, but work.4th month . . . With my brothers I dwell within the Ashram. I issue forth andcarry out the Plan as best I can.5th month . . . Let love stream out today—from out my eyes, my hands, my feet,because my heart beats with the love of God.6th month . . . Within my hand I hold the keys of life. I unlock the door forothers and they pass through—yet see me not.7th month . . . As I am strength and power and love and understanding, I bringthese gifts into the haven of my work. Thus strength goes forth to others andlove to all I meet, and to these gifts I add an understanding heart.8th month . . . The cry goes out for workers. I answer, Master of my Life, andstand within the ranks of those who serve. What shall I do? The answer comes:The thing before thine eyes.9th month . . . I climb the mountain top with others and watch the sun. Idescend into the valley [717] with my fellowmen and therein walk. The dark isgreat, but I am with my fellowmen.10th month . . . I think no thought, I speak no word, I do no deed that hurtsanother. This means I use a guarded brain against myself—the little personalself.11th month . . . The chain of Hierarchy reaches from heaven to earth and in thatchain I am a part. Above me stand the Ones I seek to serve; below me standbrothers demanding help.12th month . . . The cross is mine. The sword of love is mine. The word of Poweris mine because I love—my Master and my brothers on the upward Way and on thelesser way, my fellowmen.This change is not going to be easy for you, brother of mine. It will appear todisrupt and to disturb the rhythm of your life, but it will net you good resultsand you will never regret acceding to my request. The best lies ahead for you.You are needed, and there is service you can render along with your groupbrothers and with me.~BROTHER OF OLD: November 1944This is the last specific and individual instruction I shall give you. It is notmy intention to continue repeating what I seek you—and all of you—to be, tobecome or to do. You have had much given to you over the years which still needsto be worked out in practical effectiveness. I wonder if you have noticed howfrequently, in this series of group and individual instructions, I have used theword “effective”? This has been deliberate upon my part, for the word conveyssomething which I would see each of you express. True effectiveness is theresult of a merging of soul energy with personality force, and through thisetheric merging, the physical [718] demonstration becomes adequate to the demandand commensurate with the forces blended. Each of you who have been admitted inthe Ashram has already established a measure of definite contact. The way intothe inner circle of the Ashram is through a still closer rapport with the soul,and upon this rapport you must definitely concentrate.You are making a real effort to cooperate and to carry out my instructions; thishas not been easy for you. It has taken you a long time to get down to worksince receiving the last instruction I gave you; it has taken you long to arriveat a point of focus upon some definite activity, as I enjoined you some timeago. This again is the result of your over-rationalising mind which in dealingwith all life circumstances is—in your case—prone to make complicated andintricate the simplest of physical plane matters. You are apt to make important,things which are not of the slightest importance whatsoever.Your goal for the remainder of your life should be simplicity in all affairs andin all relationships. To this simplicity I would have you add a greater sense ofpersonal dignity—a dignity which will work out as a physical reticence; of this,you as yet know little, but it will reveal itself to you as you reflect upon theword. To these two necessities of your physical plane expression I would haveyou add understanding—an understanding based upon love and not upon any mentalprocess. This will be hard for you, for it involves being guided by your heart,unprompted by your versatile and fluid mind. If you will develop thesequalities—simplicity from the mental angle, understanding from the emotional andastral angle, and dignity from the physical angle—and will work at thesequalities during the rest of this incarnation, you will start your next lifeequipped for fuller service and with a more reliable physical instrument.A.A.B. tells me that it distresses you that you are what you call “behind” theothers in the new seed group, as far as the reception of the series of groupinstructions is concerned. She asks me what she should do, as she would notwithhold them from you if it is my wish for you to (using your own [719] words)“catch up.” Catch up with what and whom, my brother? A reception of the writteninstructions is no indication of capacity or status, for in the spiritual lifeand in all life free from physical brain awareness (as you understand it) such a“catching up” is non-existent. From the angle of esotericism, which is concernedwith the soul aspect of life, time is simply a sequence of states ofconsciousness as registered by the physical brain. It does not in reality affectthe inner spiritual man. Could you but know it—and this is a point which alldisciples need to grasp—you, the true Being, needs no instructions. The task ofany Master is only to bring to the attention of the man, working through themedium of a physical brain, that phase of the Ageless Wisdom which his own soulis seeking to have him register. In reality, you have had the instructions atcloser and more rapid intervals than have your group brothers, because of yourimportunity and the grasping demand of your agile, unsatisfied mind. But youhave by no means mastered what has been imparted, nor have you done the neededmeditation; you will therefore only receive the current group instructions afterthe sun has moved northward, and I will intimate to A.A.B. the right time.As regards your meditation work, you may now begin to follow the meditationoutline given in the last series, but you must do it with no undue pressure; youmust do it without any eager expectancy, but simply as a demanded duty. I wouldhave you watch yourself with extreme care and I would ask you to refrain fromusing the Sacred Word, except when in group meditation, when the aura of thegroup will absorb the incoming energies and you will not then be undulystimulated. The mind, when awake and active, is the great transmitter of theenergies loosed by the Sacred Word. When sounded by the emotional type, itfortunately proves ineffectual in the majority of cases, and no energy is drawninto the mechanism of the personality. But when the mind is active and enrapport with the soul at certain points of evolution, it can and does draw outsoul energy, and relates it [720] rapidly and immediately to the brain. Hencemuch of the difficulties connected with overstimulation of which you are thevictim. Adhere strictly to this injunction.One of the factors in ashramic relations which you need to find and express isthe assured peace and inner confidence which characterise its vibration. Thereis too much fever in your life. You ascribe it to a delicate body, my brother,but this is not so. It is due to a feverish mind; until calm and peace andtranquility distinguish your mental processes, it will not be wise for you topenetrate any further into the Ashram than the point where now you findyourself. So endeavour to keep the mind quiet. The physical vehicle is farstronger than you think, and a much larger measure of real health will be yoursif your mind can be better regulated.An Ashram is a place of quietly confident, regulated effort. The plan and theimmediate service-activity are known, and disciples and initiates—each aware ofhis task and equipment—proceed to carry out the phase of the One Work which istheirs. Each senses its relationship to the phases of the work undertaken by hisgroup brothers; it is in learning to see the picture whole (as the Master eversees it) that confidence and security are developed.In the place of your Sunday morning dedication, I want to give you four picturesupon which to reflect, seeking to read behind their symbolism the message ofyour soul to you, the personality.I. A quiet sea of midnight blue. Above, the shining, round-faced moon. Acrossthe sea, a path of light, and moving slowly down that path a little boatand—smiling, with the oars in hand—H.S.D. is seen.II. A pillared cloister, dappled with the sun and broken by the shade cast bythe pillars. A garden spreads on either side, redolent with the smell of manyflowers and noisy with the hum of many bees and gay with butterflies. Ten timesa bell rings out. Its tone is deep and clear and musical. But the one who sitsand writes and thinks beneath the cloister’s shade [721] moves not. He writes,and measures to the task assigned.III. A room in shadow, full of peace and calm, of books and enterprise. And atthe desk, the Master sits and works and thinks, projecting thought, workingwithin, above and all around, whilst through the room pass many. It is theirright to pass.IV. A golden door, wide open to the sun. Before the door lie rocks and bits ofstone. A path winds towards that door, and o’er its lintel are the words: Enterwith calm; speak low and only if a need is there. Enter the stream behind thedoor and wash away the stains of travel. Then face the Master, but only when thequiet of evening light shines forth and all is still within.Take these pictures—one each Sunday in the month—and work creatively with them.At the close of a year, send in to A.A.B. (for the helping of the group) yourinterpretation of these symbols. Speak truth through them and fear notcriticism.You are making progress, my brother, and can—if you so will—be of service toyour fellowmen. Forget not that at the centre of the Ashram I can be found atall times, but only when you can penetrate there with simplicity, understandingand dignity.~MY BROTHER: August 1946In my last instruction to you I stated that it was the last which I would giveyou. At that time, I had no intention of closing the outer ashramic affiliation.Today it is closed, and I give you, therefore, a parting word of practicalimport upon the physical plane, along with those of your brothers.I approach you with much concern because your physical plane life is now asfluidic as your mind has been, and you know, brother of old, that that restless,grasping, unsatisfied mind has given both you and me much trouble over our years[722] of association. Let us look at your situation clearly, and I would like toindicate to you the wise procedure for the future.You are a dedicated disciple and have proven yourself so to be; you are a memberof my Ashram, but your mental fluidity has militated against your passing intoany closer relation within the Ashram. You still remain upon the periphery,whereas you should have advanced to within the first circle of workingdisciples, at least. This, however, has been impossible and will remain so untilyou have brought quietness and rhythm into your physical plane life. It was therealisation of this which prompted A.A.B. to beg you, not long ago, to settledown. She could not give ashramic reasons, for she intrudes not into that whichI perforce must do, but she earnestly sought to help.My brother, no matter where you are, a settled place of abode is needed for alldisciples, and this for several reasons. Over the months or years, where a truedisciple is concerned, this settled abode becomes a shrine, something is builtwhich becomes magnetic and responsive to the Ashram, and occultly speaking, “thesensitive receiver of the disciple’s physical brain can be located and found tobe at peace.” I trust you understand, and I would have you ponder on these wordsand reflect upon my suggestion. I would have you seek (and you will find) aplace of suitable residence which will be of prolonged usefulness to you andfrom which you will not move, except in response to the normal procedures oflife. Because of the instability with which you have come into incarnation andwhich constitutes your major life problem, you know that you need the steadyrhythm and the heartbeat of the Headquarters in New York, through which I work;this should condition your choice of a place in which to settle and, my brother,I emphasise and re-emphasise to you the word “settle.”This is for you a spiritual necessity, and will eventually mean for you healthand peace and a stable settled personal rhythm. This again will signify a steptowards liberation. Your restlessness and instability have been accepted by youas conditioning factors in your life, and herein lies a major mistake [723]which you have always made. Both are a serious detriment to your spiritualprogress and usefulness and one reason why you are not as useful as you shouldbe to those around you.For whatever time lies ahead of you, my brother, let this constant movement end. Endeavour to be where you can be found; gather around you what you need forpeaceful, quiet and useful living, and there abide. I cannot too strongly urgethis on you . Fill your life with interests related to my work (a work which hasevoked your sincere dedication), but give not time to meditation. It is thisconstant urge to meditation which is responsible for much of your difficulty,because meditation overstimulates your fluidic and active mind; this, in duecourse, results in a restless, constantly changing physical plane life. Talkthis over with A.A.B., who has watched you with loving concern for many yearsand is peculiarly disturbed over you at this time.There is much that you can do, if you are willing to do the little things. Youhave given generously of your means and have made much of my work possible; forthis I am grateful, and for this I tender to you the thanks of those of us inthe Hierarchy who stand behind the work for which A.A.B. and F.B. areresponsible. We shall always be grateful for that help, as are the two who workwith us; we shall be grateful for your continued help along this line if yoursoul so prompts you, provided you ever retain that which is needed for yourquiet, gracious, restful living in a suitable abiding place, close to the centreof our work.We are endeavouring to prolong the life of A.A.B., which should have ended thisyear; we are doing so, much against her wishes, in order that the work in Europecan be stabilised and the books completed. I put these two things in the orderof their importance. Help her all you can. She asks me not to write this, buthas my instructions so to do. Her life is harder than you know, and but for F.B.she would not be here at all.Every morning, at noon, and each night before retiring to sleep, align yourselfwith your soul, with the Ashram and with me, and say very quietly and with notension:“I stand a point of peace, and through the point [724] which I can thus provide,love and true light can flow.I stand in restful poise, and through that poise I can attract the gifts which Imust give—an understanding heart, a quiet mind, myself.I never am alone, for round me gather those I seek to serve, my brothers in theAshram, souls that demand my help, e’en though I see them not, and those indistant places who seek the Master of my life, my brother, the Tibetan.”That is all the meditation I would have you do for the remainder of your life ,except the meditations in group formation at the Headquarters of our work. Youwill find that these affirmations, affirmed by you three times a day, willsuffice to calm your mind and turn the place where you abide into a shrine.This communication may be somewhat surprising to you. Seldom do I deal withphysical plane matters, and I deal with this matter of a “centre of peacefulabode” for you only because its lack and your refusal (an interior refusal) toseek a suitable place to live are indications of a mental condition which shouldbe brought to an end by you. This restlessness affects the quality of yourvibration, and this in turn, to a slight (a very slight) degree, affects yourashramic group of brothers.A future of service opens wide for you if, I repeat, you are willing to do thelittle things and finish what you begin.My blessing and my love for you—the love of a Master for his disciple, distantand close, remote yet near—is ever yours.~TO L-T. S. K.BROTHER OF MINE: September 1943Our association together has existed for many years. It also began many livesago. You should have advanced to a more intimate stage of discipleship had itnot been for your always ready and still persistent response to the unreal, the[725] unnecessary, and to that which comes in between you and the clear, steadyenlightened progress upon the Path which should be yours. You will note that Iuse not the word glamour here. The reason is that it is apparently an entirelymeaningless word to you, and I felt that I should emphasise the fact thatglamour (as far as you are concerned) means that which sidesteps you from thedesired service, that which engrosses your attention and prevents you fromconcentrating on the realities of life and circumstance, that which places youalways at the centre of some big scheme as the master-mind making somediscovery, as the architect of some building which is intended to househumanity, and that which comes between you and the simple duty of a pledgeddisciple—for that you unchangeably are.You have, my brother, a good illustration of what I mean in the two plans whichyou have evolved during the past six months for world salvage and unity. One ofthem was supposed to be in response to my request for a paper, but another paperwhich I asked you to write is still unwritten and that paper was more importantthan the other. These plans were drawn; time was taken in submitting them tovarious people, and to what end? There was in them nothing new. The minds andsome of the best minds in every country in the world are formulating them. Yourplans were simply compilations of familiar suggestions which have already beenpresented in better form to the public. What end, therefore, did they serve?Only to sidetrack you from the simple duty of today; only to feed thatinclination on your part to do something great; only to prevent you from a trueand practical cooperation in my plans which you know well and which thedisciples in my Ashram are pledged to materialise. It is their group duty, notfrom the angle of authoritative demand, or in a spirit of blind obedience butbecause from free choice and identity of purpose (as far as they can realise it)they are in my Ashram; they have willingly responded to my planned intentionsand in a spirit of dedication to the good of humanity.All this indicates to me that you are still prone to slip into the thraldom ofthe vague vision, the grandiose formulations [726] of something and arenegatively responsive to the collective ideas of forward-thinking men, for youdo no positive or original thinking of your own. Glamour still holds you.You might well ask, my brother: Why then keep me in your group? Why not waituntil I have learnt better and have dropped this tendency? Because you need theprotection of the Ashram and you need—from the centre of protection—to learnthen to accept the duty of obedience to the ashramic intent and to work underthe direction of the loving intentions of Those Whom you do recognise as moreexperienced disciples than yourself. You are in my Ashram also from oldassociation and because you earned the reward of this recognition andopportunity by being the first to appreciate the significance of my books andthe teaching that they convey, and to aid the effort of A.A.B. For that reasonyou earned the right to my appreciation and hers, and have had them both. Thatwas the one clear bit of spiritual thinking you have done in this incarnation.Therefore, the Ashram protects you, and your brothers stand around you, and forthis brief incarnation you are a liability—but a liability which can, with yourcooperation, be changed in your next incarnation into a group asset.There is consequently no need for the slightest discouragement and I say thatwith definite purpose and truth. There is only room for the acceptance of facts.What facts, brother of mine? Let me (with my usual frankness) tell you. Let mepoint out to you what I feel and those who know you best feel should be yourattitude for the remainder of this life. If you accept these ideas and cooperatewillingly, you will do much to free yourself; if you refuse to see the light,you will but delay the process and continue to exact the protecting care of theAshram for a longer period. Let me first highlight your career of glamour so asto prove to you, intelligently, the points I seek to make.I shall not deal with your life, prior to the recognition period which enabledyou to render me and the world outstanding service. Your recognition and aid ofthe work I was doing has released certain energies which will have much to [727]do with the changing of the consciousness of humanity. Remember that theHierarchy has this service of yours in mind.There was the glamour of the wonderful discovery you were going to make,covering several years of experimentation and leading nowhere. Why? Because youhad neither the training nor the capacity to do the work. It will be better doneand in other ways and by better minds than yours. Your equipment was notadequate.There was the glamour of spiritual power which led some of your group brothersastray for months. There has always been a glamorous response to personalitieswho have misled and glamoured you in the business world and led you into deviousand difficult situations, and which forced you, eventually, to recognise thatthey were not the least what you had thought. What is this but the glamour ofpersonalities? Until you have learnt to see people as they truly are, you cannotdo the exoteric work of a disciple.Then came an interlude. I asked for your resignation from the group, and thedoor of the inner Ashram closed upon you. That was very good for you and youendeavoured in that period to attend to the business of life, watching yourselfwith care. Then the door of the Ashram reopened and you were readmitted to thegroup life. For a year all seemed well, but the dual stimulation of the Ashramand the active work in my group proved too much, and glamour again envelopedyou.You started by formulating large schemes for world regeneration and for asuper-organisation, and yet all that time the work that I wanted done and theoutlines of the work as indicated by me, and to which your group brothers and myAshram are pledged, played no part in your planning. You have been unhappy andbewildered because of the lack of sympathy, yet what would you have yourbrothers do? Would you have them aid me in helping you to free yourself fromwild schemes and planning, or would you have them back you up and strengthen thehold that glamour has upon you?Here are my suggestions, brother of mine, given in all [728] love andunderstanding, and with a real appreciation of your sincerity of devotion, yourgreat and beautiful staying-power, your essential humility and your very realneed for protection.1. Accept the fact that you need protection, and be grateful.2. Accept the fact that in this life you have neither the mental equipment northe clear vision to enable you to be a leader, an organiser or a drawer ofblueprints for the Hierarchy.3. Accept the fact that you are not young enough to make many basic personalitychanges, for the sixth ray crystallises too rapidly.4. Accept the fact that in the performance of your home and business duties andin the effort to bring happiness to those in your environment lies for you theimmediate solution of your problem. A simple, humble life of service and ofself-forgetfulness will do more to free you than any violent endeavour tounderstand and combat glamour. You do not yet even comprehend what it is; it canonly be overcome by the illumined mind, and there is therefore, for you, nothingelse to be done but to strengthen your soul contact by practical spiritualliving upon the physical plane, and by a complete refraining from all thoughtanent the future world, future scientific discoveries, future world orders, andthe manner whereby they can be instituted.The moment your mind becomes preoccupied with the universal aspects of life itis thrown into confusion; its thoughtform-making proclivities become violent,and the illumination of the soul is then unable to penetrate. You need to learnto bring that illumination into your personality daily life upon the physicalplane. What measure of it you have received has been retained upon the mentalplane and dedicated to matters far too big for you in this incarnation and withyour present equipment. This has led to a chronic state [729] of glamour. Livepractically, sweetly, humbly and lovingly for the remainder of this life, anddemonstrate beauty in personality relations. You will thus release your mindfrom pressures too great for it, and so begin to tread the way of liberation.Can you do this, my brother? Can you bring spirituality into business and livein the business world as a disciple? If you cannot do this, you will have tolearn to do it, because discipleship leaves no aspect of life unlived, andbusiness is an aspect of human living. Can you bring naught but peace, happinessand confidence into your home and into your association at the Headquarters ofmy work in the world? Can you begin to be one to whom the enquirer can turn forhelp, knowing that he will get enough practical assistance to enable him to seethe next step ahead? You can do and be all these things, my brother. Your taskis to demonstrate discipleship in the daily life, and not to duplicate thediscipleship of those more advanced than yourself.Do the group work and meditation as indicated. I assign you no special work. Iseek to see you more closely integrated into the group in my Ashram of which youare a part. Have no doubts and questionings. You are a part of my Ashram, andthat brings the needed protection, as well as certain risks of overstimulation.The love and understanding and gratitude of your group brothers stands withwarmth around you. I have no need to assure you of my protecting care andconstant interest. The years must have proved it to you.~MY BROTHER AND FRIEND OF OLDEN TIME: November 1944There is absolutely no need for the profound depression and for the process ofself-accusation in which you so constantly live. Years ago, your dream was toserve the Master, to be known by Him and to be a part of His group or Ashram.You longed for the status, technically understood, of an accepted disciple. Youhave served the Master and rendered us, as I told you, notable service; you areknown by me, and [730] it is perhaps the fact of this knowledge and itsimplications which disturbs you so deeply; you are an integral part of a group,affiliated with my Ashram; you are an accepted disciple. You have, therefore,every reason to feel encouraged.You are, however, aware of weaknesses and of failure. So be it. But the factremains that the major trend and purpose of your life has brought you into theAshram. So be it again, my brother. All within the Ashram, except those ofhigher initiate status, fall short at times.One of the things which I said at my last word with you was that your age wassuch that it was well-nigh impossible for you to change. Yet you have changedquite definitely during the past year, and by your refusal to cultivate theglamorous thinking which characterised you in past years and so oft proved yourundoing, you have made real progress—more real progress than at any previoustime. This has almost surprised me. When I raised the point with a member of myAshram (known to none of you in this group which I am instructing), he remarked:“The soul is after all a Master, and when the force of masterhood is released,bringing quiescence and acquiescence, it is difficult to predict the happeningspossible.” Your quiescence, demonstrated upon the physical plane, largely asdepression and fatigue, produced a negativity which made it difficult for anypositive glamour to show itself; this greatly helped, weakening throughattrition the hold which it has had upon your astral body. See that it gains nostrength again. But be not depressed; simply be negative to all the suggestionsof glamour and be encouraged at my words, for I speak not lightly or untruly. Nospectacular progress will be made by you in this life. Accept that as factualand be happy at the quiet of the coming period before you pass over to the otherside. Make full use of the time and read, study and think.You have for long asked me to tell you the rays upon which your threepersonality bodies are to be found. I do so now, for you can profit from theinformation.You have, as you know, a third ray soul and a sixth ray personality. Your taskas regards the latter is to transit on to [731] the first ray, so that next lifeyou will come into incarnation with the difficult combination of three and one.For this the training, discipline and discoveries of the present incarnationshould have prepared you, and you can therefore face the future with caution butwith surety.Your mental body is on the fifth ray and hence your interest in thingsscientific; but the calibre of your mind is not yet of such a nature that youcan profit from this, and this is a fact which you must accept.Your astral body is first ray in nature and hence the potent hold which glamourhas had on you—a glamour inherited from three previous lives and renderedone-pointed and powerful in this life through your first ray astral nature. Youwilled to deal with glamour; you ran, last life, a great risk of wandering on tothe path of black magic. Your recognition of me and my work and yourinstantaneous cooperation, completely negated that possibility, but the tendencyto glamour remained and still does.Your physical body is third ray in type, and this has intensified the worstaspects of that ray, because soul energy (undirected by an illumined mind) attimes stimulates it and the glamour can take effect in physical plane activity.If you can develop mental perception to a fuller degree, and if you can achievein this life and the next a measure of real illumination, all the difficultiesnow troubling you will be resolved. In your next incarnation, you shouldendeavour to work through a second ray astral body, for there is a real lack ofsecond ray force in your most difficult equipment. There are too many energiesin your present equipment along the line of the first ray, and your ultimategoal must be a second ray personality, following upon the coming first raypersonality of your next life. Love and light are greatly needed by you, andtheir reception by you in your lower fourfold nature would produce greattransforming results. These must be brought about by you through keen interestin and love of others, and by stern mental control and unfoldment. [732]~BROTHER OF OLD: August 1946This is but a parting word to you as regards your physical plane affiliationwith my Ashram. I will start by assuring you that the inner link remainsunbroken and will persist, though even I have no idea when freedom willdistinguish you or when you can advance with surety into the Ashram itself. Anyprogress that you could have made this life, as a result of my correctiveteaching and aid, has been largely negated by your supine acceptance of failure,by your profound and lasting “conviction of sin” (if I may use so old-fashioneda phrase), and by your constant inner dwelling on your group relations. You didfail, my brother. But why stay overwhelmed by failure for year after year andremain with your eyes concentrated on the lower self that failed? All havefailed and will again along some line. E’en the Masters fail at times to passthrough one or other of the highest initiations at their first attempt and—fromthe hierarchical angle—that connotes failure. But the failure is scarcerecognised; the effort is made to register what caused the failure and theinability to stand before the One Initiator, for all effects emanate from someascertainable cause. So should it be on all levels of advancement, even such arelatively unimportant effort (from the point of view of hierarchical work) asyour attempt to gain the right of entry into my Ashram or what is called“ashramic penetration,” and then on and up through many graded failures, untilyou meet the well-known failure of the Buddha to attain His goal.I have therefore for you a message based on the words of the initiate, Paul:“Forgetting the things which are behind, press forward.” Dwell no longer on thepast but make the relatively few years which are left you of this life, years ofusefulness and of purpose in my work. This will require the acquisition and therecognition of a spirit which is unembarrassed by ambition but which is pledgedto the perfecting of each day’s relationships. Preoccupation with thebeautifying and the spiritualising of the day’s affairs will give you no timefor any reaction to glamour; your mind and desire [733] (your kama-manasicnature) will be—with definite purpose—physically oriented; your demonstration ofright living upon the physical plane will be to you the factor of majorimportance.Your spiritual focus will remain unaltered, and it is this tenacity (which youhave ever demonstrated) which has preserved untouched your relationship with meand with your brothers; you need therefore have no concern in relation to yourspiritual expression on its own plane. It is your physical expression which hasbeen at fault. Reflect with assiduity on these words of mine. A focussing ofyour spiritual attitude and nature upon the physical plane will result in a moredynamic life, instead of the basically negative life you at present demonstrate;you will be surprised at the results which may eventuate.I am giving you no meditation. I seek to see the flow of your spiritual lifedownward into daily life, and I seek not to see you raising your human soultowards a soul contact you seldom achieve, consciously at least, this life. Yourproblem has been due to the fact that in the past you at one time achieved amost definite soul contact, but knew not how to handle the force engendered. Inthis incarnation, this force flowed into the astral body to a very great extentand evoked the glamour and the deception which have coloured your life. But—youhave a vast stored reservoir of spiritual potency on higher levels than theastral, and can perhaps draw upon its source of love and light if your majorconcentration and preoccupation is the perfecting of your daily living in theplace where you are and in the environment and the circumstances for which youare responsible.You need have no fear that I shall withdraw from you the attention and thecareful thought which I have given you all these years. I earnestly desire tosee you achieve success; I have been sorry when you failed. I seek to have youwithin the Ashram, which is not as yet the case. A move forward can, however, bemade this life if—in your closing years—you obey instructions. Go forward inconfidence, my brother; the group has never left you or deserted you, and youneed no assurance from me that I hold you in my thought. [734]~TO R. S. W.January 1940Your glamour is, as you know, that of psychic sensitivity. Like S.C.P. youfunction on the astral-buddhic line; but, having a trained mind from theeducational angle (for you passed through college, did you not, my brother?) youhave a somewhat different problem. Your task is to use your mind for theunfoldment of the intuition and for the control of the lower psychic nature.This psychic glamour does not unduly distort your point of view but its verypresence constitutes a disturbing element to you. You neither like nor desirethis psychic sensitivity or the knowledge which it brings, but it constitutes anenvironment in which you have to learn to walk with freedom and with grace. Itis not some situation from which you must aim at escaping for it is part ofmanifestation and you must learn to work with it and function in it but withcomplete detachment from it—just as you do not identify yourself with physicalphenomena such as rain or storm. Glamour exists. It is. The higher glamours aregoals towards which the lower psychics must work and your work may lie along theline of helping them in the midst of the glamour and by this remark I may aid inreorienting your thought and dissipating some of your concern.A person, for instance, who has been astrally and psychically controlled by theglamour of selfish desire and material aims will have made a real step forwardwhen he escapes into the glamour of devotion to a teacher—a glamour which, foryou, would be a thing lying behind in your experience and no longer ofcontrolling importance.Ponder on this and, if you care to do so, list the higher and lower glamours andindicate how the lower can be transmuted into the higher powers, leading to alater liberation. In this problem of the glamour of psychic sensitivity, you cando much to solve it by the right handling of the time equation (for time inreception of contacts, as it is called at times, has a real relationship to thegrowth of glamours) and [735] in the elimination of nonessentials. Go forward,therefore, in service with joy and with confidence. The glamours hold you not intruth but you need more understanding of their nature.~BROTHER OF MINE: August 1940I would ask you whether the implications as to the relationship between yoursoul and personality rays to the rays of your astral and physical vehiclesinterests you in any way? The two lower rays are the same as the two higher andin between stands the ray which is, par excellence, that which provides thebattleground for the disciple in training. Twelve of the group members have thefourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict controlling the mental body, henceconsequent conflict and proffered opportunity, plus an expressed ambition forthe achievement of psychic harmony between the soul of form and the soul itself.It is through the conflict between these two that harmony becomes possible. Thisis the ray of testing, the energy which brings about trial. People struggle withideas, with attaining the goal of their current idealism and are driven bylonging to find peace, joy and divine assurance. After the cycle of lives inwhich the mental ray varies from life to life, there arrives an incarnationwherein the ray of harmony through conflict dominates; then the disciple isspecifically put to the proof and is tested and tried in order to demonstrate tohim the gain or the non-gain of the past cycle of living experience. Such aproposition faces many in this group today as it, in its turn, faces humanity,one of whose controlling rays is the fourth.You can, therefore, expect to have to face up to a life of testing and ofchange. This is not to posit that the testing and change and battle will be of aphysical nature or on the physical plane or will involve physical planedecisions. This ray produces the “harmonising” strain and stress on any of theplanes (using these words technically) and for the majority of you it ispre-eminently active upon the astral plane. [736] There the tests will come,with repercussions—if I may use such a phrase—upon the buddhic or intuitionalplane.You are facing changes in your life. I would here point out to you that changesin the life of a pledged disciple can be due to two main causes: the working outof karma which is unavoidable but which presents opportunity, or it can be dueto the free choice and free decision, involving direct initiating activity onthe part of the disciple; these decisions can be carried out or avoidedaccording to his own planning. This line of activity has, therefore, little todo with precipitating karma but is concerned with intelligent initiating of newkarma which will, in its turn, produce its inevitable effects later. I call thisto your attention, my brother, because you are reaching the point in your careeras a soul where you can consciously engineer situations and conditions which arenot effects or results but are the commencement of new cycles. It is a momentoustime in the soul’s progress when conscious decisions can be made with dueappreciation of consequences.I am also referring to this because you are meditating steps (are you not, mybrother?) which will produce effective change. I seek to have you ponder uponthe responsibility involved and know with clarity your motive. Lives ofindecision come wherein the man balances back and forth between decision andindecision, arriving apparently at no action. They are lives of apparentfutility but nevertheless of great value. Needless to point out that suchincarnations are frequently lived under the sun-sign of Libra or have Libra asthe rising sign. Prior to that particular life, the man has had littledifficulty. He is conditioned by precipitating karma and at the same timeexperiences little difficulty in arriving at decisions, because his choices andaims will be motivated by the personality and determined by the lower self.Later, after a life or lives of balancing, the die is cast and the period ofinactivity and of indecision ends and the soul begins to determine action; karmathen comes under the processes of conscious transmutation. Motives becomepurified [737] and objectives shift from those of personality ambition to thespiritual goals of humanity.Such a life is upon you now, my brother, and I am therefore seeking to make theissues clear to you. Personality decisions are not for you; and for you,likewise, the period of indecision must end and it will end when you see soulpurpose more clearly. You might here ask: In what way can I know? How can Iarrive at right decision? First of all by eliminating selfishness and arrivingat that unconcern as to the happiness or the experience of the personality;secondly, by refusing to move hurriedly. The disciple has to learn that when hehas arrived at right—and therefore for him irrevocable decision—that this verymotive and decision starts energy working along the indicated lines and that,having decided, he now moves slowly in the wake of that energy. There are deepsignificances in what I am here telling you and I beg you to strive tounderstand my meaning.I would ask you (in order to help you to see clearly and so be of greaterservice to others) to make a study this winter of the Law of Karma. Read thebooks upon the subject but take not too seriously their deductions. Gather outof that which I have written all the information you can find concerning thistheme. And, my brother, having done so, you will then arrange that material inits right and spiritual order and significance, and at the same time reduce yourideas to written form for your own clarification and the helping of yourbrothers. This teaching has a group significance.I am not referring more clearly to your life decisions and plans. They are yourown concern. I have sought to widen the “spread” of your consciousness so thatyou can bring to any planned life of service a reasoned judgment and a seasonedexperience. These two phrases should express the personality quality of thetrained disciple. For your personal meditation I suggest the following:Take ten minutes twice a day for deep reflection on one of the themes listedbelow, viewing them in two ways: the individual interpretation and, secondly,that interpretation which concerns humanity as a whole. If you will do this[738] regularly, you will build the bridge between the part and the whole.a. The dharma of the individual in the home.b. The duty of the individual in the group.c. The obligation of the individual to humanity.d. The responsibility of the individual to life.e. The reaction of the individual to karma, personal and human.f. The relation of the individual to the Hierarchy.You have there six months’ work in meditation. It will involve the practicalrelation of man to karma, individual life to the mass life as it flows throughhim, and life also as it actuates the group to life and as it expresses itselfthrough nations and through humanity as a whole.The blessing of the soul rests upon you, my brother—your soul, my soul and thesoul of all.~August 19421. Shift your consciousness into the lighted mind, for lit it is, and look notdown but up; be not so conscious of the outer form.2. For two years study, read and serve within the circle wherein your soul hasplaced your feet. Then look for greater scope, perhaps within that selfsamecircle or perhaps within another. But relinquish not the first.3. Develop joy in self-forgetfulness and serve your brothers in my Ashram. Twoof them need you much.4. Ponder the usefulness of shock , applied by you in love and yet with fulldetachment and clarity of speech.5. You need to learn the art of reverence, my chela. The chain of Hierarchy is afit subject for reflection.6. Upon that chain you have your place. Some move ahead of you. Some move alongwith you. Others again move on with hands out-stretched to you. True occultreverence holds the key. This means recognition, not obedience, not stoopingdown or looking up. [739]~MY BELOVED BROTHER: September 1943I have been concerned about you. The strain under which you work and live is notgood, and has a definite physical effect which is not desirable. I foresaw thisrisk, and it was for that reason that the first of the six statements I gave youenjoined you to:1. Shift your consciousness into the lighted mind.2. Look up, not down.3. Be not so conscious of the outer form.In these words I sought to have you turn your eyes away from the form aspect ofthe present world catastrophe, because your sensitivity led you to assume tooclose an identification with it. Such identification is a handicap and not ahelp. It feeds the life of the solar plexus, because the solar plexus centre ofhumanity as a whole is in a condition of appalling riot—if I may use so peculiara phrase.The next statement sought to swing you into the circle of your service inrelation to your group brothers and the senior group within the Arcane School.Circumstances, however, moved you from my Headquarters, and this becamedifficult of fulfilment.The need for you at this time is to study deeply and to do work which ispractically entirely along occult lines. The study of psychology which interestsyou so much and for which you are in so many other ways so eminently fitted,tunes you in at this time too rapidly on world distress and you should avoid it.The duties of the home, the bringing of joy to those you daily meet, and thekeeping of the mind upon things occult will do much to offset the astralsensitivity which is one of your major assets in helpful service, but whichunder the pressure of the world events has become almost too strong for you tohandle. The “chain of Hierarchy” is a good subject for your constant reflection,and I want you to pay close attention to my recommendation that this conceptform the background of your daily thinking. As [740] you keep that chain inmind, it tunes in on the Ashram, and therefore on the Hierarchy, for you are adisciple of some standing. This will offset the astral sensitivity, for theenergy of the Ashram stimulates the head and heart centres and draws up theastral forces from the solar plexus.I set no meditation of a special kind for you. The group meditation willsuffice. I ask you to do much occult study and much teaching and helping ofoccult students. Your work for another year should be primarily with the seniorstudents, and you should endeavour to have a larger and more organised output ofwork in that connection; it will serve to focus the consciousness more firmly inthe head. If it were possible at some time in the near future, I would suggestthat you go and talk to A.A.B. She had your problem in a worse degree, but hadmore experience to offset it and less time in which to succumb. I have told hercertain things anent you which I do not wish to write, and she will give you allthe time you need, if you will come to where she is.It is for this reason I write no more today. Also, my brother, I give you atthis time much attention in the Ashram, and my strength surrounds you. There isno cause for anxiety, for the future is assured, but seek during the coming yearto take advantage of my suggestions.~MY BROTHER: November 1944Last year my instructions to you were very brief, but they were full ofsuggestion and potent to bring you release, had you followed them withexactitude. There are certain forms of pride from which every one suffers moreor less, though the degree and quality may differ according to ray or type.Yours is a determination, or I might call it predilection, to use your mind attimes when the simple acquiescence of a loving heart is what you need. L.F.U.has a form of pride also and makes a fetish of his personal liberty,consequently putting himself in bondage to the concept of freedom; he needs tolearn that no one is really free, a disciple least of all. [741] You, my brotherand disciple, love the activity of the mind, and you enter—with your eyesopen—into situations in order to learn and experience the delight which comesfrom analysis, reflection and mental activity, followed by some decision.I am speaking thus frankly to you, my tried and loved disciple, because I seemore effective service to be rendered by you if you can master a difficultlesson at this time. You are exceedingly well equipped to serve. Your second rayenergy, coupled with your seventh ray force, makes for almost unique and unusualservice; however—and here lies a hindrance—your fourth ray mind, constantlypresenting fields of conflict which you must conquer, deflects the energy which,pouring through your soul, could lead to a planned and organised activity uponthe physical plane. But it does not. The descending soul energy and theascending personality aspiration meet upon the mental plane, and there both ofthem are arrested by your over-analytical mind. You need not infer from thisthat you are not of service to people; but it is an individual here and therethat you assist, and there is no rhythm or organisation in your service, owingto the constant mental conflict.From the very first time you were admitted into my Ashram, I have tried to aidyou to centralise all your forces upon the physical plane. When a disciple doesthis, and when he is one-pointed in his activity, there is much that he can do.When to these tendencies of inflow and of concentration there is added a trainedand illumined mind, then the disciple becomes a focal point of spiritualattraction. He can reach many, yet ever remain polarised at his own centre; hislife then has an ordered rhythm, and there is a steadfast adherence to a planwhich is carried through at all costs. He takes also his rightful position as arepresentative of an Ashram.Forget not that the Masters choose Their disciples, not only from karmicrelation (if such a relation exists), not only because the disciple demandslight and has a powerful aspiration towards spiritual things, but because thedisciple is equipped to render some definite service which fits into theashramic intention of the moment. You are thus well [742] equipped; your healthis good, even if you think it not, and will be better still when rhythm entersinto your life. You have a free mind and much, very much, intuition. You have(could you but realise it) what many people dream of possessing—time andleisure. You do not believe this, but that is because your daily life is full ofthe nonessentials—nonessential in view of world emergency. You are magnetic andattractive and can reach people through the expression of your potent lovenature. Yet at the close of each year you realise that you have not accomplishedvery much. You may have helped a person here or there and your general influenceis good. But I look for more than that from those in training and in preparationfor initiation. You are in your forty-seventh year. By the time a disciplereaches the age of forty-nine his pathway of life service should be clearlydefined. Yours is not. You have, however, two years left in which to bringthrough on to the physical plane all the energies with which you are endowed andto produce that ordered rhythm and arranged living which are required to make adefinite impact upon the minds of those around you.You play around with ideas all the time; you experiment all the time, but thatshould now be past history. I ask you now, for the sake of a needy world, andbecause I seek to see you fill your rightful place in my Ashram, to readjustyour living conditions in order to serve more adequately. I would call yourattention to the words, “your rightful place in my Ashram.” Do you know whatthat place is? I would have you find out.An Ashram is ever in a state of constant flux and movement. Disciples arepassing out of it to form their own Ashrams or to take up a specific place inanother Ashram as they meet the requirements of more advanced stages. They areshifting from one degree to another; they are moving forward steadily from theperiphery to the centre, from the outer ring-pass-not to the lighted dynamiccentre. As they move forward, preserving ever the close inner unity, place ismade for new disciples—to be admitted and trained for service.Part of the service rendered by members of an Ashram is [743] to make way fornew aspirants. This they do by hastening their own progress and moving forward.When disciples take one of the final initiations, or when they are admitted to ahigher and more potent Ashram, vacancies occur which are always promptly filled.The occult law which governs all progress in an Ashram is sometimes called theLaw of Fulfilment. By this is meant the full compliance of a disciple with theservice demands upon the outer plane. When his service is as full and aseffective as he can render it, then—under a condition which is in the nature ofa group occult paradox—his outer effectiveness produces an inner effectiveness.You have all been taught (though theoretically for the most part) that innereffectiveness produces illumined and potent service. Now learn the reverse sideof this truth. I will elucidate no further, for your own thinking shouldsuffice.You have, my brother, three things to do:First of all, you must so think, reflect and meditate that your brain will bethe recipient of your planned thinking, and not simply a sensitive registeringinstrument. Through right meditation, the energy from your soul and mind must befocussed, via the head centre. Speaking in symbols which you easily understand,“the lighted triangle of soul and mind and head will awaken the centre betweenthe eyes and bring into activity the eye of direction”; this is at presentclosed, and only occasionally opened. You have been greatly concerned for yearsover the direction of your thoughts and the trend of your thinking; shift nowyour attention to directed service. Undertake a task for me and bring it toaccomplishment.The second thing you have to do is to assess your equipment and ascertain—fromwithin yourself—where lies your field of service—one field, my brother, notmany. A disciple of your standing serves a group and not just a person here andthere, and frequently persons of no spiritual importance whose destiny can bewell left to their own souls or some teacher not of discipleship grade. I do notchoose to be more explicit. Your field of service is clear, could you but seeit, but of no use to you unless you enter it voluntarily, freely and withunderstanding.[744] The final thing which calls for your attention is to grasp in a new anddynamic manner the dual life of discipleship. Your field of service and yourfield of karmic obligation must never rule each other out, but you must learn tofunction efficiently in both careers. Your time for learning, technicallyunderstood, must now give place to the use of what you have acquired ofunderstanding and wisdom.I suggest for your helping, the following meditation. You must bear in mind thatit is only of service to you if followed steadily and with continuity. It islargely in the nature of a visualisation exercise.1. Rapid alignment and the sounding of the OM three times.2. Focussing the consciousness in the soul with a corresponding concentration inthe head at as high a point as possible.3. Then sound the OM four times. This is followed by a pause.4. The following visualisation exercise is carried forward from the point ofconcentration attained. If your attention wanders, sound the OM again. This issometimes called the “recalling OM.”a. See in the mind’s eye a sea of light.b. Then see yourself standing and awaiting direction upon the physical plane.Hold these two thoughts quietly for a little time or picture themsimultaneously.c. Then you—the disciple upon the physical plane—sound the OM inaudibly,dynamically and clearly, and as you do so, see a movement or current in the seaof lighted energy, converging towards you.d. See it take form as a stream of down-flowing energy—the energy of love, ofstrength and of understanding.e. Imagine next that divine flow sweeping through your mind and your astral bodyand settling into your etheric vehicle, awaiting a Word of Power.f. Then again sound the OM and feel the impact of [745] the tidal wave (if Imay so call it) of spiritual energy, entering into your head centre, passingfrom thence to the ajna centre, and involving in its flow the centre in themedulla oblongata—the alta major centre.g. Then, at the exact moment of this realised dispersion, say, “This source ofpower is all I am and have; I send it forth to serve my fellowmen; I thusprepare the way into the Ashram, thus drawing men toward the source of power andstrength.”5. Having completed this exercise, then meditate for ten minutes upon theservice you are asked to render; see it motivated and implemented by the energyjust received, and let your creative imagination build for you a structure foryour service.I have spoken to you with directness, my brother. I am, as I have told severalof your group brothers, ambitious that all of you in my Ashram may becomecreative and constructive workers within and for the Hierarchy. I am exceedinglyanxious also to see you expressing in fuller measure all that you are, and thusend this time of “flighty service” (forgive me for this word, but I speak toarrest your consciousness) and enter into that full demonstration of thewill-to-good which brings always joy and effectiveness.We have walked the path of life in relation to each other for years now. I haveheld you safe from harm whilst you got your bearings and tested out yourstrength, but that time should now be past. I stand by you at all times, but youmust now come forth into steadfast ordered work, shouldering responsibility and“growing up” spiritually. The time of spiritual adolescence is past for you.Will you realise that and now work ?~MY DISCIPLE: August 1946You are of those in this group who are within the Ashram, and that fact carrieswith it a definite obligation and [746] responsibility. In my last instructionto you (given two years ago) I dwelt much on this, and I would like to tell youthat you have made progress, that you have eliminated much nonessential living,and are finding more time for real service. You are becoming—as an occult phraseputs it—“grounded in your place”; that was for you an essential step. Now mustcome the mastering of the technique or method whereby (from that place) you moveforward in any needed direction—along the line of service.In this connection, no one can help you; you have to find the ways and means,alone and unaided. This effort on your part, this groping here and there for arightful field of service, is largely responsible for your exceedingsensitivity; you move in one direction and react to a needed opposition; thisproves upsetting and may lead to a psychic crisis. You move in another directionand are immediately assailed by that which is to you a phantom of fear; you moveelsewhere but the opportunity for service proffered measures not up to yourcapacity, and this you register and again withdraw, conscious always of psychicatmospheres and conditions. What then to do?A great experiment is being attempted in the Arcane School. It is an endeavourto lift off the shoulders of the Masters the training of aspirants fordiscipleship and thus to prepare them to take their stand upon the periphery ofan Ashram—in this case mine. I am thus lifting much along this line off theshoulders of other Masters. Masters such as K.H. and M. deal only at this timewith trained disciples—such are the exigencies of world work. In the advancedsection of the Arcane School this experiment is going on, though as yet only inan embryonic manner; more difficult and specific training should be given to thefew who are reacting correctly to the “call of the Hierarchy.” I have spoken toA.A.B. upon this matter, and along the line pointed out to her I ask your helpand your time; I would ask you also to permit A.A.B. to train you morespecifically for this work, and to do so with confidence, as the link betweenyou two is strong and you have ever permitted her to speak to you withfrankness. [747]You need to learn to protect yourself from people, in a psychic sense. Thisprotection can be applied in several ways. I could myself put around you aprotecting shield; I choose not to do so, for you would learn naught thereby.The work must be done by you yourself, and basically involves the transmutationof the sacral centre (not the solar plexus, as you might naturally think) to thethroat. In the sacral centre lie the ancient racial fears and deep-seatedpersonal desires. Ponder not upon the sacral centre, for that would bring theseancient inheritances to the surface, but let your work be related to thecreative throat centre. Then perform the following exercise:1. Sound the OM within the throat centre, as the soul focussed in the ajnacentre.2. See (with the creative imagination) the throat centre as a radiant, vibrant,brilliant reservoir and know it to be so.3. Then send forth from that centre a broad and vital stream of energy, down thespine to the sacral centre in the spine, preserving the stream intact in yourconsciousness so that no part of it is deflected to the physical counterparts ofthe sacral centre, the gonads.4. Then see the sacral centre (in the spine) as a radiant reservoir of energy,but as energy deflected from physical creative activity to the destruction ofancient racial fears in the world. Then project that energy out into the worldof men, to aid in the destruction of fear.5. Next, reaffirming your consciousness positively in the ajna centre, withdrawyour attention from the sacral centre and the throat centre and sound the OM—asthe directing disciple—seven times, slowly and inaudibly.Use this exercise as often as needed, but just now and for six months use itevery day. You will be surprised what it will do for you.The meditation I last gave you will serve you for the rest of your life, so Igive you no meditation now.To you, as to others in the group, I say: Go forward with [748] confidence andwith joy; establish a closer contact with me, your friend and teacher.~MY BROTHER: November 1948I start today with a word of real commendation to you. Since my lastcommunication to you, you have succeeded in doing two things: stabilised the“grounding in your place” in my Ashram (to which I referred in my lastcommunication to you) and you have also paralleled that by a very definiteshifting of your astral polarisation on to higher astral levels—a task that isoccupying the attention of a very large number of disciples at this time. Thereason for this is that a very great part of the work of the returning Christwill affect greatly the astral plane. Disciples are therefore needed who canabsorb, transmute and transfer light. For this task you are peculiarly equippedand hence the psychic difficulties which have for some years confronted you andcaused you difficulty. This trouble will greatly lessen from now on,particularly if you proceed to labour at your task ... preparatory to thereappearance of the Christ.Those disciples who work today in the world and do so consciously in order toaid the Christ and His mission, come within the protecting aura with which theHead of the Hierarchy at all times surrounds certain work undertaken by theHierarchy in connection with our planet. This work of preparation for His comingis curiously fraught with danger because of the immense and constant antagonismit arouses (and is arousing increasingly) in the opposing forces of evil. Themain attack of these forces is upon disciples and particularly those in aposition and at the point in evolution where they can act with potency andgreatly help in the task of reaching others. This you can do, and along with alldisciples are, therefore, marked “for protection,” as it is esoterically called.This does not mean that you will be free from attack and—because you are adisciple—attack on all three bodies simultaneously, but it means that suchattack will arouse in you no fear. Remember always, brother of [749] mine, thatit is fear that permits the entry of wrong potencies, and that such an attackmay not be aimed at your weakest point but preferably at your strongest; it isthere where disciples are often caught unawares and thus suffer a temporarysetback.The astral plane is in a great state of turmoil today—but that is a theme uponwhich I will dwell in my next communication to this group of disciples. It isnevertheless something to bear in mind. This turmoil is caused by an increasingdescent of the Christ energy from the buddhic plane into the astral plane—anecessary aggregation of spiritual forces of a strength sufficient to create areservoir of this energy of which the Hierarchy can avail itself as it proceedstowards externalisation. Of that force (which is astral-buddhic in nature)disciples such as yourself can take advantage. It carries the qualities of“embodied light,” sensitivity to the new incoming vibration, and protectivepliancy —I know not what other word to use. It can only be used by workingdisciples; therefore work , my brother, and let that penetrating energy find achannel through you.I have told you these things in order to reassure you, for you have been in thepast somewhat prone to psychic fear, though a very great improvement in thisrespect can be noticed. Those who work in this coming cycle must cast off fearand refuse to register in their consciousness—by an act of the spiritualwill—the very existence of that which causes the reaction of fear. It is not the“little wills of men” which must here be used, but the bringing in of the higherspiritual will, via the antahkarana. It was with this in view that I gave outthe teaching upon the antahkarana before proclaiming the reappearance of theChrist.In the reorganisation of the Arcane School, I would ask you to take your fullshare and to concentrate your major effort upon the work of the senior students.Have in mind always that it is spiritual esotericism that is required; teachingthe students to create a line of light between themselves and all circumstancesand problems. This is possible because every problem is in reality a vitalthoughtform, effective for good or evil. The line of established light candispel the evil [750] or act as a transmitter of the energy of the will-to-good.In the above few sentences I have given you a potent hint and one which shouldbe taught to all true aspirants.There is little more that I have to say to you. You might find it of truehelpfulness if you gathered together and read at one sitting, slowly andcarefully, all which I have given to you in your personal instructions sincethis group was organised. This will give you (as nothing else can) a syntheticview of the general pattern of your spiritual growth and advancement.Go forward with a sense of strength, knowing that the power of your soul, thesolidarity of the Ashram, and the protective aura which surrounds the work ofthe Christ can ever be relied upon.~TO D. L. R.BROTHER OF MINE: January 1940I find it most difficult to give a name to the glamour which holds back the fullexpression of your soul. I might perhaps call it the “glamour of continuedcircumstance.” This leads to an almost unavoidable construction of a wall ofsmall and unimportant events, of negligible contacts, of monotonously regulatedand determined duties, carried forward year after year because they constituteyour duty and life function and also provide the wherewithal whereby the needsof life can be met. These provide a slow moving glamour, behind which youconscientiously and laboriously stand and daily work. Such a state of affairsleads to a static situation and to a constant conditioning of your lifeexpression. To this, your soul at times takes exception and will do soincreasingly. For this you must be prepared. You must be ready for a certainfeeling of nausea and of frustration as your life goes on and on along itspredetermined lines. And for this nausea, you will find no real understanding inyour environment. For this also you must be prepared and to accept [751] itwithout criticism of those who fail to render you right comprehension.Hitherto, you have regarded such moments of nausea as rebellion to beimmediately suppressed; you have thrust from you all aspiration towards change,regarding it as a hindering glamour and seeking always to believe that yourchoice of the stable, the safe and the familiar is entirely right. Such choicehas indeed been right at times, but it has not always been so in spite of thedetermination evidenced in your environment to hold you to the tried and thefamiliar.Seek, my brother, at any cost, to be alive and eager for the future. Hide neverbehind the thought of past achievement or of achievement in some future life;learn to recognise opportunity when it stands before your thought and be readyto change the stable rhythms of a high grade and adequate personality for theeager forward looking attitude of a world disciple. Changes will then comebecause your inner attitude has prepared the way.Sometimes, my brother, I wonder if you will recognise them, knowing them forwhat they are? Will you see the open door, leading to a fuller and a richerlife? I call you to preparedness, and for freedom from the glamours of thefamiliar, of the family and of your surroundings.~August 1940There are within you at this time, my brother, stirrings of revolution andrebellion which have in them the seeds of liberation. Does this astonish you? Oftheir depth and purpose you have as yet but little understanding. You mustremember that rebellion may be based on purely selfish desire for a way of lifewhich your personality may demand. But it can also be soul-produced, and such isthe case with you. One of the first things which a disciple has to learn is thereal nature of that which is directing him and conditioning him. With many it issome aspect of the personality or of the personality as a whole; in a few, it isthe soul. With [752] still others, the promptings may come from a sense ofinferiority and its consequent reaction of a carefully considered defencemechanism; with still others, it may be circumstance, or the race mind orpopular opinion or the people with whom they are associated through ancientties, karmic liabilities or self-chosen responsibility. I will tell you herecertain things which may aid you towards a fuller life and a deepened soulexpression.Your link with your soul is real and it was not achieved in this life. It istherefore one of the stable factors in your life. Your mind is of a high qualityand is easily responsive to the intuition and illumination; you have youremotional or astral body well under control. On the inner planes of thepersonality, your life demonstration is good and you lead a faithful andprogressive spiritual life—so much so that your vibration reaches upward sointensively at times as to sound within the periphery of the hierarchical sphereof influence. This is somewhat rare. But outward and downward (these inadequateexpressions make the teaching hard to communicate) this is not the case. Youroutgoing energy seems short circuited and your radiation is inadequate to yourinner spiritual life. You will recall that I gave you the word “radiation” someyears ago as your desired keynote. For years I have watched the intensificationof your spiritual life upon the inner planes only to see it arrested on the eveof expression upon the plane of daily life. I refer not here to characterexpression or to being what people ordinarily call good. I refer to effectiveradiation.What causes this, my brother? I would say: Outer circumstances, and two peoplein particular, plus an acutely sensitive receptivity to the mental and emotionallife of others. Ponder on this. This sensitivity causes an arresting of physicalexpression, plus a mistaken interpretation of duty at times. Know you not, mybrother, that those who are at the stage of accepted discipleship (as you are)should be radiating centres of light on a relatively large scale. With you thispotency of radiation is present but is rendered ineffective by your reaction tothe outer details of physical plane living and to the reactions of those lessdeveloped than you are. Is [753] this a hard saying? Study it with thedetachment you have so ably developed and you will find in due time that I amcorrect in my diagnosis.Re-apply and re-interpret this virtue of detachment and much will be revealed toyou. I shall not be more explicit. My function is to indicate direction, but itis for you to understand rightly and then react. Your initial interpretationgiven to my words may not be the right one in all cases. Usually the integrationof the spiritual life and of the personality proceeds as follows:1. The astral body integrates with the physical brain, via the etheric body andthe solar plexus.2. These two then integrate with the mental body and thus complete thepersonality expression.3. This is followed after much struggle and time by the definite integration ofpersonality and soul.You have, however, carried the integration from the astral body to the mentalbody and from thence to the soul but have not yet succeeded in integrating thesethree with the physical man, dominating the brain and producing a vibrantexpression of the inner man outwardly. This is somewhat rare a condition. Couldyou see yourself as you essentially are, you would make the acquaintance of avibrant, radiant, wise disciple. But you hide all that behind a wall which hasbeen built through your conditioning supersensitive nature and circumstances,and also by the influence of several people. Come out from behind thatobstructing wall, my brother, and—for the sake of those whom you can serve—bewhat you are.That this emergence on your part may bring its own problems is probably true,but with the results of right action (carried wisely and not fanaticallyforward) you have naught to do.A brief visualisation exercise and meditation may aid in this process ofemergence. It is well to bear in mind that the dramatisation of the spirituallife leads to creative appearance, strengthening the will-to-do, directing thedesire nature [754] in the right direction and producing effectiveness inphysical plane expression. You will see, therefore, that when humanity can beginen masse to work in this manner, they will enter upon a cycle wherein evil karmawill no longer be engendered and past karma will work out in experienced,spiritual living.This meditation exercise should be carefully thought out before practising sothat you can know just what you are attempting to do and can then do it withadequate results. I would ask you to do it twice daily, when convenient. I setno regular time. A year’s steady practice (with belief, plus skill in action)may cause almost dramatic changes in your life.1. Bring about focus in the soul of the potencies of the lower man by the powerof the imagination and careful visualisation. This can be done by rapid, rightalignment.2. See the soul as a radiant sun within you (the personality hiding behind itsrays). You, the real spiritual man, produce the veiling of the lower man.3. See the rays of the sun extending first to the mind bringing illumination.Pause here and focus your consciousness in the mind. The work is done byprojecting yourself along the ray of your personality and along your mental raywhich is the fifth ray of concrete knowledge or science. This should berelatively easy for you.4. Then see the rays of the soul (the sun of your life) extending and embracingyour astral nature and irradiating the astral plane with which you are incontact, thus bringing an outpouring of love. This again should be relativelyeasy of accomplishment as your astral ray is the sixth ray of devotion andidealism.5. Carry the radiation of the sun to the vital body and see it bringing (on thebeam of the seventh ray of your physical nature) such a dynamic energising thatyou will have the power, figuratively speaking, to break through the wall whichprevents the inner radiation extending into the outer physical world. [755]6.Then sound the OM softly seven times, concentrating upon the picture of thissun (which is you and your solar quality), thus irradiating the outer life.This process should be fairly easy as all your rays tend to facilitate it. Theprocess is also highly scientific for it is in reality the manipulation ofradiant solar energy straight from “the heart of the sun,” technically speaking.Work patiently along these lines and take with patience and courage the effectsproduced. For these you will be eternally grateful.~August 19421. Be not afraid of loneliness. The soul that cannot stand alone has naught togive.2. Cut deep into the roots of all thy life. Seek freedom from the past. Yet movenot from the plane where life has placed you in a part to play.3. The rhythm of all life pulsates in time and space and in that rhythm you mustfind a note that liberates.4. Ponder on the work of the Destroyer, why comes destruction and why the lossof beauty that has been. Your task in life should make that knowledge possible.Then build.5. Be a sannyasin—free, alone with God, your soul and Me. Then work and love.6. Your major life theme in this coming year is: Search freedom. Ponder on this.It is the goal for all.~MY BROTHER: September 1943As a Master studies His chelas year by year, He arrives at certain definiteknowledges anent them which are very different to those arrived at by even thedearest or closest earthly friends. The latter are apt to fail in grasping lifeessentials, because the detail and the minute aspects of the daily expressionattract attention and the surface is confounded with the depth. It is the depthwhich the Master sees; the essential quality which He grasps, and the major needwhich emerges.[756] What, my brother, lies at the very depth of your personality in this life?I refer not here to the deeps of the soul, but to the particular hidden thingwhich is and has been struggling for expression throughout this entireincarnation. What is your essential quality? Here I refer to the outstandingquality which, given due process of experience, will radiate from your life andthus constitute your major working asset. What is your predominant need thislife? Reduce all this to the requirements for initiation (for which you arebeing prepared) and you come to three fundamental things which must bemanifested, prior to that tremendous step forward upon the Path. You will notethat I am not preoccupied with your mistakes or failures. These are inevitableand are relatively unimportant, because a disciple at your point of developmentis ever aware of them and can be trusted to take the needed steps towardadjustment.For years I have watched you. You have made steady progress in all directionsbut have reached a point which it is necessary that all disciples reach, where asupreme effort, based on clear perception and insight, is essential. To aid youin making this supreme life effort, I would like to touch upon these threepoints. I must touch upon them in such a way that only you will comprehend theimplications. There is no need for your group brothers, or any one else who maycome across and read your papers, to grasp my meaning. Two factors of interestemerge here. In veiling (from the point of definite personal application) thetruths I seek to have you grasp, I present to you a compromise between theEastern method of hinting and the Western method of plain speaking! I am, at thesame time, endeavouring to convey to you the attitude of all disciples intraining for initiation. This attitude is one of extreme personal reticence andof withdrawing from those verbal contacts which reveal too much of individualsoul growth. This is one of the first lessons in the silence which initiationentails. It is also one of the first steps towards comprehension of that“isolated unity” which is distinctive of the Master. In the Hierarchy there iscomplete unity, based upon a recognised isolation of spirit from matter. [757]This thought should provide you with a theme for much profound thinking.What, therefore, brother of mine, should be the unique realisation which thisparticular incarnation should help you to express? What lies at the depths ofyour being, seeking revelation? What is the essential quality which you shouldradiate? What is your outstanding need? I will tell you the truth as I see it,reminding you however that it is the truth as you see it which changes andconditions your life. You must therefore regard my suggestions as valuable, butregard them primarily as the subject of a defined spiritual investigation—to becarried forward with an open mind and a willingness to recognise them as correctand just when your own conclusions and your intuitive response justify youragreeing. Here are my conclusions:1. The hidden beauty seeking expression in your life is the power to use wordsto arrest others and to put them, as a consequence, upon the Path of Return.This will undoubtedly surprise you, but your apparent inability to write, forinstance, a fluent letter or an eloquent appeal, or to evoke the words ofarresting power which you feel seething within you, are only indicative of apronounced personality inhibition which you can overcome, if you so wish. Wordsare the expression of the soul, when rightly employed. You do not use thosewords. You can, if you determine to do so. The art of spiritual letter writingwill release this inner beauty and enhance your service.2. The essential quality which you should radiate is an understanding holding ofthose for whom you are responsible. I said “holding,” brother of mine. A.A.B.has called my attention to the interesting fact that it is the rarest thing foryou to lose a student out of your secretarial group, yet at the same time youwrite less and (apparently) upon the outer plane, do less, than the othersecretaries. Why is this so? It is indicative of the quality which you radiate.This quality is in the [758] nature of a potency. It is the power to hold otherssteady by the nature of your understanding; this they feel, even if you do notconsciously express it. It remains still basically subjective. A quality such asthis—binding, forceful and enduring—carries its limitations as well as itsbenedictions. People can be held too closely to you for their own good, and itis ever the weaker who are thus held and the less advanced. People in this waycan become dependent upon the one who holds, and thus fail to expressthemselves, and thus again their weaknesses are developed and a tendency tonegativity. You can develop this theme yourself. But the beneficent aspect ofthis radiation is predominant in you and must be increased and thisdeliberately.3. Your major need (and this you know) is freedom, is liberation. I do not meanfreedom from incarnation or liberation from the pressures of life, but thefreedom which the sannyasin knows as he roams free in the threeworlds—unsupervised or unintruded upon by aught but his own soul. It is thefreedom which gives mental help, emotional response and physical time as andwhen the disciple chooses. These are not evoked by habit or by the demand ofothers, but are the free contribution of the soul to a current need. Yourresponse is not always to need , is it, my brother? Ponder on this.In the six seed thoughts which I gave you a year ago, this theme of liberation,of a desirable divine loneliness, and of a search for a note that could bringfreedom was a dominant one. They still should be the major subject of all yourmeditation work. I would suggest that for the coming year you take them as theseed thoughts for your definitely planned morning meditation. I am leaving youto do the planning, but would make one suggestion. These six thoughts will needto be taken one each month for six months, and then repeated for another six.For the first six months reflect upon them from the angle of your subjectiverealisation as a soul; [759] for the second six months study them from the angleof practical expression in your daily life.I am anxious for you to make the grade this life, my brother, and here I amspeaking technically. I am anxious for you to take the initiation planned byyour own soul, and to take it this life, so that you can enter into your nextincarnation with the initiate consciousness (of the grade desired), and thusstart with greatly increased assets for service. I would remind you thatinitiation is taken alone; hence my emphasis to you during the past few yearsupon the need for you to travel alone—spiritually and mentally speaking. Fromother angles you travel not alone. The spiritual life is full of paradoxes. Weset out to develop a sense of unity and of oneness with all beings, yet at timeswe must learn the lessons of loneliness and of isolation. A great “aloneness” isthe supreme test of the fourth initiation. Remember this. Yet never, my brother,will you be alone, and this too you must have in mind. It is, in the lastanalysis, a question of recognitions. Let me assure you: I recognise you and, mybrother and close friend on the inner side, I know you and love you.~BROTHER OF MINE: November 1944In what sense do I call you this? For this appellation conveys no idle statementbut is of deep significance. It is particularly so in your case and in referenceto your individual relation to me. My last instruction should have indicated toyou how deep is my comprehension of you and your nature, and how well Iunderstand your problems, your limitations and your assets. Every Master needsto have such an understanding and to know infallibly what is in a disciple’sheart and mind; He must understand what motivates his action. When also there isa karmic tie as well as a spiritual one, when there is a recognition of unity ofpurpose, plus a past history of close relationship when the Master was also onlya disciple and the disciple was only an aspirant, then the words “Brother ofmine” take on a deeper meaning. They [760] might indicate a steady movingforward, side by side, of a younger and an older brother, resulting in aconsequent close relationship, easy contact and a deep comprehension. In thissense, therefore, my mode of addressing some of you is not simply significant ofan occult truth but of an existent fact in the three worlds. There are four ofyou in this group who have such a relationship to me. It is—between us—an oldstory. Others in this group, as you know, are temporarily under my instructionuntil such time as they have fitted themselves to fill vacancies in otherAshrams; still others are, for the first time, making contact with me in myAshram, having had no previous contact with any Ashram. I bring these points toyour attention because I would have you utilise a possibility which remains asyet a hoped-for event in your case—the possibility of a realised, easy contactwith me. It has always been possible for you to contact me with facility but youhave seldom realised it. I want you now to realise it and to develop into outerexpression what has always interiorly existed.How, brother of mine, can you do this? One definite means of intensifying thisinner recognition would be to avail yourself more fully of the period of theFull Moon approach. For years you have all been utilising this monthlyopportunity but with relatively little results; this has somewhat surprised mefor, on the side of the Ashram, there has been a great readiness for such anapproach and an eagerness to stimulate “the process of absorption,” as it iscalled. This is a process which serves to integrate the disciple regularly andcyclically into the consciousness of the Ashram, with subsequent and consequentresults to the disciple.I would ask you, therefore, each month and for the rest of your life to followfor three days a definite procedure.... I ask this because I believe you havethat persistent staying power which is characteristic of all those whosepersonalities are on the ray which is yours. The procedure will involve puttingyourself en rapport with my Ashram and to register it in your physical brainconsciousness. You may not and probably will not succeed in this endeavourimmediately, but in due course of time and with persistent effort you [761]inevitably will. Think of me as you know me to be; let not your sixth raydevotional nature play any part in this process or contact. Bear in mind thatfirst ray disciples are in my Ashram, and that there are aspects of my naturewhich are of first ray origin, but when you remember this, bear also in mindthat the aspect to which I refer is Triadal.The Masters have no personalities as you understand personality. Theirconditioning factors are the three aspects of the Spiritual Triad, and theseaspects, being creative, build the phenomenal apparatus or mechanism by means ofwhich a Master makes contact with the three worlds. This means, consequently,that disciples will need to study with greater attention the teaching on theantahkarana, for it is via the antahkarana that they make contact with theAshram and with the Master. Forget not that I have assured you that such acontact is relatively easy for you; the implications of this statement areclear. Let your reflection be upon the purpose of such a contact. Realise alsothat the intention of this work is to facilitate a great possibility whichconfronts you, that the urgency of the time demands “accomplished servers” andwise disciples, and that this urgency warrants an intensified training givendisciples such as you. The contact with the Ashram will serve to emphasise inyour mind the concept of yourself as the serving disciple. You are strong andable to take what the process requires; you can rest back on your own strengthwhen it is implemented by an increasing clarity of vision. You see people andlife more truly than you did when you were first affiliated with my group, andthe last two years have brought about much change in this connection. Count onyourself and on your soul with greater confidence; move forward with suretytowards the consummation of this life’s effort.I would call to your attention that in the instructions I gave you last year andin this one, you have a complete unit of teaching which can suffice you for theremainder of this life. Read both these instructions over once every monthregularly, thus renewing your interest and your enthusiasm. It is interesting toobserve that initiation is often taken (I might say it is usually taken) afterpassing the milestone of [762] half a century. The reason is that if thedisciple can produce the needed staying power and the required enthusiasm—bywhich I mean dynamic purpose—he can then be trusted to handle the powersconferred with wisdom, to display the needed poise, and to proceed upon hisoutward way with humility and caution.I have told you much in these last two instructions; they consummate theteaching which I have given you since 1933. Ponder on them. Act upon them andthen strengthen the Ashram and present to the Masters a wise server and atrained companion on the Way.~MY DISCIPLE: August 1946I would have you note the change in the manner in which I am addressing you. Ithas significance and my word to you in this instruction is simply this: Give tothe years ahead a deep study in order to ascertain the implications and theopportunities that this word—given you at this particular time—implies; studythe consequent effectiveness in contact (upward, inward, and outward, if one mayuse such inadequate terms!) that will result.Occultly speaking, you stand alone; you lead a lonely life, for there is nosingle person in your environment who shares with you the same quality or gradeof spiritual perception. This you may deny, for your life is very full. Life hasits constant points of revelation, some of which we recognise, and others passby unnoted. The revelation of a certain type of spiritual loneliness is onethrough which all disciples have to pass; it is a test of that occult detachmentwhich every disciple has to master.This solitariness has to be faced and understood, and it results in tworealisations: first of all, a realisation of your exact point on the ladder ofevolution, or on the Path; and secondly, an intuitive perception of the point inevolution of those we contact along the way of life. For quite a long time everydisciple refuses to do either of these two things. A false humility, which inreality borders on a lack of truthfulness, [763] keeps him from clear-eyedrecognition of status—a recognition which necessarily involves more intelligenceand sounds out no call to pride. Few too dare trust themselves to see theirfellowmen as they really are, for fear of a critical spirit—so hard it is todevelop the true practice of loving understanding which leads to the seeing ofall people in truth, with their faults and their virtues, their pettiness andtheir grandeurs, and still to love them as before and even more.This occult solitariness must be consciously developed by you, and not left tocircumstances. It is a solitariness which rests on soul attainment and upon nospirit of separateness; it is a solitariness which boasts of many friends andmany interruptions, but of these many, few—if any—are admitted to the point ofsacred peace; it is a solitariness that shuts none out, but which withholds thesecrets of the Ashram from those who seek to penetrate. It is, finally, asolitariness which opens wide the door into the Ashram.This is the factor you need the most to cultivate at this time. It willnecessitate a conscious and definite withdrawal of yourself, and at the sametime will lead to a still warmer expression of love upon the outer plane oflife.The closing of this outer group may enable you the more easily to do this, andmay deepen your inner life immeasurably. Welcome, therefore, this opportunity.As regards the outer group, I would ask you to keep in close touch, however,through correspondence, with J.S.P.; she is a group brother who sorely needsyour strength and knowledge. She has suffered far more than any of you andsorely needs lifting into a sense of security and peace. I commend her to you,and she will be good for you as you for her.As for your meditation work, my brother, I would have you adhere to the FullMoon procedure outlined earlier by me, and I would ask you to keep this practiceup for the remainder of your life. I would have you add to this monthly work adaily practice, founded upon the theme of a chosen solitariness. Note the word“chosen.” It is wiser to cultivate the quality of spiritual solitude than tohave it forced upon you—as so often happens to so many. I will suggest only thethemes for your meditation, leaving you to work out the form [764] or procedureto suit yourself, or to do without any form if it seems better to you.Themes For Meditation. One for each month, to be reviewed year by year.1. The nature of solitude.2. The difference between solitude, loneliness, separateness and isolation. Iwould refer you to Patanjali (The Light of the Soul, Book III:50) who speaks of“isolated unity.”3. Solitude and the daily life.4. Solitude and the soul.5. Solitude as a quality of the interior life of an Ashram.6. The solitude of spiritual perception.7. The solitude necessitated by the service of the Plan.8. Solitude as the background of a radiant life.9. Solitude and contact with the Master.10. The rewards of solitude.11. The voices heard in the silence of solitude.12. The silence of the Spheres.In this solitude there is no morbidness, there is no harsh withdrawing, andthere is no act of seperateness. There is only the “place where the disciplestands, detached and unafraid, and in that place of utter quiet the Master comesand solitude is not.”"},{"pageContent":"THE MYSTERIESGreat is the mystery of godliness![767] The word went forth to all the sons of men, the Sons of God: Show forththe signature of God.

Revealdivinity.Great is the mystery of thought!The word went forth to all the sons of men, the Sons of God: Think on the past,the future, and on that which is today. Learn that through thought the Way intothe innermost can stand revealed. God thought, and all the worlds emerged andran their courses. Man, in his distant radiant past, before his life on earth,the past that was before all time and space, evolved a thought. Forth into thelight of day he came and ran his course. He runs until today.Great is the mystery of pain!The word went forth to all the sons of men, the Sons of God: Learn through thestruggle of earth life to choose the way that is the better—then the best. Evadenot pain. Seek not the easiest way, which is not to be found. Tread then the Waywhich leads through sorrow, pain and dire distress to that High Place from whichyou came—the Place where God walks with the sons of men, who are the Sons ofGod. Before the august Presence, all pain shall disappear; sorrow shall fadeaway, and death shall triumph not. Beauty and goodness and the strength of Godirradiate the face of men.
