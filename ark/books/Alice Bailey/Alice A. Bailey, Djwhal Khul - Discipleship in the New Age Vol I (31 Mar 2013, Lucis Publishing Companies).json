I live in a physical body like other men, on theborders of Tibet, and at times (from the exoteric standpoint) preside over alarge group of Tibetan lamas, when my other duties permit. It is this fact thathas caused it to be reported that I am an abbot of this particular lamasery.Those associated with me in the work of the Hierarchy (and all true disciplesare associated in this work) know me by still another name and office. A.A.B.knows who I am and recognises me by two of my names.I am a brother of yours, who has travelled a little longer upon the Path thanhas the average student, and has therefore incurred greater responsibilities. Iam one who has wrestled and fought his way into a greater measure of light thanhas the aspirant who will read this article, and I must therefore act as atransmitter of the light, no matter what the cost. I am not an old man, as agecounts among the teachers, yet I am not young or inexperienced. My work is toteach and spread the knowledge of the Ageless Wisdom wherever I can find aresponse, and I have been doing this for many years. I seek also to help theMaster M. and the Master K.H. whenever opportunity offers, for I have been longconnected with Them and with Their work. In all the above, I have told you much;yet at the same time I have told you nothing which would lead you to offer methat blind obedience and the foolish devotion which the emotional aspirantoffers to the Guru and Master Whom he is as yet unable to contact. Nor will hemake that desired contact until he has transmuted emotional devotion intounselfish service to humanity-not to the Master.The books that I have written are sent out with no claim for their acceptance.They may, or may not, be correct, true and useful. It is for you to ascertaintheir truth by right practice and by the exercise of the intuition. Neither Inor A.A.B. is the least interested in having them acclaimed as inspiredwritings, or in having anyone speak of them (with bated breath) as being thework of one of the Masters. If they present truth in such a way that it followssequentially upon that already offered in the world teachings, if theinformation given raises the aspiration and the will-to-serve from the plane ofthe emotions to that of the mind (the plane whereon the Masters can be found)then they will have served their purpose. If the teaching conveyed calls forth aresponse from the illumined mind of the worker in the world, and brings aflashing forth of his intuition, then let that teaching be accepted. But nototherwise. If the statements meet with eventual corroboration, or are deemedtrue under the test of the Law of Correspondences, then that is well and good.But should this not be so, let not the student accept what is said.August 1934"},{"pageContent":"THE GREAT INVOCATIONFrom the point of Light within the Mind of GodLet light stream forth into the minds of men.Let Light descend on EarthFrom the point of Love within the Heart of GodLet love stream forth into the hearts of men.May Christ return to Earth.From the centre where the Will of God is knownLet purpose guide the little wills of men—The purpose which the Masters know and serve.From the centre which we call the race of menLet the Plan of Love and Light work out.And may it seal the door where evil dwells.Let Light and Love and Power restore the Plan on Earth.“The above Invocation or Prayer does not belong to any person or group but toall Humanity.

Nothing like it has before beenpublished, as far as I know. It contains two series of talks by one of theMasters of the Wisdom to some members of His inner group, and also a series ofpersonal instructions, given by Him to a group of His disciples. Many of thesepeople were unknown to me when they were brought to my notice; some of them Ihave since met; others I have never met; some I knew well and could understandwhy they had been chosen, knowing that their dedication to the life of thespirit and their love of humanity warranted the choice; one or two were regardedby me as most unsuitable choices but later I altered my point of view andrecognised that a wiser mind than mine was responsible for their inclusion inthe Ashram. I learnt also that ancient relationships, established in otherlives, were also conditioning factors and that some had earned the right toinclusion, even if their spiritual attainments seemed inadequate to theonlooker.A good deal of the teaching given is new in form and some of it is new in fact.One point emerges with clarity and that is: the old rules to which discipleshave been subjected down the centuries still hold good, but are susceptible offresh and often different interpretations. The training to be given during thecoming New Age will be fitted to their more advanced development. Theevolutionary progress—from century to century—presents a steadily ripening anddeveloping human mind upon which the Master can work. The standard ofdiscipleship is consequently as steadily rising. This, in itself, demands a newapproach, a wider presentation of truth and the permitting of a greater freedomof action upon the part of the disciple. The time element is also different. Inthe old days, the Master gave His disciple a hint or a point upon which toponder and meditate or He might indicate some need for changed habits ofthought. Then the disciple went away—[x] sometimes for years or an entirelifetime—and reflected and thought and attempted to alter his attitudes withoutany particular sense of pressure. Today, in our speedier times and when thedemand of humanity for help is so outstanding, the hint has given place toexplanation and the disciple is trusted with information, hitherto withheld. Heis regarded as having reached a stage in his unfoldment at which he can make hisown decisions and proceed with rapidity, if he so chooses.Certain definite reasons have prompted me to make these instructions availablefor aspirants everywhere after requesting permission from those who receivedthem. One is the need to bring to the attention of the general public the factthat the Hierarchy exists, that its Members are interested in human progress andthat there is a definitely planned system of training offered by Them which canlead a man out of the human kingdom into the Kingdom of God; that this movingforward upon the Path of Evolution out of the fourth kingdom into the fifth canbe brought about consciously, scientifically and with the full consent andcooperation of the aspirant. The day has now come when belief can (and does)give place to knowledge—a knowledge gained through the acceptance of ahypothesis in the first place, a conviction that this hypothesis is backed byadequate testimony and planned experience. The reasoning mind of the disciplecan then take the successes and failures he encounters in his training and learnthe intended lessons; he finds that progress upon the Path brings a man intocloser, conscious touch with Those Who have walked this Way before and that theWay into the Hierarchy is a way of discipline, of increasing enlightenment, ofservice to his fellowmen and of a growing responsiveness to contacts and toindividuals of which the average human being knows nothing.A second reason for publishing this book is the need to change the point of viewof the general public as to the nature of these Masters Who take pupils and Who,whilst giving them the training needed to enable them to take initiation (as itis called), reach the mass of men through their means. So much stupidity hasbeen demonstrated in writing and talking about the relationship of Master anddisciple that it was felt both by [xi] me and this group of disciples that thesanity, the breadth of vision, the lack of authority, and the understandingevidenced by a Member of the Hierarchy could do nothing but good. We found alsothat He was quite ready for His instructions to be made public.A third reason was the desire to make clear a point which is continuallyemphasised by the Tibetan as it is by all Masters and which is of majorimportance to every aspirant. Only those who are beginning to come under theinfluence and the control of their own souls and are, therefore, mentallyfocussed and attuned, are eligible for the training offered by the Hierarchy.Devotion, emotional reactions and sentiment are not enough. Esoteric training isalso an impersonal matter; it is concerned with the development of soulconsciousness and with the expansion of that consciousness to include, and notexclude, all forms of life through which pulses the life and love of God. Thetrue disciple is ever inclusive and never exclusive. It is this inclusivenesswhich is the hallmark of all true esotericists. Where it is lacking you may havean aspirant but you do not have a true disciple. There is far too muchexclusiveness extant today among esotericists and in occult schools and too muchtheological separativeness. It has been felt that this Book of Instructions maydo much to offset this evil tendency and may help to open the door still widerinto the Kingdom of God.Much in this book is new. Much is very old, tried and proved. None of the peoplechosen for instruction and for inclusion in the Ashram of the Master are saintsor perfect. All are, however, true aspirants and will go on to the very end inspite of pain and sorrow, discipline, success, failure, joy and a spiritualrecognition of almost unattainable goals. Some have been on this Path ofAccepted Discipleship (technically understood) for many lives. Some areventuring for the first time—consciously and with deliberate effort—to tread theWay to God. All are mystics, learning to be occultists. All are normal people,living useful, modern lives in many different countries in the world. Some areorthodox Protestant Christians by profession; others are Roman Catholics; stillothers are Christian Scientists or belong to one or other of the more mentalcults; [xii] some are quite unattached and free from affiliations. None of themregards his particular brand of faith or his particular religious background asessential to salvation; he knows that the only essential is belief in thespiritual realities and in the essential divinity of mankind. This beliefnecessarily involves a heart full of love, a mind open and illumined by rightorientation to truth and a life dedicated to service and to the alleviation ofhuman sufferings. This is the determined goal of all whose instructions arefound in this book—a goal which they have not yet attained and a mode of lifewhich they have not yet perfected. They are, nevertheless, unalterably upontheir way and that way is the WAY. Christ said “I am the Way, the Truth and theLife”; these aspirants, working under a great Disciple of the Christ, arebeginning to grasp some of the significances and implications of that statementwhich holds true for all time and for all disciples, because “as He is, so arewe in this world.”The work with this particular group began twelve years ago. Each person’sinstructions are given in their ordered sequence, year by year, so that a realpicture of the person concerned, of his problems and his achievement or lack ofachievement, emerges clearly. This book is encouraging in that it offsets theidea that to be a pledged disciple one is, therefore, set apart by perfection ofcharacter and isolated by the aspiration which inspires the life. These arepeople with problems, struggling to solve them; with character limitations whichthey are endeavouring to overcome; they are true instances of any man or womanwho turns his back upon the usual approach to the world of material affairs andtakes up his cross in order to find his way back to the Father’s home; theypicture for us the man who, having “put his hand to the plough,” turns not backbut presses forward “towards the prize of his high calling in Christ.”Some of these people have worked as students in the Arcane School; others havenever done so; still others (when they heard of the school through theiraffiliation with the Tibetan) worked in it in order to help the students. Theirnames will not be divulged. The initials at the head of the various instructionsand the dates assigned carry no information; the [xiii] instructions wereprobably not received on the dates given and the initials are none of themcorrect. No information will be given by any of us who know the relation betweenthe initials and the disciple. Questions as to identity will not be answered atany time. It is the subject matter of the teaching which is of importance andnot the name of the disciple for what is said is applicable to all aspirants.One other reason might be mentioned here as indicative of the value of thisbook. In every case, the disciple is told what are the types of energy to whichhe most easily responds and upon which ray or divine emanation he finds himself.He, therefore, becomes aware of what constitutes his line of least resistanceand where the major point of his life conflict is to be found.We are taught in the esoteric philosophy that seven great divine Emanations,Aeons or Spirits (in Whom we live and move and have our being) came forth fromGod at the time of the Creation. The same teaching can also be traced in theHoly Bible. Upon one or other of these seven Rays, the souls of all forms oflife are to be found as well as the forms themselves. These seven rays producethe seven major psychological types. These seven rays or emanations are:1. The first Ray of Will or Power. Many great world rulers are found on thisray, such as Julius Caesar.2. The second Ray of Love-Wisdom. The Christ and the Buddha are to be found onthis ray. It is the great teaching ray.3. The third Ray of Active Intelligence. The mass of intelligent humanity arefound on this ray.4. The fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict. Aspirants. Struggling,well-meaning people. Workers for unity emerge along this line.5. The fifth Ray of Concrete Knowledge or Science. Scientists and people who arepurely mental and governed only by the mind.6. The sixth Ray of Devotion or Idealism. Many Christian people. Fanatics.Numbers of earnest Churchmen of all the world religions. [xiv]7. The seventh Ray of Ceremonial Order or Magic. Masons. Financiers. Greatbusinessmen and organisers of all kinds. Executives are found with theseenergies in their equipment.However, only when a man is highly developed and nearing the Path ofDiscipleship is it possible for the esoteric student accurately to surmise whathis ray may be. People of all kinds and professions are found on all the rays.The conflict in a disciple’s life is found to lie in the fact that the ray ofhis soul and the ray of his integrated personality are posed against each other.At the same time, his emotional nature, his mental equipment and his physicalbrain are also controlled by some one or other of the rays and in this fivefoldrelationship lies hid much of the problem of the evolving human being. TheTibetan tells the members of His group which five rays condition them andstudents will learn much by a study of what He says. In the cases where I happento know the disciple concerned personally and something of his problems, it wasamazingly interesting to me to note how infallibly right the Tibetan was in Hisdiagnosis of the rays involved. In reading these instructions will you pleaseremember that though the Tibetan usually speaks of the soul, He also uses theword “ego” interchangeably, meaning thereby the spiritual ego and not thepersonal ego of the psychologists.We have not felt it wise to give the meditations assigned or the breathingexercises, except in a few cases. They were strictly individual and suited tothe person and his peculiar problems. In one or two cases, however, after dueconsideration, we have inserted some of the meditations with slight changes. Itwas obvious that they could be only helpful.At the end of each instruction, we have put a sentence or two which givesinformation as to the work of the disciple in the Ashram. This will proveparticularly enlightening as, for instance, in the cases of P.D.W. and K.E.S.where the Tibetan shows definite prevision and the knowledge that both these menwould die a few years later. He is obviously preparing them for that greattransition.In closing, I would like to thank all these disciples who have so kindly placedtheir personal instructions at my disposal [xv] in an effort to be of service tothe coming generation of disciples. In many cases, they helped prepare them forthe press. I would like also to thank those who helped me to get the text readyfor publication, particularly Joseph Lovejoy who gave days of labour to thebook; he has for years helped me prepare the Tibetan’s books for publication.I hope all who read this book will receive the inspiration that we who haveprepared it have received; I hope also that their confidence in the Hierarchyand in the existence of Christ and His Disciples, the Masters, may receive suchan impetus that many more will attempt to tread the Way and join the greatnumber of aspirants in every country who are seeking to tread the Path bybecoming the Path Itself.October 1943ALICE A.

It is precipitating onearth and will be composed of those who are becoming group-conscious and who canwork in group formation. This will be possible, because these people will haveachieved a self-initiated perfection (even if relative in nature) and will beidentified with certain group expansions of consciousness. It will also bebecause they have arrived at love of their fellowmen, just as they have lovedthemselves in the past. Think on this with clarity, my brothers, and grasp, ifyou can, the full significance of this last sentence.Their work will largely be to summarise and make effective the work of those twogreat Sons of God, the Buddha and the Christ. As you know, One of Them broughtillumination to the world and embodied the principle of wisdom, and the Otherbrought love to the world and embodied in Himself a great cosmic principle—theprinciple of love. How can the effectiveness of Their work be brought about? Theprocess will follow three lines:1. Individual effort, made by the individual disciple, using the technique ofdetachment, of dispassion and of discrimination which the Buddha taught.2. Group initiation, made possible by the self-initiated effort of individualdisciples, following out the injunctions of the Christ and leading to a completesubordination of the personality and of the unit to group interest and groupgood. [4]3. Group endeavour, carried forward as a group, to love all beings and toapprehend and understand the true significance of the Aquarian technique ofgroup love and work.I have felt that a linking up of your minds in connection with the work of theBuddha and of the Christ might serve a useful purpose and give you all a glimpseand an indication of Their two systems of unfoldment—one preparatory to accepteddiscipleship and the other to initiation—which would be sequential andinter-related. The synthesis of Their work is easily seen by us who work with afuller vision and a less impeded outlook than is as yet possible to you.I am, therefore, dividing my disciples into groups so that they may work ondifferent aspects of the Plan, and also laying the ground for group work whichwill greatly help the individual but which will also—above everythingelse—forward the work of the New Age.It is, therefore, my intention to write a little in detail in connection withthese groups. My time is very limited and I shall have to put a great deal ofinformation into these talks and into any individual instructions which I may beled to give (probably at widely separated intervals) to my disciples. I am notbasically writing for any of you at all but in order to lay the foundation forthe group work to be done in the world during the coming years. What I sayshould be read with care, for the written word may contain several meanings andthese can be sensed, according to the intuition—awakened or otherwise—of theaspirant.I, your Tibetan Brother, am supposing upon the part of each of my disciples, onebasic essential at least and that is a persevering earnestness which nothingwill deter. Each of you starts upon this work with certain fundamentalcharacteristics; each of you is beginning this definite enterprise of trainingfor initiation with certain defects which act as deterrents and as handicaps;each of you has been recognised by his light and for his potentialities and withthese we must perforce do the best we can. Note, therefore, the difficultproblem confronting Those Who are guiding world evolution and looking for thosewho can aid in Their work.[5] I will teach you. Whether or not you profit by the teaching is entirely yourown affair; that is something that the disciples of the New Age need to learn.There is no such thing as occult obedience as usually taught by the currentoccult schools. In the olden days in the East, the Master exacted from Hisdisciple that implicit obedience which actually made the Master responsible andplaced upon His shoulders the destiny or the karma of the disciple. Thatcondition no longer holds good. The intellectual principle in the individual isnow too much developed to warrant this type of expectancy. Therefore, thiscondition no longer holds good. In the coming New Age, the Master is responsiblefor the offering of opportunity and for the right enunciation of the truth butfor no more than that. In these more enlightened days, no such position isassumed by the teacher as in the past, and I do not assume it. I shall withfrankness speak. I know my disciples, for no disciple is admitted into an Ashramwithout deep consideration on the part of the teacher. I shall convey by hintand symbol that which should be apprehended and it will be noted and understoodby those among my disciples who have the opened, inner ear and true humility ofheart. If it is not recognised, time will pursue its onward course andrevelation will ultimately come. I exact, therefore, no blind obedience. But,however, if advice and suggestion are accepted and you choose—of your own freewill —to follow my instructions, those instructions must be followed accurately.Also, there must be none of that constant looking for results and for phenomenawhich has deterred the course and the progress of many would-be disciples.This is also for me an experiment, for those of us who are members of somedegree of the Hierarchy are necessarily changing the old ways and adapting theold methods to the newer circumstances and to the advance of evolution. Manytried disciples and aspirants (should I have said “tired,” brother of mine, forI surmise that both words are true?) are to be subjected to experiments whichwill involve the application of the ancient rules in a modern way. Disciples inthe olden days were the product of more peaceful times. The “chitta” (ormind-stuff as Patanjali calls it in his famous Book of Rules) was neither sohighly developed nor was it tinctured by so [6] much thought or potentially soillumined. Today, knowledge is widespread and many, many people are alreadythinking for themselves. The material for discipleship with which the Mastershave to deal and the type of person which has to be developed and led on towardsillumination is of a higher quality and grade, if I may employ so inadequate aterm. The experiment of changing methods and of implementing the new techniqueof group work has to be carried out, likewise, in the midst of the stress andstrain of Western civilisation. This imposes on all chosen to participate inthis work an undue effort, but if continuance is found possible and successensues, it tempers the material to a finer degree of power. As has been said,the jungles of the Occident are of a different kind to those within the Easternzone. They call for peace in turmoil; for power in fatigue; for persistence inspite of bad health; for understanding in spite of the clamour of Western life.Progress is, therefore, made in spite of, and not because of, existingconditions. For disciples, such as those I am now going to attempt to teach,there is no retiring from the world. There is no condition of physical peace andof quiet wherein the soul may be invoked and in which work—potent in results—maybe achieved in the calm of silence and the rest of what the Hindu callssamadhi—complete detachment from the calls of the body and the emotions. Thework has to go forward in clamour. The point of peace must be found in the midstof riot. Wisdom must be attained in the very midst of intellectual turmoil andthe work of cooperation with the Hierarchy on the inner side of life mustproceed amidst the devastating racket of modern life in the great cities. Suchis your problem and such is my problem as I seek to aid you.For me, there is also the problem of excessive expenditure of force as I attemptto reach each of you and to study each of you at certain intervals. There is thework, at long range, of reading your minds, of seeing your light, and ofvitalising your auras. This has not hitherto been the problem of the EasternTeachers, except in very rare cases. Those who are now working in the modernworld under the Masters of the Wisdom have undergone a preliminary tuning-upprocess and a training in receptivity during an earlier incarnation orincarnations. [7] Forget not, therefore, that I also have a problem which I amwilling to undertake for the sake of a needy world and as my contribution tohastening the coming in of the new and more fruitful era. Let us, therefore,facilitate each others’ efforts.I promise no quick results. I undertake to provide no spectacular unfoldments.The results rest entirely with you. They depend upon your patience, yourexactness in detail, the discipline which you are willing to impose upon yourlives and your self-forgetfulness. May I beg of you to leave results alone andto work without attachment for you know not with exactitude what are my goalsfor you; may I beg you to desist from that constant self-analysis which is suchan outstanding characteristic of the introspective, yet ambitious Occidentalmystic.... What, therefore, is the position I take? That I, one of a great groupof disciples who—from the humblest aspirant up to the highest Member of theHierarchy link humanity with the spiritual kingdom—can teach you the ancientrules and give suggestions to you so that you may travel more rapidly along thePath and arrive at greater usefulness to your fellowmen. There is not theslightest suggestion of authoritative pronouncement by a member of the Hierarchywho must be obeyed and whose word is infallible. Let this be remembered,otherwise work will not be possible, elements of danger may enter in and thepresent effort come to naught. My anonymity has always been preserved and willcontinue to be so though members of this group of disciples know me for who Iam. You know me as a teacher, as a Tibetan disciple and as an initiate of acertain degree—what degree being of no importance to you at all. It is theteaching that I shall give you which will matter. I am an initiate into themysteries of being. That statement in itself conveys information to those whoknow. You know also that I am in a human body, and am a resident of northernIndia. Let that suffice and let not curiosity blind you to the teaching.We stand together in spiritual enterprise. All of you have voluntarily andwithout pressure stated your willingness to go forward into a more intensivespiritual life. This you must do in the freedom of your own souls and throughthe power of [8] your own intellects. You will follow such instructions as seemto you reasonable and right but—when you do choose to follow them—you willattempt to fulfil the requirements with exactitude. You will analyse andquestion the requirements which from time to time come from me and you willaccept no belief in their verbal inspiration. Language ever handicaps andlimits. You will also be guided in your work by health and circumstance, and youwill ever remember that Masters are made through the achieving of mastery andnot through obedience to any person. You will bear in mind that I, your teacher,am not constantly aware of your physical condition or daily doings. I concernnot myself with the affairs of the personality and those misguided aspirants whoclaim that the Masters are forever telling them what to do and are guiding themin their personal affairs are still far from the grade of accepted discipleship.You will remember that the light will shine into a mind that is self-controlledand free from the mental dominance of another mind. With these provisos clearlyunderstood, let us pass on to the enunciation of certain principles and to aconsideration of what it may be possible to do.First: Let it be constantly remembered that the new discipleship is primarily anexperiment in group work and that its main objective is not the perfecting ofthe individual disciple in the group. I regard this statement as basic andessential. The individuals are intended to supplement each other and complementeach other and in the aggregate of their qualities should eventually provide agroup capable of useful, spiritual expression and one through which spiritualenergy can flow for the helping of humanity. The work to be done is on themental plane. The spheres of service of individual disciples remain the same asbefore but to their differing fields of individual endeavour there will be addeda group activity and life which will become more clear as time elapses. Thefirst objective is, therefore, to weld and unify the group so that each personin it can work in close mental rapport and spiritual cooperation with theothers. This inevitably takes time and the success of this new effort on thepart of the Hierarchy will depend upon a non-critical attitude and theoutpouring of a spirit of love on the part of each member of the group. This [9]will be fairly easy for some disciples to achieve but very difficult for others.So many high-grade people today have an over-development of the analytical mind.As time goes on, however, and if real effort is made, the welding process willmake much progress. This, therefore, is our first effort, as it is the firsteffort of the group of every Master and the achievement of the Hierarchyitself—group unity.Every disciple has to learn to subordinate his own ideas of personal growth tothe group requirements, for—in order to have a coordinated group, functioning asa serviceable unit—some disciples will have to hasten their progress in certaindirections and others will have to slow down theirs temporarily to the pace ofthe majority. This will happen automatically, if the group identity is thedominant factor in the thoughts of each disciple, and desire for personal growthand for spiritual satisfaction is relegated to a secondary place. The groupswithin each Ashram are intended to work together eventually just as the variousdepartments of some great organisation work together effectively as a unit. Theymust function smoothly and intelligently. This will be possible when theindividual members in the groups and the individual groups lose sight of theirown identities in an effort to make this experiment of the Hierarchy successful.The feelings, reactions, wishes and successes of the individual mostemphatically do not count. Only that is regarded as of moment which will furthergroup effort and enrich the group consciousness. Only that, for instance,attracts my attention which brings more spiritual power to my group of disciplesor which increases its light or dims its radiance. You need to remember that Ilook at my groups of disciples always subjectively and as a group. It is thetotal radiance which I see; it is the united rhythm which I note and the unitedtone and colour; it is the sound they collectively emit which I hear. May Ireiterate that in one sense your individualities are of no interest or moment tome, except in so far as you raise or lower the group vibration. Aspersonalities, you matter not to us, the teachers on the inner side. As soulsyou are of vital moment. Each disciple in the group of any Master may have manyweaknesses and limitations. These act as hindrances to others in the group. But,as souls, such disciples [10] are somewhat awakened and alive and have achieveda certain measure of alignment. So it is with all of you in my group. As souls,I cherish you and seek to aid and lift, to expand and enlighten.I would like here to emphasise one point as we consider the individual in thegroup and his group relations. Watch with care your thoughts anent each other,and kill out at once all suspicion, all criticism and seek to hold each otherunwaveringly in the light of love. You have no idea of the potency of such aneffort or of its power to release each other’s bonds and to lift the group to anexceedingly high place. By the pure light of love for each other, you can drawnearer to me and to the teachers on the subjective side of life and arrive morerapidly at that Gate which opens on the lighted Way. You have the opportunity todemonstrate to each other the scientific value and power of love, regarded as aforce in nature. Make this demonstration your endeavour. You will thus releasefor each other all that is needed to bring about potent and vital changes in thelife patterns and purpose of the group members. Love is not a sentiment or anemotion nor is it desire or a selfish motive for right action in daily life.Love is the wielding of the force which guides the worlds and which leads to theintegration, unity and inclusiveness which impels Deity itself to action. Loveis a hard thing to cultivate—such is the inherent selfishness of human nature;it is a difficult thing to apply to all conditions of life and its expressionwill demand of you the utmost you have to give and the stamping out of yourselfish personal activities.Disciples in the group of a Master have to love each other with intelligence andan abiding strength and thus release that light and power which will eventuallymake the group of effective value in the world. As I work with you in thefuture, I shall not wait to wrap up the truths I have to say to each of you insuch a way that they cannot hurt. I shall not in the future consider yourpersonality feelings and reactions because I count upon the sincerity of yourpurpose.It is perhaps wise to remember here that, as a general rule, no one believeswhat others may tell him—no matter how apparent [11] the truth or how much theperson may protest that he accepts that truth. Only those truths which arewrought out individually in the crucible of experience really penetrate into theliving consciousness and bear fruit. But in this group effort which we areundertaking, the fact that all in the group are made aware of what is said tothe individual may prove most useful and produce much more rapid adjustmentsthan could otherwise be the case—provided that, unitedly and in love, they willthen help their fellow disciple to change the undesirable condition. I count onone thing only, my brothers, and that is your deep sincerity. It is not anegative thing (as some claim) to point out a fault or error. As the clear lightof the soul pours in, it reveals the personality for what it is. If truedispassion is practised, this group of disciples can see things as they are andremain untouched by the revelation of the desirable or the undesirablequalities. If you are depressed or irritated or hurt by such revelation, itindicates a basic lack of dispassion and proves attachment to the personalityand to the opinions of others.Secondly, it is essential that all disciples in an Ashram should becontemplatives, but contemplatives in the occult sense and not the mystical. Inany meditation work which you are doing or may in the future do, your aim shouldbe to achieve as rapidly as possible the highest point in the meditationprocess, passing quickly through the stages of concentration, alignment andmeditation to contemplation. Having achieved that high point, you should striveto preserve it and should learn thus to function as a soul in its own world,contemplating the world of energies in which all initiates work and in which youeach must some day—in this life or another—take your place. This status (if Imay call it by such a name) must be carefully striven for, accurately observedwhen in any way attained, and an exact record of impressions kept. You should,therefore, constitute a group of active contemplatives, and the result will befacilitated if you will ponder upon and struggle for the first condition of yourgroup existence—group unity.[12] Third: This group unity which will have its roots in united groupmeditation or in the contemplative life (wherein the soul knows itself to be onewith all souls) must work out in some form of group activity . This shoulddemonstrate at once in the group itself and later on—when the unification ismore complete—in the world at large. It is in this way that the Masters’ Ashramswill be externalised on earth and the Hierarchy function openly on the physicalplane and not behind the scenes as hitherto. Then will come the restoration ofthe Mysteries.PART IIThe question might here be asked: How can this work out practically in a groupof disciples—all of them individuals but all sincerely anxious to cooperate andaid in this work? Let me try and give a clear reply.You have undertaken voluntarily to work together when proffered the opportunityby me. You are aiming towards a group solidarity which will be based upon thefact of your being souls. This should eventually manifest itself subjectivelyand essentially in the form of a group telepathic inter-communication, as groupunderstanding also of each other’s problems and difficulties and, therefore, asa group opportunity to aid and help one another. This helping should not andmust not come through personality effort or contact, or through the stating ofproblems related to circumstance and character, or through the tendering ofadvice and suggestion. We deal not with personalities in connection with eachother in a Master’s group. At the same time, it should be possible for each ofyou to learn to strengthen and aid each other, avoiding always any intrusion ofthe personality. You can each learn to transmit your soul ray quality to afellow disciple, stimulating him to greater courage, to finer purity of motiveand to deeper love, yet avoiding the vitalisation of his personalitycharacteristics. You should learn always to think of each other as souls and notas limited human beings. [13]We have, therefore, the following three objectives before us:1. Group unity . . . through thought, exoteric knowledge of each other and aconstant sending forth of love.2. Group meditation . . . as a group of contemplatives, thus rooting this groupwithin the kingdom of the soul and strengthening all the individuals involved.3. Group activity . . . resulting in the aiding of each other in specificproblems of character but not of circumstance. Ponder on this distinction, mybrothers.Later, when the group is really established, it should begin to functionoutwardly and its life should begin to make its presence felt. It shouldsteadily tend to increase the spiritual potency of all groups with which thegroup members are related and with which they may be associated. I refer to allgroups which belong to the New Age and are working along spiritual lines. Theeventual effect will be along the line of healing the various ills ofmankind—physical, mental, psychological and emotional.There are certain simple but definite rules which should govern the interiorspiritual life of neophytes in training for the various stages of discipleship.Let me here outline to you my suggestions for this simple and immediate work.First of all, all disciples practise regular and daily meditation. Thesemeditations are each individually suited to the disciple concerned and varyaccording to ray, point in evolution and the stage of discipleship which is theimmediate objective. These cannot be given here. These meditations will be givento you as suggestions for your use and acceptance. Endeavour at some stage inyour meditation to link up with me but let this linking up take place after youhave worked at and brought about an alignment with your soul. The reason that itis essential that you link up after alignment is that you can then avoid theglamours and the illusions of the astral plane whereon thoughtforms andmasquerading entities personalise the teachers and the Masters and do so intheir myriads. Add also to your meditation a short period wherein you will tryand link up with your co-disciples, sending them love, soul force, and help.[14] You would find it useful to keep what might be called a spiritual diary.This does not involve the daily entering of the day’s events and has no relationto the happenings which may concern the personality. Note this. In this diaryyou should record the following:1. Any spiritual experience which may come to you, such as contact with somePresence, either that of your own soul, the angel of the Presence, contact withsome disciple and eventually—when your life and work and discipline warrantit—contact with one of the Masters. Record this in an impartial way, preservingthe scientific attitude and seeking ever a practical explanation beforeaccepting a mystical one. A spirit of agnosticism (not of atheism) is of realvalue to the beginner and preserves him from the snares of the world illusionand of lower psychism.2. Any illumination which may come to you, throwing a flood of light upon aproblem and revealing the way that you or the group should go. Any intuitionwhich—corroborated by the reason—carries one forward into knowledge and evokesthe wisdom of the soul and its registration by the brain, via the mind.3. Any telepathic happenings between you and your fellow disciples. Thistelepathic interplay should be cultivated but it must be most carefully checkedand counterchecked and the strictest accuracy preserved. Thus we shall have thefostering of the spirit of Truth, which is the governing principle of all truetelepathic communication. An Ashram functions telepathically when fully andrightly organised.4. Any phenomena of a mystical and spiritual kind should also be noted. Theseeing of the light in the head comes under this category. Its brilliance shouldbe noted, its growth and dimming; the hearing of the Voice of the Silence whichis the voice of the soul but not of the subconscious; the registering ofmessages from the soul or from other disciples and world Servers; expansions ofconsciousness which initiate you into the conscious life of [15] God, as itmanifests through any forms and the hearing of the note of all beings. A closestudy of the third part of The Light of the Soul (the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali )will indicate the type of phenomena which should find its place in this diary.5. Any experiences of a psychic kind which do not come under any of the aboveheadings. Those mentioned above come under the heading of the higher psychismand concern the higher psychic faculties, spiritual perception, intuitiveknowledge, mental telepathy (and not the telepathy which is based upon the solarplexus activity). The lower psychic experiences can also be noted—whetherpleasant or unpleasant. Once noted, however, they should be forgotten for theyare of no moment.Days may go by and weeks with no record. Let this in no way disconcert you. Thesensitivity of the mechanism of the soul to spiritual vibration has to becultivated and existing sensitivity to lower psychic impressions has to be tunedout; so many voices clamour for attention, so many impressions—emanating fromthe physical and astral forms around us—register upon our consciousness, thatthe vibrations and sounds coming from the subjective and spiritual world arelost and not registered and recorded. You will find it interesting to note, atthe end of a few years, the difference in the data recorded and the developmentof sensitivity to the right kind of impression. This can only be realised aftermuch time has elapsed and much spurious material has been eliminated, afterbeing recognised for what it is: astralism, spurious claims and thoughtforms.Another question might here be asked: What should disciples in a Master’s grouplook for as evidence of successful group work? First and foremost, as you wellknow, group integrity and cohesion. Nothing can be done without this. Thesubjective linking of the disciples with each other in their own group, and thelinking of the group with other groups occupied with special work within theAshram and the emergence (as a result of this) of a group and an ashramicconsciousness are vital objectives. It is hoped that this will also [16]eventuate in a telepathic interplay which will bring potent results andsuccessful outer work. From these activities will emerge a group circulation ofenergy which will be of service in world salvage. Each of you should rememberthat purity of body, control of the emotions and stability of mind arefundamental necessities and should be daily the attempted achievement. Again andagain, I come back to these prime character requirements and—tiresome as thereiteration may be—I urge upon you the cultivation of these qualities. I wouldlike to remind you also that you are adult and mature men and women who need notspecific statements as to faults and characteristics. I seek only to makesuggestion as to trends of thought. Note here the word suggestion , for that isall I seek to give. The disciple must be left free to follow a suggestion or ahint as seems wise to him. This entire work might be termed an experiment inesoteric commonsense and in willingness to accept suggestion. It is a trial ofthe intuition and a test in discrimination. This work to which I have called youis also an experiment in impersonality, in willingness to work and learn, infreedom to choose or reject, in observation and in techniques. All have theirvalue.This is an experiment likewise for me. I have worked hitherto with only threeoccidental chelas, of whom A.A.B. is one. The other two are totally unknown toany of you. I ask for your aid and cooperation during these early stages of thework as far as the reaching of conclusions is concerned. I ask you to standtogether—no matter what eventuates or what forces may seek to separate you. Iask my disciples to love each other in spite of character and ray differencesand to work loyally together for group coherence and integrity—no matter whatdiverse opinions you may hold or what may occur as time elapses. If you can holdtogether down the years and throughout this life cycle, then the group can carryforward into the future and work together on other planes, thus conservingenergy. Can you persist and carry on? Can such a telepathic interplay be set upthat the barrier of death will eventually prove no barrier at all and continuityof communication persist?[17] Many such questions arise and time alone will give the answer. If there ispersistence in effort, if there is the loyal link of love, if there is adherenceto the group ideal and if there is mutual forbearance and understanding andpatience, it may be possible that this group can be welded into a unit whichwill indeed be a living atom in the hierarchical body. You are all on the Pathof Discipleship at some stage or another; in this lies opportunity.This is a body (small indeed) of disciples who—through devotion to truth,through their attempt to do their duty, and their mutual karmic relation both toeach other and to me—have been chosen (in spite of limitations and faultydevelopment) to work together towards the specific end of forming a nucleus ofspiritual power and energy for the helping of humanity. But above all else, itis a group formed to inaugurate the methods of the New Age as regards groupwork, and the training of disciples and their preparation for initiation, alongwith other groups all over the world who have caught the new vision and areworking under the inspiration and the impression of the Masters. The foundationof these schools of the Mysteries which will later be restored to the world andto which I referred in Letters on Occult Meditation may be possible if all ofyou measure up to opportunity. This should be borne in mind. The experiment mayfail. Whether it does or not, real profit will in any case eventuate.... Thatyou may one and all measure up to the opportunity and carry the work forward inthe three worlds and in the kingdom where the light of the soul streams forth ismy earnest wish and desire.PART IIIAs you face this opportunity in a world which is passing through a major crisis,I would like to state that it is necessary for all working brothers anddisciples to have three things in mind if they are to work efficiently and asdesired.First : Disciples should know that the Masters have three grades of workers.There are those doing the difficult work in the outer world. They materialisethe forms through which the Hierarchy can express its intentions and they makethe [18] human contacts. There are many such disciples and they are doing thiswork from their own free choice and because they have realised the immediate andcoming need of humanity and have pledged themselves to serve. There are,secondly, those who act as links between the Elder Brothers of the race, theMasters of the Wisdom Who embody the divine plan and the workers mentionedabove. I do not say that they act as links between the disciple and his Masterfor that is a direct relationship which none may touch, particularly in the moreadvanced stages. This second group of working disciples, however, act asintermediaries in the working out of the plan in the world and they holdthemselves in readiness to go anywhere when requested, thus aiding with theirwisdom and experience and supplementing the capacities of the field workers,conferring with them. There are several such that are being sent expressly intothe field at this time to hasten the work whenever possible and to increase themagnetic attraction of those centres through which the spiritual force of theNew Age can flow.This is all being done preparatory to a supreme effort which the Hierarchy ofMasters plans to make. Should all of you in the field at this time work withcomplete surrender and devotion—giving of all your time and interest to thecause—it may be possible to prepare the ground in such a manner that the comingeffort of the Masters may prove adequate to the emergency.The third group is that of the Masters Themselves and Their cooperatinginitiates. They work primarily upon the inner side. Their activities areconfined largely to the mental plane and to the scientific use of thought. ThusThey guide Their workers and helpers and influence and direct Their workingdisciples and the world disciples.There is at this time an inner intention of blending the occidental and theoriental approaches to the ancient wisdom and to the Hierarchy. Cooperation andthe mutual interchange of wisdom and of knowledge are essential if this is to beperfected. The objectives of both methods—the mystic and the occult—are thesame.[19] Second: It is necessary for working disciples at this time to appreciatethe immediate emergency. There is a crisis in the affairs of men. This crisismust be viewed in terms of opportunity and not in terms of cataclysm orcatastrophe. Just as in the life of an aspirant to discipleship, there comes alife or a series of lives wherein there is direct conflict between the soul andthe lower nature, so there is now an analogous crisis upon our planet. Theobject in both cases is that the soul may assume an increasing control over theform aspect.Looking at it from another angle, this planetary soul—functioning as a Hierarchyof Masters —is in direct conflict with the forces of evil. It should, however,be borne in mind that those forces also constitute a hierarchy of entities,constituting the material forms and, therefore, in their place, true andcorrect. It is a question, in reality, of what is the objective in anyparticular time cycle. The present objective is that the human family shouldnow, as a whole, do three things and anything which militates against this isevil.1. Manifest the nature of the soul, through the integrated personality. Thenature of the soul is love and the will-to-good.2. Transfer the energy, now turned to the vitalising of the physical body andphysical creation, to the nurturing of the creative faculty upon the mentalplane; thus the entire human family will be transmuted into a dynamic,self-conscious, creative agency.3. Usher in a period of spiritual unfoldment in every kingdom in nature. At theclose of this period, the door into the animal kingdom will again be opened andopportunity offered to waiting embryonic souls. Many also, at this time, cantake initiation and hence the balancing of forces at either end of the humanline of unfoldment. This is to be brought about by the renewed cyclic activityof the Great White Lodge and will be carried forward through the medium of thoseenergies which are ushering in the New Age. This crisis is upon us almostprematurely, owing to the exceedingly rapid advance made by humanity since 1850.Through the driving [20] urge of men themselves, a new realm and a new dimensionhas been contacted. Humanity has loosed energies hitherto unknown and theeffects are of a dual kind, producing both bad as well as good results.Third: Disciples must now organise for a steady united effort. This must takethe form of a closer cooperation between all groups and a standing together in acloser relationship, thus strengthening each others’ hands and, where possible,pooling resources. It should result also in a united push forward of allspiritual and occult agencies and the carrying of the truth along all possiblelines, down among the masses of men. Just as in Atlantean days, spiritual forceswere subordinated to the selfish desires of men, so today, they are beingsubordinated to the minds and the ambitions of men and the results will beprofoundly evil. The world situation today demonstrates this. For thoughmaterial benefit and physical prosperity might eventually emerge from certaincountries where great experiments are being undertaken, they will only exemplifythe triumph of the form and will finally come to naught. Just as every humanbeing struggles through in some one life to personality achievement so it isamong the nations. Yet at the heart of every nation lies latent the mysticalsoul and eventually—after dire struggle and distress—all will be well.Tendencies towards materialism and towards personality achievement must, underthe larger plan and the will-to-good, be offset by a counter move of spiritualliving and this must be the objective of all working disciples.Let such working disciples see to it, therefore, that their love for all beingsdeepens and that the growth of their love comes through their tapping the grouplove which lies back of all world happenings. My brothers, when will the timecome when the world will realise that the love aspect of the Logos—as it affectsthe human kingdom—is focussed through the inner subjective group of workers?That love is now in the stage of anchoring itself physically through the newgroups (such as this group) which are in process of forming all over the world.These new groups are centres (or should be) of divine love, magnetic,constructive and pure. See to it, therefore, that your conformity to therequirement is met in the measure of your [21] physical strength, bearing everin mind that you are equal to more effort and to greater strain than everbefore.This experiment which I have instituted and to which you have voluntarily andwillingly submitted yourselves is one undertaken for group purposes. TheHierarchy seeks to discover how sensitive groups are, as a whole, to subjectiveguidance and instruction, and how free the channels of communication are betweenthe various individuals in the group and the Master, and between the variousgroups within the Ashram of a Master. A Master’s group of disciples, upon theinner side of life, forms an integrated organism, characterised by mutual life,love and interplay. The relationships in such a group are entirely on mental andastral levels and hence the limitations of the etheric force body and of thephysical brain are not felt. Needless to say the fundamental relation is on soullevels. The fact that the etheric body and the physical brain lie outside thesebasic relations where the Ashram is concerned leads to greater facility inunderstanding and to reciprocal interplay. It is wise to remember, however, thatthe astral potency is far more strongly felt on the physical plane thanelsewhere and hence the major emphasis laid upon emotional-desire control in alltreatises on discipleship or on preparation for that state. It is not easy forthe average beginner on the Path of Discipleship to grasp this or to see thenecessity for the rules and suggestions made. For some people to conform to ruleand discipline is not easy unless it is entirely self-initiated. The suggestionswhich I make to you, my brothers, are only suggestions but it is surely the partof wisdom to follow them as long as you have voluntarily put yourselves under mytuition. Your working under me has been entirely of your own free will andchoice. You are subjected to no compulsion. Other types of disciples evincewillingness to follow instructions but their real difficulty consists inbringing the life into conformity with the desired rhythms. The narrow path,which all disciples have to tread, requires obedience to the ancient rules fordisciples. This is given willingly and with eyes open, though no rigid adherenceto such rules is ever expected. The disciple grows through intelligentlyadapting his life to these requirements as far as is reasonably possible and notby adapting the requirements [22] to his life. Flexibility within certain limitsis always needed but that flexibility must not be set in motion by anypersonality inertia or mental questioning.A change in this relationship between disciples is now being made. An attempt isbeing set on foot to see if a group activity and interplay can now be set upupon the physical plane, involving consequently the use of the etheric body andthe brain. The difficulties confronting you are, therefore, great and I amanxious that you should realise this. Will you realise, for instance, that anydifferences of opinion which may occur in the relations of this group ofdisciples will be caused by astral-brain reactions and, therefore, must not beconsidered of any importance whatsoever? They must be immediately eliminated andwiped from the slate of the mind and of the memory and classed as entirelypersonality limitations and unworthy of hindering group integrity.This experiment, being attempted by a group within my Ashram, is one in mentalrelations and in soul contact, with the emphasis and attention placed basicallythere. The astral-physical brain reactions should be regarded as non-existentand as illusion and should be allowed to lapse below the threshold of the groupconsciousness—there to die for lack of attention. This type of group work is anew venture and unless something definitely new emerges as a result of thisexperiment, the time and effort are not warranted. You must not imagine that theparticular line of work on which you may be engaged is the factor of maininterest. It is not primarily the unfoldment of the intuition, or of the powerto heal, or of telepathic efficiency which is of importance. That which countswith the Hierarchy as the Ashrams function is the establishing subjectively ofsuch a potent group interplay and group relation that an emerging world unitycan be seen in embryo . A joint power to be telepathic or a group capacity tointuit truth is of value and somewhat novel. It is the functioning of groups whohave the ability to work as a unity, whose ideals are one, whose personalitiesare merged into one forward swing, whose rhythm is one and whose unity is sofirmly established that naught can produce in the group the purely humancharacteristics of separation, of personal isolation and [23] selfish seeking,that is new. Unselfish people are not rare. Unselfish groups are very rare .Pure detached devotion in a human being is not rare but to find it in a group israre indeed. The submergence of personal interests in the good of the family orin that of another person is often to be found, for the beauty of the humanheart has manifested itself down the ages. To find such an attitude in a groupof people and to see such a point of view maintained with an unbroken rhythm anddemonstrating spontaneously and naturally—this will be the glory of the New Age.To see the link of pure love and of soul relation, realised and utilised ingroup form and work is indeed new and the attainment of this is the ideal whichI set before this group of my disciples. If this group measures up to the visionas it exists in my mind, there will be established upon the physical plane focalpoints of specialised force through which the Hierarchy can work with greatersurety than heretofore. There will (through this and analogous groups) be set inmotion on earth a network of spiritual energies which will facilitate theregeneration of the world. The influence of these groups—when permanentlyestablished and potently working—will have a wider objective than just theelevation of humanity.The potent rhythm which animates the inner Brotherhood of the Lodge of Masterswill make itself felt everywhere on earth and these groups, if successful, maybe regarded as the first step toward the emergence into manifestation of theGreat White Lodge. But remember this: the keynote of the Lodge is not attainmentor degree. It is stable relationship, unity of thought, plus diversity ofmethod, of effort and of function and its quality is friendship in its purestsense. The Brotherhood is a community of souls who are swept by the desire toserve, urged by a spontaneous impulse to love, illumined by one pure Light,devotedly fused and blended into groups of serving Minds, and energised by oneLife. Its Members are organised to further the Plan which They consciouslycontact and with which They deliberately cooperate.It will be apparent to you, therefore, that the purpose of these groups is tounfold in time the three major powers of all illumined minds: [24]First: the power to work in and with all thought substance. The Hierarchy ofIllumined Minds is a group Whose telepathic powers enable Them to be sensitiveto the mind currents and to register the thoughts of Those Who personify theMind of God, the Universal Mind, and to register the thoughtforms of Those Whoare as far beyond the Hierarchy of Masters as They, in Their turn, are beyondthe disciples of the world.Those Lives Who carry out the ideas of the Divine Mind, exist in Their gradedorders, and with the detail of Their groupings we are not concerned, except withthe fact that the planetary Brotherhood is in telepathic rapport with Those Whoare responsible for the planetary conditions in the solar system, with the GreatCouncil, therefore, at Shamballa. They are also in immediate telepathic rapportwith each other. The slowly manifesting powers of the radio and the sensitiveworkings of the perfecting radio mechanisms and of television are but theresponse in physical matter of the perfected telepathic powers and television ofthe minds of the Masters of the Wisdom. Forget not, that such powers areinherent in all men.The inner group of Masters with Whom I am associated work telepathically alsowith Their disciples and the disciples with each other in lesser degree. Thepower to “see” the Master —which has been the misguided impulse of the devoteesof the world who substitute this desire for aspiration towards soul contact—isbut their response to the “television” of Those Who seek to guide them into thelight of their own souls. They are only reacting to one of the demonstrateddivine powers of the Master but not to soul action.Your response to such stimulation as I can give you and an earnest endeavour onyour part to love with unselfishness will gradually perfect in you a similarrelation to other workers. This will work out in three directions:1. In a demonstrated ability to be in telepathic rapport with me and with Thosewith Whom I am associated.2. In power to communicate with each other at any time.3. In sensitivity to the thoughts of humanity as a whole.Can you not see, therefore, how a miniature replica of the Brotherhood can beestablished on earth and how in decades [25] to come the working disciples ofthe world, the isolated initiates in the many world organisations and thepersonnel of the New Group of World Servers will automatically respond to thetelepathic sensitivity of such groups as will be found working in the manyAshrams of the Masters? The result of this success will not be the recognitionof any particular group but it will lead to the recognition of a universal powerand the state of mind of disciples of all degrees. This will establish in timeand without controversy the unity of all beings. The revelation of unity throughthe power of thought is the glorious consummation of the work of the Brotherhoodand to this you do, as do all disciples, respond in your highest moments. Itcan, in a smaller way and according to the measure of your consecration, be yourglory and your goal also if you hold the thought of oneness, of service andabove all else of love .Second: the power of the intuition, which is the goal of much of the work whichdisciples must do, requires the unfoldment of another faculty in man. Theintuition is a function of the mind also and, when rightly used, it enables manto grasp reality with clarity and to see that reality free from glamour and theillusions of the three worlds. When the intuition functions in any human being,he is enabled to take direct and correct action for he is in touch with thePlan, with pure and unadulterated fact and undistorted ideas—free from illusionand coming direct from the divine or universal Mind. The unfoldment of thisfaculty will bring about a world recognition of the Plan and this is thegreatest achievement of the intuition in this present world cycle. When thatPlan is sensed, there comes the realisation of the unity of all beings, of thesynthesis of world evolution and of the unity of the divine objective. All lifeand all forms are seen then in their true perspective; a right sense of valuesand of time then eventuates. When the Plan is truly intuited and at first hand,then constructive effort becomes inevitable and there is no lost motion. It isthe partial realisation of the Plan and its interpretation at second or thirdhand by the ignorant which is responsible for the wasted effort and the foolishimpulses which characterise the present occult and world organisations.[26] The various groups in a Master’s Ashram can fulfil certain functions andprovide laboratories for specified work. Some can provide a demonstrationlaboratory of the trained observers of the world and can handle world glamourand illusion. Other groups can focus on the development of the telepathicfaculty and become trained communicators. The objective before the Hierarchy atthis time is to break and dissipate the world glamour. This has to happen on aworld scale just as it happens in the life of every disciple. Just as a manshifts his focus of consciousness (when on the Path of Discipleship) on to themental plane and learns to smash the glamour which has hitherto held him on theastral plane, so the problem before the Hierarchy today is to bring about asimilar happening in the life of humanity as a whole, for humanity is at thecrossroads and its consciousness is being rapidly focussed on the mental plane.A death blow must be struck at the world illusion for it holds the sons of menin thrall. By learning to break through the glamour in their own lives and tolive in the light of the intuition, disciples can strengthen the hands of ThoseWhose task it is to awaken the intuition in man. There are many and differentkinds of glamour and disciples are frequently surprised when they learn what isregarded as glamour by the Masters. I will enumerate a few of the more generalglamours for you, leaving you to make any needed application and expansion ofthe idea from the individual to humanity as a whole. Here are the names of someof these glamours:1. The glamour of destiny. This is a glamour which indicates to the one whom itcontrols that he has important work to do and that he must speak and work asdestined. This feeds a pride which has no foundation in fact.2. The glamour of aspiration. Those thus conditioned are completely satisfiedand pre-occupied with their aspiration towards the light and rest back upon thefact that they are aspirants. Such people need to move onward on to the Path ofDiscipleship and cease their preoccupation and satisfaction with their spiritualambitions and goals.3. The glamour of self-assurance or of what might be called the astralprinciples of the disciple. This is the belief, [27] in plain language, that thedisciple regards that his point of view is entirely right. This again feedspride and tends to make the disciple believe himself to be an authority andinfallible. It is the background of the theologian.4. The glamour of duty . This leads to an over-emphasis of the sense ofresponsibility, producing lost motion and the emphasis of the non-essential.5. The glamour of environing conditions, leading frequently to a sense offrustration, or of futility or of importance.6. The glamour of the mind and of its efficiency and its capacity to deal withany or every problem. This leads inevitably to isolation and loneliness.7. The glamour of devotion , leading to an undue stimulation of the astral body.The man or woman thus glamoured sees only one idea, one person, one authorityand one aspect of truth. It feeds fanaticism and spiritual pride.8. The glamour of desire with its reflex action upon the physical body. Thisleads to a constant condition of fighting and of turmoil. It negates all peaceand fruitful work and must some day be brought to an end.9. The glamour of personal ambition .There are many other glamours, both individual and world-wide, but these willserve to indicate a general tendency.Those who are in preparation for initiation must learn to work consciously withglamour; they must work effectively with the presented truth, ignoring any painor suffering or mental questioning which is incident to personality rebellionand limitation; they must cultivate that “divine indifference” to personalconsiderations which is the outstanding hallmark of the trained initiate.I shall not deal further with the subject of glamour as it affects or mightaffect this particular group of disciples in my Ashram. The times are urgent andthe need of humanity so great that there is no “space in consciousness” (to usean ancient occult phrase) for the reiteration of the known ideal, or to tell youagain what needs to be done.[28] I would have you realise that there is no haste in the work which a Mastercarries on in connection with His disciples. There is no hurry in the work whichI am proposing that we do together, but neither should there be any waste timeor lost motion. It will become apparent to you that much that I seek toaccomplish is related to thought control and to the activity of the creativeimagination. The Hierarchy produces its effects upon the plane of appearancesthrough the potency of its unified, conscious thinking. The establishing of sucha condition of unified thinking within the New Group of World Servers is part ofmy major effort at this time; we can achieve little until that has been broughtabout.So I summon you to a new phase of intense, inner living and dynamic thinking,but this time with a group objective—the objective of group fusion, group unitedthinking and group relation.... It is the inner life of reflection, thecultivated recognition of the soul and the reflective alignment of soul andpersonality which will determine the success of this work.Third: There is another great mind power which has to be unfolded. It is onewhich characterises all liberated souls, no matter what their ray. This is thepower to heal. This work is as yet in embryo and the group consciousness is asyet so young and unpolarised that it is needless for me to enlarge upon thepossibilities ahead. When men can be trained to be unselfishly and divinelymagnetic and radio-active, then there will be poured out upon the world certaindivine forces which will vivify and reconstruct, which will eliminate the eviland heal the sick. Hitherto the attempts of men in the field of medicine, ofhealing and of the various forms of therapy have been the result of impulses torespond to these hovering forces, but that is all as yet.These are the three major faculties which the spiritual man can unfold; otherfaculties and developing capacities are only expansions of thesethree—telepathic thought, receiving and transmitting; intuitive recognition oftruth and its formulation into concepts by the mind, plus the later process ofmaterialising that which has been intuited, the highest form of creative work;healing, with its understanding of energy and forces which will lead later tothe rebirth of humanity.[29] Little by little, the picture of the possibilities and of the Plan willunfold before you as your minds increase in sensitivity and your brains becomemore responsive to mental impulses. Little by little, the disciples of the worldwill work at the reproduction—on the physical plane—of that which existssubjectively. Little by little, there will appear all over the earth, groups ofillumined souls who can cooperate with the Masters with perfect freedom ofintercourse because their responsiveness has been scientifically trained anddeveloped. Their power to work in tune with or in unison with the Hierarchy, tocooperate with the group life of many other groups of disciples and tocommunicate light and revelation to the world of men will later be anaccomplished fact and is already much more actively present and potent than youthink. A little vision, brother of mine, makes the way of the disciple easierand hence I have enlarged somewhat upon the possibilities which we, with ourprevision, regard as already facts in manifestation. Nothing can stop theeventual success of the Plan; it is simply a question of time.One of the steps in training which lies ahead of you is the establishing of acloser contact with me, your Tibetan Teacher. This you must attempt with noformulated ideas as to what the results will be—if any are to be objectivelyrealised. The results may be sensed by me alone on my side, or they may work outin certain specific realisations and even phenomena on your side. I indicate notthe results of such an activity for the power of suggestion and the response ofthe creative imagination is a fruitful source of glamour.I would, therefore, ask all of you who are my disciples to endeavour to make acontact with me at the time of the Full Moon each month. Make sacrifice in orderto establish this monthly relation as I will make my adjustments to contact you.May I emphasise the necessity for holding the thought of that contact for threewhole days prior to the Full Moon itself, with aspiration and with confidenceand then for three days afterwards with expectancy. May I point out the primeimportance of making this a group activity and not a personal contact. Enterupon the work with the realisation of your group relation with your fellowdisciples and with me, for only in so far as [30] you seek to contact me as adisciple in my group will the measure of your success be rated. This contact isnot of the same nature as that direct and individual contact between a chela andhis Master. Many of you are linked with your own Master, though temporarilyworking in my Ashram; your contact with me is intended to be a group contactand, as a group , you will seek to strengthen the tie between us. This,therefore, is an act of group service to be rendered selflessly and with nopersonal expectancy. Owing to the pressure of time and of urgency in service, Iam one of several teachers who have pledged themselves for the next few years tokeep the twelve hours prior to the Full Moon of each month open for contactswith their disciples, so that at any time during that twelve hours, the worldservers and disciples can make an attempt to reach us. This will somewhatfacilitate your work for you need not, therefore, keep the exact hour of theFull Moon, unless this is easily possible. Service in the world these daysrequires constant pressure and attention and the work is strenuous. It may notalways be possible for you to make your approach at the exact hour of the FullMoon, though you can at that hour always—silently and interiorly—lift up yourheart and eyes to the Eternal. But at some hour during the preceding twelvehours, you can make your approach. When you do so rightly, you will find mewaiting. Go to your work with clear vision, a loving heart and an understandinglove. Much can then be accomplished.PART IVAs these groups of disciples become active in the world and their innerintegration and group relationship become securely established, we shall havethe germ of those characteristics which will dignify the New Age groups. I wouldask you all never to forget that this group work you are attempting to do is inreality pioneer work and hence has all the difficulties which pioneer workinevitably and necessarily has. Thereby strength to grow is gained. As thenumber of these groups increases and the personnel is gradually supplied, theskeleton framework of a future structure will slowly emerge. How that structure[31] will appear when completed is known only to the inspired vision of thearchitects. But the foundations must be set sure and deep; the framework must betrue and rightly adjusted. These two requirements are all that any of you willsee materialise in this present life time.Have you realised, however, my brothers, what occult progress in the world youhave been permitted to see during this present life time? Have you glimpsed themagnitude of the present push that is being made by the Masters and have yourecognised Their plans taking shape before your eyes? Have you grasped theessentials of what the Great White Lodge has done during the past twenty-fiveyears and the extent of the work in which disciples and aspirants everywherehave been permitted to share? I would like briefly to enlarge somewhat upon thisso as to make the picture clearer to your eyes in order that you may cooperatewith greater intelligence, for this is above everything else group work.Slowly and gradually, as far as you are all concerned, I have gathered togethera band of disciples upon the outer plane. As the group thoughtform integratedand disciples responded to my call, found each other and began to work together,it became possible for me to go forward with my chosen work and carry forwardthe plans which I set myself when I took a certain initiation.First of all, the books were published and they came out in ordered sequence andprovide a body of teaching and of truth which will serve the needs of the cominggeneration. It is for my disciples to safeguard this presentation of truthduring this century and to see to it that the books are sent forth steadily upontheir mission, until they are finally superseded next century by a newer andmore adequate teaching.Next came a happening of vital moment—of more moment than you can perhapsappreciate. An instruction upon the New Group of World Servers was sent out andgiven wide distribution by means of the pamphlet entitled The Next Three Years.This signalised the anchoring—if so I might call it—of the New Group of WorldServers upon the physical plane. They are now in active existence. The group isslowly integrating and slowly making its influence felt in the primary [32] workof educating public opinion—the only potent means of work and of far morepotency and ultimate value than any legislation or emphasis upon authority.Growing out of the integration of this new group, there is being formed in theworld that “bridge of souls and servers” which will make possible the merging ofthe inner subjective Hierarchy of souls and the outer world of humanity. Thiswill constitute an actual fusion or blending and will mark the initiation of thehuman family through the achievement of its foremost pioneering members. This isthe true “marriage in the Heavens” of which mystical Christianity speaks and theresult of this fusion will be the manifestation of the fifth kingdom in nature,the kingdom of God. In the past history of the race, a great event occurredwhich brought into manifestation the fourth kingdom in nature, the humankingdom. We stand now on the verge of a similar but still more momentousevent—the appearance of the fifth kingdom, as a result of the planned activityof the New Group of World Servers, working in collaboration with the Hierarchyof perfected souls, and under the guidance of the Christ Himself. This willusher in the New Age wherein five kingdoms in nature will be recognised asexisting side by side upon earth.You have, therefore, been permitted to share in and watch the work of theHierarchy to the extent of your individual spiritual contact and have seen thefollowing spiritual events taking place:1. The sending forth of the teaching for the New Age. This deals with the newpsychology and with the control of the personality and with the Mysteries of theKingdom of God.2. The founding in embryo of those schools of esotericism which will embody theteaching for the new discipleship and make it practical in application. Thereare several of these schools and the Arcane School is one of the first. Theyprepare the way for the greater foundations, outlined in my book, Letters onOccult Meditation.3. The recognition on a fairly large scale of the New Group of World Servers andtheir work. [33]4. The emergence—as yet only in symbolic indication—of the fifth or spiritualkingdom.5. The forming of the skeleton structure of the new groups of disciples, theexternalisation in embryo of the inner Ashrams. These in the New Age willmultiply and so carry forward the work of integrating the inner and the outergroups and fostering the growth of the Kingdom of God on earth. This will bringto public attention the fact of the restoration of the Mysteries of Initiation.The production of the outer form on earth, through the medium of books, ofesoteric schools and the educating of public opinion has been committed to agroup of us who form a part of the inner world government—disciples andinitiates—and to this group, I play the part of secretary and of organisingcontact man—if I may use words which will mean something to your ears, versed asyou are in physical plane organisation work; they mean little or nothing to us,versed as we are in the work of producing living organisms. This group to whichI refer is composed of two oriental initiates (of whom I am one) and of fiveoccidental initiates.We will leave now the consideration of this general picture and return to thesubject of the specific work that this particular group of my disciples can do.You must avoid the idea that you are working in a unique way and alone. This isnot so. There are many today working intelligently with our plans, oftenisolated and alone. The main requirement in the group work which I seek at thistime to emphasise is the most difficult one of a true impersonality . On twopoints, disciples in the past have ever been emphatic. They have seen and feltthe need for reticence, where there is any inner spiritual experience, and havefelt that the relating or the discussion of the spiritual and the higher psychicevents in their lives produced a sense of loss and was against the occult law.They have equally demanded reticence about their personality lives, about theirmistakes and failings, and have demanded it more loudly than the permission tobe silent about their soul life. Their demand has been based on a truerecognition that the discussion of a spiritual happening with those who do notunderstand [34] has in it a great deal of danger—the danger ofmisinterpretation, of glamour and of illusion. The desire for reticence in thepersonality life is based usually on pride, on a fear of criticism, on terror ofbeing derided, misunderstood and judged; these are all unworthy motives.Among the disciples of the New Age groups and ever in a Master’s inner Ashram,there is no need for this theory of reticence. You are co-disciples andco-workers. If any of you have in the past or may in the future becomeinitiates, it will not affect your relation to your fellow-disciples in thesegroups. The knowledges of initiation cannot be passed on by word of mouth withinthe initiate ranks, for they are not communicated in speech or by letters. Onlythose who possess certain transcendental senses can take initiation and shouldthey try to communicate the secrets and mysteries of initiation in symbol orform, you would fail to react to or to understand their meaning.So, in this group of my disciples, let there be the recognition of unity ofthought. Experience, thought, difficulties and problems can be shared, and thecultivation of a sympathetic understanding and of mutual aid in the spirituallife can be developed. Disciples are people of mature years from the standpointof the soul, and, therefore, the pettinesses of life and small frictionaldifficulties will not be shared by you with each other. There should be notemptation to waste each other’s time in idle talk. It is the broad and generaloutline of the plan for the outer work of these groups of disciples which shouldengage your thoughts and communications with each other.The groups planned will be of many different kinds and their work will bediversified and varied. I have for some time desired to write a little morefully about the groups which are forming in the world today, under direction ofthe Masters. They will gradually make their appearance in the world and fulfiltheir destined mission. Four of these groups are already formed or in process offorming and the others will gradually be created to meet advancing need.It is essential that members of these groups have a wider vision than they nowhave; their membership in any of the [35] groups constitutes an act of servicewhich they are rendering to the work which I and other members of the Hierarchyare carrying forward under the Plan . The individual disciple must not look uponhis work as a marvellous opportunity for his own spiritual advancement. All truedisciples are equally distinguished by a determination to make the groupssuccessful and all are longing to get as much out of the group work as possible.All are genuinely animated by a desire to serve but also by a generalsatisfaction over the interest and opportunity offered by the group work. Alongwith these most normal and right reactions are to be found much ignorance as tothe true significance of the work, a good deal of selfish pleasure and someambition. This is natural, for no perfection is yet to be expected amongdisciples. If perfection existed, you would all be found working in a differentrelation to the Great White Lodge.In order to clarify this group work which the Hierarchy plans and enable you tograsp the intent clearly, I will tell you something of the purpose which liesbehind the groups and of the general plan into which it is desired that theyfit. In the early stages of any hierarchical experiment, much difficulty isencountered, owing to the material with which the initiating agents (such asmyself) have to work. Any new idea, especially if it embodies a purpose whichcan only materialise later when the Plan is further perfected, fails naturallyto meet with full comprehension in the early stages.I have said that these groups constitute an experiment. This experiment isfourfold in nature and a concise statement about it may prove helpful.I. They are an experiment in founding or starting focal points of energy in thehuman family through which certain energies can flow into the entire race ofmen.II. They are an experiment in inaugurating certain new techniques in work and inmodes of communication . I would point out that in these last three words aresummed up the whole story. These groups are intended to facilitate interrelationor communication as follows:1. There is a group of what we might call Telepathic Communicators. These peopleare receptive to impression from the Masters and from each other; they are the[36] custodians of group purpose and, therefore, closely related to all theother types of groups. Their work is largely on the mental plane and they workin and with thought matter and with the reception and direction of thoughtcurrents. They are also working at the facilitation of communication betweenindividuals so that the rules and methods whereby speech can be transcended maybecome known and the new way of intercourse be brought about. Communication willeventually be:a. Soul to soul on the higher levels of the mental plane. This involves completealignment, so that soul-mind-brain are completely at-one.b. Mind to mind on the lower levels of the mental plane. This involves thecomplete integration of the personality or lower self, so that mind and brainare at-one.Disciples must remember these two distinctive contacts and bear in mind alsothat the greater contact need not necessarily include the lesser. Telepathiccommunication between the different aspects of the human being is entirelypossible at varying stages of unfoldment.2. Another group is that of the Trained Observers. Their objective is to seeclearly through all events, through space and time by means of the cultivationand use of the intuition. They work very largely on the astral plane at thedissipation of glamour, thus bringing in illumination to mankind. Thus anothertype of energy is brought into play, producing another type of inter-relationand communication. This communication is between the plane which is the plane ofillumination and pure reason (the buddhic plane) and the plane of illusion andglamour, which is the astral plane. The Trained Observers are asked to rememberthat their great task is to dispel the world illusion through the pouring in oflight. When there are a sufficient number of groups, working along these lines,there will be found—upon the physical plane—certain channels of communicationwhich will act as the mediators between the world of light and the world [37] ofillusion. They will be transmitters of that form of energy which will break upthe existing glamours and illusions, and so dissipate the ancient deceptivethoughtforms. They will release the light and peace which will illumine theastral plane and dispel the illusory nature of its life.3. The third group is that of the Magnetic Healers . These healers have norelation to the work of the so-called magnetic healers of today. They workintelligently with the vital forces of the etheric body. Much of their work isdealt with in the fourth volume of A Treatise on the Seven Rays . This group ofhealers must bring about the right healing of the personalities of individualsin all aspects of their nature. The work to be done is that of the intelligenttransmission of energy to various parts of the nature—mental, emotional andphysical—through the right organisation and circulation of force. Present dayhealers should endeavour to break loose from the modern and traditional ideas asto healing; they should recognise the stupendous fact that healing musteventually be carried forward by groups which will act as the intermediariesbetween the plane of spiritual energy (either soul energy, intuitional energy orwill energy) and the patient or group of patients. Note this last point. Thegroup idea must always be remembered by the students as they work; they must notwork as individuals but as units in a coherent whole. This will distinguish theNew Age methods from the past, for the work will be group work and, usually, fora group. Magnetic healers must learn to work as souls and not as individuals.They must learn to communicate healing energy from the reservoir of living forceto the patient or patients.4. The Educators of the New Age will come next. Their service is along the lineof culture and they will work to bring in the new type of education. Theiremphasis will be upon the building of the antahkarana and upon the use of themind in meditation. Again—much of this new educational science will be given inthe fifth volume of the series. They will act as communicators and [38]transmitters of two aspects of divine energy—knowledge and wisdom. These must bethought of in terms of energy. This fourth group (whose work is concerned withthe education of the masses) is a direct intermediary between the higher mindand the lower mind. They are concerned with the building of the antahkarana andtheir task is that of linking the three points of mental focus—the higher mind,the soul and the lower mind—so that there may be established a group antahkaranabetween the kingdom of souls and the world of men.5. The fifth group will be that of the Political Organisers and will concernitself with political factors in every nation. They will work in the world ofhuman government, dealing with the problems of civilisation and with therelationships existing between nations. The bringing about of internationalunderstanding will be their major objective. This group communicates the“quality of imposition,” and an authority that is lacking in the other branchesof this divine group activity. This work is largely first ray work. It willembody the method whereby the divine Will works out in the consciousness ofraces and nations. Members of this group will have much first ray energy intheir equipment. Their work is to act as channels of communication between thedepartment of the Manu and the race of men. It is a noble task, my brothers, tobe channels for the will of God.6. The workers in the Field of Religion form this group. Their work is toformulate the universal platform of the new world religion. It is a work ofloving synthesis and it will emphasize the unity and the fellowship of thespirit. This group is, in a pronounced sense, a channel for the activity of thesecond Ray of Love-Wisdom, that of the World Teacher—an office held at presentby the Christ. The platform of the new world religion will be built by the manygroups, working under the inspiration of the Christ and the influence of thesecond ray and these—in their totality—will constitute this sixth group. [39]7. The seventh group is that of the Scientific Servers . They will reveal theessential spirituality of all scientific work which is motivated by love ofhumanity and its welfare, which relates science and religion and brings to lightthe glory of God through the medium of His tangible world and His works. Theyhave a most interesting function but one which will not become evident for along time—not until the building forces of the universe are better understood.This will be co-incident with the development of etheric vision. This group willact as a channel of communication or intermediary between the energies whichconstitute the forces which construct the forms and fabricate the outer garmentof Deity and the human spirits. You will note here, consequently, thepossibility that this group’s main initial work will be concerned with theproblem of reincarnation. That problem deals with the taking of an outer garmentor form under the Law of Rebirth.8. The Psychologists will form this next group and they will be concerned withthe revelation of the fact of the soul and with the new psychology which will bebased upon the seven ray types and the new esoteric astrology. Their major taskwill be to relate, through approved techniques, the soul and the personality,leading to the revelation of divinity through the medium of humanity. They willact also as transmitters of illumination between groups of thinkers and asilluminators of group thought. They transmit energy from one thought centre toanother and, above everything else, they transmit the energy of ideas. The worldof ideas is a world of dynamic force centres. Let this not be forgotten. Theseideas have to be contacted and noted and their energy has to be assimilated andtransmitted.9. This ninth group will be composed of Financiers and Economists. They willwork with the energies and forces which express themselves through theinterchange and the values of commerce; they will deal with the Law of Supplyand Demand and with the great principle of Sharing which ever governs divinepurpose. They will [40] be the great psychometrical workers, for a psychometristis one whose soul is sensitive to the soul in others and in all forms of life.The principle of Sharing which must govern economic relations in the future is asoul quality or energy and hence their work of relating soul with soul. Theyalso evoke the soul of the past, linking it with the present and finding itlikewise indicative of the future.10. This is the group of Creative Workers . They are communicators between thethird aspect of Divinity, the Creative Aspect—as it expresses itself through thecreative work and in response to the thought world—and the first aspect, Life.They link and blend life and form creatively. They are closely related to theninth group because today, unknowingly and without any true understanding, theyare bringing about a concretisation of the energy of desire; this in its turnbrings about the creation of things. Incidentally, therefore, they are concernedwith the concretisation of money. Their work is also largely philosophical andconcerned with the task of relating—factually and scientifically—the other ninetypes of groups so that they may work creatively upon the physical plane and thedivine Plan may clearly appear as a result of this synthesis which they bringabout.III. These groups are also an externalisation of an inner existing condition .They are an effect and not a cause. That they themselves may have an initiatoryeffect (as they work out into manifestation upon the physical plane) is no doubttrue; but they are themselves the product of an inner activity and of asubjective aggregation of forces which must perforce become objective. The workof the disciples who find their place in these various groups is to keep inclose rapport with ten inner groups which form, nevertheless, one large activegroup. This group force will then pour through all the various groups just in sofar as the disciples in the groups do the following things as a group:1. Keep en rapport with the inner source of power.2. Never lose sight of the group objective. [41]3. Cultivate the dual capacity to apply the laws of the soul to the individuallife and the laws of the group to group life.4. Use all the forces which may flow into the group in service; they must learn,therefore, to register those forces and use them correctly. The hints givenbelow as to the centres which these ten groups will use must be studied. Theright use of these centres will take place only when there is a greater groupunity established among the members of the individual groups and among thegroups as a whole. You ask why is this so, my brothers? Because the forceflowing in might prove too strong for the individual disciple to handle alone,but the force is shared by the group if there is complete group at-one-ment. Inthis way, each disciple can serve the group and his objective eventuallybecomes:a. At-one-ment with his group brothers.b. Alignment with his soul and with the inner group which is the subjectivecause of the outer groups.c. The expression of the particular technique which his group should eventuallyembody.The groups will use the following centres in their work:Group 1.—The head, heart and throat centres.Group 2.—The head, heart and solar plexus centres.Group 3.—The head, heart and ajna centres.Group 4.—The head, ajna and throat centres.Group 5.—The head and heart centres and the centre at the base of the spine.Group 6.—The head, heart and solar plexus centres. This is necessarily the sameas in Group 2.Group 7.—The head, throat and sacral centres.Group 8.—The head, heart, solar plexus and throat centres. This group ofdisciples will be the first to use four centres in their work as they are in acurious sense, the mediators of thought between the other groups. They arepeculiarly a linking group. [42]Group 9.—The head, heart, throat and sacral centres.Group 10.—The head, heart, sacral centres and the centre at the base of thespine.I wonder, my brothers, if the following sequence of statements will conveyanything to your minds? It is a statement of fact and is not the least symbolicin its terminology—except in so far as all words are inadequate symbols of innertruths.1. Each group has its inner counterpart.2. This inner counterpart is a completed whole. The outer results are still onlypartial.3. These ten inner groups, forming one group, are related to the Ashrams of theMasters and are each of them expressive of or governed by ten laws, embodyingthe controlling factors in group work. A law is an expression or manifestationof force applied, under the power of thought, by a thinker or group of thinkers.4. These ten inner groups, embodying ten types of force and workingsynthetically to express ten laws, are an effort to bring in new and differentconditions, and hence produce a new and better civilisation. The Aquarian Agewill see consummation.5. The outer groups are a tentative and experimental effort to see how farhumanity is ready for such an endeavour.IV. These groups are also an experiment which has for its objective themanifestation of certain types of energy which will, when effectivelyfunctioning, produce cohesion or at-one-ment upon earth. The present distraughtcondition in the world, the international cataclysm and apparent impasse, thereligious dissatisfaction, the economic and social upheaval and the appallingeffects of war are all the results of energies that are so potent—owing to theirimmense momentum—that they can only be brought into rhythmic activity by theimposition of stronger and more definitely directed energies.The groups are intended to work together eventually just as the variousdepartments of a great organisation work effectively together as a unit. Theymust function smoothly and intelligently within themselves and also in theirinter-relation with [43] each other. This will become possible when theindividual members in the groups and the individual groups of disciples losesight of their own identities in an effort to make this hierarchical workpossible. In this type of group work, the feelings, reactions, wishes andsuccesses of the individual most emphatically do not count. Only that isregarded as of importance which will further group effort and enrich the groupconsciousness.PART VThe Hierarchy sanctioned the starting of these groups in the year 1931. Themembers of these groups have been slowly chosen since then and are endeavouring,since their inclusion in this ashramic work, to work together in complete unityof purpose and of relationship. It may be of interest to you to know a little ofhow we approached the subject.As you all know, I am a second ray disciple, an initiate of a certainstanding—the grade of which in no way concerns you, though many of you havepersonally and interiorly ascertained who I am. If the teaching which I havegiven you and the books which I have given to the world do not suffice to winyour confidence and your attention, then knowing that I am an initiate of thethird degree, or a Master, or a Boddhisattva or one of the Buddhas close to theThrone of God will in no way aid your comprehension and will only hinder yourdevelopment. For many lives I have been close to the Master K.H.; in discussionwith Him, we have often wondered how we should aid in the inauguration uponearth of those newer types of work which will be distinctive of the New Age andyet would be close enough to the comprehension of the advanced aspirants and theworld disciples so that their cooperation would be evoked and their intelligenthelp forthcoming. What were the requirements for which we should look and whatshould be the technique to be applied in the New Age for the raising of theconsciousness of men? We decided that four things must, first of all,distinguish the group work which should be done and should characterise thedisciples to be chosen for training. These were: Sensitivity, Impersonality,Psychic Gifts, Mental Polarisation. I do not make mention of aspiration, ofselflessness [44] or of the desire to serve. They are fundamentals and basicessentials and, where they do not exist, there is no use in proffering the typeof assistance which we are seeking to give.You will note that, as you look back over the spiritual history of the race ofmen during the past two thousand years (which is far enough for our purpose),that the following methods have been consecutively used to reach men’s mindsspiritually:1. The method of raising the consciousness of an individual so that he became aKnower. Individual salvation and the emergence of outstanding individuals withspiritual sense, vision and achievement to their credit has characterised themystical history of the past. Some of these people emerged along the way of theheart, the mystical way; such were Shri Krishna, St. Francis of Assisi, and allthose Knowers whose way was the Way of Love. To these can be added Milarepa ofTibet and Lao Tze of China. Such also have been many of the saints of the churchin the West. The Bhagavad Gita has been the book which has embodied this waysuperlatively.Others emerged along the way of the mind and were the intellectual Knowers.Theirs is the more strictly occult way and it has become increasingly the way ofour present day aspirants. The reason for this is that the polarisation of therace is shifting ever more steadily on to the mental plane. Some of theindividuals on this way of the mind were Sankaracharya, the Apostle Paul, andMeister Eckhart. Today, many are coming out along this way under the name ofscience. There were also those outstanding individuals , such as the Christ andthe Buddha, Who combined both ways in their perfection and Who towered aboveTheir fellowmen from the heights of Their achievement. They swayed hemispheresand centuries, whereas the lesser sons of God swayed countries, specific typesof mind and lesser periods of time.2. The second method employed for raising the consciousness of the race wasthrough groups, gathered around a [45] teacher who (to a greater or less degree)was a focal point of energy eithera. By the power of his soul contact orb. By that contact and being also a channel through which some member of theHierarchy could work.Through the example of these teachers, through their teaching, through theirsuccesses and their failures, those whom they gathered to them could be taught,their vibration could be increased, their consciousness expanded and the groupcould become a magnetised centre of force, of purpose and of spiritual light—thedegree of this being dependent upon the purity of the note sounded and theselflessness of the lives shown. The mental calibre of the group also had itseffect, for the average vibration and polarisation established the note for thegroup as a whole.An experiment is now being made to shift the focus of the groups inwards andyet, at the same time, to increase their potency by permitting no individualleader to be found at the group centre upon the outer plane. All in the groupare to be gathered together as free souls. Together, they will learn; together,they will stand with impersonality; together, they will render service to theworld. You must remember, however, that any person who takes the position thatthe work to be done is only upon the inner planes and that he is working solelyfrom mental or spiritual levels of consciousness is not right in his conceptionof the process. Inner work which does not work out into objective activity uponthe physical plane is wrongly oriented and inspired.These new types of groups will work together under the conscious guidance andsuggestion of a member of the Great White Lodge. Note the word “suggestion,” mybrothers. If these groups were subjected to the authority of such a member, thenthe objective of all the work undertaken would fail to materialize. An occultlaw would have been broken. Free, intelligent assistance is what we are askingfrom all our disciples today, and we leave them free to render it or not as theylike and in the manner which may seem best to them. I am your teacher. I makesuggestion. I offer instruction. I indicate [46] the way to the goal and to thefield of service. I point out to you what we, the Teachers upon the inner side,seek to see accomplished. Temporarily and of your own free will, you haveindicated your willingness to serve and to cooperate in my plans. Beyond thusindicating the way and the service, I will not go. It is for all of you, mydisciples, to work out in joint collaboration and in the closest understandingthe way that my suggestions and my hints should be utilised. I do not interfere.First of all, I call for a deeper love and comprehension between the members ofthe group. This is necessary in order that the internal structure of the groupmay be more firmly and closely integrated.Next, you must learn to work on the levels of meditation with greater clarityand power. So much of your meditation work is selfish. Do you realise that? Isnot your attitude very often to be expressed in the following terms: When I ammeditating, what will the Tibetan give me at this time? Will he give mesomething which will make me a better disciple? Will the meditation which he maygive me interest me more than the one I am now doing? Will a change inmeditation bring me better results (probably of a phenomenal kind!) or a newrevelation or fresh enlightenment and enable me to achieve my goal? Few of youin this particular group in my Ashram as yet really work in meditation uponthose levels where creative work is done. May I point out that until you canbegin to do this, the work which I seek to do through all of you is largely at astandstill. The object of any meditation which I may assign to you is to enableyou to have power in meditation so that you will no longer be pre-occupied withyourselves and your own problems but you will become unified with your group forgroup work and eventually for still wider group purposes—my purposes, as yourteacher and a world worker and server.With what kind of instrument, therefore, can I now work? Every true teacher askshimself this question as he studies the grouping of souls with which he hasassociated himself and which he seeks to serve and aid. As integration of thegroup takes place, the pre-dispositions and the basic tendencies of the massedgroup qualities emerge and can be studied; weaknesses can then be offset andright indications fostered....[47] I have earlier pointed out to you that the basic qualities for which welook are sensitivity, impersonality, psychic capacity and mental polarisation.Upon these I would like very briefly to enlarge and then I will lay before you(for your understanding interest and possible collaboration) the plans forfuture group activity. These plans can materialise if you can make the necessaryadjustments and submit yourselves to the discipline and the training which willmake greatly increased usefulness possible.I have stated that the first requirement is sensitivity . What exactly is this?It does not mean primarily that you are a “sensitive soul”—the connotation ofwhich usually means that you are thin-skinned, self-centred and always on thedefensive! Rather do I refer to the capacity whereby you are enabled to expandyour consciousness so that you become aware of ever-widening ranges of contact.I refer to the ability to be alive, alert, keen to recognise relationships,quick to react to need, mentally, emotionally and physically attentive to lifeand rapidly developing the power to observe upon all three planes in the threeworlds simultaneously. I am not interested in your personal relations where theyconcern your wrong personality sensitivity to depression, to self-pity, yourdefenses, your so-called sensitivity to slights, to misunderstandings, yourdislike of your environing conditions, your hurt pride and qualities of thiskind. These all cause you bewilderment and let loose in you the floodgates ofcompassion for yourself. But you do not need me to deal with them; of them youare well aware and can handle them if you choose . These faults are interestingonly in so far as they affect the life of your group; they must be handled byyou with care and with the open eye that senses danger from afar and seeks toavoid it. The sensitivity which I want to see developed is alertness to soulcontact, impressionability to the “voice of the Teacher,” an aliveness to theimpact of new ideas and to the delicacy of intuitional responsiveness. These areever the hallmark of the true disciple. It is spiritual sensitivity which mustbe cultivated; this is only truly possible when you learn to work through thecentres above the diaphragm and to transmute solar plexus activity (which is so[48] dominant in the average person), turning it into heart activity and theservice of your fellow men.Impersonality , particularly for high grade integrated people, is peculiarlydifficult to achieve. There is a close relation between impersonality anddetachment. Study this. Many cherished ideas, many hard won qualities, manycarefully nurtured righteousnesses and many powerfully formulated beliefsmilitate against impersonality. It is hard for the disciple—during the processof his early training—to hold earnestly to his own ideals and to pursueforcefully his own spiritual integration, and yet remain impersonally orientedtowards other people. He seeks recognition of his struggle and achievement; helongs to have the light which he has kindled draw forth a reaction from others;he wants to be known as a disciple; he aches to show his power and his highlydeveloped love nature so that he may evoke admiration or, at least, challenge.But nothing happens. He is looked upon as no better than all the rest of hisbrothers. Life, therefore, proves dissatisfying.These truths of self-analysis are seldom definitely faced or formulated by anyof you and, therefore (because I seek to help you) I formulate them for you andface you with them. It is hard for intelligent men and women to see othersclosely associated with them dealing with life and problems from a totallydifferent angle to their own—handling them in a weak or stupid way (from theangle of the disciple) and making apparently serious errors in judgment ortechnique. Yet, brother of old, why are you so sure that you are right and thatyour point of view is necessarily correct? It may be that your slant on life andyour interpretation of a situation needs readjustment and that your motives andattitudes could be more elevated or purer. And even if they are—for you—thehighest and the best that you can achieve at any given time, then pursue yourway and leave your brother to pursue his. “Better a man’s own dharma, than thedharma of another.” Thus does the Bhagavad Gita express this truth, telling thedisciple to mind his own business.This attitude of non-interference and the refusal to criticise, in no wayprevents service to each other or constructive group relations. It does notnegate the expression of love or happy [49] group cooperation. There is evermuch opportunity for the practice of impersonality in all group relations. Inevery group there is usually one group member (and perhaps several) whoconstitute a problem to themselves and to their group brothers. Perhaps youyourself are such an one and know it not. Perhaps you know who, among yourco-servers, provides a testing for his fellows. Perhaps you can see clearly whatis the group weakness and who it is that is keeping the group back from fineractivity. That is well and good, provided that you continue to love and serveand to refrain from criticism. It is a wrong attitude to seek assiduously tostraighten out your brother, to chide him or seek to impose your will on him oryour point of view, though it is always legitimate to express ideas and makesuggestion. Groups of disciples are groups of free and independent souls whosubmerge their personal interests in service and who seek that inner linkingwhich will fuse the group into an instrument for the service of humanity and ofthe Hierarchy. Continue with your own soul discipline and leave your brothers tocontinue theirs.The question of psychic powers is not so easy to explain. I do not refer to thelower psychic powers which may or may not develop as time goes on and the needfor them arises. I refer to the following capacities, inherent in the soul,which must be developed in all of you if you are to do your share in meetingworld need, and work for the Hierarchy in the field of world service. Let usbriefly enumerate them:1. Intuitional response to ideas.2. Sensitiveness to the impression which some member of the Hierarchy may seekto make upon the mind of the disciple. It is for this reason that I am trainingyou to utilise the Full Moon contact.3. Quick response to real need. You had not regarded this as one of the psychicpowers, my brother, had you? I refer not here to a solar plexus reaction but toheart knowledge. Ponder on this distinction.4. Right observation of reality upon the soul plane. This leads to right mentalperception, to freedom from illusion and glamour and to the illumination of thebrain. [50]5. Correct manipulation of force, involving, therefore, an understanding of thetypes and qualities of force and their right creative weaving into service uponthe outer plane.6. A true comprehension of the time element, with its cyclic ebb and flow andthe right seasons for action—a most difficult psychic power to master, mybrothers, but one which can be mastered through the use of patient waiting andthe elimination of hurry.All these powers, the disciple must eventually develop, but the process isnecessarily slow.Next comes the quality of mental polarisation . What exactly is this power orquality? For you (at this time) it must express itself in two ways:1. Through the life of meditation.2. Through the control of the astral body.Increasingly must your inner life be lived upon the mental plane. Steadily andwithout descent must the attitude of meditation be held—not for a few minuteseach morning or at specific moments throughout the day, but constantly, all daylong. It infers a constant orientation to life and the handling of life from theangle of the soul. This does not refer to what is so often referred to as“turning one’s back upon the world.” The disciple faces the world but he facesit from the level of the soul, looking clear-eyed upon the world of humanaffairs. “In the world, yet not of the world” is the right attitude—expressedfor us by the Christ. Increasingly must the normal and powerful life of theemotional, astral, desire and glamorous nature be controlled and renderedquiescent by the life of the soul, functioning through the mind. The emotionswhich are normally self-centred and personal must be transmuted into therealisations of universality and impersonality; the astral body must become theorgan through which the love of the soul can pour; desire must give place toaspiration and that, in its turn, must be merged in the group life and the groupgood; glamour must give place to reality, and the pure light of the mind mustpour into all the dark places of the lower nature. [51] These are the results ofmental polarisation and are brought about by definite meditation and thecultivation of the meditative attitude. This is not new information for you, butit is something which as yet remains unexpressed practically . If you will askyourselves the following questions and courageously and truthfully make replybefore the bar of your own soul, you will learn much and greatly aid yourdevelopment:1. What do you understand by spiritual sensitivity?a. Have you ever truthfully felt my vibration?b. Do you respond more rapidly to the quality of a brother’s faults than to hisdivine characteristics?c. In what way does criticism interfere with true spiritual sensitivity?d. What do you feel personally hinders your development of this requiredsensitivity?2. Define impersonality.a. Do you know the distinction between the impersonality of the first ray typeand true spiritual impersonality?b. When somebody disagrees with you or you do not like a person’s attitude,ideas or proposals, what is the first thing you do? Do you love him? Do you keepsilent? Do you discuss him with others? Do you endeavour to put him right? Howdo you try to do this?c. If you are impersonal is it the result of training or is it natural to you?Is it simple self-defense? or is it the easiest way to attain peace? or is it aspiritual attainment?3. I have defined for you the psychic powers. I listed six of them. Please studythem and then make a clear, concise statement to yourself as to your owncapacity:a. To demonstrate them.b. To develop them, outlining your method of so doing.4. Just how do you feel that you succeed in keeping a mental grip on life? [52]a. In an emotional stress do you transmute the condition through love?b. Do you inhibit the display of emotion and why?c. Do you call in the mind and handle your problems from the mental level?d. Do you know what glamour is and can you recognise it when it displays itselfto you?These questions have a twofold purpose. They will, if you answer them truthfullyand face them clearly, lead you to deal with yourself as a group member and soascertain the measure of your contribution to the group need and to our need ofworkers. If you will write down and answer these questions and share the replieswith your co-disciples, it will give them an opportunity to know each otherbetter.There is an occult process which reaches its culmination in one of the higherinitiations—with which initiation you have as yet no concern. It is called “abringing forth into the light.” An accepted disciple is one who is in process ofpreparation for initiation and that is one of the tasks with which I am engagedat this time. I have, therefore, to begin to lay the foundation for thisesoteric “unearthing” or “revelation of that which is hidden.” I am consequentlyproffering to you, through these questions, the opportunity to practise early inyour training this “distressing revelation” which will later take place in ahigher state of consciousness.What is it that I and Those Who are working on the inner side are seeking to dowith these groups? What is the larger objective? The groups have not been formedto train individuals. They have been formed (each of them) as seed groups for adefinite and specific end. They are organised to provide channels in the worldfor the distribution of certain peculiar types of force which will work out intomanifestation in specific ways. Energy has always been manipulated by theHierarchy and distributed in the world of men. I refer to the energies used inrelation to the awakening of the human consciousness, to the integration of theworld of souls with the world of men; I refer to the activities whereby thehuman kingdom can become a great station of light and a powerhouse [53] ofspiritual force, distributing it to the other kingdoms in nature.The statement is of vital importance; it expresses our immediate objectives andthe nature of the field of service in which you—as a group and not asindividuals—can function. This manipulation of energies has (for centuries) beencarried forward by us but its effects have only been registered unconsciously byman. We have (speaking symbolically) rayed forth the light and distributed thewater of life in a wide and general distribution with here and there (andrarely) some one isolated individual, responding actively and consciously. Hethus became a tiny focal point of spiritual energy and light. Now it has seemedto us possible to focus the light and knowledge much more definitely and to formgroups on earth—composed of the isolated, responding individuals—so that morelight and more knowledge can be spread abroad. This we decided to do in twoways:1. Through the collaboration of all the Masters of the Great White Lodge,working through Their Own disciples.2. Through the specifically focussed activity of the Masters Morya and KootHoomi and myself, Their servant and disciple.Through the first method, the New Group of World Servers came into being and thedisciples and aspirants of the world, working on all the rays and under theguidance—consciously or unconsciously recognised—of the Masters Who arespecifically pledged to help humanity. Thus a vast powerhouse and station oflight has been formed. It is a diffused and widespread light and its channelsare to be found all over the world, in every country and in every major city.This you know and with this branch of the work (to which I am personallypledged) you are actively cooperating and should cooperate.But it was felt that it should also be possible to focus the light still moreintensively through smaller and more carefully chosen and selected groups.Through these much smaller groups of disciples, the phenomenal appearance ofcertain types of energy could be expressed; certain powers could be unfolded anda more specialised experiment be possible. Peculiar powers [54] could be studiedand focussed, intensified light and power could be so clearly demonstrated thatthe sons of men would come to recognise the influence and to give proof of thesupernormal which is the heritage of future centuries.To this particular branch of hierarchical work, I pledged myself; it wouldprovide the nucleus for the coming types of civilisation and the characteristicsand activities which could be unfolded under the incoming new major influences.These have always interested me and I have specialised in them. Naturally, Ilooked around among those whose lives I have been watching—sometimes for severalincarnations. Among these were those of you who are now working with me. Thesegroups constitute the germ of a great experiment. If successful, they will, inthe course of the next 275 years:1. Anchor on earth certain types of the higher forces which the race needs andwhich are not yet active.2. Develop the six supernormal powers to which I have referred above.3. Train the group members in that synthetic relation which characterises theHierarchy and so prepare them for initiation.Out of these groups will be picked those who can be definitely prepared forcertain expansions of consciousness and who can be trusted to contact aspects ofthe Plan, hitherto not revealed. As you make progress in this work and as youseek to understand the group implications, it will become ever more clear to youwhat the Plan really is. It is as difficult for me to explain the underlyingpurpose of this group work to you as it would be to explain decimal fractions toa seven year old child, no matter how brilliant he might be. But if you have theneeded patience, the willingness to work impersonally and proceed with love, ifyou will submerge your personalities in the group life, you will know, you willperceive and the light will break in; the power to work will come to you. Weshall then have radiant focal points or light bearers and channels for theplanned distribution of force—a thing which has never yet been, upon the scalewhich we now contemplate. [55]PART VII do not intend to continue giving you only reiterated advice upon the treadingof the Path of Discipleship. You are adult men and women and know the Way. Thepractical application of the ancient Rules is your personal responsibility. Whatyou do is your own affair. You have reached maturity and should be ready for thenext step. That step will be taken when you have transmuted knowledge and theoryinto wisdom, practice and expression.It is only in a spirit of real detachment that the best work of a disciple isdone. The disciple comes to realise that because of this detachment he is (forthe remainder of his life) simply a worker—one of a great army of hierarchicalworkers—with supposedly no personality inclinations, objectives, or wishes.There is for him nothing but constant work and constant association with otherpeople. He may be a naturally isolated person, with a deep craving for solitudebut that matters not. It is the penalty he must pay for the opportunity to meetthe need of the hour. The hardest organised push of the Hierarchy is now takingplace and its objective is to offset the tendency of the race to crystalliseinto separativeness, for separation is the line of least resistance to peopleand nations at this time. Hence the formation of these working groups ofdisciples, giving an expression of group work and group cohesion and ofnon-separativeness.A few—relatively a very few—of the disciples and intuitives of the world todayare standing together in a twofold activity: one activity is to sense and touchwith greater accuracy the steadily unfolding subjective plan; the other is tospeak and teach with greater clarity and to choose with wiser exactitude theright words (written and spoken) by which to express the truth. The presentationof the sensed realities will then lead the thinking people of the world toarrest their present trend of thought and to cooperate more fully and freely inthe enlightenment of the world. I use the word “enlightenment” in its occultsense. The full measure of what can be done depends (as far as the individualdisciple is concerned) upon his inner power to live [56] each day as a soul—freefrom fear, free from self-consciousness and free from those reactions which stirthe astral or emotional body into organised activity, based on ancient habits.For the disciple and for the success of his work, an astral body of stillnessand of acquiescence, sensitive to impressions from the soul and from the Master,and reflecting the vision with as much purity of outline as may be possible, isthe goal. It should be remembered that when the disciple is fully occupied inliving the life of service on all three planes, there is little that can be saidor should be said to him. But a thought may be of aid.Let him seek, in the strenuousness of his life, to preserve the synthesis of thepersonality and the integration of all parts of his equipment. Often in thestress of activity in one body or another and on one plane or another, theemphasis may be temporarily so strong in some one direction that he may losesight for a moment of the synthetic point of view of both the Plan and thegroup. Physically, he is working under great pressure; emotionally, he may belearning the difficult lesson of detachment and may consequently be full of atemporary rebellion. Yet on the mental plane, he is aware of a mental clarityand of a power to think which keeps him incessantly and constructively active.The following three terms, therefore, express quite frequently the disciple’ssituation where his lower nature is concerned: excessive fatigue, emotionalrebellion and mental lucidity. How must he deal with this problem? Physicalfatigue need not necessarily impair in any way his usefulness. With many people,physical conditions impair their work for their attention becomes focussed onthe undesirable physical situation; disciples, however, often have a curiouscapacity to continue with their work no matter what may be happening to themphysically. The physical brain can be so much the reflector of the mental lifethat he will remain essentially unaffected by any outer conditions. The disciplelearns to live with his physical liabilities under adverse conditions and hiswork maintains its usual high level.The emotional problem may be the hardest. But only the disciple can handle hisown self-pity and free himself from the inner emotional storm in which he findshimself living. He [57] must recognise that his integration is weak, for he isworking in two phases or sections:Physical . . . . . . . emotional.andMental . . . . . . . . . . . soul.He is sometimes one and sometimes the other and usually very thoroughly ineither case. This duality must be brought into a closer relation and this is thepoint to which he must attend as he seeks to establish and preserve the neededsynthesis and personality-soul integration. When will disciples learn that theattitude which involves a certain “don’t care” reaction and a form ofindifference is one of the quickest ways by which to release the Self frompersonality claims? This is not the “don’t care” spirit which will affect thedisciple’s attitude to other people. It is the attitude of the integratedthinking personality of the disciple towards the astral or emotional body. Itleads him to assume the position that not one single thing which produces anyreaction of pain or distress in the emotional body matters in the very least.These reactions are simply recognised, lived through, tolerated and notpermitted to produce any limitation. All disciples would do well to ponder whatI have just said. The whole process is based on a deep-seated belief in thepersistence of the immortal Being within the forms of soul and personality.This inner realisation grows with the development of power in meditation whetherit is individual meditation or group work. Meditation is essential forestablishing a freer inner spiritual interplay—again whether as a soul inrelation to the personality or a group of disciples in relation to their Masteror each other. You might here well ask: Why is this sensitive interplay betweenthe disciples in a Master’s group regarded as necessary? Is not life complicatedenough without too much awareness of the conditions, the personalities and thesoul contacts of those with whom we are associated and with whom we seek to walkas fellow disciples? I would like here to remind you that, as disciples, you arein preparation for initiation and that impending condition of consciousnessimplies three things: [58]1. Increased awareness and sensitivity to experience and to life in all forms.2. The power to do for others what I have attempted to do for you, at present ona lesser scale and later, in other lives, as I now do it.3. The courage and the strength to know all, to realise all and to love withpatient wisdom and unchanging sincerity.This must surely be apparent to you. In the group work in which disciples arenow called to participate, you have an opportunity offered which can aid in theinducing of all the qualities which are needed by you as candidates forinitiation, at no such very distant date, as we view time on the inner side.The teaching has always been given that the disciple or the initiate must adapthimself to, and learn from, the conditions in which he finds himself and fromthe setting and environment with which his physical plane life puts him in dailytouch. This is one of the initial platitudes of the Path. It was, however, atone time as new a concept to the aspirant and the disciple under training as isthe teaching which I seek to give this group of my disciples and the opportunitywhich I would have you seize. The training, hitherto carried forward upon theinner planes, and unrealised oft in the waking consciousness of the accepteddisciple, has now to be grasped, used and mastered in his waking consciousnessand physical brain. The disciple in the past sought to establish harmoniousrelations with his environment—harmony being one of the liberating forces whichmust precede the release of energy for use after initiation. He practisedpatience and forbearance and helpfulness and rendered service and this wasworked out through the process of right external conduct based upon right innerorientation and attitude. But under the new system (made necessary by achievedracial progress) this process of right external adjustments must be paralleledin the New Age by right inner relations, consciously established and consciouslyheld and recognised for what they are by the conscious mind and brain of thedisciple. This, therefore, involves true knowledge of the disciple’s inner grouprelation, spiritual penetration to the inner life of a brother disciple and theconsequent fusion in the heart-mind-brain [59] of the disciple, simultaneously,of all that is known on both the outer and the inner planes. This has nothitherto been the case. It is one of the major reasons for the forming of thesegroups as far as the individual group members are concerned. It will be broughtabout gradually and safely by the daily use of the group meditations which I mayassign you, by a renewed interest in the subject of telepathic work and by acloser and deeper love, cultivated by all of you.Three things are of great importance and constitute your individualresponsibility:1. Facility of rapport . As a member of my group, it is essential that youcultivate two aspects of the “art of rapport” which is based, eternally, onloving attraction.a. Rapport or contact with the soul through a cultivated alignment and correctmeditation.b. Rapport or contact with your group brothers; this lays the foundation forconstructive, united work.2. Impersonality. Is there aught more that I can say on this theme? You mustlearn to view what is said or suggested by any group brother with a complete andcarefully developed “divine indifference.” Note the use of the word “divine,”for it holds the clue to the needed attitude. It is a different thing to theindifference of not caring, or the indifference of a psychologically developed“way of escape” from that which is not pleasant; nor is it the indifference ofsuperiority. It is the indifference which accepts all that is offered, uses whatis serviceable, learns what can be learnt but is not held back by personalityreactions. It is the normal attitude of the soul or self to the not-self. It isthe negation of prejudice, of all narrow pre-conceived ideas, of all personalitytradition, influence or background. It is the process of detachment from “theworld, the flesh and the devil” of which The New Testament speaks.3. Love . Love is that inclusive, non-critical, magnetic comprehension andattitude which (in group work) preserves the group integrity, fosters the grouprhythm and permits no secondary personality happenings or attitudes to mar thegroup work.[60] Contact, impersonality and love—these three constitute the individualobjectives which I set before each and all of you.The group requirements which must be met and preserved by the group, as a group,are as follows:1. Group integrity. This grows out of right integration and refers to thedelicate balance which must be preserved amongst the members of the group. Thisis of such a nature that there emerges eventually a group steadiness and a groupfreedom from “oscillation” which will permit of uninterrupted group work andinterplay. It will come if each of the group members will simply mind his ownbusiness and permit his group brothers to mind theirs; it will come if you keepyour personality affairs, your private concerns and troubles out of the grouplife; it will come if you refrain from discussion of each other and of eachother’s affairs and attitudes. This is of supreme importance at this stage ofthe group work; it will mean—if you can achieve success in this—that you will beable to keep your minds clear of all lesser things which concern the personalitylife. This means that your minds will be free, therefore, for group work.2. Fusion . By this I mean the ability of the group to work as a unit. This isdependent upon the achieving of right individual attitudes and (when working)the attainment of the capacity to lose sight of everything except the work to bedone and a deeply sensed love of your brothers.3. Understanding. I use this word in reference to your comprehension of the workto be undertaken. I do not use the word in reference to your attitude toyourself or to your group brothers. It means that each group works wisely andunderstandingly at its own appointed task, knowing that it contributes to awhole which exists in the mind of the Master.Integrity, fusion and understanding—this is the order of the work and thesequence of development. All groups, working in the outer world in relation tothe Ashrams of the Masters, will follow certain initial and final stages intheir work and [61] these will be uniform for all the groups, no matter whattheir specific and individual group work may be. Thus there will be broughtabout an inter-group relation and a consequent strengthening of the individualgroups. The third stage of the work to be done will be special and particular,differing for each group and to be followed by the group with meticulous care. Iwould ask all the various groups which may be working under my direction toattend to their own individual group business and not to speculate as to thenature of the work being done by the other groups.Let me outline for you the stages to be followed:STAGE ONE. Alignment. Soul contact. Spiritual poise. Poise is the steady holdingof the achieved soul contact.a. Then, the conscious relinquishing of personality reactions.b. Next, the recognition of the fact of love as an expression of that soulcontact—expressed through the medium of the personality.c. Finally, the imaginative fusion of the egoic and personality rays.This constitutes the vertical stage.STAGE TWO. The above is followed by group integration and group fusion, carriedforward consciously:a. By bringing each group member into conscious rapport through naming andloving .b. By seeing all the group members as a circle of living points of light alongwith yourself in the circle, but not at the centre of the circle.c. By imagining all these points of light as fusing and blending to make aradiant sun, with rays of light going out towards the four corners of the earth.This constitutes the horizontal stage.STAGE THREE. There follows next a careful consideration of group purpose andtechnique. This technique will be different for each group; by a dynamic,unremitting [62] following of the particular, indicated technique will theresults be achieved. This technique must not be changed by anyone except myself.Stages I and II should be rapidly effective and almost instantaneous in theirresults, after three months’ careful work has been done. I request that you givecareful, patient attention to them so that they develop eventually into stablehabits and so give you no trouble and further difficulty. The initial stages inthis type of work are of paramount importance.STAGE FOUR. Having finished the special group work under Stage III, the membersof the group will then endeavour to link up with the other groups in the samemanner in which they linked up with the members of their own group. In thiscase, however, disciples will not concern themselves with the personnel of anyof the groups, including their own, but only—as a group—link their group withthe other groups. Thus the concepts of illusion and of separateness, and therealisation of fusion, will assume correct proportions in your minds.a. Next, as a group, say the Great Invocation three times:“Let the Forces of Light bring illumination to mankind.Let the Spirit of Peace be spread abroad.May Men of Goodwill everywhere meet in a spirit of cooperation.Let Power attend the efforts of the Great Ones.”b. Then sound the Sacred Word, the O.M. three times.c. Close with the prayer of the personality to the soul:“May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be always acceptablein thy sight, Oh Soul, my Lord and my Redeemer.”PART VII[63] The need for telepathic sensitivity in every group, composed of disciples,is based upon three necessities; I would like you to understand this moreclearly.1. The cultivation of an inter-relation of a telepathic nature upon the mentalplane is essential. This has always been an established fact or condition in thecase of a Master and His disciple and between the senior disciples in any groupof accepted disciples. The time has now come when this group quality must—forthe sake of a needy world—be developed by disciples of lesser attainment in thegroup.2. This telepathic unfoldment will lead to a greater sensitivity to others. Thisis the secret of a Master’s work and the factor which enables Him to workthrough His disciples, using them as outposts of His consciousness. To do thiswith exactitude, He must be able to know their condition (mental, psychical andphysical) when He chooses so to know. He can thus discover whether they areavailable or not for any specific service, whether they can be safely used ornot and whether their sensitivity is such and their interpretation of what theysense is of sufficient accuracy so that they will respond intelligently to theneed. Have I not had to study all of you this way? Think this out and ponderupon the implications.3. This telepathic sensitivity will also lead to the new science ofinter-communication which, in the New Age, will reach general use andcomprehension. Of this condition, the radio is the outer physical symbol.Certain questions now arise and it might be well to formulate the answers tosome of them. It could be wisely asked if anyone has the right to worktelepathically upon the mind of any person? The answer is that you are doing itall the time, consciously or unconsciously, and without skill or purpose or—ifthere is a purpose—it is usually a personality purpose. It is through telepathythat ideas have been disseminated in the world by the process of mentallyimpressing the mind of some [64] disciple or sensitive person. It is then theirtask to find and direct the mind and activities of those individuals whose taskis not only to be responsive to this impression but to bring it out into theconsciousness of the world thinkers. Have you ever asked yourselves what are theaspects of the work, in connection with telepathy, which raise questions in yourmind? Is it not distrust of personality intention or point of view and aquestioning also as to your own sincerity or motives? Unless this work iscarried forward selflessly and with complete freedom from personal prejudice andpersonal choices—political or religious—there can be no safe work along thisline. That is why I emphasise to you the need of doing this work at the highestunited point of meditation and with complete obedience to my decisions in thematter.Another question could well be: What is the difference between this work which Iam suggesting to you and the work of the Lodge of the Lords of Form? Nonewhatsoever, except in motive and the point from which you must endeavour towork. The Lords of Form work entirely on and from the lower levels of the mentalplane and with the energy of knowledge. The love aspect of the soul itself isinactive and, therefore, from the angle and vision of the Great White Lodge,motives are wrong and the objectives are selfish ones. This is true both ofindividuals and groups. Forget not that these Lords of Form are souls of greatage and unique blindness. But that later, in some far distant cycle, and whenkarma has worked upon them and the Great Law has exacted full payment for allwrong done, that they too will begin to develop the love aspect and to transmutetheir motives. You too must work from mental levels but knowledge and love mustbe called into play together, producing only those results which areharmoniously and intelligently in line with the Plan. Disciples are notpermitted to call into play and functioning activity the Will aspect of thesoul, unless they are initiates of the third degree. Prior to that, they seldomrealise the distinction between the imposition of the will and the directedimpression of ideas. There is too much desire (which is embryonic will) in theirequipment for them to be trusted as yet with this higher aspect of mentalactivity. I would ask you to get clearly in your minds in connection [65] withany telepathic work which these groups (working under me) should do, that it isthe impression of ideas and not imposed direction which is the group ideal—avery different thing, my brother.You might also ask: How can this collective impressing go on and yet leave a manfree? Because it will be kept clear of all directed will-force; all that workersand disciples in my groups will seek to do is to impress certain minds with theoutlines or suggestions as to the Plan; these ideas will deal particularly withthe concept that separation is a thing of the past and that unity is the goal ofthe immediate future; that hatred is retro-active and undesirable and thatgoodwill is the touchstone which will transform the world.How then can you keep your minds free from your own desires and from your owninterpretations? By achieving that poised and positive negativity on the part ofthe two lower aspects of the personality—the astral body and the brain as wellas the etheric brain; these determine the reactions of the lower centres,particularly of the solar plexus centre. The mind will then be left free tofulfil three functions:1. That of soul contact; this will result in illumination and a workingknowledge of the immediate aspects of the Plan.2. That of thought formulation and thoughtform creation. Then a clearthoughtform can be constructed with definiteness, and it can be positivelydirected.3. That of working on mental levels with your group brothers so that yourthoughtform is a part of their thoughtform and you can, therefore, unitedlyproduce a living, embodied form which can be directed as I may determine.Another question might here arise: Are there any specific and brief rules whichshould be obeyed? The following might be given, but I would remind you that itis what you are that counts in this work more powerfully than anything else. Thecontrolling factor is harmlessness in thought and word; the practice of this,with proper observation, will greatly help all of you. Next comes a refusal tothink unkindly or with criticism; [66] this is essential in connection withthose whose minds you seek to impress. Silence , complete and unbroken as towhat you are doing, is also a vital factor; the utterance of words in connectionwith this most subtle and confidential work (or even discussion of the work witha fellow-disciple) can shatter the delicate thoughtform which you are attemptingto build. It can render the work of weeks abortive. A balanced attitude inrelation to those in power throughout the world must also be cultivated; theyneed above all else the inspiration which can be brought to them from theHierarchy.I would ask you, therefore, to practise purging the content of your minds of allcritical and unkind thoughts so that you can achieve an attitude of divineindifference to the ephemeral and fleeting personalities and to the chaoseverywhere to be seen and so endeavour to tune in on the attitude of theHierarchy. This involves the emphasis of the consciousness-aspect and thecareful observation of all that goes on beneath the surface—awakening, arousingand stimulating to a pronounced mental activity, the hitherto unconsciousmasses. The events which are happening in every country are bringing this aboutwith much rapidity; humanity is coming alive and its consciousness is awakeningto the subjective values. The Hierarchy is sore beset to meet humanity’semerging need of guidance. The sensitivity of the human race (as the result ofeconomic insufficiency, of war, anxiety and pain) is becoming so acute that wewho work on the inner side must hasten to impress sensitive, awakening psychicswith the right impression. Hence our effort to create these groups, and to usepeople like yourselves who are (theoretically) harmless but actually full ofprejudice and hasty judgments. We have to use the material which lies to handand are greatly handicapped at all times.After you have worked consciously at the purification of the mind and after youhave attempted to free yourselves from prejudice, from preconceived ideas andhasty judgments and determinations (based upon your own background, tradition,social and racial status), you will then brood consciously on the process ofthoughtform making; you will remember that—for group purposes and forsimplicity—the following three stages are of importance: [67]1. The stage of pondering over the idea which is to be impressed upon the mindof some individual. This pondering and carefully directed thinking producesconstruction ; it is a creative activity and is the first real stage in ourwork. I do not want you to endeavour to build thoughtforms. I want you to thinkclearly along lines which I may indicate. Then the desired thoughtform willautomatically take shape and all of you will have contributed something to it.2. When the thoughtform is thus built in your mind, there will follow a periodwherein it comes alive. It slowly becomes the living embodiment of the desiredidea—vibrant, active and ready for service.3. When this stage is reached, you can then—as a group—proceed with the stage ofdirection. Having carefully in mind the person to be impressed and the fact ofyour group as the impressing agency (thus providing the two poles between whichinterplay is desired), you will try to see the living embodied idea, playingback and forth between the two poles. You will send it out on the wings of love,impelled by the wise desire to serve and in obedience to my directions. Time andagain, it may return to you for revivifying and enrichment before its task issatisfactorily accomplished.The externalised groups of disciples are all of them intended to be expressionsof a type of group relation which will be better known and understood when theworld has entered into the next cycle and era of peace. Certain types of forceare, as you know, to be later utilised by the groups for specific group ends andfor world service. The motive for all such service must not be forgotten by you,as you study and work in a Master’s group. The objective is not your individualassistance and unfoldment but your training in certain group alignments andactivities which will enable these groups of disciples to work in a definite andspecific manner. The fact, however, that one group will work with one type offorce and another group of disciples will employ a different kind must not inany sense be deemed to indicate separate activity or separative interests. All[68] will be working towards one objective or goal and all will work with thesame divine energy, differentiated into varying forces for the purposes ofservice in one department of life or another. I would ask you to ponder deeplyupon the various aspects of the outlined plan or system of group work which Ihave brought to you, for it is a tentative endeavour to externalise upon earth,certain phases of hierarchical endeavour.The energy used in the telepathic work is the “chitta” (as the Hindus call it)or the mind-stuff which underlies and is the very substance of manifestationitself. God, the planetary Life or Logos, however, works with the highercorrespondence of this mind-stuff and the forces of the mental plane are thereflection or rather the densification of this higher mental substance. Theseforces, this mind-stuff, is constantly in flux and in motion. This produces thatthoughtform-making activity of the mental world which is set in motion byminds—working either individually or in group formation. In true telepathic work(carried forward without error and correctly and from a poised point of action)the currents of this mind-stuff are set in motion between certain points by thewill and the carefully expressed and formulated idea in the mind of the thinker.A certain portion of this mind-stuff (already in motion) is built into form andthen travels along the current, as set up between the two points. The telepathicworker, such as, for instance, myself, works from the angle of the mind of thetransmitter and that of the recipient, establishing first of all a current ofrapport (which you sometimes call “sensing the Tibetan’s vibration”); along thatcurrent, I send the impression, the idea or the thoughtform which I seek to seeimpinging first of all upon your minds and then—if you are capable of suchalignment—upon your brains. This process can be either rapid or slow. Where thealignment is good, there can be an almost immediate response to my thought;where it is not good, it may take days and even weeks for the impression to befinally realised and consciously registered on the disciple’s mind and brain.There are other groups which are consciously working with the energy which candispel glamour and illusion. This is the energy of the highest level of theastral plane. This level is [69] susceptible to reaction or response to thattype of energy which we call the energy of the intuition or of buddhi, if youlike the oriental terminology. It is the energy of wisdom. This wisdom energy isthe only type of force which is adequate to dispel the miasmas, the fogs and themists of the world of glamour. Those disciples who are working in these groupshave to learn to use this energy, to work wisely, to think with wisdom and torealise that wisdom itself is a force. It is this realisation which makes aperson seek out another person with wisdom when he is in trouble and difficultyand is anxious to see with clarity the way that he should go. It is thisrealisation which drives the members of the human family to the Masters of theWisdom.In Atlantean days (I am here telling you something of interest and somethingwhich should evoke a sense of responsibility), the major task of the Masters ofthe Wisdom was with the great world illusion or rather, glamour. They workedthen primarily upon the astral plane and had They not done so, human life andconditions would not be so good as they are—for they are in reality full ofbeauty, the beauty of potentiality, hovering upon the verge of immediacy ofexpression.Today, They are working primarily upon the mental plane, dealing with ideas andwith their impression upon the minds of Their disciples and advanced humanity;it is the problem of humanity itself, as a whole, to work in the world glamour;it is the responsibility of the aspirants of the world to guide humanity out ofthe valley of glamour. Men must learn to understand it and eventually—aided bythe senior disciples of the world, trained by the Masters of the Wisdom—totransmute and dispel it.You should, therefore, bear in mind that the task before the modern disciple isto carry forward into the New Age the idea of the bringing of glamour and of thegreat illusion into the light. In the light, it will disappear. In this age, wehave mastered, too well perhaps, the forces of nature and have brought out forour own benefit the material resources of the physical plane. We have conqueredthem and bent them to our will and use, often selfishly, yet sometimes with goodand pure intent. In the New Age, a paralleling control will take place [70] overthe world of astral phenomena and over the forces of glamour and illusion. Weseek to control them today mentally and theoretically. But only the energy ofwisdom will suffice to dispel the forces of the world glamour and the worldillusion. Practise wisdom, my brothers, and thus aid humanity and shorten itsastral struggle.Other groups have the task of working with the energy which is the well knownand much discussed prana or life energy—the energy of vitality. The right use ofthe pranic energies (and they are seven in number) will most assuredly dissipatedisease and bodily ills and will cure the pains of the human physical vehicle.But in connection with this, two things are essential and these are seldom foundtogether:1. The energy of the soul—like the energy of the universal mind and the energyof buddhi, or the intuition—has to be set in action upon the physical plane bythe one to be healed and by the healer. Both have to work in cooperation.2. There must be right understanding of the disease and its cause, plus thekarmic status of the patient and the condition of his centres, his alignment andhis point in evolution.As yet we are only dealing with the a.b.c. of these relatively new sciences andmuch of our initial work must be of a clarifying nature because there is so muchdistorted sensing of these occult systems of energy utilisation and so muchmisuse of these powers.Other groups are associated in a peculiar manner with the number four, and theyare occupied with the bridging work carried forward between the personality andthe Monad (the triple lower man and the Spiritual Triad) and also between thelower mind, the soul and the higher mind—thus linking that relatively lowertriplicity with the unity, the Spiritual Triad. The fourth kingdom in nature is,in its turn, a bridging kingdom between the three superhuman kingdoms and thethree subhuman. Again, the fourth plane (which must be reached by the bridge oflight, the antahkarana) is the link between the three higher worlds of spiritualbeing and the three lower [71] worlds of human endeavour and experience. Theenergy with which the group of disciples along this line of activity has to workis the Light of the soul, remembering ever that light is substance; their effortis to create—as individuals and also as a group of disciples—a great pathway oflight between the personality and the Spiritual Triad (atma-buddhi-manas orspiritual will, intuitive understanding and the higher mind).I have not dealt with some of the activities of these groups of disciples in theNew Age or pointed out the energies with which they must work in order toemphasise again to you the plans for my own groups of disciples. These groupswith which I am engaged as part of the activity of my Ashram are essentiallySeed Groups . They are intended to be outposts of the hierarchical consciousnessas it focusses itself through me in the same sense as an individual accepteddisciple is an outpost of his Master’s consciousness in the world. That is theconnection which I seek to emphasise—the externalisation of the inner work ofthe planetary Hierarchy for the first time in history and a precipitation (ifyou like that term) of an inner and ready condition. The New Age is upon us andthe integration of humanity in the three worlds warrants definite changes intechnique though not in the basic plans.All this is, however, an experiment and I would remind you that it is anexperiment which I and several other initiates are carrying forward as membersof a great spiritual organisation. If it is successful and if the spiritualmomentum set up by all of you is adequate to the effort made and if you cancarry on with persistence and with untiring effort and interest, it may bepossible to bring the experimental stage to an end; the Hierarchy can thenrecognise (as effectively established upon earth) certain focal points of energywhich can constitute magnetic centres or rallying points for the new religion,the new medicine, the new psychology and education and the new politics. Thepotentialities are great. The difficulties are not insuperable, otherwise Iwould not have been permitted to make this great experiment. We enter into noactivities which are obviously fore-ordained to failure. Many experiments arebeing carried forward today in the world by the various Members of the Hierarchyin Their differing grades and with Their [72] special groups. This effort canprove successful only in so far as the disciples of the world desire it, makethe needed sacrifices and think the various objectives into being.I am mentioning this at this time because in the press of world affairs, in thestruggles of your own individual existence and in the fatigue which is incidentto daily work and the consequent physical liabilities, there inevitably comesthe cooling down of the earlier ardours and enthusiasm, the tired recognition ofthe monotony of the demanded effort (with frequent staleness and unenterprisingaspiration), which untiring spiritual work demands.The disciple learns to pay no attention to these recurring cycles and interludesbetween the pairs of opposites for he recognises their intermittency. I do,however, seek to point out this point of danger—for danger it is—and ask you togo on with the work just “as if” it were entirely new and fascinating.It is necessary here for you also to remember that though these groups areintended to be Seed groups of the New Age, two factors in connection with themshould be remembered:1. They constitute a unique experiment in the sense that—knowing thepossibilities and understanding somewhat the forces which are slowly emerginginto prominence in a world rapidly adjusting itself to the new rhythms—yet theyare primarily an experiment undertaken by me, your Tibetan teacher and a memberof a certain standing in the Hierarchy, with the cooperation of certain otherinitiates. I am not, as I have already told you, the only worker along theselines and these seed groups are not the only units to be found today in theworld. There are, for instance, several seed units working out into being withinthe framework of the Catholic Church, under the inspiration of the Master Jesus.These are, however, somewhat more subjective than are the groups in which I amparticularly interested and their emergence is slower but they do exist. Thereare, also, two such seed groups in China and four in India. I mention this inorder to safeguard you against the sense of uniqueness which is the subtle seedof the great heresy of separateness. [73]2. These groups of disciples are all passing through the formative stage andchange and adjustment is going on. Their pattern is still fluid because too manydisciples are receptive to the words of the Masters and are less receptive tothe ideas upon which They found Their work. This comment warrants yourattention. Later, when the needed adjustments are made and groups of disciplescan work together without criticism or misunderstanding, then they can pass onto organised group work. This is necessarily dependent upon the general level ofthe group endeavour, upon their aspiration and their applied persistence. Thewillingness to work through these groups exists on our side and is found,therefore, upon the inner planes. The providing of an adequate instrumentthrough which we can work must come from you.The time must come, however, when the work of each group of disciples mustdefinitely integrate and thus change from the theoretical and the experimentalto the definite and the practical. Then the period of group usefulness willarrive. This will naturally depend upon two things:1. When the group reaches a certain stage of synthesis, then it will becomepossible for the group to work as a group with power.2. If the group fails to integrate and to take advantage of group opportunityand the particular call to service, then a re-arrangement of the personnel willbe essential. Certain disciples will then have to drop out and those who havenot measured up to the requirements, which their souls have set for them, and tothe point of attainment towards which I am expectantly looking, will be absorbedinto other groups or form the nucleus of a re-organised unit.All the teaching on the groups of disciples, functioning in the New Age, isintended for all the groups and for general distribution later on. The teachingupon specific group work will be given up to the point where conscious use of itcan be made and the knowledge given can be turned to practical purpose in worldservice. And, my brothers, it is world service that today is needed. [74]PART VIIIThe Hierarchy is deeply concerned over world happenings. When the war is over,our work must go forward at any and every cost and in the face of everyimaginable obstacle. The New Group of World Servers must preserve its integrityand work steadily and undismayed. The steadiness of those who know God’s planwill help humanity and aid the efforts of the Hierarchy. These do not hate andthey work for unity—both subjective and eventually objective.It is wise for human beings to realise that mankind is free. Even the HierarchyItself does not know which forces—those of good or those of evil—will ultimatelyprevail because even if the forces of good triumph where the war is concerned,will they triumph where the peace is concerned? Good must ultimately triumph butthe Hierarchy does not know what the immediate future holds for humanity becausemen determine their own destiny. The Law of Cause and Effect cannot be offset.In those cases where it has been offset, it has required the intervention ofForces, greater than those available at this time upon our planet. These greaterForces can intervene if the world aspirants and disciples make their voicesadequately penetrating....In this time of stress and strain, my brothers, I would remind you that there isno need for the sense of futility or for the registration of littleness. The newgroups of disciples are Seed Groups ; they are in the dark or growing stage andin the process of expansion—growing silently. This stage is most important for,according to the healthiness of the seed and its ability to cast strong rootsdownwards and to penetrate slowly and steadily upwards towards the light, sowill be the adequacy of the contribution to the New Age which is upon us. Iwould emphasise that fact to you. The New Age is upon us and we are witnessingthe birth pangs of the new culture and the new civilisation. That which is oldand undesirable must go and of these undesirable things, hatred and the spiritof separateness must be the first to disappear.The main objective of our joint work is still group integration and the settingup of that inter-communication between [75] the group members which will resultin the needed interplay and telepathic communication; this will finallyestablish that golden network of light which will serve to create a powerfulfocal point; this focal point will be the agent for the revitalisationspiritually of the etheric body of humanity—as a whole. This is an essential andimportant statement. This focal point will, in its turn, aid in the revitalisingof the etheric body of the planet with new power and with fresh impulse.I have for several years attempted to be your teacher, your Master and, I thinkI may say, your friend. There has been established between us a very strong linkof love and understanding upon my part and a proved sincerity and a definitewish to cooperate on yours. What is my attitude towards you?As individuals, you may be of small importance; as units in the group which I ampreparing and training for definite service in future lives even more than inthis, you are of sufficient moment to warrant my interest. A group is no morepowerful than its weakest link and a group suffers esoterically and as a wholeand its power is definitely curtailed when one member fails to measure up toopportunity or recedes into the glamours of the personality. This you have seenhappen. As individuals I seek to help you but only with a view to your groupintegration, to your group influence and understanding and your group love, plusthe strength which you can each bring to the whole.I, therefore, appeal to you, as a group, for an intensification of your grouplove, purpose and service so that the inner, subjective integration may proceedapace. I have three things to say to you today as a group:First of all, the strength or the weakness of this group of disciples will liein the fact that the individuals who compose it are not only egoically linkedbut that there is also a strong personality tie (with all the weaknesses whichthat may entail) and a deep, if unrealised, affection between each and all ofyou, even if you have not met each other. The strength of this situation isfound in the fact that this condition of unconscious friendship is to be foundas the result of many lives of close association in the work and also in pastpersonality relations and family ties. The weakness exists in the fact that thissituation [76] is apt to make the group personal in its reactions. This group ofdisciples is intrinsically an entity on all the three levels of the threeworlds—physical, emotional and mental—and there is a soul tie as well.I would like also to impress upon you a second point. It is of apt applicationin the strenuous conditions which prevail at this time. In the stress and strainof your group work let each of you bear in mind, for your encouragement, joy anddedicatory incentive, that you are in this particular group of disciples forpreparatory training for initiation. I am entering upon an experiment in groupinitiation and this is somewhat a new enterprise for the Hierarchy to undertake,though in line with evolutionary development. In future ages, men and women willpass through the Portal of Initiation together, instead of alone and singly ashas hitherto been the case. Group progress can, therefore, in this connection befurthered or held back by the effort of the individual group member. A member’sdifficulties can be enhanced by the united group stimulation; his strength andeffectiveness can be increased by the strength, the power and the understandingof the group. Your united responsibility is, therefore, great and youropportunity for rapid progress is real and definitely unusual. When together youpass through the Portal and I present you to Those Whose task it is to lead youon your next step, there should eventuate such an enhancement of your powers tolove, to intuit and to serve, that life will never again appear to be the samething. You will grasp with surety then what now you dimly sense, and realise thewonder of group love, of group intuition and of group service; you will thusundergo a joint illumination, a shared response and a united effort. You willcomprehend then that a line of exclusion may spiritually exist, indicating thosewho can pass on to the preparatory stage of group initiation and those who mustapproach that great event singly and alone. These latter belong predominantly tothe Piscean Age. They take initiation as separate identities; you can takeinitiation in group formation.None of us who do the work of preparing candidates for initiation are in aposition to pronounce as to time; that has to be determined by each individualaspirant. See to it, however, [77] as individuals, that your group is not heldback through your inability to see, by your personal glamours, by yourindividual problem or by your slow reactions to known truth.The third thing that I want to say is that whatever your particular status onthe Path at this time, I shall seek to help you as in the past. I shall speakthe truth as I see it from my particular vantage point. Upon your blindness incertain directions, I shall seek to throw a light. I shall point out yourweaknesses—if I can get your sincere attention. These weaknesses exist. You arenot yet initiate, and you have faults, limitations, points of darkness and muchinertia and at the same time self-satisfaction. The tendency to self-defence isstrong in some of you and this produces an unwillingness to recognise faults oreven to admit, hypothetically, that faults may be present. The tendency toself-depreciation is strong in others and it produces that over-emphasis of thepersonality and that constant thought about the personality which is sodetrimental to real progress. In these tendencies (which are so usual) therelies real danger for the would-be initiate. I warn you to watch for theindications of these conditions and to assume an attitude of willingness tolisten and to admit the possibility of failure in the one case and ofself-forgetfulness in the other. Look yourselves and life squarely in the faceand fearlessly see things as they are in truth. Do this not because it is I whoam suggesting to you that a situation may be thus or so but because you arewilling to face up to facts and are ready for unexpected discoveries aboutyourselves. One of the first lessons which a disciple needs to learn is thatwhere he thinks he is strongest and where he finds the most satisfaction is veryfrequently the point of greatest danger and of weakness. Astral conditions areoft seen reversed; hence the glamour which often overcomes a disciple.In this connection, my brothers, I will admit you into a piece of personalhistory and one which is quite ordinary in the life of a disciple. It may serveto carry its lesson and its warning. Several lives ago, my Master saw in me aweakness. It was one of which I was quite unaware and it was in fact a qualitywhich I regarded as a strength and which I hugged to myself as a virtue. I wasthen a young man, anxious to help my Master and humanity but, in the lastanalysis, I was very keen about myself [78] as an aspirant and very pleased withmyself—cloaking this satisfaction under the garb of a reiterated humility. TheMaster poured into me His strength and energy and so stimulated me that what Ithought was a virtue and what I had denied and repudiated as a vice, proved myundoing. I symbolically crashed to earth through the very weight of my weakness.You might well ask what this weakness was? It was my love for my Master whichwas my undoing. He pointed out to me after the failure that my love for Him wasin reality based upon pride in myself and a profound satisfaction with myself asan aspirant and a disciple. This I violently denied and was grieved that Heshould so misunderstand me. I proved Him to be right, eventually, through a lifeof failure and the depth of my egotism. I learnt through that failure but I lostmuch time from the standpoint of useful service. I found that I was reallyserving myself and not humanity. From similar mistakes, I seek to save you, fortime is a great factor in service. For the masses of humanity, time is not ofvery great importance; but for the servers of the race, it matters much. Losenot time, therefore, in undue self-analysis, self-depreciation or self-defence.Go forward with discrimination where your unfoldment is concerned, and with loveand understanding where your group is concerned. Where I, your teacher, amconcerned, give to my words the attention which is due and endeavour tocooperate with me. I shall then some day have the joy of welcoming you to the“Secret Place” where all true servers and initiates must eventually meet andunite.I have revealed to you, my disciples, my true name. The necessity foreradicating all reason for the speculative questioning of some of you as to myidentity and of spurring others of you on to renewed and consecrated effort aretwo of my reasons for relinquishing my anonymity. Another reason is that I wouldhave you recognise the fact that you are accepted disciples with all that thatstatus necessarily implies of responsibility and opportunity. Still anotherdeciding factor with me is to test out your ability to keep silent until it isno longer necessary to do so. Silence is one of the prime pre-requisites forinitiation and something which every disciple must perforce learn. There is,therefore, the necessity for the test. Many of [79] you are already interiorlyconvinced of my identity. You have not voiced your belief in this connectionexcept to A.A.B. who has not responded with any corroborating evidence orcomments. If you cannot be trusted to keep silence and to preserve a detachedand independent attitude, then you are not ready for that which I have to giveand the sooner we discover this the better. If you are unable to retain a silenttongue—even among yourselves—then you are unfit to be trusted and that I shoulddislike to believe. If, when you have discovered who I am, you question thewisdom of my decision to reveal myself to you and hold that I should havewithheld my identity, then that too will be revealing and will guide me in allmy future approaches to you. If knowledge of who I am leads you into thedangerous path of the devotee, it will be good for you to discover that tendencywithin yourself; if you henceforth over-emphasise the importance of my words andif you fall into the dangerous habit of accepting authority, your weakness willstand revealed to me, to yourself, and to your group brothers. We shall allprofit thereby. You will have discovered an innate weakness which discovery ofmy identity will have drawn forth; if you are burdened by the knowledge, thenyou must learn to carry burdens or else you will be of no use as a world server.The fact that I am a Master alters me not. I am still your Tibetan Teacher andthe same Instructor who has taught you for many years. I remain the sameindividual and am in no wise different. Any reaction upon your part will be apersonality reaction and, therefore, to be recognised, dealt with and finallysubdued.Let us go forward together, my brothers and chelas, along the path of service;let us together enter into the Light and tread the way to world peace and not topersonal illumination—illumination is inevitable but incidental.As regards all of you—with what have I to deal? An untested group, a staticgroup, a critical group and a group subject to pronounced glamours—such is thematerial with which I must carry forward my work. What can I do in such asituation, my brothers? I can trust your devotion to humanity, your willingnessto learn and your determination to proceed along the path of service at anycost. This I will most certainly do.[80] I would like to deal, first of all, with the objectives that I have in mindfor all of you:1. The main present objective.I seek to bring about a much needed group integration. The polarisation of thisgroup—as a unity upon the mental plane—is not yet accomplished. It is mostneeded and until this integration has been achieved, the united groupinter-communication will not be possible or the desired group work capable ofaccomplishment. Several of you need to do some careful thinking and should alignyourselves in love with your fellow disciples, eliminating all sense ofcriticism and personal self-satisfaction in your own judgment and rectitude.2. The future objective of these ashramic groups.It is fundamentally necessary that the new groups which are inaugurating the newdiscipleship should eventually establish a telepathic rapport with each other.Later, when there is a closer individual inter-relation, it will be possible togive definite teaching which will make this increasingly possible, but in themeantime a hint will have to suffice. It is foundational in nature and will haveto be accepted and somewhat understood prior to successful work in all thesepioneering groups. Think outwardly towards each other in love. Just simply that,my brothers—simply and humbly that and no more than that at present. Can youaccept such a simple rule—apparently simple? In this way the etheric body ofthis group of disciples will be animated by the golden energy and the light oflove and thus a network of light will be established which will form a focalpoint of energy in the etheric body of humanity itself and eventually in theplanetary etheric body also.3. The general group objective.This is the shifting of consciousness of all integrated human beings inincreasingly large numbers on to the etheric levels of consciousness andactivity. This entails conscious work on those levels as energy units, eachcontributing his individual share and his special quota of energy to the sumtotal of available etheric energy and doing this both consciously andintelligently. When this is done, the man is then ready for the first initiation[81] and is a true occultist—working with energy under hierarchical guidance.4. The individual objective.This necessitates the preparation of the life and consciousness for this newprocess of group initiation. This group initiation is itself of real import andis dependent upon the unit in the group fitting himself for initiation and atthe same time learning to subordinate his spiritual ambition and desires to thegroup pace and to the necessity of right timing where his fellow disciples areconcerned. It involves, therefore, a dual attitude towards the processes ofinitiation: the adapting of oneself to the needed integration and, secondly, tothe development of spiritual responsiveness to impressions from the level of thesoul and of the spiritual Hierarchy. It also involves the cultivation ofjudgment and of wisdom in the establishment of a right inter-relation with thegroup of disciples so that the group—in this case my group of disciples anddefinitely a group entity—may move on together. This necessitates the sameconditions for the group as always exist for the individual: right integrationon the three personality levels and also on soul levels, plus right groupimpression or responsiveness to the spiritual and higher psychic “gift waves”—asTibetan occultists call them.This will take many years and the work of achieving finished group attitudes andrelationships through individual understanding and true impersonality can goforward upon the physical plane whilst in incarnation, or it can go on out ofincarnation with the same facility. You must always bear in mind that theconsciousness remains the same, whether in physical incarnation or out ofincarnation, and that development can be carried on with even greater ease thanwhen limited and conditioned by the brain consciousness.The attainment of these objectives will involve clear vision and a keen andintelligent understanding; it will require the steady and consciousintensification of group love and group interplay; it will lead all disciples tolive lives full of wise purpose and planned spiritual objectives and, at thesame time, the service rendered will assume a definite and an automatictechnique of expression.[82] You might here ask me if there is one single mode or means whereby adisciple can begin to approximate this seemingly impossible goal. I would reply:By the steady practice of impersonality with its subsidiary attitude ofindifference where personal desires, contacts and goals are concerned. Such animpersonality is little understood and even when cultivated by well-intentionedaspirants has a selfish basis. Ponder on this and endeavour to achieveimpersonality through self-forgetfulness and through the decentralisation of thefocus of consciousness from the personality (where it is usually centred) intothe living, loving soul.There are four things which frequently hold back a group of disciples fromachievement and from satisfactory work:1. Lack of vision, incident to a lack of mental keenness.2. Personal glamour. This involves the astral plane.3. Individual problems, involving a pronounced pre-occupation upon the physicalplane with its circumstances and difficulties—in this most difficult of worlds.4. Inertia or slow reactions to the imparted teaching and to the presentedopportunity.A deep reflection upon the urgency of the times and a sympathetic recognition ofthe unhappy plight of humanity are much needed by many disciples and aspirantsin the world today, particularly by those who are not close to the worldsituation but who are looking at it from a distance. It is so simple to give afacile expression of sympathy but at the same time to avoid too great anexpenditure of energy in service and too intense an effort to be of assistance.The hallmark of the pledged disciple and a quality which should increasinglydominate his life is the capacity to identify himself with the part or with thewhole—as seems needed at any particular time. Such an attitude involves acomprehensive sweep of love, and this leads to inclusiveness and to the pledgingof the life service to the greatest number and to the most needy. If I wereasked to specify the outstanding fault of the majority of groups of disciples atthis time, I would say that it is the expression of the wrong kind ofindifference, leading to an almost immovable pre-occupation with their personalideas [83] and undertakings. These militate against the group integration andtend to block the work.One of the things most needed by every disciple is to apply the teaching givento the idea of promoting and increasing their world service, thus renderingpractical and effective in their environment the knowledge that has beenimparted and the stimulation to which they have been subjected. This is asuggestion to which I would have you pay real attention.I would like also at this point to bring to your attention the fact that anaccepted disciple is not in reality one who has been accepted by a Master fortraining. This is the distortion of a true idea which, in its progress from themental plane to the physical, has achieved a complete reversal or distortion. Anaccepted disciple is one who:1. Has accepted the fact of the Hierarchy with the implications of loyalty andcooperation which that acceptance involves.2. Has accepted the fact that all souls are one and who has, therefore, pledgedhimself to seek expression as a soul. The service to be rendered is theawakening and stimulation of all souls contacted.3. Has accepted the occult technique of service. His service to humanitydetermines all his activities and subordinates his personality to the need ofthe time. Note that phrase. Cultivate insight and a fluid response to theimmediate need and not a sensitive reaction to a distant goal.4. Has accepted the Plan, as indicated by the Teachers of the race. He seeks tounderstand the nature of that Plan and to facilitate its manifestation.Other points (of a more individual nature) could be enumerated, but I would haveyou lay the emphasis upon the acceptances which have or should have motivatedyour attitude and I would ask you not to emphasise so unduly in your privatethoughts this idea of being “accepted by a Master.” This thought and itsteaching by many esoteric groups has been productive of much error, muchmisunderstanding, much pain and much disillusionment. A disciple is trained incertain important [84] matters and not in his relation to a Master. Thesefactors of importance to a disciple are:1. The whole subject of humanity —its present status, its problems and theopportunity immediately presented. A disciple is one who seeks at all times toaid humanity and to further the processes of evolution as well as to developthat deep love of mankind which is the distinguishing mark of the initiate andof the Master.2. The subject of initiation . A study of this subject will lead to aconsideration of its secondary development and its basic objective of aprogressive identification with the soul of the disciple, with the soul of thegroup, with the soul of humanity as a whole and with the soul in all forms.3. The subject of service . This is not service as it is usually understood. Theordinary connotation has largely lost its significance through wrong emphasis.The initiate considers service as the spontaneous, easy expression of a definitesoul contact, brought down on to the physical plane and giving insight,practicality and inspiration to the disciple as he works on the outer plane ofexpression. Most disciples are occupied vaguely with achieving inspiration butknow nothing of the earlier stages of insight, leading to the practical and wiseexpression of the met need upon the level of daily living. One of the majorundertakings of the accepted disciple (or, as I would prefer to term it, theaccepting disciple) is to transform himself from a well-intentioned idealistinto a man of action on behalf of humanity.When a group can think unanimously along these lines and work in unison, thenthe first step will have been taken towards group initiation which is the goalof the new discipleship. Group initiation involves:1. The possession and recognition of a united vision to which the individual inthe group subordinates himself.2. The simultaneous rapport of the group members with the soul on its own level(that composite group soul which is composed of the soul of each individualmember). This leads to group integration on soul levels.3. The blended consecrated contact of the group personalities upon the threelevels of personality expression—the [85] mental, astral and etheric levels ofawareness. Some group members contact each other on one level and some onanother, but the aim should be a close contact on all three levels at will andall together when the group, as a group, demands it. This is a hard saying butlater a clearer understanding will come of what this means and what it bringsabout.4. The ability of the group to stand united and with no barriers between thegroup members of any kind. This will necessarily involve the sacrifice ofpersonality reactions, ideals and plans. At present the varying ideals,attitudes and points of view separate disciples from each other. These must go.There are, of course, other requirements but if you can understand the above andseek—to the best of your ability—to meet them, that is all that I ask atpresent. One of the great needs of all disciples and aspirants is the detachedrelinquishing of pet theories as to life, discipleship and the Plan; thepreserving of that open mind which is ever ready for the unexpected presentationand able (when the spiritual vision is strong enough) to achieve a quickreversal of all preconceived ideals. This must be done when it is deemedspiritually wise and it involves also that waiting attitude which expects thenew vision to appear, the newer truths to emerge into formulated clarity and thenew potencies to become increasingly effective. Such attitudes are peculiarlydifficult for those disciples who have the sixth Ray of Devotion and Idealismdominant in their energy equipment, for the ideals of a sixth ray aspirantcrystallise most rapidly and are quickly distorted thereby. The temporary ideal(intended to guide the undeveloped aspirant) can become a barrier, separatinghim from truth and from the realisation of a truer vision.So I would beg you, my disciples, to aim at a wide open simplicity which waitsexpectant of that new thing which is so ready today to precipitate but which isbeing hindered from so doing by the idealists of the world far more than by theman in the street. The latter is simpler in his reactions and more ready tograsp and see a way out of the immediate impasse than the mystic or theoccultist because he thinks in terms of [86] humanity. The disciples of theworld (with their nicely formulated ideals and their neatly expressed idealisticconcepts) are oft glamoured by the future beauty because they are oblivious ofthe present opportunity. Many of them will find out later that they have beenleft behind as far as registering the new truths is concerned. To this Christreferred when He said that it was not possible to put new wine into old bottlesfor that which is old will be destroyed by the expanding new life.The initiate, therefore, stands ready, for what? For the instant recognition ofwhat is new, for its immediate grasp and the treading of the new step in theunfoldment of the pioneering human consciousness, for the revelation—steadilyand constantly presented—of the new and superseding concepts. These conceptspossess a dynamic expulsive power and satisfactorily meet human need in theimmediate cycle. He is ready for the instant relinquishing of all that seemsfutile and unnecessary and inadequate to the need of the hour, and for thereception of the power from on high which breaks and destroys that which hasbecome crystallised, which has served its purpose and become old and useless; heis ready to work as a practical occultist (and not only as a mystical idealist)upon the levels of vision as well as upon the levels of practical human affairs.I would suggest that your meditation process should be divided into two parts.There should be a definitely planned individual and group meditation and also amethodical cultivation of the life of spiritual reflection. This spiritualreflection will foster the dual life—objective and subjective—of the disciplewhilst the more formal meditation would aid in the process of focussing thelight of the soul in the brain and thus lay the foundation for living,enlightened, soul service.This service is only the expression upon the physical plane of soul attitudesand activities—as the soul evidences them on its own level of consciousness. Onephase of this dual work, the reflective, works out in an increasing realisationand expression of intentional living or of “life with a purpose.” It leads to amode of living which is built upon a planned programme which approximatesitself, as far as possible, to the hierarchical Plan and to hierarchical lifeimpulses. The second phase, which is embodied in the formal meditation, is thatof a definite and [87] conscious withdrawal. If this is carried out correctlyand with deliberation, plus regularity, it will eventually bring about a mostproductive telepathic interplay between the disciples in a group and between theindividual disciple, the Master and the larger Ashram. It will also make thedisciple sensitive to the higher “gift waves.” The entire meditation (in its twoparts) involves, therefore, the linking up of heart and head, of the mystic andthe occult approach, and also of feeling and knowledge.Only from the heart centre can stream, in reality, those lines of energy whichlink and bind together. It was for this reason that I have assigned certainmeditations which stimulated the heart into action, linking the heart centre(between the shoulder blades) to the head centre, through the medium of thehigher correspondence to the heart centre, found within the head centre (thethousand petalled lotus). This heart centre, when adequately radiatory andmagnetic, relates disciples to each other and to all the world. It will alsoproduce that telepathic interplay which is so much to be desired and which is soconstructively useful to the spiritual Hierarchy—provided it is establishedwithin a group of pledged disciples, dedicated to the service of humanity. Theycan then be trusted.One of the tasks of all disciples is the evocation of the will aspect of thesoul; the will is usually quiescent in its higher aspects until a man treads thePath of Discipleship....You might ask, my brothers, of what use are these analogies and these items ofinformation? They are of little technical use to you and really increase yourresponsibility. If, however, they serve to establish a true recognition ofreality, of synthesis and of relation in the disciple’s consciousness, they arethen of real value. Those three words—reality, synthesis, relation—indicate thegoal and the problem of the disciple, plus the resultant effect of conscious,intelligent, spiritual work, motivated by love.In the New Age, as I have earlier pointed out, the keynote of the aspirant’sprogress will be love of humanity; this will indicate the awakening of the heartcentre. In the past and up until the last few years, the keynote has beenservice because (if selflessly rendered) it embodied a technique whichautomatically [88] brought the heart centre into activity. It is love ofhumanity which is the major lack in the character of many disciples today. Theylove those with whom they may be associated, or they love the work connectedwith the group endeavour, or they love their own nation; they may also love anideal or theoretical assumption, but they do not really love humanity as awhole. There are limits to their capacity to love and it is the transcending ofthose limits which constitutes their main problem at this time; they have tolearn that it is humanity which calls for their allegiance, their loyalty andservice. I would ask you all to ponder deeply on the above statements, for theyembody the task ahead for you also as you seek to fit yourselves for the firstor the second initiation.I would remind you also that the life of the disciple is ever a life of risksand of dangers, entered into willingly and deliberately in the cause ofspiritual unfoldment and the service of humanity. But I would ask each of you towatch your emotional life and reactions with greatly increased care; I would askyou to watch particularly for the least outcropping of glamour. I would callyour attention to the fact that the emergence of emotional conditions or ofglamour in your life-expression need not necessarily indicate failure. There isonly failure if there is identification with these astral conditions and asuccumbing to old rhythms. The success of the meditation work assigned andregularly followed may be proved to you by the appearance of these undesirableconditions; they must be then recognised for what they are, and evoke in youthat “divine indifference” which permits the emotion or the glamour to die ofattrition, because deprived of the “feeding-power” of the attention. The wholehistory of true emotional control is to be found in the sentence just given. Theprocess of achieving this control constitutes one of the most difficult periodsin the life of the disciple and quite one of the longest from the angle of time.For this you should be prepared. Particularly is it difficult at this time totriumph over emotion because of the intense emotional condition of the entirehuman family and the widespread fear and terror for which the energy of theBlack Lodge of Adepts is responsible. This definitely complicates your problemand that of all disciples: it tends to foster a most potent glamour. [89] So Ibeg of you to proceed with courage, joy, understanding, extreme caution and—atthe same time—with speed.I would point out also that the intention of all true disciples is to stand bytheir group brothers in love and understanding. Upon this fact you can count. Iwould also assure you that the protective love of your Master is around you andthat I shall not fail you at any time.... But, in the last analysis, the battleis yours.PART IXThe secret of all true meditation work in its earlier stages is the power tovisualise. This is the first stage to be mastered. Disciples should lay theemphasis upon this process; in it lies eventually the ability to use thecreative powers of the imagination, plus mental energy, as a measure to furtherthe ends of the Hierarchy and to carry out the Divine Plan. All the newprocesses in meditation techniques (for which the New Age may be responsible)must and will embody visualisation as a primary step for the following reasons:1. Visualisation is the initial step in the demonstration of the occult law that“energy follows thought.” This, of course, everyone interested in occult studyrecognises theoretically. One of the tasks confronting disciples is to achievefactual knowledge of this. Pictorial visualisation (which is a definite featureof the work in many esoteric schools) is simply an exercise to bring about thepower to visualise. In the work of those disciples who are being trained forinitiation, this external aspect of visualisation must give place to an interiorprocess which is the first step towards the direction of energy. The visualisingof pictures is intended to focus the aspirant within the head at a point midwaybetween the pituitary body and the pineal gland. In that area, he draws picturesand paints scenes and thus acquires facility to see—in large and in detail—thatwhich he desires and for which he intends to work. The visualising of what mightbe called “directed process” goes on in a more focussed manner and in the areadirectly around the pineal gland. The pineal [90] gland then becomes the centreof a magnetic field which is set in motion—in the first place—by the power ofvisualisation. At that point, energy is gathered by the disciple and thendirected with intention to one or other of the centres. This focussed thoughtproduces inevitable effects within the etheric body and thus two aspects of thecreative imagination are brought into play.2. The power to visualise is the form-building aspect of the creativeimagination. This process falls into three parts, corresponding somewhat to thecreative process followed by Deity Itself:a. The gathering of qualified energy within a ring-pass-not.b. The focussing of this energy under the power of intention, i.e., at a pointin the neighbourhood of the pineal gland. The energy is now focussed and notdiffused.c. The despatch of this focussed energy by means of a pictorial process (not byan act of the will at this time) in any desired direction—that is, to certaincentres in a certain order.This process of energy direction can become a spiritual habit if disciples wouldbegin to do it slowly and gradually. At first, the visualising process may seemto you to be laboured and profitless but, if you persevere, you will findeventually that it becomes effortless and effective. This is one of the mostimportant ways in which a Master works; it is essential, therefore, that youbegin to master the technique. The stages are:a. A process of energy gathering.b. A process of focalisation.c. A process of distribution or direction.The disciple learns to do this within himself and later to direct the energy(some chosen and particular kind, according to the demand of the occasion) tothat which lies without himself. This constitutes, for example, one of the majorhealing techniques of the future. It is also used by the Master in awakening Hisdisciple to certain [91] states of consciousness, but with these you have naughtto do.3. The power to visualise correctly is one definite mode of ascertaining truthor falsity. This is a statement difficult for you to comprehend. Visualisationis literally the building of a bridge between the emotional or astral plane andthe mental level and is, therefore, a personality correspondence to the buildingof the antahkarana. The astral plane, the second aspect of the personality, isthe correspondence to the form-building aspect of the Trinity, the secondaspect. The creative imagination “pictures a form” through the ability tovisualise and the thought energy of the mind gives life and direction to thisform. It embodies purpose. Thereby a rapport or line of energy is constructedbetween the mind and the astral vehicle and it becomes a triple line of energywhen the soul of the disciple is utilising this creative process in some plannedand definitely constructive manner.This visualising process and this use of the imagination form the first twosteps in the activity of thoughtform building. It is with these self-createdforms—embodying spiritual ideas and divine purpose—that the Masters work andhierarchical purpose takes shape. Therefore, my disciples, it is essential thatyou begin with deliberation and slowly to work in this manner and to use theabove information constructively and creatively. The need of the times isincreasingly great and the utmost of work and of purpose is desired.The goal of initiation is held out by the Masters to all Their disciples andThey stand ready to give the needed instruction. I would remind you at thisearly stage that only that which you know for yourself and experienceconsciously within yourself is of importance and constitutes the truth for you.That which may be told you by others, even by me , serves no vital purpose,except to enhance or corroborate an already known truth, or to create illusionsor responsibility until it is either rejected or experienced by you in your ownconsciousness. Do you understand what I mean?Initiation might be defined at this point as the moment of crisis wherein theconsciousness hovers on the very border-line [92] of revelation. The demands ofthe soul and the suggestions of the Master might be regarded as in conflict withthe demands of time and space, focussed in the personality or the lower man. Youwill have, therefore, in this situation a tremendous pull between the pairs ofopposites; the field of tension or the focus of the effort is to be found in thedisciple “standing at the midway point.” Will he respond and react consciouslyto the higher pull and pass on to new and higher areas of spiritual experience?Or will he fall back into the glamour of time and space and into the thraldom ofthe personal life? Will he stand in a static quiescent condition in whichneither the higher trend nor the lower pull will affect him? One or other ofthese three conditions must distinguish him and must succeed upon an earlier andvacillating experience wherein the disciple vibrates between the higher and thelower decisions. It is at this process, the Master presides. He is able to donothing because it is the disciple’s own problem. He can only endeavour toenhance the desire of the soul by the power of His directed thought. Thepersonality can also do nothing, for at this point both the physical body andthe astral vehicle are simply automatons, waiting responsively for the decisionof the disciple, functioning in his mental body. Only the disciple can act uponthe mental level of consciousness at this point of endeavour. Once he does so,the die is cast. He either moves forward towards the door of light where theMaster takes his hand and the Angel of the Presence becomes potent and active ina way which I may not describe to you, or he drops back temporarily into thelife condition of the lower man; glamour and maya settle down anew upon him andthe Dweller on the Threshold inserts himself between the disciple and the lightfrom the open door and renews activity. The disciple either awakens suddenly toa wider grasp of reality and a deeper understanding of the Plan and his part init, or the “veils of earth” close over his head; the vision fades and he revertsinto the life of an ordinary human being, probably for the period of theincarnation wherein the opportunity was offered to him. Should he, however, goforward through that door, then (according to the initiation which becomespossible) will be the revelation and its attendant consequences. The revelationwill not be the [93] revelation of possibilities. It is a factual experience,resulting in the evocation of new powers and capacities and the recognition ofnew modes and fields of service. These powers are conditioned by pastdevelopments and the presence of these capacities, plus a freedom of movement“within the bounds of the Hierarchy” which lie far beyond anything which he mayhave dreamed, become his. New hierarchical contacts are now possible to him; newresponsibility is laid upon his shoulders and new “fields of potency” becomeavailable for his use in world service.You have often heard that the Guru , or Teacher, in the East would teach Hisdisciple by the giving of a hint. If you have read and studied the ancientwritings of India (and who today has not read at least some of them?) you willhave noted that these hints fall into two categories:1. Hints anent personal character in relation to reality and preparation forinitiation.2. Hints anent the Oneness of Deity and man’s relation to an ascertained andgained unity.To these were later added teachings concerning the creative process when Godmade the worlds, and much concerning energy and the development of the centres(laya-yoga, as it is technically called). These four lines of teaching arepractically all that is given and all the training offered was of an exotericnature. You can see for yourselves that it was preparatory in nature and thatthe training for initiation was so deeply hidden in the emphasis laid upon therelation of Guru and disciple that it did not find expression in words and wasnot, therefore, revealed in any way. The few possible symbolic hints andmeanings have been investigated and the erudite esotericist has already drainedthese sources of information dry.What I am seeking to do is to carry the teaching another stage outward and makeexoteric what the Master taught His disciple in the ancient days when thefundamental truths anent the universal consciousness had been somewhat graspedby the disciple and the particular had been also successfully worked out in itsrightful place and manner by the disciple. The old rule ever remains anunalterable rule that all true esoteric teaching begins with the universal andends with the particular; [94] this you must ever and always bear in mind. It ismy difficult task to put into modern language and into symbolic forms thesehitherto unwritten rules. Much that has been given out since the time thatH.P.B. struggled and worked has been truth, including information anentinitiation. Much has been fanciful and grievously distorted.When a neophyte first of all applies to the Master for the training needed priorto initiation, what would you say was the Master’s problem? I am assuming thatthe Master knows His disciple well, is convinced of his sincerity and of theappropriateness of his appeal. I am also assuming that you realise that theso-called “appeal” is the quality of the life lived, the service rendered andthe presence of an illumined mind—illumined through some definite measure ofsoul contact.The Master’s problem is to teach him the stabilisation of the relation betweensoul and body so that, at will , contact can be established between them; theastral body provides no hindrance that amounts to anything, and through thatsoul contact a facile relation to the Hierarchy, its purposes and resources canbe made. Secondly, the nature of energy and its wise utilisation through themedium of an integrated personality is indicated.It is essential that one thing be grasped by all of you, prior to undertakingwork with me. It is that in a group of disciples such as this, the largemajority have already taken the first initiation and are being prepared for oneof the later initiations. There is nothing surprising in this statement or anyparticular cause for elation or for pleasure. An immense number of the worldaspirants evidence—through their aliveness to the spiritual issues, through theintensity of their aspiration and through their struggles to be good,self-sacrificing and wise—that the life of the indwelling Christ is mostdefinitely moving in them and is present in their hearts. The initiation of“spiritual fixation upon the physical plane” (as the birth at Bethlehem, thefirst initiation, is sometimes called) has already been undergone by thousands,and they are sincerely and definitely moving forward upon the Way. I wouldremind you here that many, many lives can elapse between the first initiationand the second—long, long interludes of silent and almost unapparent [95]growth. You are in no way unique or far ahead of the senior world aspirants. Inthat lies cause for encouragement and humility. It is naturally not my intentionto state who is being prepared for any particular initiation. That is a matterfor each of you to discover for himself. It is a matter of interior orientationand not a matter of outside information.One point anent the taking of the first three major initiations, I would like torefer to at this point. It is that they have always to be taken when in aphysical body and upon the physical plane, thus demonstrating initiateconsciousness through both mind and brain. This is a point not oft emphasisedand sometimes contradicted.I would like also to point out with all the clarity and power at my disposal,the very deep necessity for humility and its constantly recurring expression. Irefer not to an inferiority complex but to that adjusted sense of rightproportion which equips its possessor with a balanced point of view as tohimself, his responsibilities and his life work. This, when present, will enablehim to view himself dispassionately and his presented opportunities with equaldispassion. Undoubtedly all disciples, you among them, have speculated upon yourstatus and standing upon the Path and upon the status of your co-disciples. Thatis, after all, both natural and human. Some of you are too humble in thepersonal sense and not in the sense of true humility. By that I mean that youare so afraid of pride and bombast and an over-estimation of your capacitiesthat you are untrue to the realities and belittle the power of your souls.R.S.U. is a case in point and needs to walk humbly in the spiritual life whichinvolves a correct recognition of place and opportunity and not this constantemphasis upon her inability to measure up. She owes it to my group of disciplesand to me to see herself as she truly is—a disciple in preparation for a certaininitiation and with much wisdom at her disposal. W.D.S. suffers from aninferiority complex which drives him to an exterior enforcement of hispersonality upon others and expresses itself in a subtle, spiritual jealousy ofthose who impress themselves upon his consciousness as his spiritual superiors.He needs to accept himself as he is, to be glad that there are those whoguarantee to him the possibility of future [96] unfoldment, because they havealready achieved more than he has, and then to forget about himself as heaccepts discipleship and finds himself so busy in true service that he has notime for ceaseless comparisons with others.True humility is based on fact, on vision and on time pressures. Here I give youa hint and would ask you to think deeply on these three foundations of a majorpersonality attitude which must be held and demonstrated before each initiation.I would remind you that there must always be humility in the presence of truevision.This experiment which I am undertaking has its dangers. The disciples in aMaster’s Ashram upon the inner planes know somewhat the status of theirco-disciples, but they do not always carry this knowledge through into the brainconsciousness. This is very largely a protective factor because they could notbe trusted to handle the knowledge correctly upon the physical plane. They mightbe super-critical of a fellow disciple who was, temporarily, not living up tohis initiation objective; they might be subtly jealous or undulyself-depreciative; they might treat the disciple who is ahead of them upon thePath of Initiation as someone superior and set apart and thereby complicate hisproblem and his effort; they might lose a sense of proportion as to initiationitself, as to its processes and its states, and this through too close anapproach to, or a misunderstanding of, another struggling initiate-disciple. Thepitfalls are many and I tell you to beware. Attend to your own life and your ownbusiness . Speculate not as to the status of the other disciples in my group whoare your close cooperators and co-sharers in my experiment. Cultivate thehumility which is based on understanding and vision and so serve the world, yourfellow disciples and serve me also—as the major point of your contact with theHierarchy.I have often pointed out that a disciple is known by his influence upon hisenvironment, and an initiate by the wide scope of his world service. How does ithappen then that a few of you (not all) are not distinguished by such serviceand are of relatively small importance in world affairs? Several things couldexplain this. First of all, a disciple may be called to work off certain karmicrelationships, to fulfil certain obligations [97] of very ancient origin andthus “clear the decks” for more complete and uninterrupted service to humanityat a later date. This occurs quite frequently between the first and secondinitiations. Sometimes a disciple may be doing effective service upon the innerplanes and on a large scale and yet there may be no evidence of this upon thephysical plane, except in the beauty of a life lived. Others may be learningcertain techniques of psychological relationships and of energy distribution andmay have dedicated some particular life to the acquiring of these esotericsciences. One life is but a short moment in the long cycle of the soul. The truedisciple will never fall back on the reasons given above as alibis for lack ofeffort. I would remind you that world influence alone does not always implydiscipleship. There are many groups—well known and magnetic—which have at theircentre some dominant personality who is not necessarily a disciple.In connection with this group of my disciples and with this experiment which Iam undertaking, you need to arrive at a point in group experience wherein youare not so intensely preoccupied with your own development, status and service;you all need to learn to decentralise yourselves so that the work to be donebecomes the factor of main importance. When this is the case, then the intenseself-interest with some aspect of the personality expression, some weakness ofcharacter, some dear objective, or some physical condition will cease. You willfind the cultivation of a “divine indifference” (as I have told you severaltimes) of great assistance in forgetting the little self; this frequently loomsso large (from habit) that it shuts out the higher self; it comes between thedisciple and the Master and prevents contact with his co-disciples, thusnegating effective service.There is one more point which I would like to take up with you so that there maybe complete understanding. There come periods in the life of the disciple whenthere appears to be no contact with the Master and as if all relationship hadbeen, at least, temporarily severed. Where accepted disciples are concerned, Iwould like to emphasise that any such severance is not possible. Occultly, itcannot happen and the Master’s love for the disciple makes it again impossible.There is only one condition [98] which can result in severance and that isdeliberate and conscious effort by the disciple, carried over a very long periodof time, to bring it about. A Master does not lightly admit a disciple to Hisgroup and once having done so, the situation is irrevocable from the standpointof the Master. Any delay in progress and any final severance comes entirely fromthe pupil. There may be a temporary suspension of communication and this maylast throughout one life; that, however, is not long from the angle of the soul;it is but a flash of small moment and significance in the long career of thesoul. It looms as large and important in the personality life but may signifyonly the grasping of opportunity in the eternal now of the soul.I have, therefore, been near you and watched at intervals the tide of life rollover you; I have noted your progress and your delay. I have watched you succeedand I have seen you fail. This I do through noting the pulsation of yourlight—not in watching the detail of your daily living. That is not warranted inthis time of crisis, and owing to the evolutionary development of disciples willnever again be warranted. You are still within my group aura, within my Ashram.Your position there is determined by yourself and not by me. There exists attimes something which resembles a pulsation in the relation between teacher andpupil—a withdrawing and a coming forward where the probationary disciple isconcerned and a standing with steadfastness and expectancy on the part of theteacher. When the fluctuations of contact are ended and the pupil is stabilisedand becomes a “steadily approaching point of energy,” then he becomes anaccepted disciple. Some in my group of disciples are stabilising; some areretreating; some few are approaching and I watch with interest the waxing andthe waning of their light.The mobilisation of every disciple is demanded at this time and when I say “thistime” I refer to the present time and the next fifty years. This mobilisationinvolves the focussing of the disciple’s energies, his time and his resources onbehalf of humanity; it requires a new dedication to service, a consecration ofthe thought-life (do you realise what that would mean, my brothers?) and aforgetfulness of self which would rule out all moods and feelings, allpersonality desires, resentments, grievances [99] and all pettiness in yourrelations with your fellowmen. On the physical plane, it would mean theconditioning of all active, outer living so that the whole of life becomes onefocussed active service. I would ask you to study the above phrasing, using itas a light of revelation so that you may know wherein you are lacking and whatyou have to do.I have given you in the past a very great deal of instruction, help andencouragement. That you still have and it would profit you much if you spentsome time in recalling it. But today make a new beginning—not for your own sake,but for the helping of a needy world. Forget yourselves.The pressure of the work upon me has been very heavy lately. Much work hasrested upon my shoulders, incident to the world situation. This has involvedmuch effort on the part of the Hierarchy to prevent a complete collapse of thestructure of human civilisation, as it exists at this time. The soundfoundations of part of the structure must be saved; all else may have to go.Many things contribute to the inertia that today seems to afflict many of thedisciples of the world who should be active in service and helpfulness. Thisapplies also to you. The pressure of war conditions and concern over your ownpersonal affairs, attitudes and reactions have crowded much that I might say andhave said out of your minds. One of the first lessons which those in trainingfor initiation have to master is that difficult dual attitude which permitsright personality activity and real interest in personality affairs and yet atthe same time permits nothing personal to interfere with the subjectivespiritual life, with service and with the training, given in preparation forinitiation. As time goes on, I shall try to bridge between the old techniquesand the newer modes of training by using a part of the ancient techniques—nowbecoming somewhat obsolete—and the giving of those hints which will lead you tounderstand the nature, purpose and methods of educating accepted disciples inthe processes of initiation.Above all, I would say: Seek to recover the fervour of your earlier, spiritualaspiration and self-discipline. If you have never lost it (though many discipleshave) seek to force that energy of inspiration to work out in an effectivedisplay of [100] definite action upon the physical plane. How, you ask, mybrothers? By increasing the radiance of your light in the world through love andmeditation, so that others may turn to you as to a beacon light in the darknight of life which seems in this century to have descended upon humanity; seekto love more than you have ever believed was possible, so that others—frozen andchilled by life circumstance and the present horror of human existence—may turnto you for warmth and comforting. What I and all who are affiliated with theHierarchy seek to do at this time of desperate crisis is to find those who aredependable points of living energy and through them pour out the love, thestrength and the light which the world needs and must have if this storm is tobe weathered. I ask you to render this service to me and to humanity. I asknothing spectacular; it will, however, require a strenuous effort of your soulsif you are to respond adequately; I ask nothing impossible; I would remind youthat the apathy of the physical body and brain, the inertia of the feelingnature and the sense of futility of the mind when confronted with large issueswill seem to hinder you.Again I point the Way to you and again I wait. Will you intensify your innerlife and achieve the power which will enable you to live simultaneously as anefficient human being and a living, loving soul? It is the establishing of thecontinuity of this dual process which is your main need at this time; it willlead to fusion, personality coordination and a greatly increased efficiency.Many disciples are not young and the settled habit of thought and of the feelinglife is not easy to disrupt. They must , however, be disrupted and you must feelno resentment. The rhythms of the personality are stabilised and constitute yourline of least resistance. You must cut athwart these, thus forming the cross oflife and existence will then take on added difficulty. The results will be newrhythms of beauty.To those who are standing in the blaze of pain (and their numbers are Legion),of agony, anxiety and distress—seeing it on every hand and attempting to standsteady in the midst of it all—I say: That which appears is not always that whichtruly is; that which rends and disrupts the personality life is frequently theagent of release, if rightly apprehended; that which will emerge when the Forcesof Light have penetrated the world darkness will demonstrate the nature of theundying human [101] spirit. To all of you I say: My love surrounds you and theaura of the Ashram of which I am the centre stands like a great defending wallaround you and around all who are battling for the right. See that you battle.You can then, if you will, sense this loving protection. Each day, if you will,you can put yourself en rapport with your Master. We are not blind or uncaring.We know, however, that there are worse evils than death and pain. We know thatthis is the hour of humanity’s greatest opportunity and that if men can passtriumphantly through this and (by the strength of their own souls) surmount thisvery present evil, then the evolution of humanity will be hastened beyond allthat was believed possible. It will constitute a release, self-achieved andself-initiated. This means as much in the life of mankind as it means in thelife of the individual disciple. That chance and that opportunity must not betaken from man; the gained spiritual and eternal values are of far greaterimportance than his temporary agony.Little as you may realise it as you think of Us in Our so-called safe retreats,the capacity of identification with all that is involved in world pain today andthe sensitivity of Those connected with the Hierarchy to the unhappy conditionof humanity makes Their task of standing-by one of supreme spiritual agony. Theyunderstand the depths of the reaction of humanity; they comprehend andunderstand, for They are one with all men. This involves a far greatercomprehension than you can grasp and one which can only be adequately expressedin the word “identification.” They need the staunch support of all Theirdisciples, the steadfast love, the loyal attitude, the unquestioning response tohuman need which will enable Them to carry more easily the heavy burden whichhuman karma has laid upon Them and which They carry voluntarily.Will you give this? Will you aid Our work in every possible way, both aspersonalities, dedicated to service, and as souls who walk the lighted Way? Theneed of humanity for love and light, the need of the Hierarchy for channels andfor those who will work under direction upon the earth can call forth all thatyou have to give and can evoke your soul (the only true reward that the discipleseeks) in power and love. This will happen to you, if you will forget the littleself.[102] That your knowledge may be transmuted into wisdom and the eye of visioncontrol your living processes and all your undertakings is the desire (deepwithin my heart) for each and all of you.Your Master, Friend and Teacher,THE TIBETAN"},{"pageContent":"SECTION TWO — PERSONAL INSTRUCTIONS TO DISCIPLESTO B. S. D.November 1931BROTHER OF MINE:[105] I would say to you the following words: Waste not time in the realisationof the years spent in occult work, nor in feverish anticipation of a few moreyears of directed occult effort under my tuition. The time equation has countedmayhap too largely in your thoughts, my brother, and in the work of the presentmoment must the future possible developments be forgotten. For you should comethe forgetting of the form side in meditation, for your intuition needsawakening. Working without attachment to results is a hard lesson for alldisciples to learn but one well worth while. My special instructions for you,therefore, may cause you temporary surprise but later you will see the reason.They are as follows:First, drop all form out of your meditation work and sit in perfect silence withyour attention focussed upon the Lord of Love—which is the soul. Steady yourthought processes (which for you is not hard) and then drop the use of the seedthought. Listen and aspire. Close each meditation by pouring out love to allbeings. This outflowing thought is a great releaser and each of you in the groupof disciples whom I am seeking to train needs release from something. For you,it is release from form in your work of service. You will know to what I amreferring.Secondly, until the time of the Full Moon of May, cease from all breathingexercises. You have followed them for years and need a respite. Nature grows andprogresses through cyclic activity and cyclic rest, and, before I can carry youforward to the next unfoldment, I seek to have you rest from mental pressure ande’en from that devotion which has governed much of your life experience. TillMay, centre your thought, your meditation [106] and your service on being andsee if the reward is not great. Question not this suggestion but—in the thoughtof being —find your way into the centre of life from which all occult work isdone. To be enjoined to be is an honour, brother of mine; it will carry you atthis time further than intellection, pranayama, and that potent longing forspiritual fulfilment which is your outstanding divine quality and in some waysyour main hindrance. I am here for a cycle to teach you to the best of myability and I prepare those who respond for the service of the next life cycle.Ask of me, therefore, questions if you understand not the above injunctions andI will answer. You will find this line of more quiescent activity hard at first,for well-organised is your mind and life but, until May, simply live and standin spiritual Being and love all beings. Later I will outline for you thattraining and that breathing exercise which seems to me to be for you the way.Understand that an interlude is being given to you wherein you cease from theactive exercises of more than thirty years of aspiration and endeavour, so thata calmness of rhythm may be achieved. Later, upon that accumulated knowledge ofyears, a fresh structure of knowledge may be erected and a new and higher rhythmbe imposed. The brain cells need rest, for a certain amount of mental fatigueexists.~June 1933You have acceded to my request, my brother, and I believe see now the reason formy method of training you. The love aspect of your soul has been releasedsomewhat, though some of the inner fret for the outward achievement stillremains and hinders you on the way of realisation. One thing I would remind youand this perhaps will answer some of your questions. I view the achievement ofmy group of disciples from the point of the average of the group effect and notso much from the success or the non-success of its units. That result andsuccess must, also, demonstrate sequentially as it comes into manifestation. Thefirst sphere of focus was on mental levels. There you are unable to judge foryourself of its success or non-success, for you have not, as yet, developedmental vision. I tell you that the group already exists as a working factor onthose levels and that [107] perhaps is much. Its note is sounding and itsinfluence is being organised. It will in the next few years organise itself alsoon astral levels, on the emotional plane, and you must bear in mind that hereall forms are in danger of succumbing to the Great Illusion. These years will,therefore, be critical in the group life and this must be borne carefully inmind. No one in the group must permit himself to be glamoured.All this you are sensing, my brother, and this should indicate to you yourprogress in subjective sensitivity. Later, a group relationship will beestablished and a group accomplishment stabilised which will warrant attentionfrom the world of men. Waste not time in anxiety as to the phenomenalachievement. That must inevitably come if the fiery aspiration of each of youand the power to persist is steadfastly nurtured.You can now resume more active meditation and a breathing exercise which I willgive to you. In your meditation seek to keep the whole process in the head andremember that for you the problem is to become an “extrovert of the heart type”instead of being, as you are, an “introvert of the head type.” Therefore, foryou the way of release is the way of Love and the note of love should colour allyour meditation. Proceed therefore carefully to follow all instructions,remembering that, for you, I seek to avoid all emphasis on the form side. Thesubject of your meditation could be summed up in the following phrases:“I pledge myself to the Path of Love. I demand of my soul that I, the Spirit inform, shall act as a channel for compassion and an instrument for love until Iknow myself to be Love itself. I am that Love. With pure intent I serve. Thislove and zeal in me must feed the aspiration of my fellowmen. To this—inknowledge full—I pledge myself.”Your gift to this group of co-disciples is that fiery, dynamic, zealousaspiration which is the spiritual quality of the sixth ray, which governs yourpersonality.~BROTHER OF MINE: June 1934It is a year since I gave you any definite instructions and the time has nowcome when certain changes can be made. The [108] progress towards heartdevelopment has proceeded well and the heart centre is more alive thanheretofore. You are awakening to the consciousness of your brothers’ reactionsand can more readily identify yourself with them. Do you not see, my brother,how earlier you lived so much in the consciousness which is focussed in the mindthat your brother’s problems were to you more important than he himself? Do younot now realise that your mental ability to grasp his situation interested youmore than his troubled soul? Do you not also realise that your deep desire tofind the Master and to have with Him a definite contact has its basis in anintellectual doubt? The satisfaction of your mental longing to verify theexistence of the Masters and to ascertain your own position upon the ladder ofevolution was—in those days—stronger than your love of humanity and of service.This condition is now largely remedied and any thinking along the old lines ismore in the nature of a relapse of thought than a step backward on the path ofprogress.All growth is cyclic and one progresses from step to step in spiral fashion andthis ever involves a retracing (apparently) of one’s steps. This is, however, anillusion.I wish today to give you a breathing exercise which will blend and fuse theenergies of the centres above the diaphragm. No thought of the centres below thediaphragm need enter your mind. In order, brother of old, that I may know thatyou understand this work and in order that your brothers in my group may profitfrom your experience, I would ask you to write a paper upon this triplebreathing exercise.... I wish you to explain the purpose and the intent of thisexercise and note its effect upon the animation of your vital and psychicbodies....~MY ACCEPTED BROTHER: January 1935I would have you note my form of address. I can now use it, because you yourselfhave reached a point—long desired in your experience—wherein you now knowyourself to be on the Path of Accepted Discipleship. I could not earlier callyou this as the outer recognition of the inner status (as well as of inner [109]states of consciousness which is another name for the same thing) must come everfrom within the disciple’s own nature; we, the teachers, are only permitted toput the seal of recognition upon the fact afterwards. You have for years workedactively upon the mental plane both with and in yourself and also with the manywhose lives you are allowed to touch and whose guide upon the probationary pathyou are. Yet always there has been an ache and a longing for a more emotionaland sensitive contact and for an increased heart activity. This you are nowacquiring and as a result of the past two years’ work (for you only began toshift your focus at the close of 1932), you have begun to link up head andheart. When this is done through the activity of the will and when it expressesitself practically in service, then a man passes on to the Path of Discipleship.He can then find his way also into the group of one of the Great Ones, providedthere is a vacancy. This has happened in your case and this you also know foryourself, and hence I can hail you as my accepted brother.I seek to make a change in your breathing exercise and also in your meditationwork and I would ask you in connection with both these to keep a register ofresults and, at the close of six months, note the general average of theresults, any phenomenal effects and any growth in consciousness which you feelcan be definitely traced to these exercises. These effects should be looked for,in your case, in the psychic consciousness. It is in this department of yourbeing that there is a measure of arrested growth. The mental tension for thirtyyears has been such that the free play of the psychic forces has been inhibited.You are of an age and a mental stability that will make it safe and beneficialif you seek—under my supervision—for a measure of psychic unfoldment. But alongthat line we will proceed slowly, my brother; for the next six months we willsimply follow the method of a general psychic “washing” or purging by the meansof the seven dynamic or electric breaths (anent which I will instruct you) sentforth by an act of the will. These will sweep through your whole being andproduce a general stimulation that will eventuate in a more general sensitivity.Note, therefore, your response to that inner consciousness [110] and, during thecoming half year, keep a most careful spiritual diary, noting every psychichappening, recording each time you may tune in telepathically on the need orwith the thought of those around you, putting down every seeming extension ofthe ordinary sense consciousness and writing down even those things which seemto you speculative and of no real moment. Discriminative recognition is for youthe immediate goal. Reveal yourself to yourself on paper, not as regards yourlongings and aspirations but as regards your growth in sensitivity. Attempt totune in more consciously with the consciousness of your group brothers. Yourdiary will interest others and be the guarantee to you of your own development.You have made real progress, brother of mine, but have only, however, brokenground. For the remainder of your life prepare for the future. Work at thedevelopment of a greater psychic response to life itself and to that innerawareness which will make you react to need from the angle of a rounded outequipment; it will be of a psychical nature which can identify itself with thereactions of others and a mental stability which will enable you to work as asoul. Thus you will learn to avail yourself of the knowledge, gainedpsychically, and to serve with increased effectiveness.Later, I will (if you progress in sensitivity) train you in the art ofpsychometry, but the time is not yet.That the light of your soul and the light emanating from the Master’s group mayflood your heart and energise your life is the thought which lies in my heartfor you.~BROTHER OF OLD: June 1935I seek today to make a somewhat careful analysis of the condition of yourpsychic centres—from the solar plexus upwards. You are passing through a dualprocess of psychic detachment and, at the same time, of psychic unfoldment. Youneed to remember that the phases of detachment are many and varied. Some of themimply a detachment from the world of outer sensuous attachment or they may imply(as in your own case) a temporary and relative detachment from the world ofintellectual contacts. This is a detachment based on an inner [111] attitude andnot on any outer condition or state of affairs. This is taking place in order toround out and enrich your psychic and emotional life. There is a real danger tothe earnest student in the widespread attitude of mind which regards the worldof the emotions and of sensitive response to subtle psychic phenomena asnecessarily retrogressive in effect. It can (and often does) mark a pathwayfraught with psychic disaster. At the same time, it can indicate a newlyawakening response and sensitive awareness to other aspects of the divine lifewhich are—in their place and rightful use—as divine and as needed and asexpressive of divinity as any of the aspirational objectives of the devotee.The psychic life of a disciple is a definite part of his spiritual expression.It is only when it is uncontrolled, over-emphasised and overestimated that it isundesirable. It is a hindrance when it is misused or regarded as a substitutefor other forms of divine expression. Then it produces that which is undesirableand immerses the disciple in the world of glamour and illusion. The psychicpowers are valuable aids to service when rightly developed and sanely used; theycan be unfolded safely by the man who is mentally polarised and rightly orientedtowards service.You are no doubt surprised that you are the first that I have chosen out of thisparticular group of disciples to be prepared for psychic work. My reason is thatunder your outer reserve and your strong mental polarisation there exists apowerful psychic body at a relatively high state of development. This you havenever used in this life but it was brought to its present stage of unfoldment inearlier lives. So strong have been your psychic tendencies that your soul chosein this life to balance and round out your personality by placing the emphasisupon the mind aspect. It was, however, your past psychic links which led youinto the organisation whose work you have aided for some years—an organisationwhose work is predominantly carried out on psychic and astral levels. Thisshould be proof to you of the accuracy of my diagnosis.Psychic unfoldment, when not originating in the solar plexus must be broughtabout by right control of the ajna, throat, heart and solar plexus centres bythe spiritual man, [112] seated in the head. The ajna centre is, in your case,very little awakened. It is quiescent and revolving slowly. The pituitary bodyis, therefore, somewhat subnormal. The solar plexus centre is awakened but youhave paid little attention to it as a means of contact and only during the pasttwo years have you begun to bring it into submission to the head centre and thisthrough the cultivation of compassion. The throat centre is lethargic in itsmovement but could be easily aroused into activity and the heart centre israpidly awakening. Therefore, brother of old, we have the following situation toconsider; this I will try to picture to you in a tabulation:The Head Centre . . . . . . . . .40% awakenedThe Ajna Centre . . . . . . . . .15% awakenedThe Throat Centre . . . . . . . .60% awakenedThe Heart Centre . . . . . . . . .50% awakenedThe Solar Plexus Centre . . . 75% awakenedYou see, therefore, that for the present the ajna centre is the one which shouldreceive immediate attention. Our problem is to awaken it and set its two majoractivities into motion. These are, in your case:1. Its power to project thoughtforms.2. Its capacity to act as an organ of clairvoyance.I will ask you to do the following breathing exercise every day prior to doingyour meditation work.... You can do this exercise twice a day but no morebecause it is very powerful. It will soon bring into greater vibratory activitythe quiescent ajna centre. Should headache or tension supervene, stop the workfor a day or two and then resume. Preserve ever the attitude of the onlooker andwatch not for results. They will be there but at first only I will be in aposition to note them.My brother, the next two years hold in them for you much of inner testing andthe achievement of the subtle sensitivity to the voice of the Teacher which willenable you to work with greater ease on the subjective side of life. I haveproved your sincerity of purpose and for many years you have diligently set yourface towards the light. But, brother of old, you have walked the Path withrigidity and not with that supple ease [113] which negates fatigue and which isthe hallmark of the trained athlete—for that is what the disciple should be. Youhave seen the need to serve and have realised the field of service which is foryou the rightful place of effort, but you have rendered that service in set andcrystallised fashion and have been too often unduly objective and notsufficiently moved by opportunity. You have served from a rigid sense of dutybut you must now learn to serve with the loving spontaneity which carries allbefore it. The fluidity of the true disciple must be your goal and thatout-going spirit which produces the magnetic server. Your magnetism and yourradiation need enhancing; that will take place as you transit out of the effortto unfold and to manifest divinity into that more advanced condition which isexpressed by the words to “stand in spiritual Being.” There may also come intoyour life (as it does into the life of all true servers) an interlude or cycleof experience which may temporarily negate your present cycle of influence butthis should only be preparatory to a greater power in service.As to your meditation, my brother, after you have finished the breathingexercise, proceed then to meditation, beginning your work at as high a point aspossible. Choose for yourself a seed thought each month, keeping a record ofthose chosen.... Think deeply upon the embodied idea and carry your thoughtsforward and onward and upward (choose whichever word conveys to you the deepestmeaning) until you reach as abstract a point as you can achieve. When you can gono further and have entered the world of abstraction, then stay poised inthought and hold the mind steady in the light for as long a period as you can.Watch your thought processes as you do this and note anything new or especiallyintuitive which you may register during this time of waiting. Keep a strictrecord of the ideas which may come into your mind and note them down each dayfor your spiritual diary.In closing this instruction, brother of mine, will you remember that the lonelyway is also the lighted way. Loneliness is an illusion which seeks to thwart theefforts of the server; it is a glamour which can seriously impair true vision.That you may walk the Way in peace and light and that power in service may beyours is the desire of my heart for you.~[114] January 1936I do not seek to change your work for the next six months, my fellow-disciple. Ioutlined to you in June 1935 a full quota of meditation work. Your growth inunderstanding has been real, though the ajna centre has yet resisted effort. Themain result has been an intensification of the heart centre’s activity, but thiswill eventually have a reflex action upon the ajna centre. Any of the centreswhich have allied closely with them certain of the major ductless glands and atthe same time have no large organ (such as the heart or stomach) connected withthem develop more slowly and are more carefully protected in the process thanare the centres with a major physiological organ closely connected with them.For instance, the thymus gland is connected with the heart centre and thepancreas with the solar plexus centre. At the same time, the energy pouringthrough those centres can be deflected into certain large physicalorganisms—such as the heart and the stomach. These centres, therefore, whenbeing developed or stimulated, carry far less physiological danger than thosewhich are not so related. The ajna centre is related to the pituitary body butthere is no large physical organism to carry off the energy contacted; theetheric web is, therefore, in this locality specially reinforced and theactivity of the centre more slowly generated. This is interesting andreassuring. It is in hints such as the above that the real teaching is given.So, my brother, go forward along the same lines, earlier indicated, until I giveyou your next instruction; study with care the hints given to you and to yourco-disciples.~June 1936There are two thoughts in my heart in connection with you, my brother, and twopractical matters which I have in my mind to say to you. I would have you notethe careful wording of the above phrase because it has teaching value in it forall of you.Before I tell you what these two thoughts are, I want to give you a word ofcommendation, knowing that you desire it [115] not and knowing also that you domost certainly seek always to act under the urge and the inspiration of your ownsoul. You work and conform to the requirements, not from any specific idea ofpleasing me or even of producing further integration of yourself into the groupof your co-disciples but from a sense of duty and of rightness of activity.Nevertheless, I seek to commend you for your quality of steadfastness—asteadfastness in which you persist in the face of much psychic disappointment,if I may call it so, and the fact that there appears to be little phenomenalresponse to your constant effort. You seek to keep your eyes off yourself andsimply to do that which must be done and which you have been induced to believeis the way for you—as well as for all true disciples.Years ago, my brother, you sought more eagerly for the good results of youractivity. Now you are just as active but you are willing to leave the resultsunconsidered. This is well and very good. However, I tell you that there areresults and perhaps they can begin to be clarified in your mind. Two results Ican myself indicate to you and I choose these two with deliberation because theyare related to me and to your work with me, your teacher and your friend. First,I have accepted you into my own group in the technical sense and you are now anaccepted disciple (chela) in my group.... Secondly, I have told you and yourbrothers that I am in process of preparing you for initiation.I am reminding you of these two facts for the following reason: You must enterupon the next cycle of activity with set purpose, clear vision and unswervingattention to facts. You have ended one cycle of effort last month at the time ofthe Full Moon of May. You are entering now upon another cycle. I would have youkeep this steadfastly in mind and go forward to freer service, greaterunderstanding and clearer insight. You have laid a firm foundation.The two thoughts which come into my heart to tell you can be summarised asfollows. Note that these thoughts come from my heart and the suggestion from mymind. Herein lies a hint as to your work in the future for those who look to youfor assistance in their spiritual life.1. You need to work now more definitely and more confidently as an accepteddisciple. What do I mean by that statement? [116] I mean that you should work inthe realisation that—because of this definite acceptance—you are linked with theHierarchy of Masters and, therefore, the quality of the hierarchical service tohumanity must also be expressed by and through you. What is this quality?Wisdom, expressing itself intelligently through love. Upon this statement youshould ponder. Your service is ever intelligent (highly so) for you have muchknowledge as the result of ancient experience and deep thought and study in thislife. That knowledge must, however, be translated into wisdom through thedynamic power of a living love. I use no further terms to express this idea.That sentence should provide you with much food for thought.2. The second thought which comes to you from my heart is to urge you toremember that chelaship (discipleship) involves responsibility, and that in itsturn is developed through suffering. This leads inevitably to detachment . Thatprocess of detachment will go forward in connection with all in the group andmust entail difficulty. This difficulty may involve a constant stream of minorproblems and detachments which will colour ceaselessly your life of service,your life in the home, and your contacts in the world. This calls perhaps for ahigher quality of faith and of courage than do drastic purgings. But I have nofears for you, my brother on the Path. You have a faith of tempered steel whichcannot break. Remember, however, that where the tide of love is thwarted, theremight happen a temporary warping of your nature. You will understand whereof Ispeak and this sentence conveys to you a needed hint. Let love pour through youand all is well.The suggestions which I seek to make are based upon past instructions. SinceJune, 1935, we have set ourselves one technical achievement and one that stillremains unachieved for the majority of advanced humanity. This is the awakeningof the ajna centre. Your major need and the thing which would arouse that centreto usefulness lies—for you—in the power to visualise.The second thing which will integrate your nature and increase your magnetic andspiritual usefulness lies in the unfoldment of the creative imagination. Howshall this be done? The two are closely allied. Visualisation and the creativeimagination [117] are related. A great deal of your problem in this life (whereyour esoteric unfoldment is concerned) will be solved when these two are betterunderstood by you and when the play of these two forces produces in you an innerre-adjustment, a re-alignment and an externalisation of your subjective life.Will you think deeply upon this matter, my brother?‘BROTHER OF MINE: January 1937I am glad that you regard yourself as sensitive to my vibration, for so you are.But not as often as you think. It is so easy for aspirants to confound thesecond ray vibration—as it expresses itself through a second ray group such asmy group of disciples—with my individual vibration. Disciples need to trainthemselves to distinguish:1. The vibration of the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.2. The vibration of the Master M. or the Master K.H. should They happen to usethe ray vibration for purposes of stimulating a group.3. My vibration, which is naturally strongly coloured by the second ray.4. The vibration of a second ray group which is an aggregate of all the notesand tones of the disciples in the group.5. The vibration of advanced second ray disciples. This can at times be confusedwith mine.6. The vibration of sixth ray groups which respond to a second ray vibration.Their work lies predominantly on the astral plane and is contacted relativelyeasily.A consideration of the above may indicate to you something of value. Curiouslyenough you and your fellow-disciple B.S.W. represent the two extreme poles inthis process of theoretical recognition. You both recognise a certain contactyet, practically, B.S.W. is more sensitive to my vibration than you are; heloses much, however, by an imposed impersonality to it; you lose much by beingtoo sure at times.[118] In connection with this matter of sensing vibration, it is of value toremember that all sensing is naturally and normally an astral or an emotionalreaction. In considering my group, I am impressed (yes, and somewhat amused) bythe effort of some of you—and of you, in particular—to repudiate emotional orastral sensitivity. Some of you admit it but regard it as undesirable; othersconsider it as something to be inhibited or to be unexpressed and ignored. Fewof you, if any, look upon the astral body as a divine expression of reality withits definite and specific uses.These questions which I have imposed upon your minds are in the nature of whatmight be called “catch” questions. The astral body is—in its time and place—ofas real value, purpose and usefulness as the mind. It serves to relate thehigher impression to the lower and you cannot record my vibration in thephysical brain consciousness except through its mediation. You can be aware ofmy vibration upon the plane of the soul and your mind consciousness can beimpressed by it. Unless, however, the sensory body, the emotional vehicle, isalso active in the right sense (negative to the world of the senses andreceptive to mental impression) that impression will not be registered in thebrain or waking consciousness.Much that you say in your communications in the form of written papers upon thissubject deals with the effect that your work and life has upon others throughyour manipulation of the forces with which disciples have to learn to work, andwhich are productive of real benefit to others as they study them and watch thereactions called forth. It is of value, however, to note the differing type ofreactions evoked when:1. You work with those subordinate to you upon the Path, those who are theaverage people or the probationers who are treading the Path for the first time.With this type of person you have much to do. Is their effect upon you of themost desirable kind?2. Your inter-relation with those who are your equals upon the Path and thosewhose vibration occultly “neutralises” yours, or “parallels in intensity” yoursand consequently evokes from you (as evidence from them of status) no [119]reaction practically, except a sense of well-being or comradeship.3. Your recognition of those ahead of you upon the Path who can—if they sochoose—call forth from you or evince in you a powerful response.We are beginning to deal with the more occult subtleties in our work and forthese you must be prepared. Your papers and replies to the questions given toyou deal primarily with your work in connection with your spiritual inferiors.How about your spiritual equals and superiors? Reread your questions and repliesin this light and see what response is then evoked in you. The initiate of thefifth degree in Atlantean times had to evidence the right use of emotion . InAryan times, the initiate of the second degree has to evidence this. Are you, mybrother, prepared to say that this evidence can be produced?You entered this group work as the result of serious and earnest seeking,ancient karmic ties, much questioning which wrested response from your soul andthe earned right of a pledged server who had worked steadfastly alone for manyyears. You brought to this group activity certain assets of a pronounced natureand certain liabilities, equally pronounced—as have all the group members. Mytask is to use the assets in the group and to aid you in relinquishing theliabilities.... I would ask you, therefore, to ponder on this matter, standingas the soul upon the narrow razor-edged path between the pairs of opposites—yourassets and your liabilities—viewing them with complete detachment. The occultsentences in which I would like to state your problem and its solution are asfollows:“The magnet swings, and swinging, fails to touch the pleading hands, held forthfor help. It swings in heaven high, held by the soul—serene and unafraid—whosewill is firm, whose eyes are clear, whose heart is slowly opening to a distantsound—a sound of pain and sorrow, of weakness and distress.“The magnet drops into the mass of clutching hands. It disappears from view.Disturbance then occurs. The soul, [120] whose eyes serene have looked upon thefar horizons of the world, withdraws its gaze. Both eyes are focussed on thetumultuous group of seekers after truth. The soul searches for the magnet andsees it not, for it is hidden in the forms of many men. The soul descends andwalks the way of earth and not the ways of mind. The far horizon disappears. Thevision just before the eyes succeeds; the immediate takes the place of thatwhich has been distant. And in that place immediate, the magnet reappears.”~MY BROTHER: July 1937The mental body in your case is governed by fifth ray energy. This is apronounced condition and constitutes much of your life difficulty. It is, in thecase of all aspirants thus conditioned mentally, the paramount cause of theirnon-magnetic behaviour, using that word in its psychological implications. Iwould remind you that being non -magnetic at your stage of development meansthat (even though you may have some measure of soul contact) you cannot radiatethat soul life to others as you would like to do, for your dominant fifth raymental body (the Ray of Concrete Science, as you know) is insulated, isolatedand has a natural tendency to that discrimination which leads to separativeness.The reverse effect is also true. The radiation of others can be also shut offand hence your inability to register telepathic impressions. The value of afifth ray mind is however very great, for it means a keen and useful mind and(ponder on this) an open door to inspiration.The astral or emotional body is conditioned by the sixth ray of devotion or ofidealism, but this can be most easily transferred and transformed under theinfluence of the second Ray of Love-Wisdom. Your task this life is to make thispossible so that, in your next life, you can have an astral body conditioned bythe second ray. Your ability to go forward in the face of obstacles in order toattain your ideal is your outstanding asset, and one that will land youeventually at your goal. Your major [121] difficulty, at this time, is yourfifth ray mind. Is this not true, my brother?You have a third ray (the Ray of Intelligent Activity) physical body . This islargely controlled, interiorly, by your fifth ray mind. Again you see thedominance of this type of energy in your equipment of expression. Your rays are,therefore:1. The soul ray—the third Ray of Active Intelligence.2. The personality ray—the sixth Ray of Devotion.3. The ray of the mind—the fifth Ray of Concrete Science.4. The ray of the astral body—the sixth Ray of Devotion.5. The ray of the physical body—the third Ray of Activity.This analysis should throw much light upon your problem for you will note thedominance of the third major ray and the sixth minor ray of devotion.~MY BROTHER: January 1938I have earlier indicated to you the point of view from which I personally gaugethe capacity and growth of the group and from that angle I am pleased with theprogress you have made. During the past few years I have many times spoken toyou with frankness and even with apparent harshness. This I have done in aneffort to galvanise you to a greater oriented reaction to the urge of your souland thus draw away from you the two factors which have blocked the freeintercourse which should exist between your soul and your personality. I haveever hinted. I do not voice my suggestions in clear words at all times for myobject is always to evoke the activity of your higher Self, thus exacting thecorrect type of obedience. What are these two factors?1. A life activity which, though somewhat balanced by the work done in my group,has nevertheless had a restricting effect and which does not succeed in evokingthe highest powers of your soul. You have tried to meet this situation and toraise the general tone, but one lone disciple is hard put to it to offset thevibration of a powerful [122] astrally polarised group. Do you know to what Ihere refer?2. A life tendency towards depression which you have amazingly offset bynegation and a persistent attitude of service. It has nevertheless complicatedyour life pattern and yet has been one of your major educators.This life experience has netted you big results and you will enter upon the nextcycle of phenomenal existence with much upon which to draw, and having workedout many life relations during this particular incarnation. What have been yourmajor gains in this life?First of all, the shift of your life emphasis from the outer objective work tothe inner subjective realities. In order to accomplish this, you came intoincarnation in restricted and limited surroundings so that there might be nodominant obstructing outer attractions; you were, therefore, free to concentrateupon the inner realities. You have largely profited by this experience and yoursubjective orientation is stabilised upon a rightful basis. Only one majoradjustment remains to be made and one major sacrifice. Your problem is, as youknow, to effect this readjustment without producing the material suffering ofthose dependent upon you.Secondly, you have oriented the astral body to the higher values and impressionsand have done it so successfully that your emotional sensitivity to others isnow definitely a working asset. This sensitivity I would have you develop intostill greater usefulness through the awakening of the heart centre and a renewedinterest in the Way of the Heart. To this end, I will give you a meditation inthis personal instruction which I would have you follow until further notice.Thirdly, you have in this life stepped off the probationary path on to the Pathof Accepted Discipleship and have made good progress upon it. The accentuationof the times and your own intensity have together sufficed to carry you a longway towards the goal and this I think you are beginning to realise—much to yourown surprise at times. The recognition of facts —spiritual and subjectivefacts—is part of the needed training of all disciples; the recognition of aphysical plane fact requires no such training in sensitivity. The recognition ofspiritual [123] realities requires both training and formulated definiteexpression.The past year has not been an easy one for you, my brother. You have suffered inmany ways, known to you and recognised by me but by no one else. I have stood byand watched and at times have strengthened you when and where I could and twiceI definitely succeeded in aiding you. Do you know the occasions when thishappened? Training in the registering of offered and accepted aid is sometimesof value to disciples of your type and hence I am pointing out what I attemptedto do. I would have you work during the coming year at accustoming yourself tomy vibration. It will increase your subjective sensitivity so to do. That is thetrue value or permanent gain.In connection with the occult sentences I gave you a year ago and which Ipromised to discuss with you, the following comments may prove of value. Themain lesson of your life has been the cultivation of the power to respond to thedistant sound of human pain. This I referred to in the words “the slowly openingheart.” For two reasons, this response of the heart has not been an easy thingfor you to do. One is the fact that in your last life you over-emphasised theintellect and thus came into incarnation with a predisposition to polariseyourself in the mind nature, with consequent detachment from human touch andsympathetic contact. The other is a subconscious recognition that if you“descended to the unhappy ways of human sympathy,” you possess a capacity foridentification with your brothers and for sharing their pain which would makeyou phenomenally uncomfortable. This, in your earlier years, served to hold youaway from people, and led you to dwell on the plane of thought—detached, sereneand isolated. The past ten years have seen you change all this; though you arenot now so comfortable in yourself, you are open to others and sensitive to themin a very real manner.Next, the realisation that “both eyes are focussed on the world of human pain”is steadily becoming yours. You are learning that only in trueself-forgetfulness (forgetfulness of the soul’s goal as well as of allpersonality goals) will be for you any real consummation, and that humanity isof far greater importance than the individual human being. As The Old [124]Commentary says: “The focus now is true and real, for both the eyes, the leftand the right, are turned upon the ways of men and in this way the truth isclearly seen.”Then, we come to the words, “that which is distant fades from view and theimmediate present looms.” One of the most difficult tasks which faces anydisciple is to exchange the abstract vision of future glory and reward for theimmediate duty and goal and to learn the spiritual values of the immediatemoment as they are to be found in the foreground of daily living. I can rememberthe time, my brother, when it was hard for you to identify yourself with theproblem of the hour, so occupied were you with the Hierarchy, its personnel andplans, and with your relation to the unseen Master. Perhaps in the rightadjustment which you have been successful in bringing about, you may haveforgotten that time of distant and difficult striving. But I have not. You haveto lose sight of the far-off spiritual possibility in the service of the hour.This you have learnt to do in no small measure, only to make the discovery thatthis path of service and of self-forgetfulness brings you by a long and wearyway back to us.Finally, “thus the magnetic life again holds sway.” This time, however, themagnetism is not that of the soul in its own high place but that of thespiritualised personality in the ways of daily, earthly contact. It is thedevelopment of this “magnetic life” to which I call you afresh—for the remainderof this life and its succeeding cycles....~January 1939There has been much questioning in your mind during the past few months and alsomuch mental discomfort, if I might so express it. There has been, at the sametime, a steady adherence to the chosen way and to your group brothers. You arestill, however, under the influence of an ancient thoughtform, forgetting thatone of the tasks of a disciple is to free himself from these holding forms. Thisthoughtform leads you to look, aye, to demand results of a phenomenal nature; itincites you to believe and urges you to demand that your years of devotion, yourpersonality energy and your astral force (a strong combination, [125] mybrother!) should be rewarded by a recognition from and a contact with a Memberof the Hierarchy. You look for this, not in order to feel any personalsatisfaction or prideful reaction but as a justified and right reward of patienteffort and true occult obedience.Yet, my brother, you have had all you asked for if you could but recognise it.You know who I am and surely, therefore, the recognition for which you asked hasbeen accorded you and you are aware of that for which you are being prepared byyour soul, by me and through the chosen group work. Yet in all of this, you takeno joy nor find any rest. Should you not realise the truth of what I say, Iwould ask you to reflect awhile and maybe in time illumination will come.The group work is not easy for you. It is hard for an Englishman to free himselffrom his national assurances and prejudices, as it is for the nationals of allhighly developed countries. But in this work and at your stage of spiritualawareness, the inclusiveness of the life realisation should bar out insularity.For this you must strive, and for you the keynote is the conviction that all menare brothers —a thing most easy to say and to hold theoretically but mostdifficult to express as a living factor in one’s life.We are going to work with frankness henceforth and with freedom, and I—yourMaster and your friend—will mince no words with you or with any of my group.There is not time, such is the immediate urgency to train workers and it issurely needless with a group such as this.You will remember that I gave much time to the consideration of the rays whichgoverned the various aspects and vehicles of each of the group members, and Itrust that a careful analysis of what I said has enabled each of you to knowyourselves and to understand your problems more truly and more fully. Today Iseek to indicate the vehicles of force through which the two major rays arepredominantly focussed, reminding you that the task is to relate two energiesand three forces in such a manner that you become, in fact, a divinemanifestation. Let me here be precise.First, your egoic or soul ray focusses itself in and through your fifth raymental body. This—as I told you in an earlier [126] instruction—has given youyour defined mental focus, your critical attitude and your isolation, relativelyspeaking. It is this combination which has always enabled you to rationaliseyourself into a confidence in the rightness of your decisions and into a suretythat your particular life choices and your preferred circumstances are correctand justified. This energy and force are reinforced also by the controllingforce of your physical body which gives you a third ray brain.Second, your personality ray is focussed in your astral body. The rays—three,five and six—are your controlling factors. This gives you devotion and mentalcontrol and it should give you real balance but, unfortunately, it does not,because the mind aspect is unduly emphasised and you are afraid of devotion. Yetit is your devotion, my brother, which has brought you to us and not your mentalability. It is your devotion which has led you steadily all these years andproduced your service in the world. To what have you been devoted? This is animportant question for you to answer to your soul.I ask myself anew: How can I convey to this disciple the nature of his problem?I will put it in this form. Your egoic energy, focussed in your mind, is at theservice of your personality and of the work which you are endeavouring to do inthe particular field wherein you are forcing yourself to remain. It should bethe other way round and the personality—with all its unified powers—should be atthe service of the soul. All the forces of your lower nature should be at thedisposal of the higher Self, working through an illumined mind and sensitivebrain. Ponder on this. The energy of the intelligence and two intelligentforces—the soul, the mind and the physical nature—serve your devotedpersonality. You should reverse this, my brother, and let the intelligent soulcontrol your devoted personality. There lies your problem.The need of every disciple is ever to develop a closer and more direct alignmentbetween soul and personality and that is, therefore, your problem, even if itseems to you an elementary problem. What you need to do is to focus the energyof your soul in your sixth ray astral body instead of in your mind, so thatintelligent love may be your outstanding characteristic. This shift will docertain things for you and in you: [127]1. It will create a temporary upheaval in your life and, therefore, naturallyaffect your solar plexus, producing a period of real difficulty.2. It will transfer the energy of the soul and the force of the mind into therealm of the emotions and of sensitive feeling response, thereby greatlyincreasing your usefulness but also increasing for you the “dire pain of lifeitself”; this is a pain with which all disciples must learn to live and fromwhich all disciples must inevitably suffer.3. It will stimulate your brain cells and swing into activity many hithertodormant cells, thus making you capable of increased service of a differentnature to that with which you are now occupied. It will lead you to enquire ifyour present field of service is, for you, a legitimate one or—if it is—whatmust you do to “change the nature of the seed which must therein be sown.” Youwill know to what I refer without my further elaborating.Such is your problem. How shall we change your egoic focus and, at the sametime, fuse more closely your two major rays so that the personality issubordinated to the soul. To aid in this specific meditation must befollowed....NOTE: “This disciple is no longer working with the Tibetan Master, Who makes thefollowing comment about him:“He has reached his high water mark for this life. Further instruction is notnecessary. He has enough upon which to work.”~TO L. D. O.November 1937MY BROTHER AND MY FRIEND:Many factors are responsible for bringing people together into such a group asthis. There is, first of all, their mutual karmic relationship which, indicatingas it does equality in aspiration and a general ability to make and hold certainspiritual contacts, enables them to work together more easily as a unit or aunity, if you prefer that term. In these cases, there exists [128] a need in thegroup for a specific and peculiar development in order that the group life maybe thereby enriched and deepened. In other cases, there is a definiterelationship with myself, dating from past experience, even if that experienceis as yet unconsciously registered. There is a proffering of new opportunity fortraining to those who are upon the Path of Discipleship. All these factorsinfluenced my decision to ask you, a disciple, to work in cooperation withmyself and my group of disciples.In your particular case, the determining causes were the contribution you canmake to this group, out of your rich equipment of deep desire and understanding,and also a relation to myself of very old standing. Of this latter cause, I am,of course, more conscious than you can be.It is necessary for me to explain these points to you as the understanding ofcauses is one of your strongest mental urges, and such an urge may not bedisregarded. Entering this group is not an easy matter for you. You questionyour ability to conform to the requirements and to submit to the inevitable,even if voluntary, group discipline. I have also questioned it, not because Idoubt your sincerity of purpose and of your life intent, for I do not, nor do Iquery the steadfastness of your determination to tread the Path and to goforward towards your goal. That is for you an unalterable and inflexibledecision. You hold to it at all costs and in spite of failure at times toachieve your own standard of spiritual living. My questioning is based upon atendency on your part towards vagueness and a lack of the sense of orientationin time. This is frequently the case with the pure mystic which you have been.Of this also I feel sure you are yourself conscious. It is not easy for a personof your type to enter upon a course of self-discipline under the suggestion ofanother, such as myself. To offset this difficulty, I would remind you that youracquiescence in the matter has been quite voluntary and that you have signifiedyour willingness to make the needed effort after debating the matter for morethan a year. That is all that I ask of you. I would remind you also that in myattitude towards my groups of disciples (some of which have been working with mefor many years) I am simply prompted by a keen desire to aid you [129] all fromthe angle of my wider experience and to make suggestions. These can be followedor not as the disciple may desire.It is, however, wise to make the effort and to give me the opportunity by atemporary acquiescence and a voluntary obedience to prove to you that there is apurpose and a planned understanding behind my proposed technique of training.Will you, therefore, be willing to try out my suggestions and to follow myproposals for an adequately long time so as to give proof of their wisdom? Ittakes time in the spiritual life for adjustments to be made and for neededunfoldments to be brought about. Two or three months do not suffice to offsetthe tendencies and habits of a lifetime or maybe of several life cycles. But youhave courage and a steady will and can achieve much in this life.Your problem is that of a versatile, advanced second ray type. You have a markedability to do many things well and a decided aptitude to understand people,their motives and their impulses. You have a genius for contact and arenaturally a good psychologist. You are prone also (because of your second rayinclusiveness) to over-estimate people and, subjectively, you have a stronginferiority complex, based largely upon your sense of the divine and not onfailure. Ponder on this thought which I here give you. You need to learn to seepeople as they really are and appreciating, as heretofore, the divine in them tostand aside from them in your endeavour to help them and to work with and forthem. You are apt to regard your ability to do well along so many lines assomewhat in the nature of a handicap. You must learn to regard it rather as anindication of the many ways in which you can reach others, and as a definiteasset upon the Path.With you I can and must be entirely frank; your innate honesty recognises thesame quality in others and you would have no respect for me if I handled youwith gloves, as the saying is. My function with you is not to tell you yourfaults or to give you many directions. These you know and follow the truedirection instinctively even if at times you choose the longer way aroundtowards your objective.[130] You have two things to do which—if successfully accomplished—would verymuch increase your output in service and reorganise both your inner and yourouter life. You have to work conscientiously with the time factor and you haveto make out of life a fuller expression of work well done. You have also tocultivate more definitely than you do the habit of mind, the trained attitude ofthe Observer of life, of people and of yourself. You must develop theattentiveness of the One who looks on at life and at the life struggle ofothers. It is necessary for you to learn that when you can avoid identifyingyourself so closely with people, refraining from suffering so consciously withthem, you can be of greater service to them and a finer friend and helper.Therefore, for you, detachment is an outstanding requirement and a quality to becultivated. This is not the detachment of self-protection or ofself-immunisation or of aloofness, but that soul detachment which works fromsoul levels and—seeing all life in the light which streams from the soul—regardseverything from the standpoint of eternity. You will then see the real valuesinvolved and the true perspectives of the picture. You need to apply to peopleand to circumstances the quality of interrogation and understanding which youendeavour to employ when you follow your art. You must see people truly and asthey are—with their faults and their virtues, their divinity and their humanity.Am I not right, my brother?As time goes on, we can extend and deepen the analysis but at first I only seekto emphasise to you these two points or rather these two requirements—the rightuse of time and its right adjustment in your life, and the cultivation of anattitude of detachment. I am of no use to you or to any of my disciples if Icannot be specific and direct. The work that I may ask you to do should tend tobring about certain of these needed adjustments.I am going to ask you to add to your morning meditation an evening review upondetachment.... As far as your meditation is concerned follow your usualprocedure, at any rate for the present, only add to it each morning a definiteperiod wherein you take your co-disciples (those you may happen to know) intothe light and seek consciously to link up with them, [131] pouring out to themthe love and wisdom which may be yours. This tends definitely to groupintegration....You are in a position to aid and help many people. See to it, my brother, thatyou aid with wisdom, discernment and discretion and that you place your effortwhere the best results can be achieved. Right discrimination in helpfulness israre, but you can give it. You will, of course, endeavour to conform to grouprequirements, will you not? But this must be of your own free choice and for thepurposes of group integrity.~MY BROTHER: February 1938It will have been clearly indicated to you that you have a definite karmic linkboth to your fellow disciples and to me. The two are one, however. It is thisthat has led you in our direction and has enabled you to link up with theseinitial groups connected with the Masters’ Ashrams which are attempting toembody the coming New Age methods of work. Earlier, you have worked with anothergroup. Then the pressure of life and of circumstance and the desire to expressyourself in a chosen line of activity, temporarily lifted you out of the grouplife and your place was filled by another. Now, work is found for you in a groupwhich is to occupy itself with the dissipation of world glamour. I have decidedto put you to work in this group because you are relatively free from glamour (Idid not say free from faults or from the mental aspects of glamour which we callillusion). This freedom should be of service to the group. You can think withclarity and usually know why you act in a particular manner, for you seldom actwithout some preparatory thinking or without arriving at some sufficient andadequate reason (not feeling emotion) for so acting. Will you remember this asyou work in my group and later—as the group works unitedly to dispel prevailingglamours—will you work with them intelligently and with power as they learn,with you, to master glamour in their own lives? When a man has learned todominate conditions through the power of his [132] soul, then he can work in themidst of conditions, untouched and constructively. Will you try to rememberthis?This group work is either of moment and useful, or else it is nothing but achimera and a waste of time, having no real purpose and serving no useful end.If the groups of disciples on the outer plane which the Masters are now formingthroughout the world can be regarded as among the Seed Groups of the New Age andcan likewise be of immediate service in the stage of earlier preparatory work inwhich we now find ourselves, then it is worth while from many angles to givetime and effort (in order to cooperate constructively when the time comes) tothe fulfilment of requirements. Coming in, as you have done, several years laterthan the majority, in order to take the place of D.A.O., there is a good deal ofinformation to be mastered and much earlier instruction to be studied. If youwill do this, then you will be able to work with understanding with yourco-disciples. Take at least a year going over the earlier teaching re maya,glamour and illusion. You will find much to interest you....You are a creative worker and have also the ability to work in several creativeways. You are both an artist and a writer. This means that your soul can reachexpression and usefulness along two channels. You have, therefore, two definiteassets to contribute to world service and two points of expression whereby yoursoul and your brain are en rapport. Such channels are necessarily media ofrelation and down them light can flow, irradiating dark places. I would like topoint out that creative workers in any field are primarily those who can destroythose glamours to which humanity is prone. These are found in those fields ofillusory activity which men have themselves created. You are taking the place ofa creative worker who succumbed—sincerely and honestly—to the glamour of a “freeand independent soul”—a paradoxical idea and one which shows forgetfulness ofthe fact that the heresy of separateness, of aloneness and of independence is apart of the world glamour. This brother was thus unable to cooperate and valuedhis “personal freedom” higher than the planned group activity and thus for twoyears delayed this group of workers from arriving at [133] the intendedactivity. Will you, therefore, seek rapid integration in order to hasten theintended accomplishment?To help you do this, I shall not assign you a great deal of personal work oroutline to you much individual activity. I will, however, indicate the threerays of energy which constitute your personality. As you already know, your soulray is the second and your personality ray is the fourth. A study of these fiverays and those of your fellow disciples will show you where points of relationexist, where the lines of least resistance will be found and where you may lookfor rapid comprehension and understanding cooperation.Your mental body is on the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict and hence yourpliability, your sense of relationship and your rapid grasp of mental truth.Illusion will ever be a more ready snare to you than glamour. This Ray ofHarmony through Conflict is that bridging ray which will, in your case andthrough the mind, bring about an increasingly rapid establishment of contactbetween your soul and your personality.Your astral body is on the second ray and this will be sufficiently obvious toyou, giving you those difficulties and those opportunities which lead eventuallyto expansions of consciousness and that sensitivity to the psyche in otherswhich has been the basis of much of your most successful work.Your physical body is on the seventh ray, which gives you a sense of therelationship between spirit and matter, between soul and body and enables you,if so you will, to be a constructive agent in magical work. Your rays are,therefore:1. The ray of the soul—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.2. The ray of the personality—the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict.3. The ray of the mind—the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict.4. The ray of the astral body—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.5. The ray of the physical body—the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Order or Magic.[134] It will be obvious to you that the major line of force in your equipment,relating you to others and facilitating contact, is the second ray with itssubsidiary expression, the fourth ray. This is a definite asset and anopportunity but it also makes possible certain liabilities. These should beoffset by a stiffening of all first ray tendencies in order to bring about aneeded balancing. I would add that1. Your soul energy seeks expression through the vital body.2. Your personality force is focussed in the astral body.Read what I said to I.B.S. in order to understand the significance of the above.~BROTHER OF OLD: February 1939You have now completed a year’s work with me and in this group of disciples. Youhave had this time for clarification of your thoughts and to give you theopportunity to define clearly to yourself the objectives and purposes of thework which this group should soon begin. You start somewhat handicapped as wehave waived all the initial work and preliminary training in your case. You arestarting in at the stage of organised group work. Will you do this with patientapplication and an unquestioning but voluntary obedience? Let not world glamourovercome you and see to it that you are not drawn into the vortex of fears andof pessimism which surrounds so many people these days.As I have earlier told you, you are relatively free from glamour but the forcestoday are so strong that all disciples must definitely protect themselves. Foryou, this protection lies in some form of creative work. This is made easier foryou by the fact that your personality ray and the ray of your mind are identicaland also because your soul, anchored and focussed in your etheric body, can—ifyou so choose—galvanise your physical body into almost any kind of neededcreative activity.One of the things which all disciples have to learn to do is to avail themselvesof the forces and energies which are theirs by right of inherent possession;these are, however, but seldom employed with understanding by the average man orwoman. [135] They are usually the victims and not the users of these powers. Fewrealise how stupendous are the energies upon which they can draw at will. Yourproblem is predominantly the establishing of a dynamic relation between all theinner and subtler forces which are focussed in your etheric body so that you canoccultly “bring through” into outer expression, via the physical brain, theriches of realisation, of understanding and of wisdom which are your possession.This bringing through is not accomplished by you as adequately as it might be,though you do succeed at times in so doing. You should aim at the outerexpression of the inner nature with greater frequency and should seek to makethe conscious link between the outer and the inner more dynamic and real. Ponderon this. The strength, wisdom and love of every disciple in the world today isearnestly needed. Humanity is demanding help and the Hierarchy is asking forcooperation.~January 1940The necessity to do and to be objectively active is a major glamour of yours,brother of mine. You need to learn the lesson that it is relatively of noimportance what you do. That which is of major importance is to registerconsciously and all the time just exactly what you are doing. I would have youremember that right doing is the result of being. If your awareness of being isof a personality nature, so will be your activity. If your consciousness isfocussed in spiritual being, your spontaneous, creative and active service willbe consequently by radiation. I would have you ponder on this.For many disciples in training at this time, the present crisis presents aperiod or an interlude of withdrawing in order to re-focus and to learn again atthe source of interior wisdom. So it is with you. Be occupied with the problemof sensitive response and not with the glamour of the work which you must do.Deal with causes and not with effects. The effects are inevitably effective.NOTE: This disciple is still working actively with the Tibetan. [136]~TO J. A. C.December 1937MY BROTHER:In dealing with first ray egos, such as yourself or with those souls who areworking through first ray personalities, I am faced always with the initialdifficulty of their “isolated independence.” It is not easy for such first raytypes to cooperate, to fall into line with group suggestion, with group rhythmor group discipline, or with united synchronised activity which is the announcedgoal of all groups of disciples. Frequently the inner attitude is at one withthe main purpose and ideals but the outer expression, the physical man, remainsunadaptable and basically unwilling to conform. Were it not for your second raypersonality, you would find it hard to work in my Ashram, but it is this secondray quality of yours—strongly marked and the product of a long series ofincarnations in a second ray vehicle—which can make you, if you so desire, oneof the focal points for the work which I plan to have this band of disciples do.It will take several years to bring about the adaptation of the group members toeach other so that effective work can be made possible, to produce that innersynthesis and unified effort which will enable me to give these disciples intraining some definite task to perform —work which may affect the governingforces of the world in subtle and unrecognised ways. These we can laterelaborate when the required synthesis and understanding is achieved. Strive notto understand what I mean by this work as yet. There is much to do and much tostudy and explain before the work can come to fruition. There are many groups,working under the Masters, who have been in training for years, fittingthemselves for the task to be done. Slowly and gradually, the new concepts andthe new techniques of civilisation and of group work—suitable for the NewAge—are emerging in the consciousness of the disciples in the world.As for you, brother of mine, you are entering a phase in your life cycle inwhich you may become—if you so wish—the true sannyasin, the one who (freed fromthe more active tasks of the younger man who is starting out into the field ofhis life [137] activity) can use the experience gained, the hard won knowledgeassembled and the wisdom garnered in active service of the Hierarchy and ofhumanity. You can now live for the sake of others and find in our work thereward, interest and compensation for all the struggle of the past. To serve haslong been your aim for you have loved your fellowmen and have struggled toretain this love for humanity in the face of disillusionment, disgust at thegeneral world selfishness and a tendency (strongly marked in you, my brother) tofeel the futility of things and the uselessness of effort when confronting thepresent world debacle and the weight of human pessimism. Against this you muststruggle.I shall be glad to have your cooperation in this difficult work we are planningto do together. I would ask you right at the beginning for your voluntaryacquiescence in the suggestions I shall make to you, at any rate until you seemore clearly whither I am seeking to lead my disciples and get a more definitepicture of the work which it is possible to do. I do not think that at the endof a few years you will regret temporarily falling in with my plans for thegroup.In connection with my disciples, complete frankness is an essential and the goodpoints and the weaknesses must be recognised with equal readiness. Among thosewhom I have been training for some time there is no attempt to hide anythingfrom each other. They themselves would be the first to tell you of theimportance, the difficulty and the value of setting up this frank relation. Itis necessary that from the start of your association with my group that youshould aim at a similar clarity of vision where they are concerned and they willhave the same attitude towards you.One of the things which has handicapped you all your life and which has held youback from a possibly fuller world service has been a pronounced inferioritycomplex. This tendency, though it has not negated achievement in yourpersonality life and activities, has nevertheless held you back and inhibitedthe free inner movement of your soul, and has prevented that joy in living whichshould be the hallmark of the disciple. Your sensitivity is great and your graspof world affairs and world conditions is necessarily somewhat deeper than thatof [138] the average citizen. Yet the very depth of your vision and knowledgemake you prone to feel your individual smallness and unimportance. This iscoupled, as I remarked earlier, with a sense of futility where making any majorimpression upon environing conditions is concerned. It is in connection withthis that your personality battle must be waged. I call you, therefore, to thetask of achieving a closer soul contact. This will negate the sense ofinferiority. I call you also to a cultivated joyousness which will end inreleasing you to fuller service. Will you work on these two points and follow mysuggestions for the space of one year and thus aid the group whilst helpingyourself?To help you in this connection I am giving you a very simple meditation—sosimple that you may be tempted to doubt its efficacy. I can, however, assure youthat if you will follow it carefully for a few months or until I myself suggesta change that you will be surprised at what changes within your consciousnessthis very simple formula will bring about.... Keep a pencil and paper beside youas you meditate and note down your thoughts and ideas as they come to you.... Iam working to key you up for future work.NOTE: There was no real response to the invitation to work in the Tibetan’sgroup and though interest was evidenced in the papers, the work undertaken didnot go beyond studying them.~TO F. C. D.January 1933To my fellow disciple, F.C.D., who works in that loneliness which is sodifficult for the second ray type, I would say the following: Your problem istwofold and when it yields to solution then your field of service—alreadylarge—will increase. You have the problem of a devitalised etheric body and alsoof a heart attached to many and hence unduly strained and taxed by others. Thereare many demands upon your sympathies. By the time you have reached the age offifty years you should have achieved the difficult undertaking of becoming thesannyasin [139] in the Western world. This B.S.W. has already achieved and couldhelp you if you, with frankness, cared to correspond with him. You have somewhatto give him too.The problems of the etheric body will yield to treatment if the suggestions madeto C.D.P. are noted and if the diet (in your case) is carefully controlled andregulated.... It is not my intention to indicate to those who work in my groupthe methods they should follow as regards diet. Such things differ for eachindividual.You have necessarily at this stage the vices of your second ray virtues. Yousuffer from attachment and from a too rapid identification with other people.This can be handled if you stand steadfast as a soul and do not focus as apersonality in dealing with people—both in your home circle and in your worldservice. You need to bear in mind that your relation is with souls and not withtemporary forms and so you must live detached from personalities, serving thembut living ever in the consciousness of the soul—the true sannyasin.Carry your meditations forward exclusively in the head, therefore, except forsome incidental practice in connection with the spleen (which I will give you tofollow) with a view to etheric vitalisation. Your heart centre is sufficientlyawakened for this life and greater sensitivity would be a handicap. The perfectfulfilment of your duty and your freedom inwardly from ties will spell for youthat measure of liberation which will release you to fuller service. If you havequestions which you seek to ask me, brother of old, I will with gladness reply.~MY BROTHER: June 1933Your period of difficulty and of loneliness has not lessened for you and youhave found it hard to struggle along. I have not much to say to you at thistime; you are coming closer to your Master and in such cases fellow-disciplesmay not interfere. The greatest help that I can give you at this time is to makethe above statement to you and this I do. You have the persistence and the will(like tempered steel) of the second [140] ray and can dismiss all fear as toyour capacity to weather the storm and difficulty and to win through. Nothingcan stop you....I would like to give you a special formula or mantram and I have chosen thefollowing phrases to be repeated by you whenever you choose:“I am a messenger of Light. I am a pilgrim on the way of love. I do not walkalone but know myself as one with all great souls, and one with them in service.Their strength is mine. This strength I claim. My strength is theirs and this Ifreely give. A soul, I walk on earth. I represent the ONE.”Your work in my group and your power in relation to your group brothers,consists in your compassionate comprehension. You feed their love for each otherand you act as a focal point for that aspect of the soul which expresses itselfin understanding. You can transmit that soul quality.~MY BROTHER: June 1934You stand at the verge of a real expansion of your work and for this you mustprepare yourself. This, I believe, you already realise. It is, however, in theuse of the spiritual will on your part that the release to full liberty ofaction will come. Your life has been a discipline, but the fruits of thatdiscipline will demonstrate as you open the doors and also close them uponancient imprisoning limitations. You know well whereof I speak.First, I would say to you these words, disciple of the Master K.H. Who has alsobeen to me a wise and guiding Teacher: Relinquish that close attention to thelives of those around you which is the easy way of working for all who aresecond ray disciples. Their sense of responsibility is so great and their desireto shelter and to guard so strong that they unduly cherish those who are linkedto them by karmic obligation and whose lives touch theirs in the life of everyday. Go your own way with strength and silence, and do that which your souldemands. Let not the lesser voices of the loved and near deflect you from yourprogress upon the path of service. You belong now to the [141] world, and not toa handful of your fellowmen. This is not an easy lesson to learn, my brother,but all disciples have some day to learn it and it is an appropriate lesson foryou at this time. The call has gone out for Servers and all who are pledgeddisciples must be the first to make response. This will involve sacrifice butyou can be depended upon to make it.Your health is better and will continue to be so, if you watch with care andkeep the earlier rules I gave you as to diet, etc. You may find that in thecoming years, your hours of sleep will be less. This will be good, not bad, mybrother, for too much sleep leads to diminished etheric force. A hint sufficesfor the wise disciple. More air and sun, less sleep and fewer human contacts arefor you the rule in the future. Into these words read their hidden meaning.Clearer I may not speak for these words will be seen by others. But should younot with clarity understand, ask A.A.B. whose problem was in some points yours.I have told her certain things of value to you but she hesitates to speak andhopes you will comprehend without too much interpretation. I think you will, foryour intuition is awakened and your devotion to the cause of the Great Ones isreal and you have had much experience with other people. Your main task, at thistime, is to get yourself ready and in a good physical condition for the demandsupon your time, your strength and your heart which will surely come....For you this year the emphasis must be laid upon the stabilising of yourspiritual routine. Should you feel able to do so and the press of work permits(you see, I make not my request imperative) I would like you to write an articleupon the Power of the Dedicated Will. It is the use of the will aspect thatsecond ray disciples have to acquire and this, for you, is an immediate problem.The will of persistence you have. The dynamic will which breaks down barriersand carries all before it is your next achievement and unfoldment. May the powerand the blessing of your Master rest upon you, my co-disciple.I seek to answer the two questions you have asked me. As regards Z, theextroverting process must continue and go forward and I make the suggestion thathe wait another six months or a year before he again takes up the earlier workwhich occupied him. He will have much to do as your work expands [142] and growsand his moments of crisis will be real, for your work will assume proportionswhich his cannot during this incarnation.... Let him work first of all foralignment with his soul and then meditate, for from his own soul, his truecounsel must come....Your suggestion, secondly, that there should be a centre at X of internationalusefulness is of real value and can be materialised if you work without hasteand keep the conditioning of it in your own hands and in the hands of no oneelse. Meditate much upon it but take no steps until after.... In the secretplace must your plans be wrought out and two men (who could be of assistance toyou) have not yet been prepared; one of them you have not yet met. Think outwith clarity, therefore:a. The note that you seek to sound.b. The work on the physical plane which the proposed centre should do.c. The principles which must govern all action which you deem should be taken.d. The necessary linking which should be done if the work is to be trulynon-racial and planned to dispel some of the world glamour.~MY BROTHER: January 1935It will be obvious to you now how true were my words in my last communicationwhen I foretold the growing expansion of your work. That has happened and thepast year has seen you making many contacts and the increase of your influencein your own country and throughout the world is far greater. The decisions youmake and the discipline to which you may voluntarily subject yourself willdetermine the scope and the extent of your future possible work. Everything liesin your own hands and in your capacity to make wise adjustments.As you well know and as I have already told you, your problems are intimate onesfor they concern your home relations and your personal, physical health. Theseyou must solve yourself in your own way and no outsider may do more than suggestand indicate. That, I have attempted to do. The physical [143] weakness has itsseat in a constant draining and leakage of the etheric body. This keeps youdevitalised and hence the emphasis I have sought to lay upon the need for sunand air. Too long hours of sleep increase the drainage of vitality. Sleeprecharges the tired body and fits it for the next day’s work, but eight hourssleep each night suffices you. Your true vitalisation must come from the soul.You will not get it from excessive sleep and this is surely proved to you, foryou sleep much and yet are ever tired. Forget not that a weakened etheric bodyis easily drained by other people though they do this quite unconsciously.Therefore, for you, close contact with others is not desirable—not only from thestandpoint of your health but from the angle of the status which you havereached upon the Path of Discipleship.Your aura requires sealing (if I may use so unusual a term) and the leakage nowpresent can then be stopped. This cannot be done, occultly speaking, until youhave made some changes in your life. Close inter-mingling with the auras ofother people causes in your case a constant seepage of vitality, for you areconstantly oriented towards giving. Your course is obvious but more I cannot saynor shall I again make reference to this matter.Your problem is a very real one, but by no means an unusual one; it must befaced with common sense, loving understanding and wisdom. You must take theattitude of a disciple whose work and time is needed by the world in this hourof urgency. All problems are susceptible of two methods of solution, once thenature of the problem is seen and realised. There is the method of a sudden anddrastic adjustment, whereby the old conditions are abruptly ended and a newstate of affairs is inaugurated. This method—though oft the best—is not easy forthe second ray disciple. The other is that of a gradual readjustment accompaniedby outer explanation, until in time the same condition is brought about as inthe first method. This is the usual method for a second ray disciple. Betweenthese two you must choose, unless, my brother, you prefer to leave things asthey are.One thing I will add before definitely closing this subject. When the heart isfull of love and the head is full of wisdom, [144] nothing then is ever donethat can cause distress to others in the long run. By this, I refer not toaction but to the fruits of action. A decision can be made and a line of conductfollowed (and the decision can be right) but the eventuating conditions may notbe harmoniously adjusted unless there is a subjective freedom from fear, a heartfull of love and that loving understanding which is the truest wisdom. The manwho is fearless, wise and loving can do anything and the effects will beharmless and good producing.Persevere with the meditation upon which you are now engaged.... Meditateconstantly upon the will —consecrated to active, loving service. It is the useof the will that is of importance to a disciple, for the rightly directed willis the controller of force and the disciple works in the realm of forces. And,my brother, not only karmically but because the same great Master has been ourguide, there is work that you and I can do—both inwardly and outwardly in theworld. There is true service that you can render. But your work is that ofdirector and inspirer. Very seldom is the second ray disciple a good executive,unless the secondary ray makes him so. Executive work and organisation are notfor you. You must learn to work through others, awakening them to a sense ofresponsibility and galvanising them into activity. By the steady power of yourown inner radiance, you must hold your workers steady.The task of finding the right people and of inspiring them is your immediatetask. I would not help you and would only limit you within the boundaries of myown work (note that phrase, brother of old) if I said to you: So and so must beapproached, or, there is the man I foretold would help your endeavour. You arein training as wielder of men and a guide of aspirants in the building work ofthe New Age upon which the Great Ones are now engaged. You must learndiscrimination and understanding and right choice—through experiment, throughfailure and through success. All men are souls. Yes, my brother, but all men arenot yet ready for disinterested service. Right judgment is a needed quality foryou when considering people. For the work which you seek to vitalise, look notfor the sweet, the gentle, the kind and tender because so many very good peopleare oft unintelligent and lazy. Look [145] for those strong souls who,responding to the need of humanity and reacting to the impulse of love (whichyou so richly shed) are yet capable of thinking in strong terms, are vital intheir planning, consecutive in their activity and who waste not time inbeautiful visionary dreams. The visionary mystic senses the ideal but (using nothis mind) makes no compromise between the wonderful ideas which may materialisein a far distant future and the present period of hard necessity. Look for thosewho may not resemble you in their second ray background, but who give you oftheir confidence and love because they recognise your wisdom, realise your innerlink with the Hierarchy and lean on your experience and soul strength. Attractnot to yourself for the work you seek to do, the sweet and feeble, the weak,well-meaning, gently ineffectual person. Look for the strong souls through whomyou must learn to work. Look for those who can cooperate with the Plan.Look also for your co-workers outside the ranks of the psychologicallydistressed and the abnormal people.... You must refrain from welding them intoany structure which you may build for the Great Ones. They are not yet ready andwould constitute poor stones in the building and weak links in your work. Youmust build for the future.I have spoken to you thus at length because your work as a building cooperatorcan now begin. Symbolically, I say to you: Look for those who have blended headand heart and above whose foreheads shines the mystic symbol of the builder .That you may integrate more freely and more fully in the work of the Great WhiteLodge and enter into a closer fellowship and relationship with the builders ofthe New Age is the earnest wish and prayer of your friend, your brother and yourteacher.~BROTHER OF OLD: July 1935There has been for you lately (as for so many) a time of testing; yet it hasbeen at the same time a condition of consolidation, preparatory to the work ofbuilding to which I referred in my last instruction. I am dealing with “buildinggroups”—those groups which are coming forth along the teaching line [146] andwhich are constructing those thoughtforms which will embody the new techniquesand ideas. These—during the next two centuries—will change the face of ourcivilisation and inaugurate a period in human history in which methods will betried and principles established which remain as yet totally unknown to themajority. That period will lead the race into a civilisation and a mutual,cooperative interplay which will bring to an end the present era of selfishnessand competition.You are predominantly the teacher and have needed to learn (and still need todo) three things:First, you need to acquire that inner, divine detachment which sees life in itstrue perspective. A man is thus left free and untouched by aught that may occur.The ideal attitude for you is that of the Onlooker who is in no way identifiedwith aught that may happen on the physical and emotional planes, and whose mindis a limpid reflector of truth. This truth is intuitively perceived becausethere are no violent mental reactions or emotional states of response; thevehicles of perception are quiet and therefore there is nothing to offsetcorrect attitude. When this state of consciousness is achieved, you will be ableto teach with power and at the same time possess that also which must be taught.Secondly, you must acquire an increased ability to voice truth through themedium of the written word. Opportunity will come to you to reach the world withideas that are relatively new; that which you write can be printed andcirculated.... But, my brother, you must work for a year at the organising ofyour thought and material, so that you can reach the thinkers of the world withthe new ideas in the field of that oncoming major science, that newer field ofservice—the field of psychology....You have a capacity for clothing an idea in its appropriate garb. You couldwrite a book which would be a synthesis of these new psychological ideas,subordinated to a central theme, which would dominate them as the head dominatesthe activities of the body. It is upon this central theme that the broodingprocess to which you are called must take place. You must know with clarity whatis the new thing which you seek to give to the world. Then and only then willthe many true ideas [147] which ferment so facilely in your mind drop into placeand form the pattern of the garment which will clothe your theme with beauty andgive it expression. The writing of this book should be your main, subjectiveendeavour during the next few years. It must be wrought out in the crucible ofenergetic living and must not be the product of a seclusion, produced bywithdrawing from outer activity. Your best work must be done in spite of allhindrances and because the urge to give these ideas to the world will surmountall obstacles.Finally, continue with the task of finding those strong souls who can belong tothe New Group of World Servers, if given right training. Train yourself in thatdiscriminative ability which will enable you to find those who will warrant theexpenditure of your time and strength and of your thought and energy—from thestandpoint of the Hierarchy and of the work that the Hierarchy seeks toaccomplish. Study these words, for they give you the clue to the type andquality required.Your problems of adjustment must still continue till solved, and the processesof detaching yourself from too close a contact with the auras of others mustproceed and must be carried into the field of your service to others. I see inyou a better comprehension of this problem and an increased facility inapplication. You are learning fast, my brother, and will find ample compensationas the work proceeds. Go forward to a fuller release and, therefore, to fullerpower to serve.~MY BROTHER: December 1935I have earlier indicated to you that your general sensitivity is responsible formuch of your difficulty along telepathic lines and in connection with yourphysical condition. Today, in this personal word to you, I seek to let you knowhow well I understand all that you have lately suffered. Life has beenpeculiarly hard for you the past six months for you can tune in so easily on allthat is around you.The path of the World Saviours is ever a hard one; the way of the DivineSensitives is fraught with suffering and with pain. This is the way that youhave chosen to go, and the knowledge [148] of this and its remembrance may helpyou to endure. Much help can also come to you if you will remember that thereare certain lives in which the development of the equipment is the major goal.Then come other lives in which the prepared equipment is used. For you, thispresent life is primarily one of training and of unfoldment in connection withthe sensitive, response apparatus. You are being rendered sensitive and so madeaware. The power to tune in on the world pain and to be conscious of the worldsorrow (and that sorrow indicates the world growth in responsiveness) is rapidlybeing brought about in you. But it is a phase. It takes a strong soul to knowthe sources and the roots of pain, lying deep hidden in the manifested world.For you, at this time and temporarily , I suggest an unthinking detachment andan enforced refusal to permit the mind to ponder upon that which beats upon yoursympathies from your environment. Practise this divine ignoring for the next sixmonths. Be occupied with meeting the immediate needs of the individual; withcarrying out the suggestions which I make in connection with your group work andservice; and with deep, introspective reflection upon the Plan and the work ofthe New Group of World Servers.... My word to you today is simply one of cheerand of recognition. Persist upon the Way.~BROTHER AND FRIEND OF OLD: June 1936The strain of the past six months has been great. But it is now over and yourproblem must be to relax, not so much in the physical sense as in the innermental attitudes. So much of your sense of inadequacy and so much of yourinability to carry forward your cherished plans over long periods of time havetheir basis in physical disability, primarily (as I have often told you) in alack of vitality and not ill health. Yet the future holds for you muchsuccessful work, if right elimination of non-essential activities (with aconsequent intensification of the essential and a certain measure of physicaldiscipline) becomes possible to you. As I told you in my last communication,[149] the path of the World Saviours is a hard one, owing primarily to the powerto suffer which the second ray type embodies. This is of course in itself theprinciple of manifestation and holds the key to existence. Hence, therefore, theability of the person upon this ray to “agonise towards the goal, carrying theburden of the world, learning—through identification with others—a detachmentwhich, as time proceeds, negates all pain.” Note the paradox here involved andlearn its meaning which, my brother, is your task this life.How to discipline your physical body and how to strengthen it is your greatproblem and your immediate task. I mean not to infer that you are undisciplined.I seek only to point out that in the adjustments of the physical vehicle to thedemands of the period and to your particular life cycle, will come for yourelease into service. This service will make greater effort possible with lessexpenditure of energy and of vitality and, therefore, less physical distress.The great psychologists always become World Saviours, because the psychologicalproblem with themselves is faced and solved—and solved on the basis of atechnique of transmutation.There is little that I can say, for you are gifted with knowledge and withwisdom; there is naught in connection with yourself that I can indicate, for youhave studied your problems deeply and I—for several years—have sought to aidyou. One thing only I will say: Your problem has far less to do with your ownindividual equipment than it has to do with your environing conditions. It is inthese conditions that you have to serve. You are excessively sensitive toimpacts from those surroundings, both from the mass and from individuals, andyou know not yet how to give in fullness and yet retain, how to go out to othersand never leave your own poised position. To stand in spiritual being —as Iearlier pointed out—is the clue to your problem. You need thus to stand and withgreater poise. A dynamic, mental focussing will save you from much depletion.If, my brother, you dwell ever on the plane of the mind, you cannot so easily bereached by the majority who contact you and who at present drain you of yourstrength. Ponder on this suggestion.~[150] MY BROTHER: January 1937You are about to enter upon a period of fuller service. Much of your life hashitherto been given to objective activities and you have forced yourself to meetimmediate needs. Now your work should become more subjective and morefar-reaching in its effect and scope. This will only be possible if you learnthe difficult lesson (peculiarly difficult to you) of leaving undone much thathas hitherto been done, and by the exercise of a wise and most carefuldiscretionary discrimination. Your work must be specific and carried forward inconnection with certain souls who warrant your attention because of theircapacity to be used upon the Path. Therefore, your work must in the future begiven primarily to disciples and not to the rank and file of people. You can,however, work with the intelligent masses, the aspirants and the probationers,through your ability to reach them with the written and the spoken word. Yourtask is not to reach the unawakened, or to write that which is popular. It isthe more specialised task of working with and cooperating with those in whosehands lies the guiding of the “little ones.” You have an avidity for service andan acquisitiveness for knowledge and for information which must now beregulated. In the past, its expression has been of value. In the present, thismust be adjusted and rightly controlled; in the future, the results of thisacquisition will be employed.Once, my brother, you placed your finger upon a major need when you spoke of the“lack of fire” which you evidence. This is, as you know, partly due to physicalcauses, but I would remind you that a physical body such as you possess canhouse a fire of such intensity (owing to its refinement and its purity) thatmany can warm themselves at it and kindle their own little flame. Make not yourphysical body a deterrent or an excuse. Use the iron will with which you aregifted and force its compliance to your soul’s demands and to humanity’s need.This appeal is one that I make to all in my group of disciples. In all of youare limitations, hindrances and certain obstacles to progress. Were it not so,you would be liberated souls and not upon some division of the Path of Approachand under my tuition, as now you are. The immediacy of surrounding [151] needand of hierarchical request for help in world work should galvanise you into arenewed and sustained effort—emancipating you from the lethargy into which it isso easy to lapse. Disciples are prone to two things (as are all aspirants) andthese tendencies they should face with courage and clear vision:1. Lethargy or the failure to use the advice and information available forpractical, experimental use.2. Self-centredness—in some subtle or obvious form.You will place yourself, I know, under those who, through lethargy, fail toachieve the utmost possible. I would point out to you that though you may havethis liability in a physical or emotional form, you have not got it mentally.You are among those who take the kingdom of heaven by violence and entertherein. B.S.D. needs this mental activity in a dynamic form, even if herecognises not the truth of my remarks.If you will ponder upon the verse which I am now going to give you forconsideration, illumination may pour in. These verses do not refer to yourrecognised lethargy—of that you are aware and with it I need not deal. Theseoccult phrases deal with things basic and oft unrecognised. If recognised, theyare not adequately appraised. Here are the verses:“One star shone forth within the dark blue vault of heaven. Then another andstill another could be seen until around the star were many shining points. Thecircle of the stars revolved and kept its place and darkness was around on everyhand. Each star within its tiny orbit kept its place and slow revolved. Itscontacts with the circle’s edge proved adequate.“‘There is but one great circle,’ came a voice, ‘not many little spheres. Somestars are small and time must feed their flame. Some stars are suns and shedtheir light on every hand. Seek out a sun and feed its life. Shed forth yourrays and live.’”~BROTHER OF OLD: July 1937In dealing with the rays which control and dominate your life I would remind youthat it is your first ray mind that gives you undoubted mental influence. Thisis felt most strongly [152] by all who contact you. Being definitely in touchwith your soul (which is in its turn under second ray influence) you have acombination of forces which is definitely useful, both to yourself and others.Your mental body is governed by the first ray.Your astral body is as definitely a second ray aggregation of energies and hencethe influence of love which you carry everywhere with you. I would remind you,however, that when the soul and the astral body are both on the same ray, thereis presented always an engrossing problem of balance. There will be, in suchcases, a tendency to a lack of balance in the total effect of the equipment andwith this—as well you know—you have constantly to deal.The physical body is of the seventh ray type but it is so controlled by yourfourth ray personality that—in a most peculiar sense—it has little life of itsown. It is negative to an amazing extent and this again constitutes a definiteproblem. Your rays, therefore, are:1. The soul or egoic ray—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.2. The personality ray—the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict.3. The ray of the mind—the first Ray of Power or Will.4. The ray of the astral body—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.5. The ray of the physical body—the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Order or Magic.I have an idea that the above statement will carry much illumination to you andthat it will enable you to make real progress.~MY BROTHER: January 1938The past year has seen the many changes which have taken place in therelationship between your soul and your personality. These have now workedthrough on to the physical plane and have brought about definite outer changesin your life and circumstance. The uprooting to which you have been subjectedshould be a cheering indication to you of the emergence into a fuller life ofservice of a much better equipped worker— [153] better, because he is a freerand less clogged channel for soul force. You have now the use of a renewed andmore forceful personality in outer manifestation. Upon this thought I would askyou to ponder and carefully reflect. If you do this, you will be enabled wiselyto make certain needed changes and adjustments which have been your innerrealised goal for some long time and which can be more easily brought about inunison with the many other adjustments which change of environment have madepossible.A period of intensified service lies ahead of you, beginning in September ofthis year. This, my brother, gives you an interlude wherein to think withclarity, to subject yourself to self-imposed discipline, and to heighten yourmagnetic vibration. Your task is not to go forth into the difficult places ofthe earth but to work from your own centre through the magnetic radiance of yoursoul. This you have always done and I ask of you no new thing but only anincreased magnetic radiance, based upon an inner freedom which makes possiblethe relinquishing of outer shackles and chains, thus gaining a liberty whichwill extend through every department of your being.In connection with the problem of service and the finding of right cooperators,I might endorse your own opinion that up till now no true well-balancedcooperator has appeared. You are asking yourself (and me) if this lack ofcooperators is your own fault and if there is anything you could do yourselfwhich would attract the right person and establish a fruitful and enduringfellowship in the work. I would reply to this subjective questioning of yours inthe following terms: Decisive action, carried forward and persisted in for theneeded period of time is, for you—as yet—only in the formative stage. I refernot to your power to speak with decision to those you seek to help—physicallyand psychologically—for that you can always succeed in doing. I refer to theability always to act with a wise, clean-cut decision in relation to yourselfand your own immediate problems. You are learning to do this and the next twoyears will see you making much advance in this matter, but you are only at thebeginning of your training. Always has your problem been that of the true secondray disciple. This involves the ability to identify yourself with others, their[154] ideas and reactions and you thereby limit and hinder your own activityfrom the indecision which arises from too much understanding and too great asympathy with the personality problems and the form side of expression. When youcan stand with greater firmness in spiritual being and when you can work moredefinitely and consciously with the soul aspect and less engrossingly with thepersonality, your life will simplify and certain of your unique personalityproblems will disappear. Then and only then will your soul call to you those whocan be your true cooperators.One hint I will here give you: Look not for those who are potential spirituallybut who are not yet expressive, but look for those mature souls who do not needyour help but who seek your collaboration as you seek theirs. You have soughtfor your collaborators among those you help, but there you will not find them.It was this idea I had in mind when I told you in an earlier communication to“seek out a sun and feed its life.” I gave you no suggestion to do more than lettime take care of those stars whose size is small and their radiance limited.One of the difficult things for humble aspirants to grasp is that peculiarmoment in their life history when they must shift into the realm ofdiscriminating work. This fits them to work as we, the teachers upon the innerside, have learned to work. We work not with all who would demand our aid butleave the “lesser lights” to be handled by our disciples and the lesserteachers. We confine ourselves to training those stronger souls, those morepotent people whose lives can be “focussed in radiance” and whose response andeffort warrant our endeavour. There are many gathered around you, my brother, towhom you have given much strength and teaching and whose tendency is to confuseacquiescence in your teaching and acceptance of your strength for the moredifficult task of achieving divine self-confidence and innate, not borrowed,strength. Let such people go and—standing as a radiant centre of magneticforce—draw to yourself cooperators in the Plan and not consumers of your energy.Go through the lists of those you have sought to help and relinquish them totheir own souls. Mind not their criticism but dedicate yourself to moreimportant work—a work [155] which will appear when you have freed yourself fromthe clinging hands of well-meaning but weak-minded aspirants. Then, around thestar which is your soul will be many “shining points.” There have been timeswhen I have been hard put to it to find you because of the obscuration broughtabout by those who surround and well nigh smother you as they cling to you.Stand Free.... Having pointed this out, brother of old, go forward towards thegoal and the vision with confidence, sure judgment and the knowledge that I, whofor years (longer than you know) have watched over your progress, am standing bywith understanding and with confidence in you.~January 1939You will note, my brother, how you reverse the problem of B.S.D. because yourpersonality ray, your soul ray and your astral ray are all along the same lineof force—the line of the second ray. I have already pointed out to you thedifficult nature of your problem which is that most subtle one of the rightbalancing of energies. You have no third ray energy in you at all (the energy ofthe ray of the intellect) and this in spite of the fact of your physicalconstitution. It accounts for your intense feeling that you have no racialrelationship to the Jews at all in spite of the fact that you are of the Hebrewrace. This is a true feeling, and the only thing which relates you to the Jewishrace is the fact that your mental body is on the first ray which is the same asthe soul of Judaea. The soul knows no distinctions or differences and on soullevels no problem of any kind exists—except the problem of understanding love .Of this you know much.Your soul ray focusses itself in and through your astral body and yourpersonality ray does the same. Hence your problem and hence the facility withwhich you can relate the soul and personality rays and can carry through theirblended energies to the heart centre. The increasing use of this line of forceis one of your practical demonstrations of the future. The second thing whichyou need to do is to take these energies of the soul and of the personality, addto them the energy of the [156] heart centre and then learn how to carry allthree to the head centre and there blend them with the power of your first raymind. This first ray mental power, you must learn to bring definitely down intothe head centre by an act of the creative imagination and hold it steadilythere....I would ask you—as far as you possibly can—to insulate yourself from fear andfrom the effect of the world situation and its allied problems. The future foryou is planned and you can take the right steps through the power of yourillumined mind. I would ask you to carry forward this insulation along the lineof love, using the ancient method which has been called “the wheel of livingfire which burns not but ever heals.” This method is occult and safe andconstitutes no barrier to relationships as does the building of a separativewall. The method is as follows:See before you a wheel of fire with seven spokes. See it immediately before youreyes. Then, by an act of the creative imagination, see yourself standing in thecentre at the hub of the wheel; there regard yourself as if you were that hub.From that central position, send out the seven streams of living love, radiatingupon the world. When you do this you serve and are, at the same time, completelyprotected. This exercise can be come instantaneous and effective. It generates aprotective force and at the same time makes you a living centre of light andlove.Be not distressed, my brother, but in calmness and in peace pursue your way.There is no life, at this time, without its difficult lot to bear, and whatmatter what it is? Love all. Serve all. Preserve your mental integrity and benot influenced by those whose hearts are bitter or whose tongues are cruel. Lifeis initiation and for this you are prepared. The crises in the life of the soulwork out along certain lines as major initiations. I am here giving you a hint.For this too you are, as you know, being prepared. I stand behind you withunderstanding and with strength. I give you my blessing, my brother.NOTE: Under the most trying conditions, this disciple is steadily carrying onand working with K.H. and serving with the Tibetan’s group. [157]~TO J. W. K-P.November 1931BROTHER OF MINE:I would conjure you to face the future with joy and optimism. Courage you alwayshave but joy you lack. With you, as with F.C.D., much of the physical planeactivity is hampered by etheric devitalisation, though the causes producing theexisting condition differ. During the past years, I have many times conveyed toyou a message the summation of which lies in the emphasis I lay on steadfastnessin meditation. Etheric vitalisation lies in meditation where you are concernedand the bringing in of energy to your physical body through its instrumentality.Diet, fresh air and freedom from concern all aid the process but the main curefor you and the source of success in all your work lies in your persistence inmeditation and your contemplative endurance.The conservation of energy is wise, yet you have untold reserves upon which todraw and as yet you use them not as you might. As before I have told you, youmake not adequate use of the meditation period and your physical body suffers inconsequence and therefore your work. There is much to be done and throughmeditation you can accomplish much. You might ask me, my brother, how to utilisethe meditation period so as to benefit from it physically. The physical bodywill take care of itself when the source of supply lies open to use. Amodification—to be made by yourself—of the attached meditation would be in orderfor you, omitting the detail of the stage of ascent but visualising the inflowof energy to the centres in the etheric body and the vitalisation, above all, ofthe heart and the throat centres. This should be carried forward in a rapid anddefinite manner and the rest of the meditation period should be given to groupwork, and to a consideration of the plans to be followed in the unfolding workof the larger group to which this group belongs.You will comprehend what I mean, brother of mine, when I repeat to you theancient formula:“Out of the lotus in the head springs the flower of bliss.Its earliest form is joy. [158]Out of the lotus in the heart springs the flower of love.Its earliest indication, wisdom is.Out of the lotus in the throat emerges the flower of living forms.The earliest sign is understanding of the Plan.”Joy, wisdom and the Plan! These are for you the three points which must bematured. For B.S.W. it was wisdom, strength and beauty. For you, these otherthree. You two are very close—closer than either of you have realised. Weaknessfor you both lies in the failure of one or other of the manifestations of powerto flourish. When B. S. W. knows the true significance of beauty and you of joy,release and fuller service will be yours.~June 1933I have the same word for you again, my brother. I say to you again and yetagain, “Let the joy of the Lord be your strength.” There is much to be done andin many ways. Steps have been taken to fit you for what you have to do. Goforward as at present. Let the Plan absorb you but remember at the same timethat it works out step by step and that the true helper of the Plan is he whovisions it as it may be in the cycle of the life but who also sees the small andimmediate step ahead. Therein lies the difference between the mystic and theoccultist.You are in much better physical condition and your registration of joy must workout also in happiness and eventually in bliss. For you, too, today I have amantram which may be of service:“Joy settles as a bird within the heart but has winged its way from the secretplace within the head. I am that bird of joy. Therefore, with joy I serve.”You will know whereof I speak when I say that your personality detachment mustdevelop into a deeper attachment to the souls within the forms. Thusunderstanding grows. There is a vice of detachment as well as a vice ofattachment and the true servant of the Plan seeks the middle way. You have asphere of potent usefulness within my group. You give stability and [159] youcarry the gift of assured belief. Each member of my group has been chosen forwhat he can contribute to the whole....~BROTHER OF MINE: June 1934I would like at this time to make the comment—one of major importance toyou—that you are now entering upon the work for which you incarnated. Themembers of the New Group of World Servers—e’en when they work without mentalrealisation (not as you do, for you know somewhat of the Plan)—are,nevertheless, working “under impression,” as it is called. Their main duty, andthe duty to which their souls call them, is to preserve an inner sensitivity.This they do in the majority of cases and, where there is not your background ofesoteric knowledge, their intense interest in their work makes them one-pointedand dedicated to their task. Therefore, all personality reactions aresubordinated to the work in hand and the lower man presents no impediments tothat impression. With you, as with all the members of my group, there is arealisation of the Plan and an inner determination to cooperate and thisfacilitates the work. For you, therefore, in the immediate future, two thingsare required. Your sensitivity to inner impression must grow and increase; yourwill also must be more dynamically used.These two points I have in view as I consider the nature of the meditation whichI must assign to you. The condition of increased sensitivity is dependent upon aperfected alignment and the other upon the right seizure of opportunity, upondirected skill in action and upon a sustained egoic one-pointedness. Therefore,there must be a preservation of such characteristics—with persistence—throughoutthe day. Your morning meditation should be of a brief and yet potent characterand can best be described by the following words: Alignment. Dedication.Directed thought. Recognition of the Plan. Clear-cut realisation. Steady Will.For you, meditation is an assuming of an attitude and its preservationthroughout the work of the day. My brother, we can translate all the above intofour stages [160] which definitely relate to your life theme, if I may so callit. Begin always with the fourth or final stage and work through to the first:1. You live with the idea and you constructively embody it. This is being orrealisation.2. The purpose becomes your purpose and your will is, therefore, the will of thePlan. Towards this higher will, your personal will is steadily directed.3. This “qualifies” your life in the three worlds and you become potentlycharacterised by the quality of the unfolding Plan. Upon this quality you mustmeditate.4. Realisation of the nature, the purpose and the quality of the Plan to whichit is your purpose to contribute. This conditions the form which your work willtake.Your task is to work with the Law of Supply. The demand is already there. Yourwork is to contribute to the success of the New Group of World Servers and tothe spreading of the truth and to do this, as ever, with joy . As the demands ofthe work increase, you must learn to preserve your physical poise and goodhealth, by due attention to food and exercise. You must learn to liveincreasingly the dual life of the disciple—a life of outer activity and of innersensitivity. You have but little to fear, for much is already accomplished uponthe inner planes. The seizure of opportunity, the recognition of opening doorsand skill in activity—to these direct your attention. Your work for the NewGroup of World Servers is now beginning. There will not be asked of you morethan you can accomplish. Use the instructions I give you and strengthen yourlink with me, for that is for you also an opening door of increased usefulness.Cultivate love for your fellowmen or rather, my brother and my friend, theexternalising of that love which you have in full measure. In this will lie therecognition of those who constitute the world group. Here D.R.S. is of serviceto you for he throws a light on people.In quietness and in confidence go forward along the Lighted Way and withexpectancy as your keynote. Preserve a readiness to handle all that mayeventuate. The link between you and your Master strengthens daily. 161]~BROTHER OF MINE: January 1935You face the three most strenuous years of your life and by the time you areforty-nine years old, your work will have fallen into such definite lines thatyou will see the Plan for future service with much greater clarity and will haveacquired the desired momentum. Your work ahead lies now in cooperating withthose who are the New Group of World Servers and in organising the financingthrough which much of their work may become possible. The work as it takes shapeon the physical plane must be directed towards the spiritual uplift of thethinking people of the world in the first case and in the second place throughthem will come the uplift of the masses.Your work must be largely selective and in the main educational. It will alsoinvolve the finding and the training of those who can cooperate. Workersincreasingly will be drawn to Great Britain and to the continent of Europe. Fromthe United States of America, the teaching must go out. But Europe is the fieldfor the educating of the world in the ideas of a true world unity and for thewise presentation of the Plan. From that continent can the inspiration go forthto the East and to the West.Go forward into this work with sure courage and with no sense of pressure. Blendthe wise methods of the present organisations with the vision of the newer typesof work. This is a spiritual work in which you are engaged and it haseducational objectives which have for their goal the dissemination of thoseprinciples which must govern world-living and world attitudes during the comingNew Age. In the presentation of the work which the New Group of World Serverscan do, certain definite and immediate possible programmes can be indicated,such as the educating of public opinion in the principle of non-separativeness.But to do this, much meditation and much clear thinking will be involved.... Thetechnique to be followed and the methods employed to arouse interest and toevoke the needed support are for Western disciples and workers to decide and notfor me, your Oriental brother. I can but stimulate your soul to clarity ofperception, to wise vision, to [162] true understanding and to right planning.The rest of the work and the materialising of the project lies in your hands andwith those who respond to the ideas presented.As regards your personal development and training, brother of old, I can butenjoin upon you a consideration of the meditation work I gave in my lastinstruction to you and a renewed effort to meet its demands. You have no ideahow a fresh access of power will come to you could you but discipline yourselfinto giving a dynamic twenty minutes each morning—prior to descending to theday’s routine.... This has for years been your problem. Yet this scant twentyminutes, taken each morning with regularity at the hour of 8 A.M. would give younot only the joy you need in your strenuous service, the power and insight yourequire to stabilise your work, but also a larger measure of physical strength.Your body nature is so constituted that it responds to spiritual healing morethan do the bodies of the majority.~July 1935I have but little to say to you, my brother, as last year I wrote to you indetail and outlined to you the work of the coming years. I change not that workor my suggestions, for if I did so there would be no true synthesis in theoutput of this group. I am working on a pre-arranged Plan of my own which wasthe result of several years’ close observation of the members of my group. Ihave seen no reason to change my original ideas or plan, because you have alldeveloped as I foresaw, though one or two of the group are learning more slowlythan the rest whilst one member of my group has unexpectedly leaped ahead.Your work is being steadily consolidated and, as you lay the foundations deepand begin the superstructure, you must guard the original idea and the initialthoughtform from all possible deterioration. The difficulty of the spiritualbuilders and the architects of the Plan only really begins when that which theyare constructing becomes public property and subject, therefore, to criticismand outer help. Then the task of preserving the original purity of idea and ofpurpose becomes onerous.[163] Be prepared for expansion of the work. But expand according to plan andnot according to emergency, for you are building in collaboration with the innerBuilders and the two structures must be counterparts. Ponder on this, yet be notrigid on non-essentials.Take the tensity of your inner pressure off the work for awhile, my brother. Themomentum at this time is adequate to carry the plans forward. Therefore, holdsteady, brood deeply but drive not.~BROTHER OF MINE: January 1936Every perfecting organism must have in it those elements of life and power whichembody the energy of the three aspects of divinity. It must likewise have thoseforce channels through which the other four types of divine energy may expressthemselves. This may be provided by those disciples who are on each of the sevenrays indicated, or by those disciples who can, through their purity andconsecration, carry any type of energy which the Hierarchy may choose to projectinto an organism through their agency. The New Group of World Servers is arapidly developing organism which must be preserved from undue crystallisationand over-organisation. It must, however, express itself through all the sevenways of divine manifestation. You and your associates have—if you so choose andbecause we have offered you the opportunity—much to do with the rightorganisation of the outer expression of the New Group of World Servers. Afterthe initial, preparatory period is over, what has been done subjectively andobjectively will be so definite in its effects that the future lines ofemergence and the policies and activities will be relatively stable andunalterable. This is a responsibility which must be faced.The task is, however, complicated because the New Group of World Servers has init so many aspirants and some disciples of whom you can know nothing; these arealso working actively and under the new impulses, frequently without being awareof their affiliation as cooperators.[164] It is necessary, therefore, for you and other members of my group ofworkers to hold yourselves sensitive to the new factors and to the people whosetask it is—equally with the group to which you belong and recognise—toprecipitate the new group activities, the new attitudes and the new techniques.Hence, again, the necessity for a trained inner attentiveness, not only to thevoice of your own soul, to my voice and to group impression but also to thevoices of those who will be attracted to the group whom you recognise bysimilarity of purpose, of method and of attitude. This, my brother, is not easy.This year should see you achieving a greater inner freedom and a clearer spiritof true liberation which will express itself in an attitude of real, and notassumed, joy and peace and a less weighed down spirit of responsibility. It mustbe remembered that this is a group responsibility. Your task is the attaining ofa keener and more sensitive reaction to subtle and spiritual impression and tothe group impulses of the New Group of World Servers.... As you go forward withthis task, the right method of approach to those working in the New Group ofWorld Servers will appear, the needed doors will open and the correct way ofevoking interest will easily become apparent. The work upon the inner planes isalready done and only the awakening of the brain and of the objective mindremains to be accomplished in connection with these individuals.One other point remains for me to touch upon. Your orientation to the Plan isright, and you have wisdom and strength. Conserve, however, your strength andremember that right relaxation is just as much a part of the service you canrender as the strenuous, unremitting work which leads to enforced and perhapsinconvenient interludes of gaining physical strength. The steady, unbroken,inner push, carried forward through right organisation of the outer factors oftime and physical strength is essential. It is not possible, unless there is abalanced life of service, of recreation and again of service.~BROTHER OF OLD: June 1936You are in process of gathering together your forces for another cycle ofactivity in connection with the New Group [165] of World Servers. Forget not,all creative processes proceed with a cyclic rhythm. The rhythm set by the NewGroup of World Servers is a three year cycle and to this rhythm you will findyourself conforming. The end of one such cycle came in May, 1936. Anothertowards which we will proceed in a mounting crescendo of work and of successwill be in May, 1939. The third will come in May, 1942. Have these datescarefully in mind and thus lay your plans for the future. Thus will you beworking with the law and along the lines of least resistance. Make each threeyear cycle conform to the rhythm of creation. In the first year, lay youremphasis upon the activity of the manifesting principle, using that whichappears and with which you have to work. In the second year, let the clarity andthe quality of the note to be sounded by the manifesting form appear and beheard. In the third year, behind the form and expressing itself through thequality, let the livingness and the work of the indwelling life emerge for allto see. Bear this in mind as you consolidate the work. The keynote of the firstyear’s work is consolidation, that of the second year must be expansion whilstthe keynote of the third year must be the making of a definite impact upon thepublic consciousness, by the sounding and the emphasising of some one clearnote. If this cyclic measure is kept thus in mind, no serious mistakes will bemade.... The New Group of World Servers must work in these three year cycles andthe foundation of cyclic attainment must be laid. This cyclic rhythm willrelease from strain and yet enable the workers in the Group to feel that thereis no failure. It is impossible to do good work where a sense of failure or lackof attainment is found.One thing I would like here to point out and that is that there are many inother countries, scattered all over the world, who have a close and intimatework to do because they are actively associated with the New Group of WorldServers. They have not yet made their contact with you or with those in myparticular group of disciples. You must learn, as must the other members of mygroup, to recognise them. Where there is a recognition of principles, ofimpartiality in service and pure intelligent goodwill, then give freely of yourtime and help. Hold out the hand of fellowship. Where there is life and the[166] type of seed is one, then the same flower will appear throughout the worldin all lands. Naught can alter the expression of the type and the genus of themanifestation. Bear this in mind.As for you, my brother, keep close to your own soul. Walk carefully andguardedly. Tread fearlessly and joyously in the light of your soul and in theblended light of your group brothers.~BROTHER OF OLD: January 1937With true first ray brevity, you have replied to certain questions which I haveput to you and yet these replies are—from my point of view—most disclosing. Withyou, as with F.C.D. and R.S.U., the main difficulty is lethargy, based on agenuine physical disability. It is not my intention, therefore, to urge you to agreater activity but to a greater organisation upon the inner planes and greaterintuitive reflection. This group of disciples has undertaken to do two things:1. To assist the work of the New Group of World Servers in linking them, widelyand consciously, to the men of goodwill throughout the world. This has to bedone in order to bring in right and new conditions upon the earth.2. To find and organise the needed funds for this task. The last is in many waysthe outer expression of the first, for just as money has been in the past theinstrument of men’s selfishness, now it must be the instrument of theirgoodwill. I commend this to you as a real thought and so to continue to use it(employing an American phrase) as a talking point.The above is simply a summation of the task immediately ahead of all of you whoare seeking to aid in our work and to this task I urge you and all associatedwith me. The walls of difficulty must go down and success must follow effort—theunited pressure of determined souls pushing through to victory in spite of realodds. This united and definite effort must be carried forward withoutdiscouragement or questioning—with due attention to the time factor and with asense of urgency. This will [167] negate all lost motion and will permit noopportunity to slide. There are, my brother, many who will give theircooperation but who, at this time, sidetrack their cooperation, owing to fear orto the over-emphasis of non-essentials. I refer here to those men of goodwillwho are today aware of the urgency of the Master’s work but still hold backassistance in full measure. There are those also who do not realise the urgencyand are unaware of the immediacy of the Plan or even that there is a Plan. They,however, when faced with the issue will give.It is not for me to deal with this problem, as we shoulder not theresponsibilities of the World Servers. I present it to you, my brother, and tomy group, and I throw behind you the weight of my strength and the stimulationof my love. One-pointed, directed effort can achieve results in spite of worldconditions, misrepresentation by those who do not understand and the failure ofresponsive interest on the part of one’s co-disciples—throughout the world orclose at hand.Brace yourself, therefore, and with the other members of my group push through.Stand steady and do not be so seriously troubled as to the progress of the workwhich seems not yet to move as rapidly as desired. When the movement does come,it will be rapid....The following three sentences may aid you in handling your problem and help yourprogress as a worker:1. The sense of responsibility shines forth in flickering flames from every soulwhich has sought and found alignment. Fan those flames into a steady fire inevery soul you meet. Ponder on this.2. The sense of sacrifice is faintly seen in every soul that loves the Plan.Teach them that sacrifice must touch the depths of giving and not call forththat which upon the surface lies or that which can be known. The unseensacrifice must go with that which can be seen. Teach this.3. The sense of comradeship is surely known by each and all of you but needs thedeepening of service shared. Shew this and draw it forth. The comradeship ofburdens shared, the sense of deep response to need, the comradeship of servicerendered, the urge to sacrifice—teach these to those who seek to work within theMaster’s plan and show all three yourself. [168]~July 1937Your mental body , my brother, is upon the fourth Ray of Harmony throughConflict. Hence your power to harmonise, to unify and to comprehend. At the sametime (thus indicating soul purpose), it took a fourth ray mental nature (withits love of harmony through conflict) to handle the particular task which yoursoul assigned, and the undertaking upon which you are engaged in the aiding ofthe Plan.Your second ray astral body greatly facilitates your work, giving youunderstanding and harmlessness; your emotions thus do not interfere with yourjudgment and your decisions. But the combination of a fourth ray mental body anda second ray emotional vehicle requires careful watching so as to preserve thefirst ray balance as you grow older and tendencies crystallise into habits. Theonly way to do this is to deepen and establish the soul contact which (althoughof the first ray) is, as you will remember, the first subray of the second ray.As you have already guessed, your physical body is on the seventh ray. Henceyour Masonic opportunity and your ability to organise and to rule. I wouldremind you all that when the statement is made that the physical body is uponthe seventh ray, it means that the atoms of the brain, in particular, arecoloured and motivated by seventh ray energy. So it is with all the rays uponwhich a physical vehicle may be found. This provides a definite opportunity tothose so constituted at this time in connection with the seventh ray, as it iscoming into influence so rapidly. At the same time it provides a problem—thatunending problem of the balancing of forces which is the major task of theinitiate or of those in training for initiation. Viewing you, therefore, as acomplete unit, your rays are:1. The soul ray—the first Ray of Power or Will.2. The personality ray—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.3. The ray of the mind—the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict.4. The ray of the astral body—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.5. The ray of the physical body—the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Order. [169]~January 1938Three words I gave to you, my friend and brother, in my last communication. Theywere: Responsibility, Sacrifice and Comradeship. I urged on you the task ofawakening the aspirants by whom you are surrounded to an understanding of theirsignificance. You comprehend them yourself, but they must be exemplified,explained and nurtured in all whom you draw into the circle of group influenceas collaborators and cooperators with the Plan. Responsibility you can shoulderand have always shouldered. Sacrifice you have always rendered and understood.Your values are sound on this and you want nothing for the separated self.Comradeship, you are learning and it is not an easy lesson at any time for firstray souls to master and express. The littleness of the personalities and thepettiness of individual points of view are irksome to the server of the Plan whostands, serene and detached, upon a first ray pinnacle of vision and resultantcomprehension.I have three points to take up with you and my message to you is brief. I seeknot to impose upon you a definite meditation, beyond suggesting that, as youface and shoulder an increasingly wide financial responsibility, you persist inthat brooding meditation in relation to the problem which I gave you a whileago. You are coming—as a first ray disciple who is proving himself—under acloser supervision by your Master. My task is now only to stand by. The threepoints which I would impress upon you are as follows:1. Waste not time in backward looking nor in futile consideration of the wisdomor the non-wisdom of past undertakings. Go forward with confidence andintensity. Months of focussed and intense action lie ahead of you and, rightlycarried forward, success awaits you in the gathering of the needed equipment todo the Master’s work and aid the Plan.2. Handle with care the force which flows through you as you shift increasinglyinto the consciousness of your first ray soul and into a first ray Master’sgroup. See to it that your second ray personality can rightly deal with thatforce, blending it with love and tempering its power with [170] understanding.The first ray force must deal with circumstance and must not make its impactupon personalities. It is needed to force issues and determine results (notethat phrase) but not to shatter and to hurt. True impersonality must be borne inmind and your personality must note its effect upon other personalities andoffset its innate and oft most useful destructive work.3. Ponder on joy, happiness, gaiety and bliss; these release the channels of theinner life and reach—in a wide circle—many kinds of men. They heal and cleansethe physical body and help you do your work with little effort, a proper senseof values and a detachment which is based on love and not isolation.In closing I would say: I am not dissatisfied with the work which has been doneby you and the workers in the field but I call you all to deeper understandingand increased activity.For you, my brother, I have this word. Let not the glamour of fatigue and ofdisappointment over world conditions lead to abortive work. Fight not theglamour which seeks to impose itself upon you with your first ray indifference—apotent attitude easily assumed by you as by all first ray types. Fight it bynon-recognition and by complete absorption in the immediate task; I refer to awise absorption which neglects no due physical care nor due time for relaxation.The work goes forward in the world along the correct, indicated inner lines. Thedisciple who has achieved a measure of sensitivity to the Whole must learn todiscriminate between aspects of that whole. You are too sensitive to the desireand feeling aspects of the world personality and the glamour of your ownreaction to this. Learn to register with equal sensitivity the mass of the worldidealisms and aspiring thought; then the glamour of fatigue and of innatedisgust will give place to a keen interest and understanding of the glamour-freedisciple.~MY BROTHER: January 1940The pressure of the work is heavy upon you and it still remains. I have noparticular instruction to give you at this time because what has been initiatedwill achieve its own momentum and travel towards its inevitable conclusion. Iwill [171] only add that the effort you are making to meet the demands of thework which I have outlined, draws forth my approval and—if persisted in—shouldprove of prolonged service to humanity. I would ask you to note the word“prolonged” because you are building for the future and, in the future, the truesignificance of accomplishment will be yours. Proceed, therefore, with patience,with skill in action and with an unmoved persistence.In reference to the work of fusion at which you must arrive in connection withyour bodily forces and your soul energy, I would call your attention to the factthat your soul energy is focussed in your physical equipment, thus bringingtogether the energy of your soul and the force of your seventh ray brain. Thereis, consequently, a direct alignment between soul and brain and this must bedeepened, understood and utilised. Your personality energy (which is of thesecond ray) is focussed in your fourth ray mind. This leaves your astral body asa unity—by itself, from our standpoint of consideration—and this is, in yourcase, as it should be. You have a powerful astral body of sufficiently poisedcontrol to proceed with the task and the solution of personal relationships,without the undue pressure of personality reactions. Some day a study will bemade of the fact that practically all reactions are of an astral or emotionalnature, except the reactions of the physical mechanism to the outer tangibleenvironment. This is not yet sufficiently noted by orthodox psychology. Thereactions of the personality to the soul and of the astral body to thesubjective life are of vital interest to the esotericist.The fusion must, therefore, be made between the mind and the brain, each ofwhich expresses one of the two major energies. That fusion already partiallyexists. When it is consummated, the mental goal of harmony through conflict willbe superseded by the inflow of love, working with power through the brain and(incidentally) your general physical health will speedily improve. How shallthis be brought about, my brother? The first stage is one of real difficulty,particularly to first ray people. It comes through the power of visualisation.That is why ritual is of value to such as you and Masonry—being on the first rayand emanating, consequently, from Shamballa—aids the process of visualisation.It gives colour and performance [172] of a tangible kind to inner, subjectiveactivity. Visualisation is a powerful agent in the evocation of the creativeimagination. Let me here give you a hint. If you use this idea in the planningof the work which you seek to do for the Hierarchy and for which we are seekingto hold you responsible, and if you carry into all that work the ideal ofritual, of rhythm and of energy distribution, you will evoke a syntheticpattern, a unified procedure and a harmonious working out of the Plan.Therefore, I would ask you to give ten minutes each day to the pictorialvisualisation of your entire work and programme. See each phase of it as a lotusof living beauty, connected with all the other phases by lines of fiery energy,thus bringing all parts of it into one whole. All the different phases will forma great unity of light and love, expressing itself through the will-to-good. Benot side-tracked when doing this. Use the building energy of your second raypersonality and the seventh ray energy of your brain, because through yourbrain, your first ray soul energy is expressing itself. You do not hereconsciously work as a soul. You work with as much soul energy as can expressitself at any given time through your brain. If you worked with pure soul energyand from soul levels, you would bring in too much of the Shamballa force for thedelicate structure with which you are dealing.Precede all that you do with a definite effort to bring about the followingalignments and in the following order:1. The alignment of all personality forces with the energy of the personality,focussed in the mind nature. This means an aligned personality with the focus ofthe attention in the intellect.2. The alignment of the personality with the soul. This means bringing themind—which is focussing all the lower energies—into direct relation with thesoul.3. The alignment of soul and brain. This is brought about by dropping thepersonality and all its forces out of your consciousness altogether and relatingsoul and brain by an act of the will.When you have done this, then swing back into the mind nature and, focussedthere, proceed with the work of visualisation, as I have above suggested. Buildyour picture stage by stage.[173] Go forward with courage, hope and joy, plus understanding, my brother.Train those who work with you with painstaking care, for much depends upon them.Remember always that you do not work alone.NOTE: This disciple is still actively engaged in the Tibetan’s work.~TO R. A. J.August 1936MY BROTHER:The press of work has led to some delay in my writing my personal instructionsto you. I realise, however, that you have much real patience and hence have feltno sense of pressure. Those of us who teach from the inner side have usually todeal with two extreme positions where our disciples are concerned. We have toprotect ourselves from the importunities of those who are spiritually selfish(oft unconsciously) and over-eager for development and teaching; we have also tostimulate those disciples, who are slow and cautious and doubtful to a moreready and “approaching” attitude. Those aspirants and disciples, who stand readyto be taught when opportunity offers, ought to continue steadfastly with theirwork even when apparently there is no inner contact. These disciples offer nostrain to the inner teacher and, in the last analysis, make the most progress.You have given your life to the craft of teaching and consequently there is nowgiven to you a more expansive view of the underlying purpose of the planetary,educational movement. In this movement, those of you who have some inner visionand who can grasp the magnitude of the Plan to bridge the gap between the higherand lower mind can contribute much to our endeavour, for you can build on mentallevels. I am pointing this out, because, for you, this inner mental work is atpresent essential—a mental work to be carried on in the egoic consciousness.This is neither the consciousness of the concrete levels of the intellect northe more abstract levels of the intuition. During the next few months the need,for you, is to work at a more instantaneous and definite alignment. To this end,you will find, at the close of this instruction, that I [174] have given you ameditation which makes this alignment its major objective.Also, in order to clarify your mind in this connection, I am going to ask you tosearch for all that I may have said regarding alignment in my various books.Will you write them all down and then, after due study of them, will you write apaper on the nature of true alignment. In this way, you will stabilise your ownknowledge and serve your co-disciples by bringing to their recollection inunified form all that I may have said. Write out each passage, my brother, infull, gathering them out of the various books and present them in orderedsequence so that the simpler instruction comes first and the more abstruse last.You might well ask at the start of your personal work with me, what I consideryour major requirement at this time. In the equipment of all disciples there isalways much that is lacking and a good deal that should be eliminated. It is,however, needless and useless to attack all points at once and, therefore, I sayto you at this time that your major need is a speedier and steadier highvibration. Your progress on the Path has been earnest and steady and your lifetendency has been directly oriented towards your goal; but your rhythm, orrather, your spiritual heart beat, is slow and this should be speeded up. Youmust move more quickly on the Path; this will come through a more active mentalattitude. The vibratory rate of the bodies differs. The astral body vibratesmore quickly than does the physical, and the mental body has a higher and morerapid vibration than the astral. It is on the mental plane and in the mindconsciousness that you must seek to live. This will enable you (after two orthree years’ work with me) to “stand in spiritual being,” a thing which at thistime you only do under strong mental stress and strain, for it is not yet a lifehabit.My blessing rests upon you in a new way, e’en though for four years I haveinteriorly worked with you.~BROTHER OF MINE: March 1937The implications of the past year, in your particular case, are not hard toread. There has been a steady unfoldment, and [175] yet at times some realdiscouragement. There has been a renewing of your determination to press forwardat all costs and yet some sense of failure, based largely upon physical fatigueand the pressures of life. No one but yourself guesses how tired you have beenat times. There have been a few high moments and a good deal of valleyexperience, but usually the steady monotony of a career which has become anestablished habit and in which you long frequently for the manifestation ofearlier enthusiasms. This is, however, inevitable and is one of the things whichoccur to disciples who are truly on the Path. The outer plane life is followedalmost automatically, and much of it falls, through habit, below the thresholdof consciousness, and produces thereby system, regularity, and good discipline.If this becomes the centre of consciousness, there is aridness, a longing forchange and for early “excitements” (using that word in its more technical,psychological sense) which would give the sense of reality to the outer work.But this trained responsiveness to environing conditions, leading, as I havesaid, to right automatic habits of response, should be regarded as a liberation,setting you free for the deepening and the excitation of the inner, subjectivelife, wherein your centre of consciousness will become increasingly focussed. Iam pointing this out to you as I feel (while I study your general condition)that this consciousness of release is one which you greatly need. The deepundercurrent of spiritual aspiration and mental attention to the impact of thesoul is much needed by you all, and by you especially.You have worked for some time at the alignment of the personality. This directedattention to the matter must have, and has, produced results, even if youyourself remain unaware of them. Others are conscious of them even if theycannot express to you wherein they sense the change.To change your meditation is not my intention but I am going to give you sevenseed thoughts and will ask you to concentrate upon them in your meditationperiod. Otherwise keep the meditation the same as earlier indicated. These seventhoughts are as follows:1st month—The Power of the Sou l pours like a steady current through my life. Isense it in my attitude to life, [176] and in the light it brings as it sweepsthrough all the aspects of my nature. May that power strengthen my will toserve.2nd month—The Light of the Soul streams forth like a beacon light upon my way;and in that light I see the light in others. I know I travel not alone.3rd month—The Love of the Soul wells up within my heart; and understanding,pity, love and self-forgetfulness arise. I carry love to all I meet. I meetmen’s love with love and remember not myself.4th month—The Joy of the Soul irradiates my life, and lightens all the burdenswhich those I meet may carry. The Joy of the Lord is my strength, and I developstrength in joy for others.5th month—The Purity of the Soul acts like a cleansing flood and bathes my lowerself in the “waters of purification.” The body of desire is rendered pure andclean and strong. I can then become a cleansing force to all I meet.6th month—The Will of the Soul becomes my will. I know no other. That will islove and peace and power and strength to live. It bears me on. It leads me tothe Cross and to the Resurrection. Thus only can I raise and lift my fellowmen.7th month—The Presence of the Soul abides with me. I walk with God by night andday. I stand with God upon the ways of men; the shadow of His Presence which isthe Presence of my soul, reveals the God on every hand, in every man. I seedivinity on every hand in every form.I think, my brother, that if you ponder upon these thoughts and if you endeavourto incorporate them into the meditation upon alignment which I earlier gave toyou, you will gain in power to do God’s will. The two aspects of yourself—thealigned personality and the attentive soul—will march towards unity.I give you no set work to do this time as I would have you carry out theinstructions last given. However, if you care to [177] note each month, thesignificance which may appear to you in your meditation work, you wouldcrystallise your vague reactions and make the power behind these mantricformulas your own.One word more I would now give to you, my brother. Stand steady and know thatyou are not alone. This group of disciples in my Ashram is not as yet anintegrated whole; its personnel is not yet complete; but it does constitutealready a harbour of refuge upon the inner planes. The love of your co-disciplesis yours. May I also tell you: I, too, “stand by” you in understanding strength.~MY BROTHER: December 1937I wonder if you have noticed (and when I say “you” I refer to all the disciplesin this ashramic group) that nearly all of you are on the second rayegoically.... The reason for this choice of second ray souls to work in thisgroup, is because this ray is pre-eminently the teaching ray, the ray that issometimes called that of “light-giving influence” or the “ray of theilluminator.” The task of all true educators is to bring light to the minds ofthose they instruct, so that they may walk more securely in the way which leadsto the goal for any particular incarnation. It was, therefore, obvious that themajor influence, dominating the group, would be that of the second ray. Theinteresting thing to note, however, is that in practically all the cases it isthe soul ray which has this predominating influence. There are no second raypersonalities in this group. This requires, consequently, much definitelyapplied activity on the part of all of you in order to cause its manifestedexpression.The next thing to note is that the personality rays are—with one exception—onthe line of 1-3-5-7, showing thereby a tendency to preserve balance and tooffset the powerfully controlling line of 2-4-6. I want this word balance to bemuch in your minds as you study the work of the Ashram and the groupinter-relation. Only the balanced person can truly meet the need of thoseentrusted to him to teach or can handle with wisdom the two lines of synthesisedforce which are brought into conjunction in every teaching process. These twolines [178] are the five lines of energy which compose the teacher’s equipmentand those which compose the equipment of the one who is to be taught.In no profession is the attitude of the observer more required than in theteaching profession, and in no profession is the correct handling of one’spersonal forces of greater importance. This realisation will produceautomatically two techniques which later we can study in greater detail: thetechnique of controlling one’s own forces so that there can be no undue ordangerous pressure, and the technique of employing pressure correctly so as toevoke response in the one being taught. This constitutes a definite science andwe shall deal with it as we proceed with our study.One of the things which I seek to do today is to give you an analysis of therays which determine your personality equipment so that you can balance yourdevelopment to the best possible advantage, and know with what forces you canwork. Another point also will emerge in time and that is the nature of theadjustment you will have to make to relate yourself to your co-disciples. Theseadjustments will be along the lines of innate predispositions and theirutilisation to the best advantage in order to bring about an understanding whichwill lead to good and creative activity.Then, my brother, I will give you and all in my group a meditation which willaid you in balancing your problem of interior ray inter-relation and, in thisway, we shall gather together some ray meditations which may prove of value notonly to yourself but to others, if used with due care. This is a thing which Ihave long wanted to do.It is known to you that your major rays are the second and the seventh. Thelatter gives to you, if you can but understand it and choose to use it rightly,the power to take the light which is in you and in the pupil, and apply it tothe enlightening of physical plane living, for the seventh ray is the raycontrolling spirit-matter relationships.Your mental ray is that of the fourth, the Ray of Harmony through Conflict, ofbeauty through order, and of unity through understanding. This, being on theline of your soul ray, will [179] tend to bring about rapid contact with thesoul, via the mind, if you apply yourself with diligence to the task involved.Your whole life problem is, therefore, that of relationships, both withinyourself and in your chosen field of service. This is naturally true of all, butyour particular battlefield in this connection lies in the reconciling of theforces warring within your own nature and in your particular environment. It isnot the Kurukshetra of the “pairs of opposites,” wherein Arjuna sits in themiddle and seeks to balance the warring forces. It is the battlefield of higherrelations—those between the soul and the personality, and between what you arein this life and the environment in which you find your chosen field of service.Your personal release lies in the production of harmony through conflict, andyour best technique is to produce this harmonising influence within yourenvironment as the result of your inner conflict, silently waged in the shrineof the mind.Your astral or emotional body is on the sixth ray, so that again you have a lineof force direct from the soul. In your case, this sixth ray energy shows itselfpredominantly as devotion to duty as realised, and to responsibility asrecognised, and not so much in devotion to persons or even ideals. This hasconstituted a paramount balancing factor in your life.Your problem will appear more clearly to you when I tell you that the ray ofyour physical body is the second.1. The soul ray—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.2. The personality ray—the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Order.3. The ray of the mind—the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict.4. The ray of the astral body—the sixth Ray of Devotion and Idealism.5. The ray of the physical body—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.This means that your entire equipment is along the second ray line of force and,therefore, much wise balancing is required. But how can this be done? And alongwhat line of difficulty will the problem, which this situation brings about,[180] be expected to emerge? I wonder if I can make it clear to you by pointingout that as the vehicles of the lower nature are on the same line as the soulinfluence, two difficulties will be present and should be recognised:1. The influence of the ego or soul will come so easily at your particular pointin evolution that the chances are that you will not recognise it; its vibrationwill be similar to the accustomed notes of your various bodies. You have,therefore, to train yourself in the art of differentiation so that you canrecognise at will the various tones of your three bodies and can easilydistinguish when there is present the tone of the soul, and react to its note orvibration. The secret of the power to distinguish the nuances of any particularline (such as your predominating line of 2-4-6) is through an increasing,planned sensitivity.2. Where all lines of influences are related and similar, there will always be atendency to negativity and a failure (except in moments of emergency) to assumea positive attitude—particularly towards the soul. What is needed in your caseis more of the positive vibration of the first ray line of force, and to thisline your seventh ray personality is the only open door. The inauguration of aregime of the power aspect of love would greatly help you. The understanding,identifying aspects of love are yours in great measure; much will come to youhowever if you use the will aspect of love through the medium of your seventhray personality. I do not here refer to the will-to-love, my brother. That youhave. I refer to the power-to-love and, through love intelligently andpowerfully applied, to evoke right conditions in your environment. I would haveyou ponder on this and do the following first ray meditation....Go forth to the day’s work expecting and looking for the results of this firstray meditation. Know that those results are assured just as long as you can“stand with power in spiritual being.”~[181] BROTHER OF MINE: August 1938It is not my intent to do more than to give you a few brief words, a suggestedmeditation and a short elucidation of certain words which should embody for youyour personality goal. You have so much study, and life today is so intense andfull that a multitude of words might fall on ears stunned by the noise andglamour of our modern world.You have had a year of strain, interior strain predominantly. I believe yourealise that you are the better for it. Only in the stress of circumstances canthe full power of the soul be evoked. Such is the law. The coming year may showbut little relief or lessening of the strain but you are (interiorly again) farbetter equipped to handle it.A word upon which I seek to lay stress is alignment . You need to develop astraight and direct contact between soul and brain for that is the distinctivefeature in all disciples of experience. You have already brought about analignment between the mind and the brain. The higher needed alignment has beenmuch bettered and you need not work so hard now at developing that capacity. Youneed, however, to employ the line of force which you have succeeded inestablishing between the soul and the personality with greater frequency andmore facility. The result of this would be that the significance of two otherwords would become apparent and you would radiate light and love and becomeincreasingly an inspiration to others. This second word, radiation , should formthe key of your life until next I instruct you. The peculiar type of radiationwhich I want you to endeavour to express is that light which reaches others uponthe wings of joy .I would remind you here that happiness is the result of achieved personalitydesire; joy is the expression of the soul’s surety, whilst bliss is theconsummation which the monad bestows upon the initiate.Prior to your group meditation, my brother, I would have you do the followingbrief spiritual exercise—as the Christian mystics call it: [182]1. Sound the O.M. three times as a personality, achieving alignment; then soundit three times as the soul, conferring inspiration.2. Then, focussing yourself at as high a point as possible and using thecreative imagination to your fullest capacity, see the radiation of love aslight pouring from the soul and raying forth as a mental influence to others, asan emotional benediction to others, and as vital life in your aura and physicalpresence.3. Sound the O.M. again three times as an integrated personality and soul, fusedand blended into one.My blessing rests upon you.~January 1939You have one glamour, my brother, which to you is well known. I will not give ita name for that is needless, and you will know whereof I speak. It is allied tofear and tunes you in on that potent and well developed world glamour. It isconnected with your astral body and your emotional desire nature. It is verypotent and of long persistence, constituting therefore, a powerful thoughthabit. Live as if it existed not. As you seek to function as a soul and to actas from soul levels, you will learn that things which are potent and apparent inyour personality consciousness are in fact non-existent; they enter not into theconsciousness of the soul. You will know to what I refer. I would, using aphrase with a modern significance, advise you “to forget” this glamour once andfor all. Let not this glamour limit the impression which you are in a positionto make as you serve within your particular sphere of usefulness. Be notdiscouraged (which is an aspect of your particular glamour) at failing to seethe results (in this life) of the conditioning which you are imposing on otherlives. Remember, as a disciple, that in this life you are establishing thoserelations which may not manifest in their true importance until you—as aMaster—gather around you your group for instruction; you are preparing forservice many lives hence.You are entering with renewed strength and vigour into the coming winter’s work.Like many today, relief and release [183] appear to lie in concentration uponyour life-appointed task; in the performance and the perfection of duty is to befound a sense of contributing to the assuagement of the world need.Nevertheless, that does not suffice for a disciple, as you will have discovered;yet it constitutes for you a problem.In teaching you, I seek to do three things:1. Give training in the initial steps of technical discipleship so that a goodfoundation of knowledge in preparation for initiation is laid for future use.2. Stimulate you to such an extent that the inner urge to express the spiritualreality (which is your true self) may overcome all the inertia which holds youdown—as it does so many—to a restricted spiritual expression.3. Integrate you more closely into the group life. I would remind you that inthis group (if it is to be a true nucleus of the group life of the future) thedisciple must recognise that it is the united group thinking, the unified groupdesire and the blended group activity which conditions its expression. This, inits turn, is the manifestation of the simultaneity and the synthesis produced bythe sum total of the similar thoughts, desires and plans of the majority. It isfor this reason, therefore, that I give you your instructions, in the hope thatthey may pronouncedly condition the group thinking and in this way produce theneeded subjective changes.I have told you that you were establishing those relations which may latermanifest. I wonder if you are proceeding in any way consciously to do so? Theserelations are of a nature different to those existing between you and yourassociates in your chosen field of work or between you and your group brothers.A disciple and later the initiate of some degree or other—from the highest tothe lowest—has a twofold relation to establish and to hold:1. With those of like degree with whom he is associated in the work. Then theirunited relation enables them (as a result of their group unity) to be en rapportwith levels of consciousness and of activities higher than their own. This is,therefore, a group relation, dependent upon the established inter-relation ofgroup members. [184]2. With those to whom he is related karmically; or by his own choice which maynot be karmic at all but a newly instituted decision; or by the choice of othersopening to him avenues of contacts which he, himself, working alone, would neverhave made but which are the result of the drawing power of the group soul.It will be of real value to you particularly to attempt to distinguish betweenthese relations; to recognise and regulate those relations which are unavoidableand which are those definitely emerging from the past. These cannot be evadedand frequently constitute—through their interplay in the life of the disciple—amajor life problem. The inter-relation between a disciple and the Ashram hasalso to be handled intelligently by him so that, by the subjective interplay,group fusion may proceed without hindrance and with dispatch. It is here that Iwould like to see closer integration and keener interest on your part. Yourgroup attitude to your group brothers is somewhat negative, is it not? A morepositive contact would be desirable.I do not here refer to a personality contact such as the word “friendship”connotes but to an outgoing on your part to them and a receiving from them whichis the higher spiritual connotation of the trite words “give and take.” What doyou give the group? What do you take from the group? Unless both exist there isno free circulation of the united thought and desire to which I referred above.Where these do not exist there is apt to be obstruction and blocking. It happensautomatically without intention and is the result of a particular state ofconsciousness. This “gentle, unrecognised withdrawing” (as it has been termed)has its basis in many things. It can be a mode of self-protection, necessitatedby long years of extreme sensitivity; this eventually must give place to theguarding of the group interests. It may be the result of shyness and of aninarticulate nature which longs and seeks for the companionship of the Way butknows not how to bring it into functioning process . It may be the result of acritical nature, for it is the critical mind which separates and divides, as youwell know. It may again be caused by a habit of loneliness, induced by inherentnatural tendencies, or by executive position and the circumstances of theindividual life, or by sorrow [185] or shock in early life experience. This mustbe balanced by an outgoing on the part of the soul which then shifts the wholeproblem of relations to a higher level of contact and brings release and thepower to communicate, which is the hallmark of group life.I would ask you to consider these thoughts with care and to ponder upon theestablishment of group relations and their recognition in your brainconsciousness, for it is your problem in connection with the group of which youare a part. To the exoteric relation must be added the inner. This I think youknow. Such a contact should be relatively easy for you as you have four rays outof the seven active in your nature and because those rays which are apt toproduce separative attitudes in the early stages of expression (the first,third, and fifth) are lacking in this incarnation.I wonder, my brother, if you have noted the relation which exists between joyand radiation—two key words which I gave you years ago for your guidance?Radiation is a tangible substance and potency, producing effects. Your radiationor “quality of effective auric contact” is recognised and evokes reaction uponthe objective plane in your immediate environment and by those who contact you.It is the subjective, consciously focussed radiation to which I here callattention. This should produce effects without physical contact, and this shouldconstitute your joyful service. Joy is the most powerful impulse behind theright kind of radiation.I would ask you: How does a Master reach his group of disciples? Through directradiation. It is the basis of all telepathic communication, group interplay, andpotent usefulness.As an exercise to foster this desirable process of effective radiation, I wouldask you for the next few months to endeavour to reach two of your group brothersthrough directed thought, joy and outgoing love. Choose any two you like andseek to establish contact. I would suggest two that you do not know personally,if possible, for that will make the exercise more directly useful, and,therefore, constitute a more adequate test.... There is need for some physicalcare, brother of mine, and also for the cultivation of a trained poise. Much youalready have as training, but much will be demanded of you in [186] the comingmonths and for this you must be prepared. Your life quality in expression isgood. Intensification is all you need.NOTE: This disciple is still actively cooperating with the Tibetan.~TO I. A. P.June 1938BROTHER OF OLD:The last few years have been for you years of strenuous activity and service, ofpersonal discipline and difficulty and of hard work, accompanied by muchexternal and interior upheaval. This you realise. It may be of some help andcomfort to you if you realise also that this is known on the inner side and thatnone of it has been lost motion or waste of time. It has been for you a time ofrelease and of liberation, little as you may grasp this fact.Since 1917, I have watched your progress and your work. This will indicate toyou how slowly we, who seek to help and guide our chelas, work. But it is bystanding alone that all disciples grow and by feeling their way and discoveringtheir own peculiar line of approach to the centre from which light streams out,and also by responding steadily and in realised loneliness to the call of dutyand service. Now, however, the time has come when you can work with clearervision, with a closer cooperation with and from the inner Centre and with lessloneliness. You have now become a part of my group of disciples and these, achosen band of brothers, are standing by you; I, too, seek definitely to makemyself known to you and to draw closer to you in helpfulness and understanding.My Ashram and those of you who are being affiliated with it are becoming closelyconnected and esoterically form one group.I would ask you to realise that in this work which we are planning to dotogether, we work with complete and open frankness, seeking to hide nothing fromeach other. We will [187] bring into the open the successes, the failures andthe weaknesses and look at them together in the clear light which comes from theCentre and in each other’s presence. Such is the method of the New Age groups.The utmost impartial impersonality is our goal, for such an attitude sets usfree for deepened service.I am communicating with you, my brother, as with a trained worker and as one whohas proven his willingness and his ability to serve and to make sacrifices forhis fellowmen. Our objective is to function as a group, pledged to a unitedservice in which all personalities are submerged and only the light of the soulshines forth. In that light, you will see light on your problems, bothindividual problems and those arising in connection with the group or in yourchosen field of service. Two things I would like, however, to bring to yourattention at this time and only two:First, that as you work and serve and strive to train yourself, you must learnto “go out” more definitely to others, offering them the opportunity to serveand help in the work you are endeavouring to do, no matter how inexperiencedthey may be or how full of faults. Ponder on this and seek to work our way, forthis is ever what we, the teachers and guides on the inner side, have to do. Weoffered you opportunity and you must also offer opportunity to others.Secondly, be not weighed down or over-distressed by the weight of the ignoranceand the lack of development of the masses whom you see around you. The psychicatmosphere of the countries in which you work is peculiar and most difficult forthe disciples who are working in connection with us, the workers in the GreatWhite Lodge. It is easier for chelas who work in connection with the . . . . . .Brotherhood (a branch of our activities). Such chelas do not, however, work withthe intelligentsia or with the pioneers of the race or with the thinkingaspirants. They work with the quality of spiritual aspiration to be found in theherd, in the mass, and not with or in the individual. They do not work with thetype of person whom you can reach. I mention this because I know well the deepdiscouragement which can assail you as you react to the massed psychicimpression. Release yourself from [188] it in the assurance that the Great WhiteLodge is working for the aspirants and that the . . . . . . Brotherhood isworking with the illiterate and ignorant masses. It is one work but delegated todifferent groups who work in the closest possible association.I am assigning you no special work at this time, for your time is fully occupiedin service. I suggest a meditation to you....~BROTHER OF MINE: January 1940I would suggest to you that your major danger at this time lies in a glamourwhich is the result of loneliness. There are certain glamours which work out asthe result of a too close and restricted inner, spiritual life and an imposedintrospection. Having no one to whom to talk and being far from your spiritualbrothers, you are much alone; and being in a position of the one who teaches andwho gives, you stand somewhat isolated and have withdrawn yourself—perhapsunduly, even if unavoidably—from the personality angle. This results in yourcreating a potent thoughtform of aspiration, of spiritual interpretation and ofspiritual aims and goals. But this constitutes a thoughtform, my brother, nomatter how lofty in nature, and can result in a pronounced glamour and aglamorous control in some form or another. It can speak to you and conditionyour psychology and of it you should be aware and so on guard; you shouldrecognize it as your own creation, to be conditioned and controlled by you andnot vice versa. You will, I think, know to what I refer.Free yourself from this glamour for the sake of the service you have soefficiently rendered to us. Learn to recognise that the time limit is brief andthat for you (as for your fellow disciples and for A.A.B.) only those thingsmust be done which are of service to the whole and which are already set inmotion. The initiating of new endeavours when the time in which to completethose for which you are responsible is relatively brief can constitute a glamourof a most handicapping nature. I thank you for what you have done in our serviceand I ask you [189] to go forward along the lines you have already so firmlyestablished.NOTE: This disciple is still struggling, under conditions of great lonelinessand in one of the Latin countries, to carry out the Tibetan’s work and doing somost successfully.~TO S. S. P.May 1934MY BROTHER:We are to work together for a while and I seek to help. Your first objective isto set up an understanding relation with your group members and with myself. Nogroups belonging to the Masters or affiliated with Their Ashrams, such as arenow planned under the new impulse emanating from the inner side, can functionadequately unless there is willing and voluntary cooperation between the unitswho compose the group. This is not always easy.You have been asking yourself on what grounds have you been chosen out of themany possible aspirants to do this particular work? Partly for karmic reasons,my brother—a karma that has touched mine at various points, and partly becausethe inner light has been fanned to a flame by your faithful adherence to theordained duty. This warrants a further fanning of that flame by those of us whoare seeking helpers in the outer world. Your objective is and has been service.This we know and to increase your capacity to serve is my objective. Are youwilling to be taught and will you voluntarily attempt to conform to mysuggestions? You can at any time cease to work and can drop out at will. Thereis no compulsion in this work of service which love of humanity and of the GreatOnes calls forth.Your attention has not primarily been fixed on the art of healing, yet youcan—if you will—heal with potency those emotional ills which are deep-seated inthe astral body; this latent and unrealised power of yours must be developed andbrought to usefulness. Some people heal those afflicted with physical ills. Somework in the field of psychology and deal with those [190] troubles which have amore mental basis. Others (and you amongst them) can aid in stabilising theemotional or astral bodies of those distraught. This I can teach you to do. Butfirst of all, we must get you into a better organised condition so that you canpresent to your soul an aligned and clear channel through which spiritual forcemay flow.For a while the focus of your attention must be upon the heart centre. To thisend, a meditation which you will find in this instruction will be of service toyou if you will work at it for the space of six months....Your main difficulty and the main hindrance to your usefulness lies in theover-activity of your mind; this does not make you especially critical of otherpeople but it does keep you yourself in a constant state of questioning and ofbewilderment about the fundamentals by which humanity lives. A questioning ofthe unanswerable is a waste of time, my brother. The attempt to define theundefinable and to measure the mind of immensity is futile. Work, therefore, atthe production of that inner mechanism of contact which exists as yet only inembryo within your personal ring-pass-not. Remember that only through rightmeditation, useful thinking, and the practice of harmlessness can this mechanismbe duly developed. When developed, the futility of your questioning will beseen, for you will know the truth and the truth shall make you free. Think withsimplicity.I give you, my brother, a special piece of work to be done during the next sixmonths. In my various books and writings I have referred much to healing and tothe new developments in relation to the etheric body. Will you go through all ofthem and cull from them passages which have reference to healing in any form andto those passages which deal with people connected with the healing art. Thuswill you serve me and my group of disciples and make that which I have said moreeasily available in compact form for the group use. This will be a real service.To you I give this message: Seek not the reason yet for all that does appear,but learn to love and do. Work from the heart and not from the head and balanceyour unfoldment. With heart and head aligned, the healing force can flow withpower through you to others.~[191] MY BROTHER: November 1934I have but little to say to you this half year, so brief a time have you beenworking in this group. The doors of opportunity have opened wide for you, foryour increased stimulation (through your group affiliation) has so enhanced yourpotency that your vibration attracted attention where your words on occultmatters would have fallen on deaf ears. Herein is your field of service andherein lies your test. Particularly for you the word magnetism should beconsidered. You have some definite magnetic power. This you know. But throughwhich centre will it flow, and via which body? I give you here a thought and Iindicate to you a field of awareness, concerning yourself, that you should learnto master. Some day you will be forced to face the issue and decide from whatplane and through which body you will work. Will you be mentally magnetic, andstimulate the mental bodies of those you serve, or will your magnetism be astraland feed the emotional nature of those you contact? Animal magnetism is not whatinterests you, but that which you have can be consecrated, through reticence andcontrol, to service. Egoic or soul magnetism should be your goal, and from thatpoint of soul influence you can some day work. But as the soul makes magneticall three bodies, you must learn control and right use; otherwise soul force,pouring through that which is uncontrolled, will inevitably destroy.Keep on with the same meditation. Later I will give you an entirely new mode ofmeditation, if you proceed with this as desired. I would ask you to keep carefulmonthly records. They need not be long but must be sincere. Note specificallyand accurately your emotional effect upon:a. Your family.b. Your associates.c. Those to whom you lecture or preach.d. The lives you touch each day.Note this, brother of old, and enter on your record in your spiritual diary.Thus will you learn to work and understand.[192] Study again with care what I said to you a few months ago and may theclarity of light guide your heart, your thoughts, and aspiration.~MY BROTHER: June 1935During the coming six months I am going to ask you to do two things: First ofall, concentrate your energy each day and do not dissipate it in so manyunrelated activities. A wise conservation of energy and the elimination ofnon-essential activity is for you desirable at this time; it will bring about aninner organisation of your forces which in a year’s time will greatly increaseyour usefulness in service.Secondly, I want you to lay emphasis in your meditation on the simple, andapparently elementary, stage of alignment. The work of watching each day youruse of energy, and your meditation practice in alignment will produce in you agreatly increased efficiency. Your alignment is weak. Your motives are all thatcould be desired from the angle of your knowledge; your devotion to the cause ofhumanity is equally right; your liking for your fellowmen is very real. Yourmind is active and alert, and you are deeply interested in life and in all thatconcerns human relations. But your coordination and your alignment are not good.The coordination factor is that which governs the integration of yourpersonality—mental, emotional and physical—whilst the alignment factor isrelated to the control by your soul, and the establishing of a direct line ofcontact between your soul and your brain, via your mind.Figuratively speaking, there is a lack of steady contact between the mind andthe astral body. Here is the weak place in your alignment. When you are mentallyalert, which is quite often, a temporary coordination is set up and there iswhat one might call a momentary alignment. But the moment your mental activityceases there is a complete break. You then function as a sentient, emotionallyvital and active person, with the mental nature remaining outside the loweralignment.I told you earlier that you could work as a psychological healer. This is true.But your knowledge of modern psychology is as yet weak; you should read andthink more definitely along [193] academic lines for that will aid in bringingabout the needed integration and coordination.In the production of alignment during meditation, I will ask you to do thefollowing exercises, in breathing and in focussing. You know well, do you not,my friend and brother, that the more disciples are aligned and coordinated, thegreater will be their power in service.Therefore, attempt the following breathing exercise, paying particular attentionto the interlude, and to the line of thought which you carry forward duringthese interludes. This is, for you, a somewhat difficult task, yet the interludeshould be the easiest and most effective part of the meditation work. Aninterlude, properly held and utilised, is one of the preparatory steps towardsthat occult phenomenon, called by the oriental teachers, samadhi ....Then meditate deeply during the next six months on the following six phrases,holding the consciousness as high in the head as possible, and attempting tohold the mind steady in the light and aligned with the brain.1st month—May the light of the soul illumine my mind, and shed a light upon theway of others.2nd month—May the love of the soul control my lower nature, and guide me in theway of love.3rd month—May I act as a soul in all my ways, and thus awaken others to a rightactivity.4th month—I teach the way to others. I seek to contact souls, not minds.5th month—As a soul, I serve my fellowmen.6th month—I place the torch of truth in other hands, and from my torch theylight their light.If you follow these simple suggestions, my brother, you will be surprised at theresults which will appear in a year’s time. Simplicity is the way of soulgrowth. Be simple.Each month, write a simple summation of your thoughts and service as you workwith the monthly seed thoughts. Endeavour to make these six papers of realmental value to others, and also see, if possible, that they have a magneticvalue [194] and that they breathe out, not only mental understanding, but alsoan emotional appeal. Attend likewise to the form in which you cast them for thatwill be the symbol on the physical plane of your inner alignment.~January 1936I have very little to say to you this half year, my brother. The meditation workand the exercises assigned to you in your last papers were intended to coveryour work for the period of one year.... I would ask you to study your lastinstructions with exceeding care. All I intend to do is to give you a new seriesof seed thoughts. Your coordination is better, but your alignment is still weak.One of the objectives, which you should have steadily in view, is the constantcultivation of the attitude of the observer, of the one who assumes and holdsthe position of the perceiver. This you are beginning to realise, for I note inyou a closer attention to the daily duties of the disciple, and a more observantattitude towards yourself, and towards what you do and say and think. Thisreaches, likewise, to your life on the astral plane, and you are becoming awareof the dreams and experiences in the hours of sleep. Remember ever, however,that these also are a part of the great illusion. The goal is to develop thepowers of observation which are those of the soul, and the cultivation of thepower to register, through the medium of the brain, the thoughts of that divinePerceiver.In order to achieve this attitude there is no need for you to subject yourselfto constant criticism. Each day, however, subject yourself to a brief and exactanalysis. I suggest for your personal use a form of evening review.... Have thethought of the divine Perceiver as you work over it each day, and seek to seeyourself in the light of that spiritual perception. It is not necessary, mybrother, to do this at night, if the hour, fatigue or your duties should renderit inconvenient. Do it once in the twenty-four hours and do it with care.Disciples everywhere have to work hard at the task of self-perfecting for theworld situation demands trained and skilled workers. No group can be used inworld service that is not working in perfect accord and this harmony must beattained as a group . It must be brought about, not through the process [195]whereby people withdraw within themselves and thus inhibit that which upsetsgroup equilibrium, but by the process of loving self-forgetfulness. You havewithin yourself a good deal of steady staying power, and you have also adefinite capacity to radiate. Use these powers as a contribution to your grouplife, and, by means of your loving radiation, strengthen the group structure,and stimulate the group love. This is something I ask you definitely to do.My brief instructions to you can be summed up as follows:1. Keep your meditation as heretofore.2. Follow carefully the review work assigned you.3. Above everything else pay close attention to reaching me, if possible, at thetime of the Full Moon and give to the five days thereof your constant thought. Iam anxious to see a greater emphasis built up this year in connection with yourcontact with me, your teacher and your friend.One other point I seek to make, my brother, whom I hope to see drawn into acloser relation of service. This point may be regarded by you as in the natureof a criticism. From my point of view and lucidity, it is the pointing out of ahindrance to your progress; it is in the nature of a stone or rock over whichyou might stumble as you tread the pathway towards the light. You have, as youknow and as I have told you, a very critical mind; you are full of response to,and recognition of, the weaknesses and frailties of your family and associates.Let not this grow upon you, but let it cease, for it builds a barrier betweenyou and them, and obstructs and hinders your service.The seed thoughts on which I would ask you to meditate are as follows:1st month—The heart as a radiating centre of love.2nd month—The radiance which shows itself as joy.3rd month—The will, as directed by love and expressed in freedom.4th month—Speech as an expression of a heart at rest.5th month—The power to dwell, unmoved, at the centre.6th month—The personality, as a reflector of the light of the soul.~[196] MY BROTHER AND MY FRIEND: December 1936One of the secrets of true life, which is beginning to emerge in yourconsciousness, is that of being . It must take the place of doing . Life has soarranged itself for you that activity is the way of expression and the line ofleast resistance. The pressure of the times in which you live and the need ofthe world have definitely forced you to be active in a fairly large environment.So do our souls arrange for us the major ways of life! But there is slowlydawning upon you the realisation that by “standing in spiritual being” (morethan by any specific activity) you can express the deep basic trends of yourlife, and make yourself of value in your surroundings. This is predominantlyyour life lesson and, my brother, you are just beginning to learn it.For you, radiation is the keynote. And you can radiate. For you, the goal is tobe a channel and no more and no less. This is the outstanding requirement anddemand of your soul from your personality. This, I believe, you already know,and a study of your soul and personality rays should make clear to you why, inthis life, this is so.The ray of the mind, the fourth ray, is the controlling ray of your personality,and that means that the power to react to soul illumination is yours. The goalof your meditation should be light . I would point out, however, that in yourcase it is one of quiet reflection and inner recollection, preserved at alltimes. This permits you to be a channel for the inflow of light to yourpersonality and, through your personality, to your environment.I am not, therefore, going to give you a definite meditation upon light, but amgoing to ask you to make light the subject of your daily review. I call it notan evening review as I care not when you do it, as long as you do it once withineach twenty-four hours, taking one or two of the questions in the review,reflecting deeply upon it during the next six months. Then each month answer oneof the six questions I here set you, one question each month.1st month—What, to me, is the practical meaning of the word, light? [197]2nd month—In what manner can my life be illumined?3rd month—What is the factor producing illumination, and does this factorfunction normally in my life?4th month—What effect will an illumined mind have upon my daily life?5th month—What effect should my life as a Light-bearer have upon my environment?6th month—Am I in touch with other Light-bearers, and in what manner?Let your replies to these questions be brief but full. Yes, I mean exactly whatI say, my brother, “brief but full” for this is largely a question of terseterminology but of concise definition. Continue also with the group meditation,but write those brief reports, not only for your own illumination but also forthe enlightenment of your group brothers.In connection with your personality rays, I would point out that the ray of yourmental body is that of the fourth, which facilitates your task of responding tothe light of the soul, for it gives you a mind nature which can react easily toyour second ray soul, for it is on the same line of force. At the same time, itmakes your mind a focal point for soul force in your fifth ray personality,which is itself a mental ray. The building of the antahkarana should constitutefor you no real problem.Your astral body is on the sixth ray. This gives you a one-pointed attitude tolife and primarily, in your case, to the things of the spiritual world. You aredefinitely “on your way” and with a quite satisfactory simplicity are goingforward. This ray also enables you to make a fairly facile soul contact, shouldyou so desire. Your rays, therefore, are:1. The soul ray—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.2. The personality ray—the fifth Ray of Concrete Science.3. The ray of the mind—the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict.4. The ray of the astral body—the sixth Ray of Devotion or Idealism.5. The ray of the physical body—the third Ray of Active Intelligence.[198] What, therefore, constitutes your major difficulty, for you are notsatisfied yourself with your progress, and rightly so?The main reason lies in your fifth ray personality, wherein the emphasis is laidupon the critical, analytical mind. This leads you to watch and criticise and toargue with yourself and with circumstances. It also lies in your third rayphysical body which, again upon the mental line, increases the activity of yourcritical personality. It is yourself, however, whom you mainly criticise, butthis can be as wrong and as unnecessary as criticising others. If you will letyour soul influence your personality more definitely, working through yourfourth ray mind and your sixth ray astral body, studying and utilising theselines of least resistance, you will make rapid progress towards that goal youhave set yourself in this life—the integration of soul and personality.Be not discouraged, my brother. If you and all your group brothers will work onthese ray ideas and deal with yourselves as unified wholes and not withyourselves as composites, you will soon be ready for group work in healing. Forthis I am planning.REVIEW ON LIGHT1. What constitutes a review?a. What, in my estimation, would constitute a reviewing of my day with the ideaof Light predominating?b. In a review, am I asked to re-do or re-experience, or should I assume theattitude of the Onlooker, who stands “steady in the light ?”2. Am I capable of learning to walk in the light and thus finally of achievingillumination?3. Can I see myself mentally as standing in the light of my soul and do I knowthe meaning of steady reflection?4. If I use this review on light as it should be used, what will be the effectin my life, and what will be the effect in the life of the group whom I serve?5. Can I honestly say that I know how to stand aside as a personality and turnthe light upon the problems of my daily life? [199]6. For what reason do I want to walk in the light ?a. Because I seek personal illumination?orb. Because I want to help in enlightening those around me?7. If this review work is a definitely scientific method of bringing aboutsubjective results with objective changes, what will these results and changesbe?8. What basis can I find in my study work which would indicate that I could beillumined and thus intensify my capacity for service and my increased usefulnessupon the Path?9. Is my progress upon the Path of importance? Why?10. If it is true that the blind must advance by touching , but that those withsight move by seeing , and by keeping free and unattached, why then, havingsight, do I not walk more definitely in the light ?11. Is my mind the organ of vision for the spiritual man, and am I offering thisorgan to the higher self to use?12. Can I hold the mind steady in the light ?13. As I review my day, what part has illumination played?14. How do I define the phrase “light of the Soul”?15. Light is a quality of the soul. In that light,a. Can I forget the fragmentary personal self?b. Can I recognise the one self in all selves?16. We are told that there is an archetype, a pattern, a ray, a goal and a lightwhich shines from the Path.Realising this, do I know anything of the freedom from worry which shouldenlighten my way?17. In what manner is the light reflected in my life?18. Do I recognise my fellow pilgrims on the way of light?19. Can I draw consciously upon the light when others need it?20. I am the redeemer of the lower nature. In what manner does light aid thisredemption?21. Has there been one moment this day in which the light has poured through me?22. The nature of the soul is light . Experience of this light is achievedthrough mind control. What does mind control signify to me? [200]23. By what problems and on what occasions is the light in me most easilyevoked?24. Have I brought light to others today?25. If I did demonstrate light , did I do it consciously or did it just pourthrough me?26. What activities and qualities of my lower nature need to be eliminated ifthe light is to lighten my way?27. What is the main hindrance to my enlightenment?28. In what manner can I use the light in order to help my fellow-men?29. In what way can I most truly serve my fellowmen?~MY BROTHER: August 1937During the past six months, you have made definite progress and are now far moreof a strength, inner and stable, to my group than you have ever been. Preservethis stability and this freedom from criticism which you have in some realmeasure achieved, seeing to it that this stability does not crystallise into astatic condition or this freedom from criticism does not interfere with thequality of free analysis.This group of disciples is more aligned, and integrated, than it was and if thisintegration proceeds and rapport is more strongly established, we can indeedproceed to work later on. This work is, in the last analysis, dependent uponcertain rightly established rapports:1. Between the group members and myself, your Tibetan Brother.2. Between the group, as a whole, and the Hierarchy.3. Between this group of chelas and other groups in my Ashram.4. Between the individual members in the group.I would ask you to ponder on these matters.I have said that I would deal with the rays of the personality vehicles duringthe coming instructions, so that you can realise your individual problem moreeasily and, therefore, more quickly fit yourself for service. As you know, yourpersonality [201] ray is the fifth and your mental ray is the fourth and the rayof your physical body is the third: 5-4-3. These are the Rays of ConcreteKnowledge, of Harmony through Conflict (wrought out, therefore, in your case inthe mind nature) and Active Intelligence. It will be apparent to you then, ifyou think clearly, why your physical vehicle is such a good response apparatusto mental impression, and why your life problem is tied in with the physicalplane location or environment where your personality finds itself. Your problemscome far more from your circumstances and your environment than from withinyourself. Is this not so, my brother? This is not so usual a condition as mightappear. You are singularly free from inner complexes but also singularlyresponsive to outer circumstance. Ponder on this, because it will make your wayof life more clear, and will greatly facilitate your progress on the Way.The inhibitions to the free play of the light of the soul through you in yourenvironment are not be found in any particular mental or astral reaction but inthe response your entire personality makes to your outer environing conditions.That response produces an outer swirl of forces in your aura wherein comesopportunity for your fourth ray mind to produce harmony through conflict, andskill in action, which is the true significance of the subsidiary names of thisray, called frequently the Ray of Art or Beauty. It is the ray of creativeliving, and not creative art. Creative living produces beauty and harmony in theouter life, so that others can see the achievement.How can this skill in action be produced? How can this predisposition of yoursto produce harmony in spite and because of conflict be facilitated? By astrongly mental meditation which will bring in the light of the soul, which, inyour case, is love-wisdom, and bring it in such power that the combination ofwisdom and of skill in action (in order to manifest harmony) will produce theemergence of the inner pattern into the outer theme of your daily living. Iwould point out to you that you are more strongly on the wisdom line than on thelove line, and, under our plan of individual analysis, you would be listed as onthe “Buddha Way” more than upon the “Christ [202] Way.” To work this outeffectively, you should concentrate your attention upon this theme of wise andskilful living , as it expresses itself in your environment. This will tend toextrovert you very considerably, to focus you on physical plane living, and tobring your brain consciousness (and consequently your outer activities) intoline with soul wisdom and soul desire.There is no particular need for you at this time to pay much attention to yourastral or emotional condition. Focus your inner attention in two aspects of yournature: the soul and the brain, through the use of the illumined mind. You willsee, therefore, why I asked you the questions I did in the last instructions,and required your defined answers.I will give you a fourth ray meditation which must be carefully followed by youuntil you next hear from me. Do this meditation rapidly, at a point of tensionand of fusion, and do it dynamically with all the power of your illumined willbehind it....Proceed with confidence, my brother, knowing that all is well. You have twomajor physical plane problems which are well recognised by you and are known tome. Solve them, if possible, during the coming six months by the aid of thethoughts which I have today given you.~BROTHER OF MINE: May 1938It will, I know, be a source of great satisfaction to you that some in my groupare starting definite group work in healing. You are on the active line and itwill be of peculiar benefit to you to thus cooperate, for it will do more tointegrate your personality and your soul into one functioning unit than anyother one exercise. For this reason, I do not intend to do more than give you ashort breathing exercise which I would ask you to carry forward regularly beforedoing the group meditation. This exercise will aid in swinging your variousbodies into a rhythm which will facilitate the downflow of the healing forcewhich—in this group work—must come from the soul. The group is not reallyworking (as does the average healer), with the etheric prana....[203] This exercise will build up a closer group rapport and is in the nature ofa special service which you are rendering to the group, and will establish akind of rhythmic impact upon the patient, thereby weaving a path of light to himalong which the healing energy can flow.Your last instructions are full of suggestions to you which should becomeclearer and more helpful as you study them and bring to them a growinginspiration. I would ask you to study them in the light of your gainedexperience and the new assignments given to my disciples.There will be for you several important changes during the next two years, bothin your life and your environment. Be prepared to recognise them and to gainfrom them that inner development which the right handling of the presentedsituation should—and will—give.This is all I have to say to you at this time, my brother.NOTE: This disciple is still loosely affiliated with the Tibetan’s work and isstill, on occasion, in touch with the Tibetan. Of him, the Tibetan remarks thatthis affiliation is permitted because “he lived fully up to the light that wasin him and that his failure (if so it might be called) was due to the fact thathe was at the very beginning of the Path of Discipleship.”~TO C. A. C.August 1937MY BROTHER:You have been asked to serve in my group of disciples for three reasons. Itmight interest you to know what they are, for then you can serve moreintelligently, and that is ever your desire. I give them to you in order oftheir importance, beginning with the least important at the present time andyet, perchance, with one which you can most easily recognise.1. An ancient karmic link with me, your Tibetan Teacher, and also with aco-worker, in a chosen field of service.2. A basic and lifelong interest in the field of education. This will make ourchosen theme for study to have much significance and interest for you. [204]3. A definite and recognised inclination towards all that concerns the New Age.It is this consciousness of the new incoming influences which has brought youinto a New Age group.I am glad, my brother, to have you associated with this group and I believe thatyou will benefit much, as well as bring much of benefit to others. Such work asyou are now undertaking brings with it its own difficulties and problems. Theseare not yet particularly apparent as the group is only in process of integratingand the true group problems (to which I am here referring) can only emerge afterthe group brothers have worked together for some little time. They are problemsof temperament and occasionally of injudicious action, problems of understandingand of interpretation, and also problems of application of the peculiar New Ageteachings to the present time. This latter problem involves also the problem ofright compromise, and a true sense of the time values.The life period ahead of you is that of the sannyasin , of the one who—havingtasted to the full of life experience—is now dedicated to the life of spiritualvalues and to their teaching to others. Ponder on this.I am assigning you no special work. I would ask you to study the instructions Ihave given to this group with care and with as much speed as is consistent withcareful study and understanding. You can then take up the work intelligentlyalong with the other group members, and proceed with them to the next step andthe next unit of teaching.I know you have thought much upon the subject of which rays condition you andwhich forces are available for you to use. Let me tell you what are your raysand the dominant forces with which you have to work in this incarnation:Your soul ray is the first Ray of Will or Power, as is also the ray of yourphysical body . Hence, if you so choose, comes the facility and ease with whichyour soul can impress your brain. This tends also to make you very intuitive,though not at all psychic. It gives you—again if you so choose—organising power,and the use of a dynamic, spiritual will which can carry you through and overall obstacles. Use it, my brother, with greater frequency—not on others but onyourself and in connection with anything you seek to do in the working-out ofthe Plan.[205] Your personality ray is the second Ray of Love-Wisdom and this enables yousafely to evoke and use your first ray Will, for it will then be inevitablymodified by your personality focus. You will note, therefore, how this tends tomake you fairly well-balanced, when you act as a personality or as a soul.Your mental body is on the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict and this, attimes, upsets your balance and your equilibrium. Your desire for harmonysometimes produces short-sighted vision and you tend to act precipitately. Whenthis occurs, you later discover that you initiated conflict instead of havinginstituted harmony, as had been your original intention. But you can learn muchthereby, because, in the last analysis, the fourth ray governs humanity itselfas well as this planet, the earth; your fourth ray mind can always, therefore,put you in touch with the world of men, and do it with greater safety than canyour emotional nature. This fact, coupled with the wisdom and love of yourpersonality, should aid you greatly in the task of working with people which isyour chosen field of endeavour and expression.Your astral body is, as I dare say you have suspected, upon the sixth Ray ofDevotion. This gives you idealism, devotion to causes, your power to sacrificeand your determination always to produce good out of seeming evil. This lattercharacteristic is outstandingly yours. I would like here to call to yourattention that there is a lack found in your equipment of the modifications ofthe first ray line of energy. You have none of the forces of the third, fifth,or seventh rays in you at all. Balance is preserved through your first rayaspects. Therefore we have:1. Your soul ray—first Ray of Will or Power.2. Your personality ray—second Ray of Love-Wisdom.3. Ray of the mind—fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict.4. Ray of the astral body—sixth Ray of Devotion.5. Ray of the physical body—first Ray of Will or Power.~MY BROTHER: August 1938I feel that if you had to define just what the past year of experience andservice has given you that you would register it [206] as a sense of greaterinner certitude and assurance, particularly in service. You will find thatassurance is held before you as the goal of your spiritual endeavour. You havemade much progress towards this goal lately and your first ray soul can anchoritself firmly in this personality quality and can do so with safety as the graceof humility is fundamentally natural to you.Your field of service is growing, which is ever the reward of service rendered.You have now also gained a release from much ancient responsibility; this shouldleave you still more free for the future. What the future can hold for anyperson, it is not possible these days to foretell, for planetary conditions aresuch that no forecast is unalterably correct—not even for a member of theHierarchy. For you, there will be the need for decision on various points and tothis end I call your attention to another quality which is Consecration . Letall changes take place in your life as the result of right decision which must,in its turn, be based on a true soul orientation and dedication. Decisions mustnot be made as the result of any outer influence.You might ask me at this point upon what a right decision should be based and Iwould reply in the following terms:1. On that which offers itself to you as spiritual opportunity but which can becarried out without relinquishing right and inescapable obligations. I say rightobligations and not personality inclinations.2. On that which will give you a wider field of service so that all your powersand gifts and acquired talents may be called into play and give you that roundedout development which will equip you for your next life of activity.3. On that which can be done best by you and by no one else. Doors open andclose and the disciple in training has to cultivate that spiritual, instinctualresponse which will enable him to know through which door his soul desires himto pass.The only exercise I am going to give you at this time is to ask you to take fiveminutes, prior to the group meditation, for pondering on the familiar words, “Inquietness and in confidence shall be your strength.”~[207] MY BROTHER: January 1940The glamour which constitutes your major limitation is in a peculiar sense atime glamour and affects you in two ways. One way affects you in strict relationto yourself and of it no one is aware; and the other affects all that you do onthe outer plane of appearances and of daily living. In the adjustment of thesetwo and in the attaining, first of all, of a mental attitude towards time asimmortality and, secondly, of a command of time so that it is the agent ofcreative beauty in your life, you will master the last lesson which thisparticular incarnation has been intended to teach you. I do not desire to bemore explicit.As you steadily study time from the forward looking angle and time in referenceto the future, you will discover an emphasis which needs altering in yourthought life; as you study time in reference to the daily task, you will bringinto your output of service to humanity and for us, a directed synthesis and anenhanced potency which is at present lacking. A sense of time and of itsrelation to the soul is one of the most absorbing and useful studies of thedisciple; an understanding of the relation of the past to the future and theirunited effect in the present will create one of the levers which will open foryou the Door of Initiation. I believe, my brother, that if you will meditateupon this that you will conclude—as I have done whilst studying you—that controlof the time factor is the main need at this time. It will be for you to give aname to the particular glamour in connection with threefold time which is yourmain hindrance. Work at this problem during the coming year and, as you work,clarification will come. You will note that I am not here dealing with faults.At your particular age, life habit, developed tendencies, acquired good, andunconquered faults are firmly established. Go forward with your equipment as itis in full self-forgetfulness but seek to establish a rhythm in connection withtime which will eventuate in a re-organisation, a fuller service and a moreeffective expression of the soul. Study, if you care to do so, the significanceof rhythm as it produces melody and causes harmony.~[208] BROTHER OF MINE: July 1940You have had much of strain, difficulty and mental readjustment during the pastyear, but then who has not in these days of world strain, world difficulty andworld adjustment. I would point out here that enforced adjustment (from whichthere is no escape) is one thing and simply involves acquiescence, thecultivation of a willingness to accept with understanding that which may not beavoided. There is another form of adjustment which grows out of conditions whichare self-initiated and which are based on the effort to handle your own life anda capacity to recognise the place and time to effect changes and, ruthlessly andas a soul, bring about those conditions and situations to which thepersonality—under the urgency of the soul—must adjust itself. One situation, thefirst, is based upon the past, under the Law of Cause and Effect. The other isbased upon the fore-knowledge of the soul, sensed by the intuitive personalityand concerns the future. To both, you bring a certain type of equipment and thisis the thing of practical import.You will note how this fits in with my comments on time found in my instructionto you last January. I might almost call this the second lesson upon the rightuse of time which is so essential in your case, though not exactly in the sensethat your personality would apply my words. Time has to be grasped by you in itscyclic nature and in the inevitable swing of the pendulum between past andfuture as they both affect the present; secondly, in the adjustment which youhave to make in the present in relation to these two. Later, as you come to knowyourself more wisely and to comprehend the working out in the present life ofthe established habits, qualities and tendencies brought into expression in pastlives, you will find yourself increasingly being conditioned by emergingtendencies which are the effect of soul contact and soul impulse. These concernthe future . You will then come to a fresh understanding of time and to a senseof the urgency and importance of each moment in the present. It is this processof interplay between that which has been, that which will be and that which isat any given moment which creates you, the personality, and [209] this is foryou the most needed concept. It serves to give importance to the present andalso directs the future. You may perhaps wonder why I emphasise this question oftime in your particular case. There is always in each disciple at any givenmoment of his incarnated life some one aspect of development which is of moreimportance than another. The right understanding and the right use of time isfor you the major significant lesson. When understood and relegated to itsrightful place and when wisely used, you will experience an amazing release. Theimplication of these words is far deeper than you might think.These basic requirements in a disciple, expressed and understood, areconditioned by the quality of the energy pouring through the etheric body. Ihave given to each of you an analysis of your rays, five in number. Later, Iwill endeavour to show you all the state of the etheric body which is the primeconditioning factor as far as physical plane expression is concerned. This bodyis the aggregate manifestation of all the energies at any one moment which maybe concentrated through the seven centres. It is these centres which indicate tous who watch the point in evolution, the immediate limitation, need and theinherent possibilities. The response of the physical body is purely automatic tothe impression or impulses coming from the vital body. This in itself isresponsive to certain sources of energy—these may be one or other of thepersonality vehicles, the personality note or the direction of the soul,producing impression in varying degrees.During the coming period until such time as I give out the next groupinstruction, I would ask you to discipline your time, making each moment count;I would ask you to perfect each life episode and event (which is only anotherword for time ) so that they are as constructive in expression of the group willas you can make them. This, you will never regret doing.As regards your personal meditation, we will pursue the same theme. You have acapacity to use the will and at the same time to be inclusive (more inclusive inyour consciousness than you yet are in expression) which is very real. The onecalls into activity your soul; the other deepens and sweetens your personality,and I think you will be the first to admit that both these qualities aredesirable.[210] PERSONAL MEDITATION1. Relax and focus yourself in the soul. Then sound the O.M., breathing it outupon the world of men and saying to yourself inaudibly:“The will of God moves the world.” This is the thought lying behind your use ofthe O.M.2. Then ponder upon the significance of time as an expression of the will,realising that this expression is a thought—instantaneous and effective—in themind of the planetary Logos. Think out carefully some of the implications ofthis last statement.3. Then say slowly and thoughtfully:“The past has gone. I am that past. It makes me what I am. The future comes. Ialso am the coming destiny and, therefore, I am that . The present flows fromout the past. The future colours that which is. I make the future also by mypresent knowledge of the past and the beauty of the present. And, therefore, Iam that I am .”4. Sound the O.M. softly three times.I am responsible for this work and I would ask you to proceed as indicated and,my brother, to trust me, your teacher and friend.NOTE: This disciple was given the opportunity to work but did not carry throughand resigned early in the work.~TO I. S. G-L.March 1934MY BROTHER:There are several things which I seek to say to you today and severalsuggestions which I seek to make. From a work and life of much outer usefulness,you pass now for the remainder of your life to one of intenser, interiorapplication. Your work will be increasingly subjective, and this in no way [211]will mitigate your usefulness which should increase as the years go by. Later, Iwill indicate to you some work which can—with advantage—prove of usefulness toyour fellowmen but the time is not yet.You, as well as two other disciples in my group, are starting to work with me atthis time with a most definite end in view. You are all of you very individual,and you have for years stood alone. To work as a unit along your chosen line ofservice has been your task. For all such souls, it is a problem to be faced whenthe time comes for their identities to be merged in a group soul and theirpersonal isolation is thereby infringed and negated.With you, however, this isolation is not the result of any separative tendencyof the lower mind, for that is offset in you by your deep-seated love of theMasters and of humanity. It is the result of the essential loneliness which hasbeset your path, as it does the path of all disciples, and the development ofthat instinctive reticence which is an aspect of the necessary equipment of allwho are struggling towards the Portal of Initiation. The vow of silence whichall disciples take must still be kept, but the power to share knowledge,experience and the gains of illumination must at the same time be cultivated; inthe light which streams forth from the centre of Light, all that concerns thepersonality and service must stand revealed. All secrets must fade away, yet therevelations which come as one progresses along the Path must be held in thesecret chamber of the heart where none may see them but those who share the samesecrets. The reticence to be cultivated is that of relationship with the groupof Masters and the Hierarchy, plus the knowledges you share with those who walkshoulder to shoulder with you upon the Way. You withhold also, as dangerous,knowledge which you may have from those who are not yet upon the Path ofDiscipleship. It is skill in action and in the distribution of information whichmust be developed. I mention this so that you may know the rightness of yourattitude but also in order that you may gather the fact that the present cycleof loneliness is still objectively true but subjectively ended. Do youunderstand what I mean, my brother?You have two handicaps and they must be considered. One [212] is your physicalcondition and the other is your emotional polarisation. This latter condition islargely responsible for the first one, as you yourself know. As you learn toshift the force of your soul from below the diaphragm to the higher centres(which is the problem of all disciples in training) your physical condition willbe alleviated. One of the first things, therefore, which you will have to do isto close the solar plexus centre to the entrance of forces from the astralplane, and open it to the entrance of forces from soul levels, via the headcentre. You must learn to function also more powerfully from the centre betweenthe eyebrows, the ajna centre.The heart centre and the solar plexus centre are the two centres which are themost developed in you; next comes the throat centre. How shall we bring aboutthe change from the solar plexus centre to the ajna centre? Through rightmeditation, my brother, and right breathing. I will ask you, therefore, for thenext few months to follow the suggested routine below for a few minutes—fifteenat least—each day. This need not interfere with any meditation which you maychoose to do, provided that you see to it that you preserve always a point offocus in the head. All your work with me—at any rate for the present—must bedone in the head. There must the consciousness be held steady. I would suggestthat you work as follows:1. Start your meditation work by imagining (great is the power of the creativeimagination) that you are consciously carrying the forces, entering the solarplexus centre, to the ajna centre.a. Inhale as you count six and imagine as you do so that you are gathering upthe force of the solar plexus centre (through an act of inhalation) to the head.Picture it as rising there—up the spinal column.b. Then, as you count eight, think of those forces from the astral plane asbeing lost and merged in an ocean of intelligent love. On their way up thespine, they have been blended with the active force of the awakening heartcentre.c. Then exhale for six counts and as you do so realise that these forces arepouring out through the centre [213] between the eyebrows on to the world ofmen. The centre between the eyebrows is that of the integrated, dedicated,threefold personality. Therefore, you have:Inhalation . . . .6 counts — Gather the forces up to the head.Interlude . . . . .8 counts — Forces blended and fused.Exhalation . . . 6 counts — Blessing the world.Interlude . . . . 8 counts — Realisation of work done.Later we might increase these counts but this suffices for the present and forthe beginner who may read your instructions. This will aid in the closing of thesolar plexus centre and in stabilising the emotional body; incidentally itshould improve your general physical condition.2. Then, holding the consciousness steady in the head, at the close of the finalinterlude, say the following invocation:“May the energy of the divine Self inspire me and the light of the soul direct.May I be led from darkness to Light, from the unreal to the Real, from death toImmortality.”3. Then, still holding the consciousness in the head and visualising a sphere ofdeep electric blue, vivid and living, say the following words, endeavouring torealise their significance as you say them:“I stand in spiritual Being and, as a soul, I serve.“I stand within the Light, and as the light shines throughout my form, I radiatethat light.“I stand within the love of God, and as that love streams through and from theheart, I magnetise the ones I seek to aid.”4. Ponder then for five minutes on the spiritual significance of the followingfour words: Stability, Serenity, Strength, [214] Service, taking one each weekfor a month; for the space of six months build them into your very nature, thusaiding the work of closing the solar plexus and transmuting its force.In a voluntary obedience to the suggested work (and not to me, my brother) willcome for you increased power to live with joy and serve. This is, I know, yourhigh and consecrated motive. Keep the link with me through the power of thoughtand not through love and devotion; that you already have, my friend of oldendays, and you need not further unfold that aspect of your nature. Build up yourphysical body through relaxation, much sunshine and quiet. Read much and studyprimarily along the lines of international interest and those things whichconcern humanity as a whole. You are on the first ray where your personality isconcerned, and broad general schemes and the wider plans are for you easy tograsp. See the world picture whole and shift the focus of your attention fromthe small, individual man to the larger Plan. Investigate the psychology ofgroups. You have wide knowledge as to the psychology of individuals. Study nowworld psychology and mass movements. Together we go forward to a widerrealisation and my work with you as an individual is not so much to teach as tostimulate. My blessing rests upon you.~MY BROTHER OF OLDEN TIME: August 1934I am myself feeling my way with this particular group of my disciples. I find itnecessary to work slowly. I seek not to change the work assigned until the groupis more developed. In every small group of disciples there is always one amongthe members of the group who has a definite point of contact that brings in theintegrating force, just as a Master, at the centre of His Ashram is theintegrating, cohesive energy. You can serve in this way with this group ofdisciples because you have for many years followed the Way. You have, therefore,a specific responsibility to the group which you fulfil by holding yourselfsteadily in the light, by constantly lifting up your heart unto the Lord of yourlife, and by constituting yourself a [215] channel of light and love to yourco-disciples. This I ask of you. This is all that I have to say to you today.~MY BROTHER AND MY FRIEND: March 1935(For such you have been for many lives, e’en if your present physical brainregisters not the fact.) The past year has been a hard one for you, as it hasnecessarily been for all who are sensitive and whose physical bodies areill-equipped to stand the modern pressure or to carry the inner, spiritual forceavailable. It has been particularly hard for you also to establish the innerlink with your fellow disciples and this you have realised and it has troubledyou. The difficulty is due to the fact that your polarisation is essentiallythat of the man devoted to the Hierarchy and whose link is established with thatHierarchy. Your orientation—esoterically speaking—is towards Shamballa. I usethat phrase because it connotes something definitely intelligible to you. I seeknot to be more explicit, for you will comprehend the significance of what I say.You serve and love your fellowmen because we, the teachers on the inner sidealso serve and love them; your approach to humanity and to your co-disciples isvia Those Whom you serve upon “the Lighted Way of the Lord of Life.”You work with human beings and you seek to integrate into this group of minebecause I, whom you know and love, have asked you so to do. This is ofassistance to you but there must be for you a still greater achievement. As yourealise the status of your soul, you must come to the understanding that youserve with us and not simply because you are asked to serve. Give to your groupbrothers of that great gift of love which is so fundamentally yours but which isas yet only in process of finding full expression. Your problem is summed up inthe word which I earlier gave you. I told you that you were shifting egoicallyfrom the sixth Ray of Devotion on to the second Ray of Love-Wisdom—the raywhereon I myself am found. Your first ray personality gives you power with menand this power you know you possess, and you have endeavoured to use it wisely.Your sixth ray soul-polarisation has served to enhance [216] the dynamicone-pointedness of your first ray force. Now that condition is beginning tochange and during this transition period you suffer much. But you have the taskof making this transition and of embodying the love-wisdom force before theclose of this life and, my brother, it is one requirement that you can fulfil.You can also guard yourself from too much suffering over others and over generallife conditions and in this wise detachment your first ray energy can aid.From the angle of the mind, this soul activity and change of focus will forceyour idealistic tendencies to find expression in teaching . Idealism is themajor gift of the sixth ray force. Teaching is an expression of second rayenergy. This combination of idealism and of teaching is for you the way.From the angle of the emotional body, this transition marks a vital change frompersonal to impersonal work. This capacity to be impersonal has been greatlydeveloped in you by your first ray lower nature which renders you easilyimpersonal—if you so choose. But for you the lesson of all disciples must belearned which is to be impersonally personal. That is not easy of attainment. Anattached detachment is for you the goal. It is in order to aid you in learningthis lesson that you have been placed in my group of disciples, which can (forthe time at least) provide the “playground” for your soul. To love yourco-disciples, impersonally to identify yourself with the subjective life of thegroup and to work in rhythm with them is somewhat difficult for you, but mostvaluable. I ask you to attempt it, my brother, and to pursue this objective inspite of all personality objections. In a few years’ time, you will betterunderstand my plans for you.From the angle of the etheric body, this soul transition or refocussing ofenergies from the soul plane will produce the transfer of energies, gathered upand poured through the central clearing-house of the solar plexus centre—throughthat midway station between the higher and the lower centres—to the head andheart. This will be carried forward as you seek to live more consciously in thesoul realm and to be more definitely oriented—as a soul—to the world. This willin no way change your outer activities but will surely produce a deepenedrelation to your fellowmen. Increasingly will you see them in us and us [217] inthem. Ponder on these ideas for I seek to see you working with even moreeffectiveness and liberation.I have already indicated to you your responsibility to my group of disciples andyour function in my group. The power through which this particular group willintegrate must come through you. Each of my disciples has something to give tothe group as a whole.... I tell you again that the force which expresses itselfin loving, magnetic, coherent energy must pour to all of this group through you;upon this task I ask you to meditate.The only meditation which I would suggest to you is along this line. Ponderdeeply on group work and study carefully all I have said on group activity andthe technique of the new groups. This experiment in group activity which I amattempting to initiate is of real potential value; for the furthering of itssuccess I seek your aid. Make the idea and the ideals of group work in the NewAge your major study during the next six months. You will not regret so doing.~MY BROTHER AND MY FELLOW WORKER: November 1935For all disciples, in the truest and the most significant sense, the past fewmonths have constituted an intense period of trial, of testing and of suffering.From this you have naturally not been exempt. Let not this, however, sadden youand do not ponder too deeply upon your reactions to all that has happened. Thatyou could weaken under it or that you could in any way relinquish your fieryaspiration has in no way caused me anxiety. Of this, there is no fear. But thatthe strain could become so heavy that all your powers would be given simply tostanding steady and that you would have no strength to live joyously—that is apoint which I have definitely considered.There is no cause whatever for discouragement. Today, in this hour of worldstress and need, we are looking for disciples who can live joyously and with noconcern as to their individual capacity to measure up to opportunity. We lookfor those who are caused no bewilderment or anxiety as to their failure tomeasure up to opportunity or their failure to live up to their own vision ofdiscipleship. Live up to our vision, brother of [218] old, and know that time isof no moment and that the soul grows and expands its flower of life as itreaches towards the sun. It sends its beauty and aroma forth into the world ofsouls and hence into the world of men.One hint only would I give you at this time. Your one-pointed devotion is knownand the powerful vibration of your aspiration is realised. Let devotion now betransmuted into an all-embracing love to all beings, so that that love canenfold within its radiation the seen and the unseen, the known and the unknown,the loved and that which needs loving. Such is the attitude of consciousnesswhich radiates from the Lord of Life.Watch your physical strength somewhat and live not at so high a tension. Relax alittle during the coming months and foster those lighter moments of relaxationwhich give to your soul opportunity to attend to its own affairs upon its ownhigh level. Then it can return in greater force and with a more potent vibrationto its habitation—the threefold personality. This the disciple is apt to forgetin the intensity of his longing for soul contact, for illumination andrealisation and for conscious contact with his Master. That contact, remember,when once established upon the Path of Discipleship, is never broken. Stand,therefore, upon this belief and relax and play at times.As has been my habit in relation to you, I am leaving you to handle your ownmeditation. I suggest , however, that you centre it around the problem of grouplife, in its pure, essential meaning and that you seek to work out the rules forgroup living which I have laid down.~MY BROTHER: October 1936This has been a year of inner expansion for you and one which has brought you anincreased capacity to see the vision with clarity. One of the goals for all trueseekers is the development of “true insight” and this is becoming a nearer goalfor you. You will know within yourself to what I am referring.As you know, I find it useful to indicate to all in my group [219] of pledgeddisciples their five determining or conditioning rays so that they can work withintelligence at the fusion ofa. The various personality rays.b. The personality ray with the soul ray.There are two major factors of paramount interest to all aspirants and—in yourcase—the task is made somewhat difficult because you have to add to these twotasks the work of shifting your soul ray from the sixth Ray of Devotion to thesecond Ray of Love-Wisdom. This is not an easy thing to do without an interludeof intense difficulty and of energy disruption, accompanied oft with loss ofpersonality balance. You have, however, nearly completed the task and the worstpart of the process is over. It had primarily a physiological effect upon youwhich showed itself in the difficulty you had a couple of years ago. At thattime, as you know, I endeavoured to help you. That condition is now definitelyameliorated. The psychological implications are to be found in the transferenceof the psychical energy you wield from the solar plexus centre to the heartcentre. In terms of living expression, this means that you can transmutedevotion into love, and idealism into proven wisdom. Is not this your immediateaim, my brother?As you know, your soul ray is the second ray, for your basic nature isessentially love-wisdom. Your personality ray is the first, the Ray of Will orPower. That has been for a long time subordinated to the past ray of your soul,that of devotion to the soul, to the Hierarchy, to humanity as well as toyourself. Your problem of personality emphasis has changed from that of thecontinuous impressing of your personality attitudes, ideas and desires upon yourenvironment (as was the case in your last life) to an occasional cyclic andalmost violent emphasis upon some individual. This is now only occasional(relatively speaking). You are learning to leave others free—a hard lesson for afirst ray personality, animated as yours is by knowledge and goodwill.The ray of your mental body is also the first ray. This means that yourintelligent mind can dominate at need and can be far more powerful in expressionthan it usually is. It is always an interesting and an easy matter for the soulto control and [220] illumine the mind when the first and the second rays are asclosely related as they can be in your case.As your emotional body is, however, on the sixth ray (as was your soul when youcame into incarnation) it is there that the emphasis of the soul has been andthere has been for you the line of least resistance. Now the line of leastresistance should be the mind, and your major objective in life and inmeditation should be the mind, and increased illumination—this in order torender increased service to your fellowmen. Hence the meditation which I haveoutlined for you and which I would ask you to follow. It is brief and powerful.Your physical body is also on the first ray, so you can see how powerful acombination you have for service, if you can truly comprehend your problem andwork with a sense of synthesis. It is not so much the mystical union, mybrother, to which you should aspire for that is progressively proceeding, but anintensified illumination of the concrete mind. Therefore, your rays are asfollows:1. The soul ray—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.2. The personality ray—the first Ray of Power or Will.3. The ray of the mind—the first Ray of Power.4. The ray of the astral body—the sixth Ray of Devotion.5. The ray of the physical body—the first Ray of Power.It is this powerful first ray combination of forces in your equipment which hasproduced the emotional instability of which you have ever been conscious. Butthe shift of your soul energy on to the second ray will now most definitelyoffset this and lead to a condition of focussed stability. This will probablyalso better your physical condition.I would ask you to do the following brief exercise:1. Endeavour to focus yourself in the light of the soul through the practice ofalignment. You must realise:a. The soul is light.b. Light is reflected in the mind.c. Then automatically you become one of the Light bearers.d. The light shineth in a dark place. [221]2. Make a conscious alignment then of the vehicles with the soul, holding thesethoughts in mind.3. Then, consciously, hold the mind steady in the Light.4. Give five minutes to:a. A dedication of the personality to the service of the Light.b. The assuming of the responsibility of a Light bearer.c. Seeing the Hierarchy of Servers with which you are definitely affiliated as apower-house of Light.5. Give five minutes to meditation. Note down any thoughts which may come intoyour mind on the beam of light from your soul.~MY BROTHER AND MY CHOSEN FRIEND: August 1937The past few months have been difficult for you. They have involved decision,changes, much misunderstanding in certain quarters and a deeply sensedloneliness. If you will study what I have earlier told you anent your rays, youwill see why this is so. There is in your present life make-up or “presentedappearance,” an over-balance of the first ray attributes. Your personality ray,your mind ray, and the ray of your physical body are all governed by your firstray energy and this presents a very real problem because it predisposes you tothe following conditions:1. A loneliness which is based on a sense of isolation. This is due also to thesense of isolation which the first ray always gives. It is essentially the rayof detachment. This is, for you, offset by your soul ray.2. Owing to the fact that first ray energy in your case is focussed in yourpersonality and in two of its mediums of expression, you wield—owing to theunbalance—an undue power or effect upon all you meet and seek to help.Fortunately for you, and also owing to the quality of your soul ray and to anachieved measure of control, your effect upon those you seek to serve is good.You [222] are, however, definitely aware (are you not?) of the powerfulinfluence you can call into play and thus affect other people’s lives. You knowalso the powerful reaction you can evoke from them. This is the effect of firstray force when focussed upon the physical plane. It provides both an asset and aproblem. You came into incarnation this life to learn to wield this forcerightly and, in the effort to do so, you have in many cases inhibited its outerexpression, sometimes with disastrous results (oft of a psychical nature) uponyourself.3. Your emotional nature has been the clearing-house for all this first rayenergy; this will account to you for much of your inner experience and for muchthat you have suffered and do suffer.Having pointed this out, I would add that this powerfully polarised first raypersonality gives you the power to do three things:First of all, to storm the Kingdom of Heaven and take it by violence andconsequently—in this life—to force certain issues and bring certain soulobjectives to fruition. Be, therefore, encouraged.Secondly, to make possible certain forms of service in your personality life.Earlier I have used a phrase to that effect when teaching you that “yourintelligent mind can dominate at need.” This was a statement of fact; one of theways in which you can rightly use the first ray energy, predominantly yours, isby forcing mental issues and making yourself do what your soul or the Hierarchyasks of you....Thirdly, your first ray personality makes it easily possible for you to dominatethose you meet. This would have been dangerous for you to attempt in your lastlife, for love did not so powerfully control your reactions. It is not dangerousin this life if you hold on to love and avoid the outer forms and techniques ofauthority and control, thus developing wisdom and practising impersonality. Yourmotives are seldom at fault. Your methods are somewhat first ray methods,forcefully applied at times; this damages those you seek to help.This particular life has been a crucial and difficult one for [223] you but youare equal to the task your soul assigned. It will remain so and there is for you(as is always the case for disciples at a certain stage of unfoldment) nocessation, no easing of the situation and no periods or interludes for real restor pause. Do not, therefore, look for them. Pass on triumphantly in the love ofyour soul and the power of your personality.Guard your health, my brother. Stand closely with your chosen fellow disciples.Your link with them is strong. See also that your astral body is not therecipient of too much first ray energy but protect it from that inflow by anactive concentration of your mind upon your chosen field of service, and developan increased inflow of soul wisdom. Concentrate upon wisdom which, in relationto the astral body, means the unfolding (through love) of the intuition. Thepure expression of the love of the soul is not so difficult for you to expressbut it is hard for your emotional nature to handle it. Is this not so, my friendand brother?~MY BROTHER AND CO-WORKER: April 1938I have but little to say to you or to any in this particular group of mydisciples at this time. I desire most earnestly that the group integration maybe strengthened by the understanding performance of the group work. That initself will bring fusion. That fusion will work out in the strengthening of thegroup relation and the stimulation of the individual in the group—an aspect ofthe work which is oft forgotten but which is of real importance. To thisstimulating of the group and of the individual, you can contribute much and yourability so to serve will increase....Again I would ask you to watch your health but principally—in these days ofstrain and of difficulty—your astral health. Will you say each day the followingmantram:“Within the circle of the will of God, I stand.Without the radius of the world of glamour, I take my placeAnd there I stand. [224]Before the open door that just reveals a different lighted wayI take my stand.Before the presence I will take my place and there will firmly stand.And standing, see.”Three words stand out in this mantram and to them I will call your attention;the way , the presence and sight.My blessing rests upon you at all times.~January 1940How shall I approach you, my beloved brother, at this time and how indicate toyou your prevailing glamour without, at the same time, so wounding yoursensitive nature that I shall do more harm than good? And, I ask myself, howmuch revelation is needed by you, for, are you not aware of two glamours whichprevent the full expression of your soul and hinder the ripening to perfectionof your truly dedicated life?Ponder upon these words as you pass through the “intruding seclusion” of thecoming months, for so your personality may regard the adjustments of your soul.I will but give a name to your two glamours and will leave you to deal with themor not as may seem best to you. Upon your method, however, of aspecting themwill depend much of the effectiveness of your future service for us. To thatservice you are unflinchingly dedicated, and from that service naught will turnyour steps. But delay might eventuate until the needed lesson has been mastered.One of the glamours which controls you is that of the highest level of theastral plane. One of the Masters has called it “the glamour of the rose ofaspiration as it pours through the solar plexus and not through the heart.”Another is the glamour of the Burning Ground which can so engross the attentionof the disciple or the initiate that his spiritual place thereon, the results ofthe clarifying fires and the heat of purification become the all-absorbing themeof the personality and, brother of mine, the personality must be lost to sightin the “glory of the One.”[225] Need I further elaborate? Is not my meaning clear to you, even though tono one else? I stand with you and will continue to stand, for whether I am onthe burning ground or on the mountain top, whether I am silent in the secretplace or surrounded by the surging crowds of humanity, it matters not. Thelessons of divine indifference, once mastered, release the soul to union withthe One. Surely it might be said that He Whom I and you and all disciples serve,the Christ, demonstrated in Gethsemane His sensitivity to that lesson and alsoHis mastering of it.NOTE: This brother is still actively cooperating with the Tibetan.~TO L. F. U.August 1937BROTHER SERVER:I have watched you for some years now, little as you may have suspected it. Itwas under my definitely applied impression that you found your way into my groupof disciples in which you now work, and at the same time you found your destinedfield of service. I am glad to welcome you into this group of students. Thepersonal touch is wise with you for you neither fear nor crave it.In the life of every aspirant, there comes a life wherein he finds the group towhich he belongs. I refer to the inner group of disciples and the outer group ofservers with whom he can and must cooperate. When these two discoveriessynchronise (which is not always the case) much time is saved and theopportunity is great. This has been the case with you, and this I believe youare beginning to realise.Your soul ray, my brother, is the first, and your personality ray is the third.Owing to the pressure of the times and of the work for this immediate cycle, youmay have heard it said that I am relieving some of the Teachers on the innerside and thus setting Them free for wider and more exacting service. I amhandling some of Their pupils for Them and preparing some [226] of Theiraspirants (whom They have been watching) for the stage of accepted discipleship.In this last category you now find yourself. It was the coming under myinfluence subjectively that led you to the realisation that the deepening ofyour love nature was, for you, the next step in your equipping yourself forservice. Your ray combinations necessitated this and my second ray influence,therefore, helped. There is not an aspirant in the world who could not wellintensify his divine love nature, not his astral emotional love nature. But youneed to comprehend always the reason for any development and hence myexplanation.You have come a long distance quite rapidly upon the Path lately, and havedefinitely increased both your vibratory capacity and your influence. Some yearsof potent service are possible to you and again another explanation is in order.He Whom you will some day know as your Master when admitted in fullconsciousness into His group of disciples (the Master M.) is the head of allesoteric schools in the world at this time. Hence you can see why you found yourway into my group of disciples and why also you are working actively andfruitfully in its executive and organisational end. It is in line with yourinner group force and this, rightly understood and used, can make of you auseful focal point for the Master’s energy in the place where you have chosen toserve. You must learn to differentiate, therefore, as time goes on and yoursensitivity increases, between:1. The vibratory influence (incoming and outgoing) of your own soul.2. The vibratory influence (incoming and outgoing) of this particular group ofdisciples.3. The vibratory influence (incoming and outgoing) of the esoteric schools.4. The vibratory influence (incoming and outgoing) of the head of all esotericgroups, the Master Morya.This you will not be able to do for some time yet, but the developing of thistype of sensitivity is, for you, a needed unfoldment, and will come eventually,if you will follow my instructions with care, and let true love increasinglysweep [227] through the lower personal self. It can sweep through, my brother,because (as you rightly feel) you do know somewhat of the nature of love. It is,however, one thing to love, and another thing to be a channel of the love of thesoul and of the group.Your sphere of work is clear to you, and there you are both needed and useful,which is all that you desire. The keynote of your daily work should beunderstanding , just as the keynote of your work with yourself on all threeplanes should be fearlessness , with love colouring all your life. These are thethree words which express what should be the colour-tone of your life expressionfrom now until the call comes for you to serve on the other side of the veil oflife. Ponder on these three words—understanding, courage or fearlessness, andlove—for the remainder of your life of service, for “as a man thinketh, so ishe.”We will now change your meditation and for the future, until I again make achange, I would suggest the following:Meditation Work:1. Alignment with the soul and a definite conscious polarising of realisation ashigh in the head and as high on the mental plane as possible. Then pause.Visualisation Exercise:2. Then look out, in your imagination, over the world of men. See that world asone of light, with here and there intensifications of the light in certainlocalities or centres or areas.a. Then imagine this web of light with its radiant centres of force as pulsatingto the rhythm of the world aspiration.b. Regard yourself then as the onlooker, but also as a channel, among the manychannels, for the energy of the spiritual Hierarchy, focussed for you throughthe Master Morya, and stepped down to you through me, your Tibetan brother.c. Use then the set of phrases which embody your aspiration and which appears inyour replies: [228]“Love is the incentive of our aspiration on the Path;Love is the substance of our living in the world.Love is the light and the light of freedom for all creatures;Love pulses through the universe in a divine rhythm.Love is the consciousness of God.”d. Imagine, as you do this, that the energy of love is pouring through the webof light, stimulating each of the many, many centres into greater radiance.3. Then sound the O.M. breathing it forth into the personality.4. Next, do some mental work in meditation, holding the mind steady in thelight; carry your service in my group and any other aspect of your work in theworld into that light, seeing it all as part of the one great service. For you,intercession is peculiarly useful, for it tends to promote understanding.5. Seek then to get in touch with your group brothers, holding them too, as agroup , in the light.If you so desire, on two days in the week, you can follow any meditation whichyou find useful and helpful. I seek to leave you free.~MY BROTHER: February 1938You have for some time been working on the meditation assigned. You have madeprogress—more progress than you yourself can perhaps sense. I say this to youfor your encouragement. In the regimentation and the regularity of your life andin the steady rhythm of your service, high moments of realisation and ofexaltation become relatively rare. Points of crisis, of spiritual crisis, maylack. I point this out so that you can see to it that in the inner life there ispotency and dynamic impulse, e’en when the outer life seems moulded to apattern. It is a needed pattern, because it makes your service possible. Themoment a man sets his hand to the plough and starts upon his ploughing, fromthat moment until he has completed his [229] task, he remains internally freebut outwardly bound. So it must ever be with the servers in our work.But climaxing moments are of importance and the pursuit of an even tenor is notusually good for a disciple, if overlong perpetuated, especially at the point ofevolution at which you find yourself. It is good for the aspirant who is workingupon the control of the emotional body and the attaining of astral equilibrium.It is not so good for the pledged disciple whose career should have in it—as didthe career of the Christ—the valley and the mountain top experience, and thecave experience also with its loneliness and its period of introspectiveculture. Therefore, my brother, I call you to a more dynamic living thanheretofore. The attainment of the outer attitude in your chosen work has beengood. The inner orientation to the soul as love, is also good. Let there be nodoubt in your mind upon this point. But paralleling this steady progress mustcome an increasing crescendo of experience, and a more vivid interim living. Ithink you will apprehend that whereof I speak because I speak in terms of yourown desire.For the coming year, keep your spiritual diary in terms of crisis . Create notthese crises for yourself. They are not of a physical nature, nor need they beemotional. But they should be mental and of the soul. If these crises occurwithin the astral body they produce a contraction—which is incident to selfishconcentration, to that pain or pleasure which comes when there is thesatisfaction or the negation of that which is demanded, emotionally orsentiently. Is this not so, my brother? But the crises of the soul areexpansions, registered by the inflow of love and light. They are mentallyrecognised crises of inclusiveness. These lead one on and prepare one for thelater more vast expansions which we call initiations. It is these expansivecrises in the various aspects of your nature which I ask that you watch andregister and record during the coming year. Note in which body or vehicle ofexperience they occur. Note, too, your reaction to them and their after-effectin your personal life and in your service. You will find this of major interest.You are in a position where you can be of much service to others. Yourusefulness depends upon your ability to achieve a constant inner growth andprogressive realisation and your [230] consequent capacity to meet all who seekyour aid in a spirit of love, free from personal criticism and with theintelligent reticence which is so pre-eminently one of your characteristics. Theintensification of the potency of your aura (your personality emanation) is mostdesirable for it is through the right use of the aura that we stimulate othersto renewed effort, or slow them down to less potent expression. Thisintensification is dependent upon the quality, potency and tempo of yoursubjective life. Hence the earlier suggestions I have made to you.As regards your meditation work, I would change it somewhat. For the next tenmonths, the following procedure will be desirable. See to it that by the timethe sun moves northward, you will have so assimilated the procedure andaccustomed yourself to the form that that aspect of the meditation will beautomatic and your inner attention can, therefore, be given to the significancesof the work assigned. The objective is to enable you to pursue two lines ofactivity accurately and simultaneously.Meditation Work:1. Give five minutes to alignment consciously achieved and to the withdrawing ofyour consciousness to as high a point as possible.2. Then take five minutes for complete silence, of both the inner and the outerman. The breathing, if correctly followed, should greatly aid in this.3. Then inaudibly and in the achieved silence, sound the Sacred Word, the O.M.,listening as you sound it, and imagining it as being sounded by the soul. Thesoul breathes out the sound and passes it through all three bodies and thus outinto the world of men, carrying love and power.4. On receipt of these instructions and having in mind their general tenor,choose six short passages which should constitute your seed thoughts for thenext six months. Choose them from any source you prefer but choose them all atonce within a few days of receiving this. If you prefer, you can use thefollowing six symbolic sentences which I have chosen for you. I have chosen themfor you [231] because—rightly used and understood—they can act as focal pointsfor spiritual energy, breaking up that which hinders and pouring a cleansingtide through your personality. You seek to be a channel and you long adequatelyto serve. This I know . Be willing, therefore, to let the “forces of light”enact their will within your life, e’en though you awaken with surprise tounknown and unrealised aspects of yourself—both good and not so good.First month . . . A barrier of stone. A flood of cleansing water, and then theVision. The pilgrim then can chant: I stand in love.Second month . . . A boat at rest upon a sea of blue. And then a tidal wave. Butafter that the calm. The boatman chants: The storm has brought me here.Third month . . . A mountain top. Snow with a fold of sunshine. A group ofpilgrims on the upward way. One pilgrim chants: In love we walk the Way.Fourth month . . . Three birds upon a tree. A searing wind and pouring rain, andthen the nightingale—the bird who sings close to the heart of God.Fifth month . . . A gate of brass, a golden portal and then an ivory door. Threegates, but only two are shut. Pass on, oh pilgrim on the Way, and find the opendoor.Sixth month . . . The rising dawn; a cool breeze and a shaft of light. A wearypilgrim and then again the vision. He chants: I stand in love for ever.5. Then mentally carry your group brothers into the light and see the wholegroup functioning as a unit and held together by love, mutual understanding andcorporate vision and united service.~[232] BROTHER OF MINE: November 1938Little as you may like to hear it or to recognise it, I wish to tell you thatyou have made more real progress the past year than in any previous ten years.You might ask me how I know this and in what way I can register thisdevelopment? By the breaking up of old adhesions (to use the language ofsurgery, and the soul is a most efficient surgeon) and the disappearance ofancient crystallisations, it becomes apparent to me that the power of your soulis making itself felt. That is good. But I would point out to you one thing thatall aspirants are apt to overlook, and that is that the successful applicationof soul force to the personality life will always produce over-stimulation inone or other of the bodies and that this must be guarded against and definitelyoffset.You have a curious combination of rays with which to work, my brother and myfriend, but a correct understanding of the five forces which control you in thisincarnation should do much to enable you to make a right approach to the lifework which will be yours in your next incarnation. This particular life whichyou are now experiencing is simply a preparatory one. In the earlier part ofthis life you worked definitely with what you inherited from a previous life,following the lines of least resistance. This culminated for you in certainaspects of creative work, but it was only the fulfilment of innate capacity andmost definitely personality achievement, and not soul performance. Forget not,however, that personality achievement is, in its right place and time, divineachievement.But the point for you to grasp is that this later part of your life ispronouncedly preparatory training for creative group achievement in your nextlife. One of the problems which we, the teachers upon the inner side, havealways to face is how to lead our chelas to the recognition of the temporary andrelatively unimportant nature of any one particular life. You had, up to the ageof forty-three, no real group sense. You came into incarnation to gain it andfound your way into group activity. This proved to you a place of soulsatisfaction at times, and of conflict many times. And, my brother, you havemade real progress in the evocation of group consciousness. It has been [233]peculiarly difficult in your case, owing to the two major rays which controlyou—the first Ray of Power, of isolation, detachment and the sense ofuniqueness, and the third Ray of Intelligence, which is apt to bring with it thesense of pride of intellect. This latter you have most successfully controlled.But in this particular incarnation, every step forward in soul control must betaken through the facing of certain tests connected with your line of leastresistance, and must be taken with the eyes of the mind wide open, so as toavoid the pitfalls of aloneness, and of separation. This I think you know.Your problem is further complicated by the fact that your mental body is on thethird Ray of Active Intelligence which is also your personality ray. This doestwo things for you: It definitely facilitates the integration of yourpersonality, and it also enables you to contact your soul with relative ease, ifyou so choose. Nevertheless, it also emphasises all the third ray faculties andcapacities of your personality—critical, analytical, separative, prideful andfull of self-interest—and, as you are definitely going through a process ofrapid integration, this produces situations which require most careful handlingand watching.Your astral or emotional body is on the sixth Ray of Devotion. This brings inthe conflicts of idealism, and constitutes for you the crux of your lifeproblem. It enables you also to bring certain offsetting tendencies to yourpersonality and mind rays which are most valuable.As your physical body is also upon the sixth ray, your brain is consequentlymost responsive to your astral impulses, particularly along the lines ofidealism. The combination of these two sixth ray forces in your equipment areyour only points of contact (in this incarnation) with the great second raylines of force. You should bear this most carefully in mind and cultivate thehigher or group idealism assiduously and earnestly, for it is through thisidealism that your entire personality life expression can arrive at the neededbalance and recognitions.~MY BROTHER: March 1939Your glamours are not many or potent, for you are more [234] subject toillusions than to glamours, being so predominantly a mental type of disciple.The question in my mind which I bring to you today for answering is whether themental emphasis which you impose upon all your daily living, both inner andouter, may not within itself constitute a hindering glamour, thus handicappingthe full awakening of the heart centre. Much have you done in the past fiveyears anent the increased sensitivity of the heart. Yet the rationalisingintellect can still impede the receptivity of the heart to life and circumstanceand, above all, to the dominant appealing note of humanity itself and as awhole.Are you strong enough to participate, with no barriers up, in the present worldsorrow, world distress and world awakening?The heart of humanity is now coming to life and that in itself constitutes aproblem.The combination of a trained mind and an awakened heart is the objective of thedisciple who at your stage of development is in preparation for initiation, andthe relation between the two is oft forgotten. It is one of an unrecognisedglamour, owing to the fact that the achievement of intellectual balance cantemporarily upset the truer balance of the whole man. As I told you some yearsago, the heart afire with love (not with sentiment or with emotion) is your lifegoal and this must be achieved not by stifling the intellect but by anintellectual perception of the significance of the loving heart, plus an activeunderstanding of the significance of human suffering, leading eventually toparticipation in it. It is this relation of the trained mind and the awakenedheart that constitutes the true burning ground and a study of the humansituation at the present time would indicate the correctness of my proposition.~MY BROTHER AND FRIEND: June 1940You are one of the few in the group who have—consciously or subconsciously—madea strenuous effort to develop the qualities as indicated by me. Love, you arerapidly developing and expressing and much that seemed inexplicable to you in myearlier emphasis (when starting work with you) now seems [235] clear to yourperception. The need for fearlessness will be recognised by you in a differentlight if you study with care any communication which you may receive from me atany time. On this subject, I will say no more for you will comprehend whereof Ispeak and the reason for the brevity of this communication. Understanding growsapace in you. One hint, however, I will give. Let it be the understanding of thepoint of view of others and not so much your understanding or theirunderstanding. You need, if I might so express it, to cultivate a closeidentification with others and not to cultivate the effort to understand. Ponderon this. I have no more to say to you in this instruction and the reason forthis is known to you.NOTE: This disciple is still working with the Tibetan.~TO I. B. S.March 1932MY BROTHER:You have entered my group of disciples for a certain specific training and inthat word “training,” you have the keynote of your intended accomplishment. Thetraining to be given calls for no enforced obedience but it does entail thesubmission of the personality to the will of the soul and not to that of thelower desire nature, no matter how fine or aspirational. I seek to indicate toyou modes of unfoldment and to give you hints as to capacity. Beyond that I haveno function.You have been working and serving for years, and it is that service and thataspiration which have carried you forward into definite training for initiation.In a certain sense, therefore, you have been accepted as a chela and to me hasbeen assigned the work of safeguarding you. I say “work” with deliberation andask you to ponder the phrase I employed. How long you will be preparing for sucha step in the expansion of your consciousness is of no importance and I ask youto forget it. But it is of importance that you get out of this opportunity itsutmost usefulness.You may well imagine, brother of mine, that it is not my [236] intention towaste my time or yours in feeding pride with flattery or in holding out to you avision of a notable future. The physical plane realities emerge out of a true,inner, spiritual development, and if you are sincere (and this I do believe youto be) you will welcome the plain speaking and truth—no matter how temporarilyhumiliating you may find it to be. If all is ultimately to be revealed as mendevelop the powers of the soul, it is time we learned to know one another as weare and to regard exposure as a means towards eradication.You have two main difficulties and before you can go forward into a greaterliberty these must be, in some measure, overcome. The one that looms the largerin your consciousness is that of the physical plane handicap of an unstabledigestive system. The one that looms the larger (in the consciousness of thosewho seek to help upon the inner side) is an over-emphatic personality, with itsattention focussed on the personality and on its doings, instead of beingfocussed upon the inspiring soul.The result of this tendency is an excessive intensity of vibration which wrecksand shatters the mechanism. Your sixth ray personality produces an intenseadherence to your ideals and to the truth, as you see it; it produces also aone-pointedness which has led to a focussing of energy in the head. This hasbeen intensified also, owing to our western civilisation being immersed in thethoughtforms of the Piscean Age—the age of the sixth ray which is still with us.When the first ray energy of the soul pours in and blends itself with the sixthray force, the shattering effect is increased and the personality carries moreforce than it can handle. That energy is also unevenly distributed and goesprimarily to the throat and to the solar plexus, causing a disturbance and anupsetting of the balance of the forces in the body. This, in its turn, producesa disturbance in the alimentary tract and when this disturbance becomes anestablished habit, a very real problem is presented.You ask: What shall, therefore, be done? I will give some suggestions which youcan follow or not as you choose.1. Lose sight of yourself in loving other people and feed not personalitysatisfaction in a constant managing of their affairs. [237]2. You have a gift of love and understanding. Use it as a soul and not so muchas a personality.3. Learn to put first things first and do not pay so much attention to the smallbut engrossing details, presented by circumstances and by other people. Thesefeed personality satisfaction as you handle them with your undoubted efficiency.Sit back and let the life aspect work in you and in others.Your digestive difficulties will be much aided and might disappear when you haveestablished a constructive relation between your soul and your personality andwhen you can live in your heart and not in your solar plexus.~BROTHER OF MINE: November 1933This is simply a very brief notation. You have made some progress in relegatingthe personality to the background and you are now more inclusive thanheretofore. See to it that steady progress is made in that direction. With anaspirant as tried and focussed as yourself, I need no easy words with which toapply the truth. I can speak with directness and with certainty of attention tothat which may be said.The progress you have made warrants my giving you a meditation to be followedwith care during the next few months.... And now, brother of old, I say to you(as I say to all aspirants in training for discipleship): Learn that occultreticence which produces inner power and outer silence. Speak less and lovemore....~BROTHER OF MINE: March 1934What shall I say to you now as the time comes when again I can communicate withyou? My heart is with you and I have an understanding of the way that you havecome. Your very intensity and your strong aspiration have led you intodifficulty and you are the victim of your virtues and of your occultinexperience. Do you not know, my brother, that the disciple [238] is everbalanced in endeavour and runs not to extremes of any kind? Yet balanced efforthas not characterised your work the past few months. You have been swept by anemotional thoughtform and the effect of the astral energy has been to increasethe emotional devotion and the physical nervousness which have ever handicappedyou. The effect of true teaching, emanating from mental levels, is to stabilise,to mentalise and to ground the disciple in spiritual being; to be is for you thegoal.It is not the function of the true teacher ever to criticise. It is his functionto watch over the chela and in the light of wisdom and compassion to aid himwith instruction. I have today a few things to say to you and they must bebriefly expressed because your fatigue is greater than you realise. You needrest and care. This is owing to excessive emotional stimulation which has beenthrust upon you; this comes from a group of well-meaning aspirants gatheredaround a thoughtform of myself to be found on the higher levels of the astralplane. It is only a thoughtform which they see in a glamorous light and suchthoughtforms of the teachers are often to be found and are purely astral and notreal.First, I would say: Be not discouraged but admit the failure of your intuition.Be, however, true to yourself and if you feel, my brother, that the position isnot as I have stated it to be, then abide by your own decision and be true toyour higher self. That is the matter of the greatest moment—personal truth andintegrity. This decision may lead you to continue to form part of my group ofdisciples—a cooperation which has been interrupted the past few months—or it maylead you to work in conjunction with the group which has lately so powerfullyinfluenced you. But be true to the situation as, in sober meditation, you seeit; no higher attitude can be expected of anyone.Have in mind, however, that your physical body is not strong enough to stand thepressure of two vibratory groups and (until such time as you make your choice)we will hold the work you do with me in abeyance. The choice is entirely yours;you are utterly free to act as seems wisest to you and there will be nocriticism from us entailed in any decision you may make.Secondly, should you desire to continue with my instructions, [239] thendiscontinue acting upon the instructions which have been going to you from thisgroup whose focus is on the astral plane. Resume then the work I outlined foryou earlier which you have lately neglected and follow my instructions in detailand with meticulous care.In connection with the meditation work and the energy you gather, will youremember that this will not stimulate your nervous body at this time but canbecome a group asset. The effect of the work you have been doing with the groupwhich is working under the influence of glamour has been to feed your devotionalnature, to emphasise your development, your training, your work, your need andwhat is thought of you . None of it has been of any value to this group ofdisciples to whom you had pledged yourself or to your associates in service withwhom you have been for so long affiliated or to those connected with you in yourcurrent daily life. It has indeed produced a separating effect between yourself,your group and your surroundings. This you know well and it is distressing youdeeply. Your failure to conform to the requirements of my Ashram has not aidedeither, has it?All the work that I seek to do with you and my other disciples has been with theobjective of intensifying their group relation, to deepen their group love andto bind them together as a group. For this is group work which the Hierarchy andthose associated with it do, and my group is not one wherein personal trainingis given in order to bring about personal growth. Let me emphasise this again,my brother. I am not training you so that you can grow. I am training a group ofdisciples so that they may function as a unit, and as a welded totality. Thatsubjective inner unity has been neglected by you whilst you wandered down abyway of high grade personality and emotional beauty but which in realitybelonged to the world of illusion and not to the world of light and of vision.Your great sensitivity made this easy. Your latent love of power facilitatedyour delusion. Your failure to conform to group requirements precipitated thecoming of the glamour. But your inner link is strong and your aspiration vital,if you will but see truly and act strongly.The next thing that I want to say to you is that your etheric [240] body (whichexpresses itself through the nervous body) is in a rent condition. Forget notthat these thoughtforms of power sap and drain those who attach themselves tothem. You have much ground to regain physically as a result of the past fewmonths....Again I say: Be not discouraged. By our failures and our reactions to glamour,we learn to tread with confidence the Way of Light. By our falling intocriticism, we can gauge our soul quality. Neither criticism of those who lead mygroup and with whom you have been affiliated, nor criticism of those who leadthe group upon the astral plane which has brought you into the realm of glamour,will do more than reveal to you that personality reactions block the way of thesoul. In the last analysis, your problem is not which of these two lines ofteaching you will accept or which of certain guiding personalities are myrepresentatives. Your problem is whether your intuition can discern between asoul vibration and the vibration of a high grade astral form. Your Tibetanbrother and other individuals do not count. If they count with you, then you arein error. It is truth that counts and the associating of yourself with thehighest truth you can contact.I have written to you thus, my brother, because I sense the tension of yournature and your bewilderment at the situation—one which you had not foreseen andwhich causes you deep distress. Relax and be at peace. Thus will you make rightdecision. In the light of eternity, these little happenings (and how small theyare when looked at in the right light and—dare I say it?—with a sense ofhumour!) disappear. Go forward with fresh courage. Learn from the past butrefuse to be held by that past. Do not let the words or the influence of anyonelead you. May the light of your own soul lead you from strength to strength andreveal to you a purity of motive which will flood your life with love.~BROTHER OF MINE: September 1934For you today I have a very simple message and a simple instruction. I would sayto you in the words of the initiate, Paul: [241] “Forgetting the things whichare behind, press forward.” The glamour which enveloped you has gone. It hasgone, my brother. You are now suffering primarily from fear and fromhumiliation. These are both destructive and unnecessary. You were the focalpoint for the glamour but you were also the focal point for the group love,which you aided much in awakening. Dwell somewhat upon this.You are entering now upon changed conditions and your life will take a differentline of action in the future. For this you must be prepared. But all ways areways of service, and in service and in the helping of your fellowmen there comesfor you the way of liberation. Be concerned with the group work and its rightfulprocesses. Your soul will prove your guardian. Continue to give your physicalbody rest and sleep. Feed it normally and sanely and play no experiments with itas you have so oft and foolishly done in the past. Keep busy with the Master’swork and with happiness enter upon and accomplish each day’s task.... Youroffering to the group is the providing of opportunity for service. You mustlearn to be served as well as to serve, for in so doing, your personal will isbroken and the higher good substituted.~February 1935We can now, brother of mine, begin to do more definite work. E’en yet, however,you must proceed with care and for another few months I would suggest that youdo no work, except that which I may here indicate. The rent in the etheric body,which reduced you to such a serious condition early last year is now sealed ,but it would take only a little to re-open it again if you were subjected toundue strain. It was through this rent that the glamour entered in such fullforce and worked such temporary havoc in your life.This testing glamour can serve the entire group of my disciples as anillustration of much that you will later study. Hence good is being wrested fromseeming evil. Evil itself is but an illusion, for it is the use that is made ofmotive and opportunity by personality separativeness and selfishness whichconstitutes evil. From right motive and the same circumstances [242] good mayemerge. If no other result eventuates, this past experience will serve to makeyou and your co-disciples far more cautious in the future and less prone to leapto conclusions. Glamour, when it is of such a definite kind, is most convincingand of a seeming reality. This is a definition of the word “glamour,” and theword “seeming” gives the clue.I have said that it is my intention to deal with each of you with utterfrankness. We can, as a group of disciples, begin now our real work and canregard the past cycles as simply preparatory in nature. The objectives beforeeach of you are to submit to such a discipline and to unfold your spiritualnatures with such purpose that you can contribute much to the work of my Ashram.Each of you must work towards such a relative perfection so that yourcontribution may be of value and in no department of your nature can you causehindrance. We are working towards a matured and synthesised group activity—asare all the Ashrams of all the teachers—and shall some day achieve it, but inthis particular affiliated group the conditions for such work are not yetpresent. Work steadfastly, therefore, at self-improvement and at the eliminationof those personality faults which stand in the way of the general usefulness.My brother, for long you have occupied the centre of the stage in your ownthought. You are not jealous in the ordinary sense of the word because yourpride refuses to permit the usual form of jealousy. But you are ever consciousof being in the centre of your circle of human contacts and have a feeling ofresentment—oft unrecognised—when this is not the case. This was one of the mainfactors in your humiliation last year. Such an attitude is easy of achievementand simple to hold; it is the line of least resistance for your personality. Myword to you today is decentralisation . You must struggle to shift your mindaway from yourself as teacher, friend, wife, worker, or disciple of the Tibetan;you must cultivate that understanding heart which will make you more aware ofothers than of yourself. A hard saying and one not easy to express in thoughtand life! In the last analysis, your problem is the subjection of your sixth raypersonality to your first ray soul impulse. A study of the sixth raycharacteristics will help you here, particularly if you remember that (being adisciple) it will be your sixth ray vibration [243] which will cause you themost trouble and along which glamour will easily enter. It is, for instance,your personality fanaticism and your personality devotions (both to people andto ideas) which need tempering if your first ray power is to manifest. Yourfanatical devotee will must be superseded by the purpose , ordered andsteadfast, of your first ray soul. In this last sentence is for you the key toyour future unfoldment. The steely, brittle, determined, dynamic will of thedevoted aspirant must change into the steadfast, powerful, calm purpose of thesoul, working through the disciple. The soul is fluid in adjustment butundeviating in aim. Likewise, the brilliant fanatical devotion to this, that orthe other person or ideal must give place to the gentle unchanging love of thesoul—the love of your soul for the soul of others. In this lies for you a hintand your future success. I think you will realise whereof I speak. In conformityto soul impulse mould your life and shift out of the realm of high desire andaspiration into that of settled purpose and an undeviating attachment toreality.You can resume your active study work and your meditation work as outlined by mebelow.... When you are meditating see to it that you are relaxed and sit not sofiercely erect as is your usual custom. Rest back somewhat, achieving comfortand self-forgetfulness.The meditation given will produce a needed reorganisation of your inner bodiesand this will give fruitful results in your other contacts as well. The above isall that I have to say to you for the present, my brother. May the peace of yoursoul, the love of your co-disciples and the benediction of your Master rest uponyou. Give to all the best that you have to give and fret not over results.~MY BROTHER: November 1935The past year of effort should have prepared you for changes and for increasedusefulness in service. That your will is directed to service is well known to meand to your fellow disciples but your field of service should be greater at thistime than it is. Wherein lies the difficulty? Why are you not more [244] potentin helping others than you are? Shall I tell you why, my brother?The reason is to be found in the difficult combination caused by your two raysin expression—the sixth ray and the first. When your sixth ray personality canwork, free from the influence of your soul ray and be one-pointedly directedtowards some determined programme, there is no hindrance in your physical planeexpression. When your first ray ego can likewise so work, then much will beaccomplished by you. But, at the present time, your first ray expression inconjunction with your sixth ray personality produces more destructive work thana manifestation of the divine purpose of your soul. In your efforts, forinstance, to help people, your sixth ray devotion is apt to frighten them awayfrom you and your first ray power oft shatters that particular inner body whichis for them their weakest point; you are then left as ever the “one who standsalone.” This is characteristic of the beginner in the conscious life of a firstray soul. Is this not oft the case with you, my brother? It is not that peopledo not love you, for they do; it is not that you do not love them, for you do.It is that you are too dynamic in your approach and the force that flows throughyou destroys as quickly as it builds and drives away by its “blast of out-goingpower” that which you sought to attract and which has been temporarilyattracted. You lose so many people out of your range of influence, and this youwell know and it bewilders you. The fault lies primarily in you and not in them.You see, my brother, I am seeking to begin your training as a worker; hence myemphasis upon this first ray characteristic of your soul (as it vitalises yoursixth ray nature). You must begin to handle it wisely if you are ever to be ofuse.In an earlier teaching, I endeavoured to awaken you to the risk of constantlyassuming the position of the “one in the centre.” That attitude, as well as theone to which I today refer, is also distinctive of a first ray soul and thepresence of these two attitudes (of the one in the centre and the one who standsalone) are indicative of the fact that your first ray soul is beginning toassume some control over your personality. Is this not a real encouragement? Youare on the verge of seeing the results [245] of your work with your own nature.If you can accept that which I have to say in connection with the destructiveaspects of your soul contact, you can save yourself much difficulty and troubleand save other people too. You might rightly ask me how and in what manner youcan offset these tendencies. I can but reply to you with simple and ordinarytruths—so simple and so ordinary that their scientific value is easilyoverlooked. I say to you: Lose interest in your personality life, in itscontacts and affairs by substituting a dynamic interest in world work. Do notarrive at this detachment through an intensification of your sixth raypersonality attitudes; we do not desire to have fanatics in association with us.Arrive at it through a deepening of your love nature as it includes others andexcludes your own lower nature. I say to you: Work with detachment and, becauseyou are demanding nothing for the separated self, all things will, therefore,come to you. You will not then stand alone but will function as an attractivemagnetic unit in group service. Here, therefore, lies your immediate problem.You have to learn to be decentralised and to step out of the centre of your ownpicture. You have to learn to be magnetic and to build and not destroy. Ponderon these suggestions and work simply, quietly and happily at your problem.You are facing strange and new contacts and hence you can, if you so choose,expand your field of service. Forget not, however, that every expansion ofconsciousness, resulting in increased scope for service, is to be taken at acost and for this you will have to be prepared. But you are a strong andsteadfast soul, provided you can keep a poised and steadfast attitude of mindand emotion and preserve yourself free from personal ambition. Then you can winthrough to your goal.Leave people free and seek not to influence them or to impose your ideas uponthem. Your interpretation of them and of their need (no matter how close theymay be to you) is not necessarily correct. Leave people free in allrespects—with the freedom that you demand and expect for yourself. May I, in alllove and tenderness, suggest that the ideas, methods, formulas and ways ofliving which seem right to you (and are right for you) may be entirelyundesirable for others and that, if you force them on those others, their soulsmay remove them from [246] your influence in the cause of freedom to expand. Inthis suggestion lies for you the clue to much that is destructive in your besteffort and this should convey to you the method for your and their deliverance.You may now resume your full quota of work and I suggest for your considerationthe following breathing exercise. Please continue with the same meditation. Do asimple breathing exercise each morning and as you work at it, regard it as yourmeditation process, and so run a dual line of thought and work. Proceed asfollows:1. Inhale on 8 counts, and as you do so, say to yourself, retaining the entireprocess in the head and on mental levels: “With self-forgetfulness I gather whatI need for the helping of my fellowmen.”2. Then follows an interlude of 12 slow counts, during which you ponder on thestrength, the wisdom and the love which must be shown to your fellowmen.3. Exhale on 10 counts, saying: “With self-forgetfulness, I breathe out loveupon my fellowmen.”4. Then comes an interlude of 12 counts in which you ponder upon love to allbeings.Then repeat the process, only this time carry on the work entirely in the heartinstead of in the head.~February 1936I was correct, was I not, my brother, in telling you in an earlier instructionthat changes were to take place in your life and environment and circumstances.You have seen much and travelled much since that time. What has been the gain upto this moment? Do you feel your inner life enriched? Are you less introvertedand more self-forgetfully outgoing? Always you went forth to the helping ofothers but never did you forget your position as the helper; therefore, therewas always the unconscious drawing of the one to be helped to you yourself, in apersonal sense and frequently a subsequent rebound away from you. Do you leadthem now to lose sight of you in the vision of their own souls?[247] These are questions which you alone can answer and they still hold for youindication of a needed task. Liberation for you lies in submergence in yourgroup of fellow disciples and in the elimination—as I have earlier told you—ofyour sixth ray fanaticism. Along this latter line you have made much progressand are much to be commended. Now the life of the first Ray of Will or Powermust sweep increasingly into prominence. For you, it is not so much theimposition of the will aspect which is needed but the understanding of the Planand your consequent intelligent cooperation with that Plan. But it is the planfor humanity and not the plan for you as a partner and cooperator with thegreater Plan. In your personal reading and study for the coming months, Isuggest that you search out all references to the Plan in my books, noting theaspects which are of immediate import and dealing not with the plan for thecoming race and for the distant future. Then list briefly and concisely thesalient points in the Plan; be not prolix and train yourself to a brevity whichin no way negates lucidity.Proceed with the breathing exercises I assigned you for they are producing inyou much needed changes. Adhere closely to my instructions and carry forward thework; it should now be automatic. Note how, in doing so, you are carryingforward three lines of activity simultaneously:1. A physical activity....2. An imaginative activity which sees the above moving of energy in an orderedrhythm and which visualises it as being raised.3. A thought activity which is subjectively and steadily aware of the dualprocess and of its objectives. The objectives are to organise the energy bodyand so order the forces of the body that a mental effect is achieved.To all these, a fourth activity might be added—that of the Observer, of the soulon its own plane, perceiving or looking on at the development of this triplefunctioning. Forget not, my brother, that all disciples must learn to beconscious simultaneously on all three planes and to carry on consciously severalactivities. This exercise should train you in this facility. I would remind youthat there is often a deeply scientific raison [248] d’être for the exercisesand suggestions which I may give. They may not be apparent to you at first butyour ignorance in no way negates the efficacy of that suggested; the inner workof organisation can proceed easily e’en when there is no understanding of thereasons for which it is done.As to your meditation work, I seek at this time to change it. You have followedfor a long time that which I gave you earlier. I now suggest meditation work tobe most carefully followed and attempted with due watching of the effects. Thisentire meditation is to be carried forward in the heart—not in the physicalheart but in the heart centre between the shoulder blades and in the ethericbody. Thought must be kept off this location, however, after the first definitefocussing of the consciousness in the etheric body. Here is the meditation:1. Alignment with the soul, to be carried forward as rapidly as possible untilit becomes eventually almost instantaneous. Then say with deliberation: I am thesoul. The soul am I.2. Then centre your consciousness in the love aspect of your nature, the energywhich flows through the heart centre and endeavour to keep it steadily there.However, forget about the fact of the heart centre and keep the mindpredominantly upon the love aspect of the soul. Say then: I pour out love uponthe sons of men.3. Then for fifteen minutes ponder upon the nature and significance of love.4. After pondering the subject of love for three weeks each month, you can(during the fourth week) study with care the thoughts that have come into yourmind in connection with this theme. This you can do from the following threeangles:a. Of right or of wrong action in the expression of love.b. Of motive, high or low, in the expression of love.c. Of soul activity in the expression of love.The sixth ray expression of love is usually idealistic and fanatically applied;frequently, true love itself is lacking and there is the imposition upon othersof what the person himself thinks is love. It was the second ray energy [249] oflove which, in the case of Christ, dominated His sixth ray Personality. Slowlyand gradually, this domination must begin to take place in you.The rest of the meditation you know, and it need not be recorded here.~MY BROTHER OF OLD: August 1936I am anxious that you should realise that at the time of the full moon this yearone cycle of training and of integration closed and a new one started. Thekeynote of the cycle which passed was discovery—discovery of weakness, not anegative discovery but one which was fraught with responsibility; discovery ofyour fellow disciples and of your brothers, as pilgrims on the Path; discoveryof the goal and a consequent pledging of yourself to that goal; discovery of thework to be done and discovery of the Plan. All these discoveries have come toyou and have unfolded in your consciousness during the past few years. You havelearnt and known much. Now a new cycle begins and the keynote of that must beintegration with a view to its essential nature, its dominant need, and the workto be carried forward during the next few years. How shall this integration beachieved?As I study the disciples in this particular group, affiliated with my Ashram, Iask myself if it is possible that they can swing into the needed rhythm and solearn to work together as a unit. You are all so intensely individual and notonly so, but you are proud of it. You are deeply and subconsciously satisfiedwith this separative attitude. The group rhythm, the group unity, the groupintegrity and the group synthesis are secondary in the consciousness of severalof you to your own individual development, to your own attitudes, and to yourown personal points of view.I have only three disciples in this particular group who are free from thisweakness and who are primarily concerned with group life in contradistinction tothe individual unfolding life. The remainder are individualistic still, but notgroup members, integrated into the group. In saying this, I state to you your[250] problem. I realise that you love your co-disciples and that you have areal devotion to me, your teacher; you love the path which leads to light butyou and the others are still the dramatic centres of your own lives and you aretoo much the forceful actors upon your own stage, on which you each seek to playa leading part; subordination to group life, so necessary a factor in the workto be done, is as yet unappreciated. The reason for this is that you aredwelling as yet upon the astral plane; there is the focus of your consciousness.It is a high level of the astral plane but until you can shift to mental levelsand there learn to hold the mind steady in the light, your sense of proportionmust inevitably be wrong and the first and necessary things will not hold thefirst and necessary place.I seek to do two things with each disciple in this particular group:1. Point out the particular predisposition to the group life which exists in youand on what it is based.2. Indicate wherein you can integrate more closely into the group and thus feedthe group life, not simply drawing sustenance for yourself from the group.As I make this statement, I ask myself how frank I can dare to be and how far Ican go with my instructions to you. Is it possible that you would all accept mypoint of view, for I cannot call it criticism? Criticism is always destructive,no matter by whom it is given. The indications of a needed change in attitude,proffered to you in love and from a deep-seated desire to see you all freed forfuller service is surely in a different category. May I, therefore, speak to allof you in freedom? And will you give as much attention to my words as you wouldto an older, loved and trusted friend? I ask for no more than that. I have nointention to coerce you. I only desire to help, to aid you in a liberatingprocess and to see you walking with joy in the light.What, therefore, is the note of my specific message to you, my brother? What isthe thing which you primarily need to learn which would govern your attitude tothe group and which, when learnt, will integrate you more closely into my group?Simply this:[251] You can serve my group most and yourself best by achieving impersonalitywhere your personality is concerned . When you are free from the glamour ofpersonality, then you will integrate into your group in a new and effective way.You will be of value to my group and will feed its life because you will be achannel through which hierarchical life can flow and not simply be a recipientof that life as you now are. In the above sentences your whole life problem issummed up. It is I.B.S. who loves and serves; it is I.B.S. who speaks wisely andwho works for me. The focus of your attention on your training and your lifedemonstration is: How far am I, I.B.S., complying with requests? What use am I,I.B.S., making of this information? What results am I, I.B.S., getting from mymeditation practice? What phenomena do I, I.B.S., register at the time of thefull moon? Always I. Always I.B.S. Read back, brother of mine, over all thereports you have written about your work during the past two years. Gather themtogether and run with rapidity through them so as to get their general trend andnote if my words are not warranted.Here lies the crisis for you. Here is indicated to you what your next stepforward into the light should be. The question now arises as to what you shoulddo, how you should proceed and how work towards liberation from the “I complex.”Let me, for the sake of clarity and in order to be concise, list the stagesthrough which you must go:1. Refuse to dramatise I.B.S. Go on with your work, plan, teach and study, butdo it in self-forgetfulness, being urged thereto by group needs, by world needand by my need of help in the work I plan.2. Learn to do this by pondering upon the soul, by strengthening your soulcontact and by bringing about a more stable alignment. Learn to think always interms of the group and not in terms of I.B.S. This is bound to take time for arhythm which has been thus established over a period of years is not easilybroken and dissipated. Old rhythms take some displacing.3. Pay closer attention to the evening review and change from the one which youare now doing to one on impersonality....[252] If you will with faithfulness carry forward this work, you will freeyourself from the grip of personality and there will not then exist in you thosebarriers to group integration which are now found. Having pointed this out toyou, my brother, let me add that you have no real cause for discouragement foryou have made real progress. You have much, as a soul, to give. Once you havefreed the channel from that which today clogs and hinders, you can greatlyenrich the group life and give much to your fellow disciples. Go forward,therefore, with joy into a richer service and a more true self-forgetfulness.The breaking of the influence of sixth ray energy, as it expresses itself inyour personality life, is not an easy task but it is one to which you are equal.Earlier I definitely laid the foundation for what I have here said to you foryou will remember that I referred to the sublimation of your personality.~MY BROTHER: February 1937Your replies to the questions which I asked were honest. It is not wise,however, for you to continue the process of introspection too closely for youranalytical mind is functioning adequately these days and the danger ofover-functioning is ever present. In a life given to teaching (such as yoursis), whether it is teaching physical plane matters or giving esotericinstruction, the teacher has ever to practise the divine art ofdecentralisation. Being by force of circumstances placed at the centre, theinner attitude cultivated must be that of a planned, peripheral attention, anidentification with those to be instructed and loss of the constant sense of thelittle self. The practising of detachment from self-concern and self-conceitwhich the onlooking soul evinces is no easy task, particularly for one of yourtemperament. How can it be achieved.The terms of release are so simple, my brother; the art of conformity is sohard. What are these terms? I will list them with brevity, for you need not,after all your training, that I should elucidate:1. The focussing of attention in the head. [253]2. Alignment of the bodies through correct and supervised breathing and eventualabstraction. Ponder on these two requirements for you can use them now and studyalso the ancient words of Patanjali who deals fully with the subject.3. Identification with others and then the final losing sight of the littleself. See, however, that in this case, right motive controls.4. Intense dynamic interest in the theme of the moment, free from fanaticism andboundaries, realising that—rightly handled—all themes are of spiritual moment.You should only evidence interest in the self during the hour of the eveningreview which I would ask you still carefully to continue. It is of real profitto you.... Life for you at this time holds much of service. See to it that youcrystallise not. As one gets older in the physical sense (a thought which youever evade, my brother) there is always the tendency to become set in one’s liferhythms and objectives; the life theme is steady and the danger of rigidity isvery real. See to it that you keep flexible and fluid and learning all the time.Teach, my brother, from the living experiences which you undergo and not from anaccumulated series of life episodes. This thought warrants your carefulconsideration. Only thus can your words and your life influence carry to othersthat living fire which can set their lives ablaze with divinity. Choose not thesubjects of your service but serve all who seek your aid. Seek them notyourself. In that last thought lies for you much of future understanding.One thing I seek to say to you, but I can only convey my thought in words thatare necessarily vague. It is not my task to cast too much light into the future.This I will say, however: Mould your life upon the pattern of the sannyasin andhold on to no physical plane attachments. If you do, they will fail you and thepain in thus holding will hinder your feet as they stumble upon the Path. Walkfree, my brother, and hold to nobody and hold no person to you in the bonds ofattachment. Can you be a true sannyasin and stand in life alone or with onlyyour brother disciples as comrades and friends? In the developments of the nexttwo years see that these words of mine constantly recur to your mind, for thuswill you handle the eventualities [254] of life relationships in a spiritualmanner. Should you be able to see life’s circumstances rebuilt around you or seethem crumble to nothingness with equal equanimity, then your field of servicecan enlarge. You will have no interest in the affairs of the little self. Seeingthis, the many little selves will come to you for help.~MY BROTHER: September 1937What I have to say to you can be adequately covered as I consider with you thefive rays which govern you in this particular life. Since I last communicatedwith you, your life has opened out increasingly along the lines of service toyour fellowmen and to us. One word I would say to you in this connection: Letnot that service take the place of your soul in your waking consciousness norlet the satisfactions—which inevitably come—supersede the longing for the blisswhich the soul experiences and which produces a magnetic rapport with the worldof souls. Live ever in the secret place of the soul and keep always silent.You have for many years reflected upon the relationship existing between yourfirst ray soul and your sixth ray personality. You have realised that for you(in this incarnation) only love and service must govern your life expression, ifthe ambition and pride of the first ray, and the fanaticism of the sixth raywith its glamour-producing characteristics are to be offset and balanceachieved. This relationship is your major problem. Let us further complicatethat problem by the recognition of the ray qualities of the three bodies!Perhaps, however, complication will be simplified and a study of the moredetailed personality tendencies may reveal to you sources of strength andproduce clarification. It is of value to know the lines of least resistance.Your mental body is on the fourth ray and this can definitely be a help to youif the energy involved is rightly used, because—though it means the achievementof harmony through conflict—it also swings into action another second rayattribute, thus aiding in the work of “sweetening” your nature, if I may usesuch a banal word. As this ray controls your mental body, it places you,symbolically speaking, in the warrior caste and [255] leads you to fight, e’enif it be purely idealistically, or at times under the influence of glamour.Your astral body is a real problem because it emphasises the ray of thepersonality; it too is on the sixth ray. It should be remembered that the raysthemselves have their secondary attributes and just as the sixth ray—expressedin your personality—can lead to the fanatical following of the ideal (whateverthat may connote to you) so the same ray in the astral body produces theexpression of devotion. In your case, this devotion constitutes for you the seedof selflessness. This devotion where you are concerned is not devotion to yourown selfish interests but it is for you a great extroverting factor. It leadsyou along the way of service. When, however, two instruments or vehicles and thesoul are on the same ray, then the problems of the right balancing of forcesemerges and this has been very real in your case, has it not?You have a third ray physical body. This gives you contact and brings you downto earth, a thing that a sixth ray person predominantly needs, particularly whenhighly developed. It aids you in expression upon the physical plane; it makes afocal point for the manifestation of the soul, for it is peculiarly the raythrough which the third aspect of divinity sweeps into expression; it canproduce the potency of personality expression but it can also prove a definitehindrance.In summing up, therefore, it might be stated that your rays are as follows:1. The ray of the soul—the first Ray of Will or Power.2. The ray of the personality—the sixth Ray of Devotion or Idealism.3. The ray of the mind—the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict.4. The ray of the astral body—the sixth Ray of Devotion.5. The ray of the physical body—the third Ray of Active Intelligence.This will make apparent to you the lines of energy which are coloured by the twomajor rays of our solar system: In your case they find their expression throughrays 4 and 6, and through rays 1 and 3. This is helpful to know, is it not?[256] One hint I will give you, brother of mine, at this time. Guard your healthduring the coming years and thus make increased service possible and also keepfluid in intent, in purpose, and in activity. As time goes on, you willcomprehend to what I am referring.~MY BROTHER: February 1938The coming year will see you facing two basic decisions. What they will be isnot for me to indicate. Through recognition of the decisive crises in life, thedisciple gains the strength to stand alone and detached, and, through theability to stand detached, comes the power which the divine Observer can wieldif he does not identify himself with circumstance. One of the things which willemerge during the coming century will be a better understanding of the Law ofCycles. There will then eventuate a comprehension of the life rhythm with itshigh moments, its dark and depressed hours (I speak not in terms of emotionalreaction but of the alternates to the moments of altitude) and its difficultinterludes wherein understanding is wrought out through the action of appliedreason. It is particularly wise for sixth ray people to master the Law of Cyclesand of rhythmic growth, for their predisposition to fanatical and violentactivity can be offset by wise handling of the life rhythm.You have passed through a period of expanded service; it has carried you farfrom the life intent of earlier years and new relations and new forces motivateyour days. See to it that enough of the old conditions and the old relations arepreserved in order to guarantee continuity and stability. I seek to word theteaching which I give to you and your co-disciples in this group in such a waythat perception may come to those for whom the specific teaching is intended,yet nothing need be said which would foment curiosity in the minds of the otherdisciples in the group.You have travelled far during the past six years and your life trend (and bythis I mean your spiritual life trend) is now definitely established. I usethese words in order to express the idea of the soul’s intention. Can you castyour mind back to [257] the year in which that orientation became definite? Suchretrospects have real value, my brother.I seek today to deal with the mental problems of the disciples in this group. Itold you earlier that your mental body was conditioned by the fourth Ray ofHarmony through Conflict. This ray has been a factor which has resolved many ofthe difficulties set in motion by your sixth ray personality, focussed and mademore powerful by a sixth ray astral body. The personality is alwayspredominantly allied with or focussed in one of its three aspects. I willendeavour to show you now the vehicles through which the soul ray alsooutstandingly expresses itself:1. Soul energy, in your case, seeks expression through the vital or ethericbody.2. Personality force is focussed in the astral body.A little reflection upon these two facts will make clear to you wherein yourlife problem consists. It has been the problem of fusing and blending thepersonality so that the energy of the soul may control from mental levels, andso employ your fourth ray mental body that the over-activity of the vital andthe astral bodies may be overcome. It is helpful to know this, is it not? Thereare certain great aligning qualities which are brought into play when the soulcan grip and control the vital body, but they demonstrate more as physicalvitality than as qualities in consciousness. This I think you know. During theremainder of your life, if you will work with and control (as a soul) yourmental body, you will enter into your next incarnation with the control of thepersonality centred in the mind. That means a greatly expanded consciousness andfar more power to serve—power adjusted to the need which is faced.What, my brother, are the characteristics of a fourth ray mental body? Let melist a few of them for you, leaving you to make your own application, intruthfulness and understanding. [258]Destructive Constructive An inner mental battle The resolution of the pairs ofopposites. Many antagonisms Non-partisanship. The Middle Way. Prejudice Tolerantunderstanding. Personality unity and synthesis Group unity and synthesis.Discord, interior and exterior Harmony within and without. Environal problemsEnvironal peace. Imposition of the personal will Expression of the will-to-love.There are, of course, many other qualities and tendencies but I have enumeratedthose of the greatest usefulness to you. I would remind you that the fourth rayis, when a part of the personality force equipment, the expression of thewill-to-love (either in the material sense or in the spiritual). It is,therefore, allied to the first ray, through its will emphasis. It should not beso difficult for you, consequently, to shift your soul emphasis into the “mindarea” and from there control the physical body instead of controlling it (as isnow the case) by a great effort of soul control from soul levels. This is a hintto the way of release for you.However, as you seek to bring about this emphasis, remember always, my brotherof old, that it must be the will-to-love which is essential to you; it is tothis end that I suggest the assigned meditation. I would suggest that youconcentrate upon this fourth ray, with its keynote of the will-to-love,expressed in harmony whilst in the midst of conflict. In your next incarnation,you should function through a second ray personality but this will depend uponthe success of your present effort and upon your ability to grasp the outlinesof your task. You have, therefore, to transmute your sixth ray devotional andfanatical tendencies into spiritual love and strength; your one-pointedness mustbe based on an inclusive orientation. It has, hitherto, been based on sixth rayaspiration. In the future, it must be founded on intelligent conviction—a verydifferent thing, my brother, and mental in nature.I would ask you to make a careful study of all that you can find anent thefourth ray in A Treatise on the Seven Rays and make definite application to yourown mental unfoldment and a practical interpretation of its desired effects interms of your own life. You should ask yourself the following question: Whatwill be the effect, in the personality life upon the physical [259] plane, of anestablished alignment between my first ray soul, my fourth ray mentality and myphysical brain?I assign, therefore, the following meditation:1. Achieve alignment, conscious fusion and stability.2. Then definitely and consciously shift your attention into the mental body....3. Next, consider the pairs of opposites with which your personality must dealin this life. Do this by the aid of your fourth ray mental body.4. Visualise these pairs of opposites as two high mountains, separated by anarrow pass between them; this is, for you, the symbol of “the narrow way.”5. See these mountains, standing on either hand, one in the shade and the otherin the light. See the narrow way between as a golden pathway. Then pictureyourself as “passing between.” As you do this remember that your soul isobserving you, the personality, progressing on this Middle Way.6. Then take the following seed thoughts for careful reflection:1st month—I stand in light, the One Who can observe.2nd month—The distant, wandering one, who is my little self, I call to me.3rd month—Between the Pillars of the Way, I pass. I leave these twain on eitherhand.4th month—The Middle Way leads to a bridge and on that bridge I stand.5th month—And on that bridge I meet my Self.6th month—And thus the two are one and harmony is now established.~MY BROTHER: February 1939In my last communication to you, I dealt very thoroughly with the problem ofyour “manifestation within the planetary life” (as it is esoterically called)and discussed your ray equipment [260] at some length. You have, as sincerelyand earnestly as you could, endeavoured to make the information of use inbringing about a better presentation of your soul’s objective through the mediumof your daily life. This I have not failed to recognise. You have found, haveyou not, that one at least of the decisions to which I referred is alreadyconfronting you. The issue as yet remains undecided for the task ofrelinquishment is not easy. I would suggest to you that that which has to berelinquished may not be that upon which you are at this time laying theemphasis. I would remind you also that the Law of Sacrifice is ever followed bythe Law of Re-Appropriation in the spiritual sense. Upon this fact I would askyou to ponder.The world today is in such a distressing condition that the major need in everycountry is the appearance of “steadily shining points of light” which canillumine the way for others, dispel the gloom and produce right reaction, basedupon a clear seeing of the issues involved. The smaller happenings of anindividual’s life can aid him to gain facility in thus seeing and shining. Inthis task of dispelling the gloom, those of you who are working in my group ofdisciples can help set the way, aid in determining the pace and so swell thenumbers—small as yet—of those who constitute the “lighted points.” To do thisadequately requires a personal and group decentralisation which few of you asyet possess but for which you are struggling and must continue to struggle.The cultivation of a divine indifference as to where you are and what you aredoing would be of peculiar value to you and you would profit much if each nightyou meditated for five minutes upon your capacity to demonstrate this neededspiritual detachment.I would ask you also to follow a very brief meditation so that there may comeabout a more easy fusion between your soul and personality, between these tworay energies—one of which conditions you in space and the other determines youin time. The problem is not an easy one, because your first ray energy—combiningwith and subduing your sixth ray forces—will produce a great stimulation unlessyou adhere closely to my instructions. The effect will be felt in your astralbody. This [261] stimulation is not desirable and must be avoided by you at allcosts. If, therefore, you find that the use of this meditation produces anincreased expression of sixth ray force and that you are becoming increasinglypotent astrally, increasingly “devoted” to what you are doing, increasinglycritical and irritable and increasingly fanatical—then promptly discontinue itsuse. Work only in the heart centre when using this suggested form and be sure nothought shifts down to the solar plexus—that open door to the astral plane. Makea short, quick alignment with the soul. Know yourself to be, in truth, the OneWhose nature is spiritual detachment and isolation (not separativeness ordivision), then pause and stabilise yourself in that consciousness. In thesecret place within the heart, let the personal self meet the real Self face toface and let it there dedicate itself to the service of the soul with deepconsecration, devoted love and fluidic intent. By fluidic, I mean thewillingness to do what the soul requires, when registered and recognised by youas the next duty.Let not the glamour of attainment of your service goals, brother of old, blindyour eyes to the need for further and constant training. The disciple oftbecomes absorbed in the work to be done to such an extent that he forgets thatthe outer life of service will become arid and full of personality unless it isparalleled by a growing sensitivity to the impulses of the soul. That soul islove and understanding. Cease not to work at the problem of true spiritualperception and be not so occupied with the task of service that you neglect thelessons which you yourself must learn. Live as you teach and keep your valuesclear. You have done good and faithful service and helped many. Take helpyourself without unduly emphasising in your own consciousness your own need.NOTE: This disciple has never wavered and is earnestly endeavouring to work forthe Tibetan and to tread the Path of Discipleship under His instruction.~TO L. D. N-C.April 1939BROTHER OF OLD:[262] And what shall I say to you, fiery warrior in our work? Just this: Inquietness and in confidence shall be your strength and in an all-inclusive lovelies your opportunity. This, I think you know. You have made real progress inswinging free from the limitations of a sixth ray personality during the pastthree years. I have watched you now for seven years and you have broken loose ingreat measure from certain very definite handicaps. That which hinders you nowis mostly old habits of thought and speech and these too must go. They must go,not through a drastically imposed inhibition, but swept away through theinflowing tide of love.You have a difficult combination of rays, my brother, and these have powerfullyconditioned your life. Your egoic ray is the first ray and your personality rayis the sixth Ray of Devotion. Power, will, devotion, idealism, fanaticism—suchis the combination. Fortunately for you, in your last life, your personality raywas the second ray of love and so it had been for several previous lives. Thishas greatly aided in off-setting the dynamic destructive effects of your sixthray force. Of this you should be very glad.Now you are entering slowly into a new cycle of activity. Let it bedistinguished by love and by no desire for anything for the separated self. Youmight reply to this by saying that you believe yourself to be free from all suchdesire. But, brother of mine, were you so free, you would not suffer so muchover people or over the frustration which always comes—and always will—until thedisciple no longer cares for success or non-success, for appreciation or fornon-appreciation. Ponder on this and search your heart more closely. You are onthe verge of real release and I tell you this for your comforting and help.To carry forward this new service to which you have dedicated yourself, you needthe releasing power of the tide of love which is the soul. Forget not that youare on the power ray. It is the power of love intelligently to serve . Let thesewords be the keynote of your reflection and endeavour for the next [263] fewmonths. I will give you a meditation which will facilitate your effort....I have also suggested that you do the attached review on Detachment. You willfind it profitable to use for a while. Go forward in peace, and with assurance,my brother. You have much to give; much wisdom, much experience and muchunderstanding. Often, however, you “stand in your own light,” and yourpersonality interposes itself between the real spiritual self and those whom youseek so ardently to serve.NOTE: The pressure of life in Europe during the world war, 1939, has made itimpossible for this disciple to continue at this time.~TO R. V. B.November 1931To you, my brother, my words are as follows: You have this life stepped out intoa greater measure of release than was anticipated by your soul or by Those Whowatch upon the inner side of life. The day of opportunity opened for you and youtook it. I have sought within your aura for that with which I should deal and mymessage for you is perhaps an unexpected one—the message of speed . Not hurrynor the rushing forward into experience with undue haste, but the steady,conscious quickening of the vibration which leads to power. Your outerdemonstration gives not full expression to the pulsating life within; theactivity of your soul is limited by your physical plane movements. More rapidcoordination between the inner and the outer is needed and this at no cost toyour achieved poise nor your really fine efficiency. You will know whereof Ispeak for, in your high moments, you annoy yourself by your slowness of responseto the things which are inwardly sensed. You have poise, courage and knowledgeand the “way of the disciple”, which the disciple has to tread, is known to you,but the cells of the physical body need more rapid sensitising and this throughthe bringing in of energy and not through diets or [264] other physical planemeans. For the next six months send the energy you may contact to the throatcentre—not to the physical throat, but to the centre which lies back of thephysical organ up the spine and yet outside the physical body altogether. Thisfact should be remembered by all disciples. The seven energy centres are to befound about three inches behind their locations as usually denoted. If this isborne in mind, much physiological danger will be avoided. Rapidity of spiritualreaction in all the cells of the body is the word for you, brother of mine....Go forward in strength (which you have) and in peace (which is yours) and inpoise. For you, breathing exercises will do much.~BROTHER OF OLD: June 1932You have carried much responsibility and done much work with fortitude, and youmust now remember that all periods of strain are but preparatory to the handlingof still more work with increased efficiency and speed. Of one thing I wouldseek to remind you. All disciples who are being trained for that stage called bythe inappropriate name of “accepted disciple” are being taught to use their ownmagnetic vibration to gather to themselves those who will constitute their owngroup, those whom they can specifically help. This work, they are taught bybeing put into a position of trust in relation to their fellowmen. Your work is,therefore, the work of training people to be workers and so fit them to becooperators with the Plan. You will contact those who need you not as a leaderor teacher. They will be those whom you know and feel require training and help.They have to be taught to work inclusively and to be animated by intelligentlove. Take them into your aura and hold them in the light. Note their increaseof capacity and later their individual reaction to you yourself. By this youwill arrive at an understanding of your vibratory, magnetic capacity. The soul’snature is love and love is the great attractive force.In reference to my comment anent “accepted disciples,” I would remind you that,after all, the Master accepts no one. [265] He only recognises achieved capacityand ability and then endeavours to use them for the furthering of the divineplan. Disciples need to enquire, therefore: Does the love aspect in my naturedraw people to me personally so that I can help them or does it set up a soulinterplay between them and me? This is something that I would have you study anddo. The extent of your magnetic radiation could well be doubled and is not yetequal to the power latent within you.The mantram which I have chosen for you is intended to embody a statement ofyour life purpose. It is as follows:“I know the Law and towards the goal I strive. Naught shall arrest my progresson the Way. Each tiny life within my form responds. My soul has sounded forththat call and clearer day by day it sounds. The glamour holds me not. The Pathof Light streams clear ahead. My plea goes forth to reach the hearts of men. Iseek, I cry to serve your need. Give me your hand and tread the Path with me.”Your usefulness to my group is that of emotional poise. See that you lose itnot, whate’er betide. It means more than you can realise to your co-disciples.~MY BROTHER: January 1933Since I last communicated with you, you have had many conditions to face whichhave inevitably promoted growth and developed your intuition. This latterfaculty is steadily awakening and for you one of the ways of externalising yourinner awareness is through the use of a spiritual diary. Gather seed thoughtsout of your consciousness and deepen your grip upon these thoughts by puttingthem on paper and enlarging upon them as you write. Your meditation each day canbe made to serve such a purpose also and the two requirements for rightmeditation (where you are concerned) are the formulation of such seed thoughtsand definite visualisation work....The reason for the meditation which I am giving you is to foster a closeintuitive recognition of the reality which lies behind the group of discipleswith which you are now associated [266] through your relationship with me.Another is the stimulation of the throat centre through which you must learn towork during the third stage of the meditation work assigned.... Watch themeditation work with care and communicate with A.A.B. should you feel the needof advice.Your contribution to my work you know. You have to present a stable focal point;you must be a wise guide and friend and you must hold steadily the reins ofgovernment with self-effacement and yet with true insight. This is the task foryou, my brother. You must also foster impersonality in those who work aroundyou; this can only be accomplished as you yourself learn to be more impersonallypersonal. Impersonality is not hard for you but the more difficult task ofpersonal interest and contact is to be achieved, for you will unfold by thatmethod. What you have done is known and recognised, brother of old, but forthanks you look not.~MY BROTHER: June 1934The door of opportunity—growing out of the intensified effort of the next twoyears—opens wide for you. You have perhaps noted, as you have read theinstructions given by me to my group, that I am somewhat changing my approachand giving each of you a slightly more intensified personal interest. The reasonfor this is that at the beginning of this fourth year of our work together, I amforced to recognise your sincerity as a group and your willingness asindividuals to conform to the requirements. This sincerity and willingness havebeen voluntarily given. This warrants a greater effort on my part—an effortcalled forth by the group itself. My time is most precious at this period ofworld activity but I am willing to cooperate with the group if they continue toevidence willing service. Given a little more personal training, the result maybe out of all proportion to the effort on my part.Bear in mind that as I think of you (when communicating with you at the time ofthe full moon each month) it will inevitably produce a stimulation and apouring-in of energy. This is only now constructively possible. We, who teach,have [267] to guard our disciples from the potency of the group which werepresent. The risk of over-stimulation is always real and present. It is forthis reason that you will find it of value to study with care all theinstructions which disciples in my group (whom you may know) may be willing toshare with you. My spiritual interest and its consequent effects in energy formare spread over the entire series of teachings, given individually or to thegroup as a whole. In this way, the potency is somewhat stepped down; the groupbecomes more closely integrated and the life of each disciple, the problems ofeach and the achievement of each become part of the group life, the groupproblem and the group achievement. I commend these words to you forconsideration—life, problem, achievement or, presenting them as a duality,life-consciousness and form-activity.In this connection (for I choose my words with care) I would remind you inparticular, my brother, that the wise disciple regards all outer expression onthe physical plane of experience as achievement . There is no essential failure.At this stage in the life of the disciple, there may be a failing to meet therequirements with perfection; there may come cycles of aridity and of aseemingly static condition; there may be times wherein the sense of futility isdeep and real. But none of these will be lasting. The grip of the soul upon itsinstrument, the personality, is too strong for these cycles to be more thantransient episodes.I am not proposing to change your meditation work at this time. Continue with itas outlined to you in my last communication. Seek for the symbol to be foundabove the head of each of your co-disciples. This is an interesting form of workand for you at this time most developing. Bear in mind that in the interplay oflove (that which goes forth and that which is given back) will suddenly comerevelation. A few hints at this point may prove useful to you:1. In the linking of the heart and the ajna centres will come increased abilityto do this work. This linking will come as you pour out love to your fellowdisciples and as you endeavour to focus your consciousness between the eyebrows(the ajna centre). It is here that you have failed in technique....2. Direct your thought energy (which is the carrier of love [268] energy) to theajna centre of each of your fellow disciples....3. Study with care the instructions given to your fellow disciples, and seek tofit more definitely into the general plan. You are inwardly freer thanheretofore and must endeavour to keep your personality life free and simple. Ithink you will know within yourself wherefore I am emphasising to you, at thistime, the two words: Freedom. Simplicity. They are, for you, the key tosuccessful service. Let nothing and no one remove you from your achieved innerpoise. Yet turn not your back on aught of joy or happiness which may come yourway and that may increase your efficiency in the work—the place wherein yoursoul, your karma and your link with my group have placed you.The speeding up of your vibratory capacity has proceeded satisfactorily. If youcan maintain this increase through the power of your meditation, you will bringyour inner bodies into such a rhythm that the demands of the future will findyou equipped to meet them.That you may with steadiness and joy go forward to the work of the coming yearand that you may give to the group the measure of your strength is my prayer foryou.~BROTHER OF OLD: July 1935I gave you in my previous instruction much upon which you can still work. Thereis much that you have not yet fully grasped and I would like you to re-read whatI said with renewed care and understanding. With the exception of two of thisparticular group of disciples, all are in training for greatly extended serviceand that service will begin to take form very shortly.... Until that timearrives, work at an intensification of your understanding and heightening ofyour vibration.In the daily round of duties and of detail comes for you the opportunity totransfigure life in terms of accomplishment. In these words are to be found foryou the objective of this life’s endeavour. True accomplishment involves a lifeof steady radiance and stable uniform activity; but, brother of mine, in thisactivity and general accomplishment there must come—[269] as the years goby—what I might call crises of achievement . There must be culminating momentswhen the uniform activity climaxes into hours of dynamic crisis. Then one cycleof work ends in some direction or another and a new cycle of activity commencesin the same place and within the limits of the same general endeavour; this isconsciously recognised as a new beginning. Unless such moments of crisis occur,the life simmers down to a general dead level and (even if useful) offers notthe chance for an extreme effort with its consequent need to draw upon the fullresources of the soul.The routine of the daily demands can usually be met by the technique of analigned personality and in your case this is particularly so. It must, however,have in it—if it is to be adequate to the demands of this day and period ofopportunity—those moments wherein the personality demands the full cooperationof the soul. Every such moment of fusion increases the personality potential andits vibratory influence; it also initiates those unfoldments that profoundly anddeeply change the rhythm of the life. In these days, all working disciples mustlearn to use their entire equipment and every aspect of their physical nature,the whole man in the threefold world of human evolution.One point might here be noted. The extremity of the disciple in service finallydraws out the interest of the soul. After the third initiation, the extremity ofthe soul (speaking symbolically and conveying no true meaning to the aspirant)evokes the cooperation of the Monad. Thus service is the scientific mode, parexcellence, to evoke spiritual integration and to call forth the resources of adivine son of God. I am emphasising this to you as I seek to have you note,during this coming year, the points of crisis in your life which are the outcomeof the pressure to serve.Note these in the following way and ask yourself the following questions,entering the relation of the crisis in your spiritual diary:1. What was the form of service which produced the crisis?2. Was it in the field of the emotional or the mental life?3. What steps did I take to produce a fuller soul experience in order to meetthe necessity? [270]4. Did the crisis produce any definite after-effects of a relatively permanentnature in the lower bodies?During the next few years such crises are possible. It is also possible that twoof them may pass unrecognised by you. Therefore, my brother, watch with careyour daily life and note the moments of opportunity wherein, given a little morestimulation, your field of accomplishment may expand and your vibratory rate beincreased.~January 1936As you have seen, my brother, I am not making any vital changes in the work ofthe group now. An increased momentum in service and a more rapid spiritualreaction at all times should constitute the major emphasis from now on. I havetold all of you so much during the past four years that (should I now cease myinstructions) you have, both as individuals and as a group in my Ashram,sufficient teaching and information to carry you along the Path for a very longway. But I continue with my task of awakening each of you upon the subtlerplanes in order to intensify the contribution to world aid that you can make andto stimulate you, as a group, to avail yourselves of the world opportunity forservice.Go forward, therefore, with the same work as outlined in the previousinstructions; during the next six months take as your seed thoughts formeditation three sentences out of that earlier teaching:1. Transfigure life in terms of accomplishment. True accomplishment involves alife of steady radiance.2. There must ever be crises of achievement which will draw upon the fullresources of the soul. These must be demanded by the personality.3. Understand the technique of an aligned personality, for the extremity of thedisciple in service draws out finally the interest of the soul.You will ponder upon these ideas during the coming months, remembering that theyembody your needed lesson and your [271] ultimate achievement; and that theyalso indicate in a most amazing manner the work and the achievement of the NewGroup of World Servers.~BROTHER OF MINE: June 1936I would commend you today for work accomplished silently within yourself. Howmuch has been done, only you yourself can gauge. A steady re-adjustment has goneforward in your life and in your grasp of the work essentials, and you havesucceeded in freeing yourself inwardly from much of the detail work with whichyou have been confronted. This was my desire; in the future, you can do muchtowards an aspect of my work which makes the rest of it possible. I refer to thefinancing of the work which I have planned. Cooperating with those who areendeavouring to procure the needed funds for the work to be done during the nextfew years will strengthen you inwardly and eliminate that fear which stilltinctures much that you do. This fear to which I refer is not due to lack ofcourage as it is to fear of definite action, of clear speech where individualsare concerned, where the need is for a direct appeal and a straight presentationof the facts is warranted. This fear is being overcome; for this I have muchcommendation for you because this fear went down into the very roots of yourbeing; it is basic in the form life and also in the specialised activity of thesecond ray type and is coincident with your second ray ability to reactsensitively to others. It is, therefore, a problem to you of peculiardifficulty, as it is a soul expression and not a personality one.This whole question of money is one of the greatest difficulty at this time andalso one of the utmost simplicity. The difficulty is due to the wrong thoughtwhich, for generations, has been brought to bear upon the problem, leading towrong attitudes, even among the most devoted disciples. The attitude of humanityto money has been coloured by greed, by grasping for the lower self, byjealousy, by material desire and by the heart-breaking need for it which—in itsturn—is the result of these wrong attitudes. These wrong attitudes lead to [272]the disastrous economic conditions which we find all around us. They are effectsof causes which are initiated by man himself. In the re-generation of money andin the changing of man’s attitude to it will eventually come world release. Ifthis cannot take place, then some dire condition will arise; money (as we knowit) will vanish off the earth and the situation will have to be met in someother way. Let us hope that this will not be needed but that it will be possibleto change the thought of humanity where money is concerned so that it will beregarded as a great spiritual asset, as a definite spiritual responsibility andas a means to real world work. The custodians of money will then shoulder theirresponsibility without fear and with due understanding. At present, they hold onto it through fear of the future and distrust of each other. The key to theright expenditure of money and to its correct use can be summed up in thefollowing statement to which I would ask all of you to pay attention:As money has in the past ministered to personal and family need, so in thefuture it must minister to group and world need. Each unit has, in the past,attempted to act as a magnet and to attract to itself that which will meet whatit regards as its need—using personal activity and labour, if of no influence oreducation, and financial manipulation where that was possible. Groups in thefuture must act as magnets; they must see to it that they are animated by aspirit of love. I give you a thought here which is capable of much expansion.Need, love and magnetic power are the three things which—consciously orunconsciously—attract money. But they must all manifest at once. The need in thepast has not always been real, though it has been felt (such is the worldglamour and illusion). The love has been selfish or unreal; the demand forthings material has been for that which is not necessary to health or happiness.The magnetic force utilised has been, therefore, wrongly motivated and thisprocess—carried forward over so long a time—has led to the present direfinancial situation in the world.By the transmutation of these factors and the expression of their highercorrespondences—through right love, right thought or meditation and righttechnique—the financial requirements [273] of the new groups and of the NewGroup of World Servers will be found. I would suggest that an elaboration ofthese ideas should be disseminated among all whom you know who could help. Iwould ask you to ponder much on these ideas for, in the education of theintelligent world servers, this question of money and of right attitudes towardsmoney and right meditation upon money must be boldly faced. The emphasis laid bycertain large groups on meditation for the raising of funds (usually forpersonal use or for the selfish ends of their own particular organisation orgroup) has been based upon this emerging concept of the group use of money.Being, however, selfishly and personally interested, the money was thought of inrelation to the individual and not in relation to the group. This attitude mustand will be changed.One thing more I would ask of you, my brother, and of the group who read mywords. Money is the manifestation of energy. All energy can be applied indiffering ways, being in itself an impersonal and blind force. It can beselfishly or unselfishly used. That, in itself, constitutes the main difference.Motive and creative thought determine the magnetic power of any individual,group or centre. Determine your motive; see that your group ideal and group loveare dominant; use skill in action; this will involve right preliminarymeditation, plus correct thinking; then you will find that that which you needwill be forthcoming.I have little of a personal nature to give to you at this time. With you as withall the group there is much knowledge. You have been given and taught much, bothby your own souls and by myself in instructions and in my various books. It isnot possible for me to continue ceaselessly telling you that which you alreadyknow in theory and which you need now to work out in practice. That working outlies with you individually; when you have worked out that which you know, thenmore will be forthcoming. I can, however, teach you somewhat anent the neweraspects of group work and this I seek to do and you seek to know.One thing only would I say to you at this time of a personal nature: Rest muchthis summer; be much out of doors and lay [274] the foundations for work in thecoming winter months by much quiet thinking in the open air.~BROTHER OF OLD: January 1937Again there is little that I feel the need of saying to you. You are responsiveto much teaching upon the inner side and a form of definite reflectiveintercourse has been established betweena. Your inner, psychical nature.b. Your soul.c. Your brain.This should be gradually developed and cultivated. It is one of the majorintegrating forces and an adjuster of right conditions.There is only one thing that perhaps I might at this time emphasise for you andI can do it best in certain occult sentences which I have chosen for you andwhich take the form of four dynamic injunctions. If you grant them an obedientacquiescence and an intelligent understanding of their meaning, that obediencewill increase your vibratory rate and, consequently, your magnetic influence. Itwill also hasten or quicken your practical output upon the physical plane andenhance your value in the work which you, as a member of the New Group of WorldServers, are seeking to do. Let me phrase them for you without comment:1. See your outlines clear and let no haze of any kind veil the sharpness oftheir contours.2. Let both aspects of the truth emerge within your consciousness—the good, thebad, the true, the false, the real and the illusion. Face both, for both arefacts—the one in time and space and the other in eternity.3. Live on the mountain top and walk there with your brothers. Thus keep thevision clear above the fogs of earth.4. Fear not to speak the truth, whate’er it be. You love enough.~[275] BROTHER OF MINE: July 1937As you study your rays, the reason for the close relation between you and someof your fellow disciples will emerge into your consciousness more clearly. It isa relation not only of age-long mutual service and of understanding but also ofanalogous energies and forces and similarity in use.Your mental body is on the fourth ray; hence your power to harmonise and toavert conflict, thus acting as a calm centre in the whirlpool of activity withwhich you are surrounded. This is your dominant contribution to the work; Iwould have you ponder on this and intensify your effort to play this part andabove all to play it dynamically. It is a vital service which you can render, mybrother, and you have hitherto rendered it with success. I would have you renderit more consciously and, therefore, more dynamically.Your emotional body is upon the second ray and your development along this lineis sound and good.Your physical body is on the third ray; it is here that your major problem lies.It is closely connected with your mental problem which is that of an increaseddynamism. The dynamic power of your soul must pour through your fourth ray mind,galvanising it into a renewed, inclusive, loving, harmonising activity. Be moreoutgoing (as a part of your self-initiated training) to those, for instance,with whom your daily lot is cast. They need help. Give them of that help freelyand fully. The third Ray of Activity which governs your physical body is undulyquiescent and should be awakened by the soul to increased coordinated purpose.The following rays must, therefore, be taken into your consideration as you seekto live as a soul and to coordinate your personality:1. The soul ray—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.2. The personality ray—the fourth Ray of Harmony.3. The ray of the mind—the fourth Ray of Harmony.4. The ray of the astral body—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom. [276]5. The ray of the physical body—the third Ray of Active Intelligence.You will, from this tabulation, notice the relation existing between yourpersonality ray and your mental ray and that between the ego and the emotionalbody. These indicate to you lines of least resistance.~MY BROTHER: January 1938The four injunctions which I gave you earlier have done their work, have theynot? You see yourself more clearly now and know yourself, for you have thevarious aspects of yourself more definitely visioned—the good, the bad, thetrue, the false, the real and the illusion. This clearer vision—envisaging someaspects hitherto unrealised—will necessitate your living on the mountain top,and in the clear air there to be found to see life true , your task and yourco-disciples as they are. You have needed this more definite discovery ofyourself in order to advance towards greater usefulness. Some of this knowledgehas come to you during the past year, awakening you to certain values, revealingto you many hidden things within yourself and others, and consequently bringinginto your life new complications and emerging personal difficulties.I shall have more to say to you later when the adjustments necessary to yourchosen change of circumstance and of life have been made and quiet has settleddown again. These periods of upheaval and re-arrangement come at times—sometimessoul induced and sometimes as personality events. They must be lived through,the veiled lessons learnt and the possible expansions of consciousness induced.We facilitate or hinder these expansions by the moves we make; we hasten ordelay our growth by our enacted decisions. The true disciple, however, proceedsupon his way at any cost and naught can arrest his progress on the Path.I have asked myself what I can say to you at this time that will be of definitevalue. Four things—brief and to the point—come into my mind as I look at you andfeel for you a sense of [277] gratitude for your past consecration to the Planand a sense of hopefulness for your future service.First: I would say—Deepen your consecration and put first things first. Letnothing and no one stand between you, the vision, the Plan and your fellowdisciples.Second: Prepare for complications in your life, for now you travel not alone.Your life has been relatively free up to this time, but the choosing of acomrade must and does in every case bring other issues and other values intobeing. Upon the planes of soul and mind, you still must stand alone and if yougrasp this from the very start you will not find the complications of any greatimportance. They will only evoke a greater emotional livingness andunderstanding; this you have needed much and this you now can have. This alsoyou can handle wisely if you live upon the higher arc and do not descend intothe world of glamour and illusion. Remember, my brother, there can be equalityin love and purpose (from the basic and the essential point of view) but notequality of inner understanding or of point achieved upon the Path. The disciplecan do much for the probationer from the angle of the soul. The probationercannot do the same for the disciple.Third: Go forth upon the future way with courage and no fear. Stand in strengthbeside your fellow disciples, intent with them upon the chosen path. They standunfailingly beside you.Finally, my brother, become more definitely a radiant centre of magnetic life,fusing the people with whom you may work through love and understanding. That isa hard and difficult task for it means bringing together in the bonds of servicemany elements which might not otherwise fuse and blend. This involves anunderstanding, an analysis of human beings and a slow and patient work. As yourwork may grow and its boundaries extend, you will be faced increasingly with theperplexities and difficulties incident upon human relationships. These must behandled with impersonality, love and silence.Seek to integrate others into the service of humanity by yourself standing inspiritual being and radiating love and wisdom. I repeat again for yourconsideration and help during the coming months the third phrase which I earliergave you:“Live on the mountain top and walk there with your brothers. Keep the visionclear above the fogs of earth.” [278]Preserve your meditation as you are now doing. My blessing rests upon you.NOTE: This disciple is working steadily in the Tibetan’s Ashram.~TO D. A. O.August 1933BROTHER OF MINE:I have refrained from writing my personal instructions to you earlier than thisas I felt your need to think things through, and your strong inner urge to beleft free to work out the concept of this group work in your own way. Group workin connection with the spiritual life is not, for you, easy. Your life trainingas an artist in your own field has taught you to work on the physical plane ingroup formation. It is in the field of esoteric endeavour that you find inyourself an antagonistic reaction. There is in you, and rightly so, adetermination to be yourself and to stand alone and on your own feet. Thisdetermination of yours is sound. It has met a most needed demand of your ownsoul. It has been necessary for your personality to be forced by your soul to gothe lonely and isolated way.But it is this very quality of yours that I desire to weld into this group; itcan be offered by you in service to the group. It is in this participation in asubjective group endeavour—loosely organised on the physical plane and intendedto remain an inner group condition—which will give you opportunity to expressfor others the gain of your life experience. Therefore I would ask you toremember, my brother, that one of the contributions that you can make to thisgroup of fellow aspirants is the attitude you hold to organised forms. Anotheris your power of intuitive perception and your capacity to sense reality. I callyour attention to this. I am taking earnest students into my group, not with thesole intent of giving them esoteric training, but also for what they can bringto each other in the perfecting process. This group in my Ashram is composed ofhuman beings who are oriented towards the light, who [279] have made progress onthe Way, and yet who still have individual limitations, character defects andover-accentuated personality traits. There is a tendency to find one’s peace andrelaxation in a well-intended spiritual withdrawing and isolation; this is evera limitation of the mystic temperament. Is it not so?In any group which has for its objective the development of the intuition, theremust appear the concretising faculty of the mind. This the intuition must bothoffset and at the same time use. The mind emphasises form and the building offorms. The intuition is formless, and yet the ideas intuited must expressthemselves through form. From this concretising faculty, owing to your sense ofbeauty and your sense of the essential values, you are singularly free. For youthere must be the lesson of the equal divinity of form and of form building,with the creative work of organised detail in every balanced production. Beautyis, after all, as much of divinity as can be expressed through any one form.Remember that form and life are one . There is naught but life in manifestation.Your power to intuit, therefore, will aid the group, so regard your work as aservice to be definitely rendered.Emotional stress and strain and your intense love of beauty have been theprincipal training elements in your life. Oft you have been bewildered and yourfellowmen bewilder you at times. Seek for one year to bring to bear upon themand upon yourself the light of the intellect , and let the power of aspiritually applied analysis and the consecrated functioning of the concretemind be deliberately applied. Remain ever the Observer, using the concrete mindas a divinely organised instrument.Work with symbols will be found of real value to you if you persevere. I wouldgive you a hint anent them which your intuition will reveal. Where theconverging lines of any symbol meet and where the many lines cross there is apoint of force and of illumination, a focussed centre through which theillumined mind can pierce. Ponder on this.Will you for six months, my brother, attempt the following meditation,remembering that I but suggest and seek not to control or to dictate?...[280] Your other meditation is left to your own choice and discretion. Attentionto group requirements and the establishing of a self-imposed rhythm in your lifefor a year will give you good results.~MY BROTHER: February 1934The question as to the usefulness of this particular group work has beensomewhat answered in your consciousness, through your application to the workitself and what you have learnt thereby. The significance of the innerintegration of free souls, independent and standing upon their own feet, yetvoluntarily seeking union with the soul in group formation is assumingimportance to you. A living organism and not a vital organisation warrantsconsideration, and its life seems worth fostering. This you have recognised.You ask yourself, however, at times: “Of what specific usefulness am I, as anindividual, in the teacher’s group?” The development of your fellow disciples isnot uniform; some are possessed of this or that quality, and lack others; somefunction primarily on the plane of mind, others on the plane of the emotions.You have a fair measure of the intuition already developed, and—as I earlierpointed out to you—you can serve your group and facilitate their work in thisconnection. All gained quality of any kind must be regarded by the individual asa group asset and not as a personal achievement. This requires emphasising andinvolves clear thinking and detachment on the part of the group members. Alltrue recognition calls for these qualities. Therefore, my brother, seekincreasingly to foster this germ of the intuition from the purely unselfishmotive of group usefulness, remembering that the blending of the mind and theintuition produces a consequent organisation of spiritual faculty which worksout in power and magnetic force or radiation in the personal life.Your first ray personality can intensify the usefulness of this conjunction,just in so far as you can work constructively in your chosen field of work andwith your fellow students. A first ray personality can cause the soul muchdifficulty when not [281] subordinated in all humility to group service. Whenthe personality is guided by the intuition and by clear thinking and the life onthe physical plane is given to the freely imposed rhythm of organised service,then power can be conferred, and definite usefulness be the result.You might ask here, and rightly so, how this intuitive sensitiveness of yourscan be of service to the group with which you are associated. Let me, if youwill, give you a meditation which will render group service and which will aidme in my work of awakening these members of my Ashram to the light of theintuition. This meditation is based on the recognition that separation isfounded on personality living, but that in the realm of the soul there is noseparation but only a free circulation of spiritual life, light and love. Dothis meditation once a week and also at the time of the full moon, but continuewith that already assigned by me in my last instruction to you, as your owndaily exercise....I would like to point out that if you work this way, with the emphasis laid uponthe giving-forth aspect, there will be no danger of the growth of any mentalcontrol over your group brothers. Fifteen minutes given to this service once aweek will bring to you its own reward. But of that you need not think.Steadiness in all relations, in all relations, my brother, is a needed growth,and discipline or ordered habit is of real usefulness to you. This must beapplied not so much from the standpoint of organising the personality but ofyour release from time limitations. Be the ruler of your time and make the hoursof each day your servants, exacting from each hour its full quota of work orrest, without the sense of undue pressure or rush. When the time problem issolved by you, you will enter into a greatly increased usefulness. In this therehas already been real advance, but the effort can be carried still furtherforward when your interest in the significance of time is evoked more fully. Butthis must be done gradually, for the creative, intuitive worker has the problemof working in the realm of the timeless, and from that point of awareness hemust employ time in the art of producing that which he seeks to express. Youwill understand whereof I speak.Seek for the next few months, therefore, to increase your [282] intuitiveservice, to be the master of your time, to walk through life and to handle allyour relations from that centre of peace whereof you know, and which is to youthe one sure reality.~MY BROTHER: July 1934I have but little to suggest to you at this time, as I would ask you to continuewith the work as outlined by me in my last communication. I think you knowwithin yourself the value of the instruction then imparted and the reason why Iemphasised certain work. E’en if you do not understand, I who watch and guidecan see the germ of the needed organising faculty demonstrating in ever fullermeasure. Much of your usefulness to this group has been unrecognised by you asit has worked out mainly on the astral plane in a stabilising and lovingcapacity to integrate the group in love. Of this your physical brain is scarcelyaware.You have had a period of relative stability in a life hitherto full of ceaselessmovement, and this for you is novel and educational. Your life work,esoterically speaking, consists in mentally arresting and stimulating thethinkers and workers in the world, so that they measure up to the need and thedemand of those around them. So many people feel and think. You can teach themto think and feel. This connotes a wide distinction. I would ask you tocorrespond at times with a brother whose name I will give you. He needs yourwisdom and your strength, and you can help him through a period of apparentloneliness from which he now suffers.Your work for the group is to blaze the trail to the high places and to keep itopen.~BROTHER OF MINE: March 1935For a year now, I have made no change in your meditation. I have watched you forresults in two respects. I have sought, first, to see you (as I earlierexpressed it) a “master of time” and I have, secondly, noted the intuitive helpyou have sought [283] to render to your fellow group members. I have noted yourattention to these matters. The things which concern the soul are for you todayof far greater moment than those which concern the personality. This has beenillustrated for you in your personality disappointment and your group contact asevidenced in ... a little while ago. The integration of certain of your groupbrothers into your consciousness was the main objective of the experience. Outerpersonality contacts have a definite place and are of value if rightly handled.Your help, for instance, with I.B.S. can be increased through the nowestablished rapport. May I pause here, my brother, and thank you for the way youhave egoically stood by her and helped her through a crisis that was moreserious than any of you knew at the time?If you cast your mind back over the past three years, you will note a life fullof experience on all the planes of the personality; you can note too, if youwill, a growing tendency towards soul control. I say tendency, my brother, forit is when tendency is transformed into habit and dynamic daily rhythm that thegates of initiation open before the disciple. Your major work today is toestablish this habit. It lies for you hid in the control of time, whichconstitutes for you a major problem.The development of certain types of people demonstrates through their control offorce. With other types it shows in their control of the time factor and theirability to understand the practical significance of times and seasons, and theirright and regulated use. You belong to this latter group, and in achievementalong this line will come for you release and the establishment of beauty .There is a mystical beauty to be achieved, as we all know, through art. Itconveys a general sense of beauty, colour and inspiration, and thus it clothesand veils ideas. There is an occult (hidden) beauty also to be achieved in thefield of art. This conveys a different sense of beauty, colour and inspiration,clothed in those forms which reveal ideas. Mystical beauty veils, in beauty, theideal. Occult beauty reveals, in beauty, the ideal. For you the occultachievement must be the goal, and the revelation of ordered beauty in time andspace must constitute your synthetic effort. Ponder [284] on these words anddefinitions, for in them is to be found the secret of true creativeness.Meditate upon the distinctiveness of mystical inspiration and occult revelationand on their synthesis in all great achievement.The integration of the personality has been your task of late, carried forwardboth consciously and unconsciously. The enriching of your life experiencethrough fuller human contacts and a deepened understanding has for you thepromise of creative expression, provided that each day is dealt with by you asan arranged opportunity for organised effort.Will you understand me, my brother, if I say to you the following words? Spendyour time listening . Give expression to the sensed vision. Cultivate thewaiting attitude of psychic attentiveness, and when you hear the unheard andsense the intangible, endeavour to formulate it into words and expression ofsome kind, preserving the spirit of psychic drama which informs all such events.Forget not the occult truth that time and events are one basic phenomenalhappening.As regards your meditation work, I would suggest the following procedure. Bearin mind that I but make suggestion. It is for you to try out and see if wisdomlies behind my suggestion or not, and whether knowledge of you is the incentiveof my effort on your behalf....Write down at the close of your meditation work each day your thoughts. Latersee what has been the net result. Should you so desire, put it into proper formand share with your fellow disciples.This meditation will aid in bringing in your seventh ray power or organisedcreativeness which is one of your real needs, is it not? All work to be done atthis time must be planned to bring in the organising, synthesising, integratingaction of the soul. The technique will differ in the varying cases, but theobjective is the same.Guard your health, my brother.~September 1935There is not much that I have to say to you at this time, brother of old. Youget much teaching from me subjectively [285] and during the hours of sleep. Thatwhich you can bring through into your brain consciousness each day of thatteaching is of inestimable value to you, for it establishes a technique andopens up a channel through which you can “bring through” that which you sense,and this is for you a much needed and immediate development.This experiment in which we are attempting to take some members of my Ashram andform a group which will aid in the dissipation of the world glamour,necessitates most careful consideration and wisdom. It is an effort to provide afocal point through which the Hierarchy can reach and more readily attack theworld illusion. This requires the most careful training of the group members,and if all of you submit intelligently to this training and discipline, it willbe possible, later, to form a unit of occult potency and I may then set you somedefinite work to do as a group . This will, however, depend upon the variousreactions of the group members and their intensified effort to learn and tounderstand. It is not my intention for the next year or so to do more thanprepare you all for that united effort.For you at this time I have but this one message: Aim at real achievement inaccomplishment. I have definitely worded my thought that way so as to arrestyour attention. There must be for you that definite objective upon the physicalplane which will materialise in an equally definite achievement, so that yoursoul can say: “I have accomplished that which I intended.” These achievements(of a minor character and of a major character) must be tangible, and should bethe emergence into being of that which can be realised as the externalisationsof your inner sensitive perceptions.Intuitives (such as you are) have ever the problem of this materialising. It isa creative function. This is your obligation to your soul, and herein oft liesyour failure. May I use this word “failure,” brother of mine?The integrated personality which possesses no spiritual objective, no mysticalsense and no real powers of intuition and inner perception, can never “makegood,” as you say in the West. But the mystic, the disciple and the intuitiveaspirant is as a house divided against itself. The energy of the man [286] isflowing in two directions. What is needed is the realisation that—given rightmotive and true spiritual consecration—achievement on the physical plane in thechosen field of expression is spiritual achievement and, therefore, possible.How can this be done? By three things, my brother, which I give to you for yourconsideration in the order of their importance.1. The attainment of the vision; the power to intuit; the capacity to controlthat which must be brought through and materialised on the physical plane.2. The following through of this idea or ideal:a. From the sensed intuition to its formulation into mental concepts,thoughtforms, words and phrases;b. To its clothing with desire, with emotion and with beauty of feeling;c. To those wise and intelligent steps which will bring about the emergence ofyour idea or ideal into the light of the physical plane.3. The organising of your time so that you get out of each day its full quota ofinspiration, mental work and physical plane activity. Thus you will impose uponyourself that discipline which will not negate or inhibit your efforts, butwhich will produce the maximum of results with the minimum of effort. Ponder onthis.I change not your meditation just now, brother of mine. Carry it forward foranother six months. There has not been adequate time for results. I particularlycommend to your care I.B.S. Care for her. Aid her with your wisdom and yourlove, and help her break through into greater usefulness. In closing I say toyou: Stand steadily and know (not believe or hope) that all things are workingtowards your release into greater expression of beauty and service.~MY BROTHER: February 1936There has been for you a great stimulation of the entire psychic nature duringthe past six months, due to the close [287] attention you have rightly given toyour personality unfoldment; due also to the strenuousness of the experiences towhich that personality has been subjected, and due too to the effect ofincreased integration and to the psychic atmosphere in which you live. Yourresidence is in a great psychic centre. This all indicates a step forward,provided you continue to hold with care the attitude of the Observer and do notidentify yourself with the phenomena which you experience and may experience inthe future. These experiences hold, as well you know, the seeds of danger—thedanger of the detail and of the phenomenal happenings seeming of greaterimportance than of the whole and the formless. For you, however, this was aneeded step in the integrating process; the sense of the abstract and theformless was unduly developed in you. You were the true mystic and the spiritualvisionary, the idealist and the one whose imagination, love of beauty and thesense of inner reality shut you away from the world of practical life,wherein—for those who have eyes to see and ears to hear—the mystic truth everlurks in its fullness, the vision of colour and harmony is ever to be found, andthe ideal can be seen undergoing the process of materialisation. The blending,merging and fusing of the subjective beauty and the outer beautiful reality isyour daily task. Those who, like you, are intuitive, must train themselves to beinterpreters. The task of the interpreter of reality and of beauty shouldincreasingly drive you into organised and planned activity.In this last sentence, I have summed up for you the major task which shouldoccupy you for the remainder of your life—an interpreter of beauty and reality.How this is to be done is for you to decide. I but indicate your goal. As onegets older, the method of active expression has perforce somewhat to alter, andthe ways of demonstrating the inner recognitions, and the task, shouldinevitably change, though growing all the time in potency. This implies no lackof potent achievement, but only the using of a different medium in which towork. Of this I feel the need of reminding you. The goal is intensification ofthe potent life at the centre; that life must inevitably find its outlets.You have much to give your group—love, beauty, intuition [288] and harmony.These exist as powers of your soul; they are being (and can be) used more andmore. To these also I will add a definite creative ability. As before I toldyou, the development of a time consciousness which will not limit, but whichwill serve to conserve and organise the fifth gift of days, hours and minutes(those priceless gifts!) is your immediate need. There is a divine aspect totime.I would like to see your meditation carried forward more dynamically and with amore instantaneous alignment and its consequent results. Seek during the ensuingmonths to make your meditation periods short and powerful, remembering that atpresent their objective is the inner organising of the bodies and not so muchthe realisation of the unseen. That realisation is for you somewhat easy. Itsbringing through into the brain consciousness and its wise use in service iswhat calls for your attention. I can now alter your meditation form, as you havehad the one you are now employing for a year. Some of it I will preserve, but Iwill radically change part of it....This may be regarded as a mode of intercessory activity, for intercession is ascientific means of relating the idea, the ideal and its outer expression. Giveas much time to this as you like, providing your mental attitude remains dynamicand intense.~MY BROTHER: November 1936I have not much to say to you at this time. You are afraid (as a personality) ofbeing unduly influenced and of being subjected to an authority stronger thanyour own and coming to you from a source that is not that of your own soul. Iforesaw your present state of mind when last I wrote to you, and it was therealisation of what that would be that coloured all my instruction. It was thisknowledge that prompted me to say, “You have much to give .” That which I haveto say to you today is as follows:You are free, my brother. No one is seeking to hold you in this group. No one isseeking in any way to gain authority over you. No one wants you to work or studyor to serve, where [289] your own soul does not prompt you to work and toexpress yourself. But remember that there is no freedom except in making freechoice and in serving. The idea of freedom can itself constitute a prison. Thereare no free souls anywhere, except those who of free choice imprison themselvesand find themselves within and by the law of service. You can leave thisparticular group, but if you are to grow at all, you will find yourselfinevitably within some other group for service. You can drop theresponsibilities which you shouldered when you joined this group, but you cannotescape the shouldering of other responsibilities. You can pass out of this groupof brothers, as far as the outer plane linking is concerned, but you havealready established links with them which cannot be broken by any personalityactivity or line of action, for they are soul links and must at some time berecognised. It is the service, the responsibility, and the group work whichcounts and lasts; the fluctuations and reactions of any personality can delay,but they cannot negate success.Basically, fundamentally and essentially, you are pledged to the service of thePlan somewhere, somehow, some day. The fluctuations and indecisions andquestionings of your personality do not really matter in the long run and in thelight of soul activity, but they do matter in time and space and temporarily,where your band of group brothers are concerned.So feel free, my brother, but be quite sure that it is not a freedom demandedbecause group affiliation irks you. The more your soul grips your personality,the less you will be concerned with the problems of isolation and of freedom.Feel free, but be sure that it is not a freedom demanded because the steadydiscipline of occult training frets a temperament still essentially mystic. Themore your soul grips you, the more your mind will awaken, and feeling (in thepersonal sense) fade out. Feel free, but be sure that it is not a freedomdemanded because the sense of failure to organise your time and reduce yourpersonality to rhythmic living hurts your pride. The more your soul grips you,the more assuredly you will learn to use time as a responsibility.I did say earlier that in all group effort some would have to slow down theirprogress and others speed it up in order to [290] balance the group life. Yousay that you have never ceased to question this, and you bring the analogy oflight to bear upon the problem. Your analogy is not really in order. I was notspeaking in terms of individual light but in terms of group service and grouprelationship. There are many in the Hierarchy at this time who have refusedfurther opportunity of progress in order to stay with and help the sons of men.The point of development of everybody in the group is not uniform, and this is afact that you should recognise and which, when recognised, negates theapplication of your illustration. Your illustration is entirely true, but has nobearing on the subject.I suggest that you take until next May before coming to your final decision. Ihave asked a member of another group in my Ashram to do your work in themeantime. I am therefore assigning you no work, and you are regarded astemporarily suspended from the group. I ask naught of you but that youreconsider your decision from the angle of group good and group progress, andfrom that of your group brothers, and not solely from the angle of what seemsbest to you yourself and your own comfort, and your own so-called freedom. Infernot from this that I regard your decision as a selfish one. I know what it hascost you. It is, nevertheless, based on feeling, and feeling is seldom a trueindication of right action. I seek only to give you the time to think. I wouldremind you as you seek decision that your soul is on the seventh ray and thatyou are working through a first ray personality. Hence, my brother, yourproblem. A mystic of wide consciousness with a powerful personality ray and witha soul vibration in line with the New Age, seeking to impose upon thepersonality the rhythm of a “ceremonial order and organisation.” I would ask youto bear in mind that group work involves sacrifice and oft the doing of thatwhich might not be preferred and which might not—from the personality angle—bethe easier way out and the easier activity. The choice, however, rests with youand the thoughts of the group must be kept away from your decision, so that youcan make it freely and unhampered. The group must then abide by your decision.~February 1937[291] Only my love and understanding go out to you at this time, my brother, butnot my words or my instruction. Seek the way of selfless service and all iswell.“As birds fly together to summer realms, so souls unite in flight. Passingthrough the gate they thus alight before the throne of God.”Thus wrote an unknown saint of the Church, who travelled not alone.NOTE: This disciple decided for a while to travel alone upon the Way as far asaffiliation with the Tibetan’s group of disciples was concerned. On the innerside, the group remains intact with all its members affiliated, actively orinactively.~TO W. D. B.August 1934MY FRIEND AND FELLOW-WORKER:You have had an interlude of disciplining and of adjustment, and this has notbeen a time of ease. Those of us who look among the ranks of men for those whocan be used, have watched the progress of disciplining. These are days whereindisciples of all degrees—great or small, mental or intuitional—have to be triedand, if in any way available, they must be used. Your measure of detachment tothose you love and to the results of work was tried out; your intuition wasstrengthened, and now the work of the next few years must call for yourattention.Two things I seek to point out to you. The first one is that your work now fallsinto two main departments—one connected with your own inner development, and theother connected with what service you can render in the world. Yet these two areone. The training of the New Age, and the coming technique to use in fittingdisciples for their work is through service to achievemen t, with the emphasisupon the service and not upon the achievement. Your work in the world and yourwork [292] in my group of disciples is your mode of future inner development. Toyour group of students you bring what mental power you have, and develop itthereby; to the group you bring your intuitional capacity, and by constant useit also grows. You are thereby led forward, and the group contribution to othergroups is deepened.Your second line of development is service in the world. What line that servicemust take is for you to know and decide, and the germ of your decision isalready in your mind. I give no definite instructions at any time to govern adisciple’s service. Not in this way do servers grow.Three among your fellow-disciples are sannyasins, and you are one of the three.The lesson of your interlude of deepened quiet training was detachment and theunfoldment of right action through the analysis of motive. Through these testsin your deeper Being, and through your response, you placed your feet upon thepath of discipleship. This I think you know. I tell you not what you should knowfor yourself, but it is always permissible to enhance right thought conditions.There is one of your co-workers (L.U.T.) with whom I specially ask you to makecontact. Hold him in your thoughts and correspond with him. He is a warrior,scarred in the struggle, yet who persists, and for him you can do much.As for yourself, my brother of old, I enjoin on you two things, which are thesecond point to which I earlier referred in this instruction. I would remind youto ever bear in mind that I but make suggestion, and that suggestion is to befollowed only if it meets with your own inner approval and coalesces with yourown soul’s injunction. Your meditation for a while has been that upon the Light.I seek to give you another meditation, which is simpler, but for you morepotent, and which will give you, if followed for the next six months, the neededimpetus....In the coming years, my brother, work with ease and eliminate the consciousnessof strain and the sense of pressure. You belong to the work to be done and notto yourself. This is true of all disciples of all degrees, probationary,accepted and initiated. You are needed in the pressure of the coming work, andyou must keep the instrument in good condition. When I [293] say you are needed,I mean that old relationship and old joint experience enable you to work in thisgroup with facility and understanding, and that means power in the task to beaccomplished.Study the three words which are your life keynote, and with humility go forward,and thus aid in the breaking of the world illusion.Your rays, brother of mine, are:Soul ray—the second Ray of Love-WisdomPersonality ray—the fourth Ray of Harmony through ConflictIn a previous life your personality ray was the first Ray of Power, and hencethe evidence of power which seizes you at times.~BROTHER OF OLD: January 1935It is not my intention today to change your meditation work or to alter myinstructions to you. You have worked at them for a relatively brief time and Ishall not, therefore, change them until after the Full Moon in May, and in thenext half-yearly work. You will gain a fuller idea of the group work and of yourgroup brothers if you will take the time to study with care the instructionsgiven individually to them.I am not interested in much writing, or in the use of words and phrases whichwill intrigue the aspirant, or give to him a sense of my keen personal interest.I would not help that way. But I do seek to word these instructions—general andpersonal—so that they may embody a thought and offer food for matureconsideration. The time both of teacher and of taught is today so valuable thatthere is no need for me to explain a necessary brevity.I will call to your notice for closer attention the instructions I earlier gaveyou. Quiet concentration upon the life of the sannyasin and the achieving,therefore, of that inner detachment which is his outstanding characteristic,should be your main thought and control your hidden life during the next [294]six months. With the growth of that detachment, a deeper love and a deepenedesoteric expression of that love should normally be developed.The bringing about of a better alignment would also release more fully the loveof your soul into your personality life and render you more radiant andattractive in the spiritual sense. This would increase your usefulness inservice and supply a need. It is more a need in expression than a need in fact.This release of love will come through alignment, decentralisation from thethings of the personality and a more loving attentiveness to the service ofothers. Continue, therefore, with the meditation work already given, butdedicate two or three minutes before starting to definite work in order toproduce alignment. See to it that, as far as you may, you “stand in spiritualbeing,” that you are one with the soul and that there is a clear channel fromsoul to brain, via the mind. Then forget the differentiations which are mentalin their origin and useful in their right place, and do your work as a soul.Work at establishing a close rapport with your group brothers. You are new inthe work but are integrating into the group life rapidly and have much to give.~MY BROTHER: August 1935We will today somewhat change your meditation work, as the visualisationexercise has done much of its work in stimulating the ajna centre and infocussing your mind more firmly in the head. I have watched the result withattention. The past six months have brought to you three things:First, much strain, both in connection with your own immediate circle, with thework in your environment, and also in connection with your own inner reactions.I think you will know to which of these latter I specifically refer.Second, there has been for you an increased field of contact and of service,carrying with it the consequent tests and new opportunities to aid and help.This expansion should continue and should evidence a growing sensitivity on yourpart to world need.[295] Third, you are conscious (are you not, my brother?) of a fresh source ofillumination and inspiration and that the past year has greatly strengthenedyour realisation.Speaking symbolically, the Path of Discipleship is now real to you; the hithertodim and distant portals of the Golden Gate which lie ahead are not so dim anddistant. Their outline is more clear and the “sound which issues forth” conveysnow somewhat to your inner sense of hearing.You are, as I believe I earlier told you, a pledged sannyasin. That carries withit joy, but responsibility; discipline but realised gain. The work to be done bya sannyasin lies ever in the realm of increasing realisation. He has to becomeaware and conscious of each step that he takes and its result, of each motivethat impels and its effect, and of each objective gained and its consequence.The fruits of discipline have to be clearly understood by him without anyattachment to the results of the work. This alert awareness must be fostered byyou, my brother. A condition of increased sensitivity in yourself to yourselfand to others must be increasingly developed. A conscious approach to the goalmust be induced in you so that you are ever aware of contact in two directions:you are aware of the inner subjective life and also aware of the outer objectiveworld; this must be undertaken and developed by you as a synthetic, dualactivity. Ponder on this.Before indicating your meditation work for the next few months, I would suggest(forget not that it is only suggestions that I ever make) that you give the nextsix months to close consideration of your effect as a worker upon those you seekto help. This is a very valuable exercise for all disciples and involves aself-discipline but little emphasised in the usual books on discipleship. Theimpact of ray force upon people embodying differing aspects of ray energy willbe one of the coming developments in the field of esoteric psychology; you wouldfind it of interest to watch the impact of your second and fourth ray energyupon people, and also of that first ray power which you brought over from aprevious incarnation. In this way you will learn the easy way to serve, for itwill be that which will evoke the least resistance from those you serve, [296]and you will not have to undo or rebuild; you will also take the first steps inbecoming proficient in the science of force.Now let me give you a simple breathing exercise which has for its main objectivethe increase of the potency of the heart centre. Remember that the evocation ofthe rhythm of the heart centre is demonstrated in the early stages by anincreasing understanding of individuals and a growing awareness of groupproblems. Later it produces definite group consciousness and awareness of thePlan . Should you like to keep up the visualisation exercise which you have beendoing, you are quite at liberty to do so but do it at another period during theday....You will note that most of the work I have given you here links the threeaspects of your thought life—the creative imagination, the mind and theintuition—and it is the bringing about of this synthetic linking which is mypresent objective with you. Bear this in mind and learn first of all todiscriminate between these three; then to use them sequentially with facilityand finally to use them simultaneously. This is not an easy task which I haveset you, my brother.May I ask you to write three short papers on these three thoughts which I gaveyou for the unfoldment of the intuition, so that others may benefit thereby?~MY FRIEND AND BROTHER: February 1936The discipline which always accompanies the accepted disciple for work in thefield of the world has been yours most definitely since I last communicated withyou. Because you are a disciple, that discipline has taken hold of all aspectsof the lower self (the human self) at one and the same time. Those who are notdisciples may be exercised in one or another of the lower bodies. A disciple,however, is exercised in all three simultaneously, that is, in the personalityas a whole. For you, therefore, there has been renewed physical disability,emotional stress (of two kinds, is it not so, my brother?) and mental difficultyand strain. This latter has been the worst and is partly responsible (though notentirely so) for the other two.The lessons to be learnt by all disciples (before they can [297] work with powerin the world) might be expressed as the need to gain discrimination between1. Primary principles and secondary principles, or between two rights:a. A greater and a lesser right.b. That which is right for you but which may not be right for others.2. Between one’s personal dharma, obligation and individual duties and one’sgroup responsibilities and relationships.3. Between the needs which group work evidences and demands and those of theindividual.4. Between essentials and non-essentials.So the task is hard, my brother, and the problems have—as you well know—to besolved alone. There are phases of inner experience upon which no one mayintrude, not even the interested and sympathetic teacher, or the Master Himself.Should they so intrude, the richness of the possible experience remainsunattained. For you, the keynote to your essential emergence, radiant and free,is silence and patience and not too great a use of the analytical mind. Lovereveals far more clearly and definitely (in your case) than analysis. Within thelimits of your own horizon, you see clearly. Within the limits of your range ofcontacts, you must love deeply, and upon loving deeply must your emphasis beset.For you, as for all your group brothers, must come concentration upon the workof preparation for the Wesak Festival. Pure channels and released minds are themajor requirement at this time, and I call you all to a preparatory purificationand mental discipline. It is the growing inner momentum of aspiration anddevotion and the increasing “lucidity” of the mind which must constitute thegoal for all of you during the next few months, for it is the demand of thedisciples of the world which will bring in that which the world needs, and theintensification of light in which the real light can be seen. There is occultpower in the words: “And in that light shall we see light.” The light of thedisciples of the world is sorely needed at this time by the Hierarchy. Yes,needed , my brother.[298] During the next few weeks, I would suggest that you concentrate upon“holding the mind steady in the light.” This will involve renewed work inalignment, and in the conscious refocussing of the mind towards reality. It isthe activity of the inner, conscious man which ceaselessly turns its attentionto the soul, seeking identification with that soul. The alignment usuallycarried forward is that of the personality with the soul. This you have largelyachieved and the result is that of the calling in of the power which flows fromthe outer petals of the egoic lotus (speaking symbolically), the knowledgepetals, to the brain. It is the energy of the second tier of petals which mustnow be evoked—those of love-wisdom. It is the inflow of this energy to thepersonality which I seek to evoke, and which must be the objective of yourattention during the coming months. You have knowledge, my brother, and yourspiritual experience is rich. Let this demonstrate now as wisdom, expressinglove.To this end I will outline to you the following suggested meditation, upon whichyou can work, unless I see fit to change it later....Will you also, my brother, write down what may come to you concerning“radiation” and concerning “magnetic service”? These two papers will constituteyour individual offering to your group brothers. Should you not have thestrength and time for both this and the group work outlined by me earlier, thenchoose the elucidation of these two words—Radiation and Magnetism —in preferenceto the group work.~MY BROTHER: August 1936It is difficult for me to know just what to say to you at this difficult halfyear period. The past few months have been times of difficulty to you, but theyhave nevertheless been times of real growth, even if you yourself sense it not.Yet, regarding yourself as a member of your group you have offered but little tothe united group life of your brothers. This may perhaps be somewhat due to amisconception as to the true significance of my purpose. It is so difficult fora person who has [299] sixth ray qualities predominantly present (either as theresult of this life’s direction, or as carried over as predisposing influencesfrom another life, as is your case), to realise the one-pointed intention (usingthis word in the sense in which the Catholic uses it) of a group. One’s ownpoint of view, one’s own dharma, one’s own problems and one’s own unfoldment arefollowed so one-pointedly and—complicating the difficulty—with such truly rightand high motives. When to this is added an intensely critical mind, the problemis doubly hard. But, brother of old, your intense inner loyalty to truth, yourtruly developed selflessness, your strong link with the Hierarchy as a pledgeddisciple, and your clearsightedness are contributions to the group life of suchvalue, that I ask you today to attempt to reintegrate yourself into the group ina true and selfless manner.This particular group of my disciples has the problem of arriving at anunderstanding of glamour—a glamour in which all human beings move who are as yetbelow the grade of an initiate of the third degree. The tests, therefore, towhich the group members have been subjected, have been many and great, andseveral times the life of the group as a unit has been nearly wrecked. I.B.S.could tell you much, were she to speak with you face to face, of the time whenit seemed well nigh impossible to save the group life. L.T.S-K. realises todayhow glamour has him in its clutches, yet sees not the point of entrance. D.A.O.,too, as you will see from her correspondence, is bewildered—though she realisesit not, and would deny the implication—by the glamour of independence. And yetthe group goes on and will go on, as long as the spirit of love continues toprevail among the members and there is freedom from truly selfish purposes.Part of the great temptation of our Master, the Christ, in the wilderness wasbased upon the three aspects of the world glamour—illusion, glamour and maya.These all threatened to bewilder Him and He met each of them in turn with theenunciation of a clear-cut principle, and not with the wordy arguments of ananalytical brain. From that field of victory, He went forth to love, to teachand to heal. In these days of world pain, let love and joy equally be thekeynotes of your life [300] —as a group and as individuals—for they carry thehealing vibration of the Hierarchy.I change not your work. I have little, my brother, to say to you today. You havenot done the work earlier assigned. Why, therefore, should I assign more ordifferent work? That earlier given is still needed. Think less and love more.This is the keynote for you during the coming six months. Then light will bereleased and will shine upon your way. Consider the welfare of the group bybecoming an integrated part within it. You will naturally demand: “How can I dothis? Questions and problems of various kinds fill my mind, and how—troubled asI am—can I be of service to the group?” With most aspirants, the need is totrain them to think and reflect, to ponder and to analyse, but you do these witha rare facility. Frequently you analyse yourself into a cul-de-sac. Is it notso, my brother? There is no way out of that cul-de-sac for you except by rising; you cannot go back, for retrogression is not the way of the disciple. But youcan rise on the wings of love and the motive of service into the freedom and thelight where the Great Ones walk and live and work.In the assigned meditation given in the last series of instructions, I give youthe following to incorporate:1st month—Orientation.2nd month—Lucidity. Clarity.3rd month—The Peace which passeth understanding.4th month—Integration.5th month—Group Life.6th month—The radiant Way.We shall otherwise leave your work to be completed, if you so will.~MY BROTHER: February 1937You have been so personal, my brother. You have insulated yourself behind a wallof silence, and cannot be reached. The karmic opportunity was offered you, butyou recognised it not. My definition of the type of glamour from which yousuffer with facility drove you behind this wall in hurt pride and resentment[301] that your brothers should know your weaknesses. My brother, this shouldnot be. It is all a part of the environing illusion. What matters it if eachknows the weaknesses of his brother on the Path, and if all are aware of anindividual’s frailty? Are you yet so imperfect and are you yet so unloving thatknowledge need evoke criticism and resentment, instead of love andunderstanding? This you could not face and hence your retreat. Thus, you workout your problems in solitude away from your esoteric group which you will againfind at a later date, though probably—not inevitably—in another life. Who canset a pace to a soul’s destiny?NOTE: The above statement by the Tibetan will explain why—for the rest of thisincarnation—this disciple is not working in His Ashram.~TO D. L. R.July 1934MY BROTHER AND FRIEND:I am asking you to work in this group of students and aspirants for two reasons:First of all, because, through this technique of instructions, you can receivesome aid in the treading of the Path if you choose to avail yourself of what Imay have to offer, and secondly, because your particular type of mind and yourtrained experience will give to this group that balancing factor and thatpatient stability which it needs.The group has passed through a crisis as a group. Certain of its members havelikewise had peculiar testing and difficulties. These they have surmounted andfrom them they are learning the needed lesson. The subjective potency of whatyou have to give will help—if I may so express it—to bring the whole group up topar, and enable me more rapidly to integrate it, and fit it for an instrumentfor service. I begin this communication by stating this clearly, as the serviceyou can render is to you of more value than the service that can be rendered toyou. But the group and the training to which it subjects itself can give youmuch if you will try out the work for a year or so.[302] No attempt is made authoritatively to impose restrictions on the studentsand their work, and all can cease from the endeavour at any time. A third reasonfor my putting you into this group is to put you in touch subjectively, as wellas on the physical plane, with D.H.B. as he and you make good travellingcompanions. This is but a suggestion and a hope to be tested out by both of you,if you so will.You have passed through one of those periods of quiet and of controlled innergrowth which from time to time is part of the training of the disciple upon thePath. Now the fruit of that subjective experience, known only to you and tothose who guide and watch the footsteps of all aspirants, must work out inexoteric service, rendered progressively on each of the three planes until itemerges into fruitful action on the physical plane. Bear this in mind as youattempt to work with this group of my disciples; make your mental rapport first,then your astral contact and leave the physical plane expression to take care ofitself, for the lines it will take will depend upon the inner continuity ofcontact, and upon your sensitive subjective realisation. This will take time, mybrother. But there is no hurry in the realm of the soul.The meditation work to be done by you should be for a while dynamicallyextroverted . I use these two words because they express the process to befollowed by you for the next few months. Should you care to do so, I wouldsuggest the following breathing exercise, to be followed by the meditationprocess below. All the work done should be controlled by the consciousness,centred and held steady in the head....We will, at this time, refrain from using the highest head centre in thebreathing exercise, beyond recognising it as the point from which you areworking. The objective of this exercise is to integrate the three centres abovethe diaphragm, and so make the personality more magnetic, and more definitelyresponsive to the radiation of the soul.For your meditation work I suggest the following procedure:1. First of all, do the breathing exercise, outlined above.2. Then, focussing the consciousness as high in the head as possible, sound theSacred Word. [303]3. Then do the following brief and intensive visualisation exercise:a. Imagine a path of golden light, leading from where you stand to a vasttwo-leaved door.b. Then see, rolling along this path a disk or wheel of rose , which you sendforth and which eventually disappears through the door.c. Then send along the same track a disk of vivid green , and follow it by adisk of golden yellow , both of which disappear the same way.d. Then send a disk or wheel of a radiant, electric blue , which rolls along thegolden Path but which does not enter through the door but remains there, hidingthe door from sight.e. Picture then yourself as standing before the electric blue disk, havingtraversed the golden path and there meditating upon the following words:“I am the Way myself, the door am I. I am the golden Path and in the light of myown light I tread the Way: I enter through the door. I turn and radiate.”4. You can then carry forward your own meditation, though refraining from anyuse of mantrams and from visualisation exercises other than those indicatedabove by me.5. Sound the Sacred Word again, breathing it out upon the world from the highestpoint in your consciousness that seems to you possible.Attempt this meditation once a day for the next few months as it will form thebasis of the meditation which I can later give you.~BROTHER OF ANCIENT DAYS: January 1935I can indicate to you the line of activity by which you can best aid in thisgroup activity, and this is the development of telepathic rapport. It was forthat latent capacity in you that you were originally asked to be a member of theinitial group of disciples. Though your karma and circumstances at [304] thattime temporarily militated against that happening (and your action then wasentirely right) that in no way negates your latent capacity. I am pointing thisout as I would like you—if you will—to work towards establishing a telepathicrapport with the group, beginning with D.H.B. and D.A.O. Seek to contact them inthis way and get into touch with them on the matter. By so doing you will helpin establishing a group interplay and integrity which is one of the mainobjectives before all groups of disciples. When all are formed, then a memberwill be chosen from each of the groups to form another group whose work will beto preserve a group interplay between the groups. If you can give five minuteseach day to an effort to get into touch with these two, you will find success atthe end of the way. You will probably find (as you are a first ray soul) thatyou can make an impression upon their minds more easily than they can impressyours, but your fifth ray personality will offset some of this, as you functionmore easily on the mental plane than on the astral on account of your raypolarisation.Continue with the breathing exercise as outlined in my last instruction. I seekto make no change in this. You have only done it for a few months and the rhythmof the work must be definitely established so that it becomes automatic, therebypermitting freedom of thought within the limits of the work. I will, however,change your meditation outline in the following particulars:1. The breathing exercise.2. The sounding of the A.U.M.3. See before your mind’s eye the same two-leaved door, standing wide open.Through it you see a radiant sun of golden light.4. Instead of sending forth the disks of coloured light, visualise yourself asstanding before this open door.5. Then say: “May the energy of the divine self inspire me,” and feel yourentire nature vitalised by the spiritual energy, pouring through the open doorupon you and through you.6. Next say: “May the light of the soul direct,” and visualise that lightpouring upon your daily path. Bring into that [305] light your group problemswhich you may have to solve and face, and face them and handle them in thelight.7. Finish the rest of the invocation, saying the words with all the power ofyour soul behind them. Add the mantram I earlier gave you:“I am the Way myself, the door am I. I am the golden Path and in the light of myown light I tread that Way. I enter through the door. I turn and radiate thelight.”8. Sound the A.U.M. as before.Let not the things of the personality upset in any way your equilibrium, mybrother. Preserve as heretofore that inner silence that guards the secrets ofthe soul, and the way your soul has indicated—the way that you should go.Detachment from the thoughts of others and steadfast radiation hold for you thesecret of your ultimate liberation.BROTHER OF MINE: August 1935I seek to give you some personal work to do in connection with me that will notbe easy. You have ever been interested in that inner subjective work which mightbe called telepathic clairvoyance. This work you would have done had it beenpossible for you to work with my first planned group. Would you care to workwith me, my brother, along this line for a while? I have placed in your “way ofvision” in meditation (a phrase which perhaps means little to you but whichnevertheless embodies an existent fact) two symbols which I seek to have youcontact as a training in inner sensitivity. See if you can contact them and theword for which they stand. This work will form part of your meditation.1. Achieve a sense of inner poise and quiet, yet at the same time, hold apositive attentiveness to the establishing of a contact with me. Seek to sensemy aura and to tune in on my group, of which you are a part.2. Then register what seems to appear to you, and any word connected with theregistered symbolic form which may emerge in your consciousness. Try to contactthe first symbol in the first three months, and the second in [306] the lastthree. Record each day what you feel you contact and summarise your results. Benot unduly anxious.3. Sound the Word, the O.M. three times; once for your group brothers, then foryour immediate circle of family and friends, and finally for the group ofstudents which you are training for me. Realise that as you do this two thingshappen: First, that you are vitalising them, and secondly, that you areestablishing links whereby you can reach them and the group life can flow.4. Say the mantram of the Disciples’ Degree: “May the energy of the divine selfinspire me and the light of the soul direct. May I be led from darkness tolight, from the unreal to the real, from death to immortality.”5. Proceed with your meditation as you yourself shall choose but do not givemore than ten minutes to this period.6. Then do the breathing exercise as hitherto, but place it this time at the endof your meditation for this will set in motion the energies which you may havesucceeded in contacting.It will be obvious to you that I am seeking to establish a closer link betweenyourself and the group on the inner planes of which I am the focal point. This Iam definitely endeavouring to do. With this in mind, carry forward yourspiritual life during the next six months and integrate yourself more closelyand consciously into this group of mine on the inner planes. Of this group, yourco-disciples are a part. Have ever in your consciousness the fact of the group,the purpose of group service at this time, and the intention that shouldunderlie the life pattern of every disciple—that the Plan must be served.I have but little more to say to you now, except that I desire deeply that youmay emerge into greater freedom of life and expression and liberate yourselffrom any chains which may hold you back from the life of full and lovingservice—I speak of inner habits of thought and not of any externalresponsibilities and contacts. [307]~MY BROTHER OF OLDEN TIMES: February 1936I seek today to emphasise to you the need to recognise and re-interpret yourinner life pattern, or, in other words, the inner programme which your soulundertook to follow when you first set your foot upon the Path of AcceptedDiscipleship. This you did two or three lives ago and you have followed thispath slowly and with caution. There is now, however, need for a more dynamicfollowing of your soul purpose and a definite negating of all the impedimentswhich seek at this time to obstruct your progress. I would call your attentionto the fact that I do not here refer to outer relationships and contacts. Theyexist and have their purpose and, as you well know, all right responsibilitiesmust always be met by disciples. I refer to that inner, active, spiritual lifewhich you should increasingly cultivate, and to that dual activity which everydisciple has to follow simultaneously. This dual life embraces the world ofinner relationships and of recognised subjective attitudes, but it also embracesthe life of outer service and of those relationships which you have assumed asyour physical plane dharma. Clear vision as to these outer relations in theworld of professional activity, of friendships and of family relations is anecessary requirement in treading the Path, and until a disciple sees theserelations in their true and right proportions, his mind is frequently disturbedand his service handicapped. I give you here a hint. Every link that one makeson earth does not necessarily entail the recognition of a soul link. We make newand fresh links and start new lines of karma and of dharma. One of the firstthings that a disciple has to learn is right judgment as to the relative soulage of his associates. He soon discovers that these vary. He learns then torecognise those whose wisdom and knowledge surpass his own, to cooperate withthose who stand with him upon the Path and to work for those whom he can help,but whose evolutionary status is not on an equality with his own. The orderedpattern of his life can then take on definite forms and he can begin to workwith intelligence.These points you need to study, remembering that truth and clear vision are ofgreater value than blind loyalty and curtailed understanding. When grasped, theylead to increased happiness [308] and to power in all relationships. A rightsense of proportion does not necessarily involve criticism.I seek to change your work and meditation considerably this next half year. Myobjective in so doing is twofold: I seek to see you bring about a more rapidalignment and a more dynamic intensification of your life of aspiration. Yourmental polarisation is good and your work in the world greatly aids you in thisrespect. Its integration with the life of feeling could be stronger and moredynamic, and for this we will work for a little while. I seek, secondly, to aidyou to be more sensitive to the forces which should pour in on the world duringthe month of May if the world disciples measure up to their opportunity.Continue with the breathing exercises as heretofore. Then meditate as follows:1. Focus the consciousness as high in the head as possible.2. Sound the O.M. three times inaudibly and, with the power of the creativeimagination,a. See the physical body dedicating itself to the service of the soul.b. Retreat still further inward as you sound the O.M. and visualise theemotional nature pouring itself forth in aspiration towards the service ofhumanity.c. Retreat still higher and still more inwardly and dedicate the mind principleto the service of the Plan.3. Then, holding the consciousness on this high plane, seek to lift yourconsciousness higher still and, by a definite act of the will, see three thingsoccur: complete alignment, definite integration with the personality, and thedynamic focussing of your consciousness in the soul.4. Then sound the word audibly, but sound it this time as the soul, breathingforth light, understanding, and love into the waiting, attentive, integratedpersonality.Make this a dynamic, quick and conscious activity.5. Attempt then, as a soul, to link up with your co-disciples. Having done this,seek then to see the symbol which blazes forth from the brow of each of them.Each symbol is different. Endeavour to see these symbols by definitely [309]linking up with and pouring out love to your brothers. Note down each day thesymbol that seems to you to be related to them.6. Having done this, repeat rapidly the process of alignment given in points 1,2, 3, and then sink back into the stage of contemplation, holding it as long asyou can. Assume imaginatively (if you cannot in reality) the attitude of a soulas it lives the life of contemplation in its own world, and endeavour then tosee in connection with the following monthly themes what the soul sees andknows.1st month—The nature of contemplation.2nd month—The necessity for integration.3rd month—The technique of alignment.4th month—The inspiration of the personality.5th month—Association with the hierarchical endeavour.6th month—The service of the Plan.7. Insert here what intercessory work you seek to do.8. Sound the O.M.For your own personal work I would ask you to write one paragraph which willembody your highest thought concerning the six themes which I have given abovefor contemplation.My brother, I ask you to persevere without discouragement and with no unduepondering upon results achieved. You are not in a position rightly to gauge yourown progress. Continue to serve and to work and leave realisation with itsresults and effects to take place naturally without any forcing of the process.Your soul is active and just now its attention is turned in power towards itsinstrument; your vibratory rate, your power in service, can increase; and youropportunity at this time is real. The physical brain is not yet in a conditionwherein the inner activities can be accurately registered but that is noindication that that activity is not great and right. Comply with my suggestionsand keep in close touch, subjectively and objectively if possible, with yourgroup brothers.~[310] MY FRIEND OF OLD: August 1936The past six months have seen you making many re-adjustments in your life. Asyou have fulfilled your outer obligations in the various fields of lifeexpression, there has been a simultaneous freeing of yourself from the “pullinghands” of associated friends and people. The necessity for an inner freedom,preserved inviolate, is for you an urgent one, but you are learning fast thelesson that freedom is a state of mind and not a condition of being. The fear ofan isolated loneliness has oft beset you, yet you have realised at the same timethat that type of loneliness is oft the setting of the disciple. The increasedsensitivity of a disciple’s vehicles causes him gradually to become aware of thetrue world of subtler values.For what you are being prepared you have been told and know. You know also thata deeper attachment to humanity, paralleling a finer and more clear-cut andclearly realised detachment is for you, therefore, a major objective. I have inthis last sentence summed up for you your immediate problem, and I tell you alsofor your encouragement that you are making real progress towards your goal.One thing, my brother, I feel you need to realise more definitely; that is thata life of fuller expression in outer service on the physical plane is requiredand would further aid you towards your goal. Your problems are, however, knownto me and this extension of your outer influence (radiating from an innercontrolled centre) and the developing of a wider range of contacts must comeslowly. But it must surely come and will, if your intention and thought aredirected towards these ends. As you grow older, there is much that you have togive. The wisdom which you have necessarily wrought out in the furnace of painand of suffering must be available and used as the Way of Light and of Joy opensup before you. I hold out before you no illusions of a great work to beperformed for which you are divinely predestined. The eventual great work,successfully carried forward, which falls to the lot of all who achieve thegreat Initiations, grows out of a steadily expanding consciousness, a steadydecentralisation, demonstrating in a constant outgoing in compassion andunderstanding to the needs [311] of the little ones upon life’s way, and agreater realisation of the nature of the whole. Learn, therefore, to includemore people within the range of your daily thought. It is good exercise for thedisciple in training. Let your influence, welling forth from a steady andradiant centre, make itself felt in ever widening ranges of contact. Seize eachopportunity for a more expanded interplay with other lives, touching themwherever you possibly can, and achieve in that way that fluidity of responsewhich will carry you forth upon the tide of an ever richer service.You are at the point where you can—if you so will—achieve a higher and morepotent rhythm. Its potency and its vibration must be felt outside the homecircle and contacts or your relationships with your group brothers. In whatmanner that extension of service must demonstrate is for you gradually to findout. I but indicate to you possibility. One thing I can, however, tell you andthat is that it will come through a deepening of your meditation life, and notthrough an outer search for such contacts; it will come through the developmentof a true spiritual understanding which will make the “magnetic beat” (as it isesoterically called) of such potency in your life that you will not need to movefrom where you are because those whom you can aid will come to you increasingly.For you, the consecrated pen, the dedicated hour, the quickness to seize anopportunity for a carefully chosen word, and the sense of reticent securitywhich you can convey to others will be the chief methods which you will employ.Can you grasp the value to the troubled aspirant of finding in a brother thatpower to aid which is based on a trained reticence and a sure knowledge?I am inclined to leave your meditation as it is at present, changing only thetheme of your meditation. These themes I leave you to find for yourself,choosing them out of this personal word which I have given to you. Use those sixsentences which seem to you the most helpful, and regard them as the thoughtsaround which you will build your mental and emotional life during the next sixmonths.~MY BROTHER: February 1937You are learning the lesson of detachment with rapidity, and [312] you aregradually standing free from the clinging hands of others. Just as the GreatRenunciation of the fourth initiation is made possible by the many lesserrenunciations of many lives, consciously undertaken, so the many acts ofspiritual detachment lead eventually to the severing of that final thread whichinvolves the death of all personality attachments. Then only those relationshipsare left which are upon soul levels. Your task is to learn to differentiatebetween such spiritual detachments and those enforced detachments which areundertaken on higher levels of astral awareness. The problem of the disciple isto reach a point where he is not hindered or held back by any human being andyet so to handle himself as far as attitude is concerned that he hurts no one inthe process of withdrawal. The outer personality claims of attachment are oft sopowerful that their clatter and their rattle prevent awareness of the goldenthread which links us with another soul. Likewise, overestimation of anotherperson can act as a real hindrance. The chains must break, leaving only a goldenthread between each soul—a golden thread which cannot break.Two things I would impress upon you at this time, and upon them I would ask youto work until the next period comes around.First, deepen your power of expression and begin to train others through a moredefinite outer service. You have always been able to work subjectively withothers. This has been one of your major assets in group work. You are mentallymagnetic, and through a controlled astral body, you interfere not emotionallywith that magnetic influence. This is, for you, an established habit and willpersist; it is the result of many years of reflection and of thought control,plus (in this life) academic training. For the rest of your life seek to becomemagnetic through the written word, through identification with the one you seekto help, through the magnetic power of your mind, enhanced by your soul andcontained and embodied in the form of written help. I am seeking your help intraining aspirants to become conscious disciples. Give of that aid, and therebyachieve that magnetic usefulness which will greatly increase your power toserve.Secondly, the following occult message will give to you, if [313] you employ theintuition, the indication of the next spiritual achievement ahead of you—onethat can be quickly accomplished if there is right understanding, or which canbe learnt with pain and difficulty if such understanding lacks.“The key is found; and with the pressure of the hands in service of the light,and with a beating heart of love, the key is turned. The door swings open wide.“With hasty feet the one who hastens towards the light enters the door andwaits. He holds the door ajar for those who follow after. He thus, in action,waits.“A voice sounds forth: My brother, close the door, for each must turn the keywith his own hand, and each must enter through that door alone.“The blazing light within the Temple of the Lord is not for all at the samemoment or hour of the day. Each knows his hour. Your hour is now. So, brother,close the door. Remember, those behind know not the door has opened, or the doorhas closed. They see it not. Rest on that thought, my brother, and passingthrough the door, close it with care, and enter upon another stage upon theWay—alone and not alone.”I would change your meditation at this time, for the group meditation isintended to supersede the individual meditation in the majority of cases. Iwould however give you a brief exercise to perform which may help in theexternalising of your magnetic power.... Do this exercise every day with slowand measured thought, and with no sense of haste and no looking for results. Theresults are inevitable if the exercise is faithfully and rightly carriedforward.Enter into a closer relationship with me, my brother. There are things which Ican say to you in the moments of high meditation and at the time of the fullmoon approach.This is all that I have to say to you at the present.~BROTHER OF OLD: September 1937There are, in my group of disciples, certain people who are outstandingly calledto live the life of the sannyasin, the life of [314] the one who—havingfulfilled the duties of the scholar, of the householder, of the family man, andof the business man—is now called to that attitude of life and that orientationto other purposes and goals which we technically call that of the sannyasin, orthe teaching disciple. In the olden times, such a man left his home and hisbusiness and went out into the world, following the gleam, seeking the Master,and ever teaching as he went. Today, in the life of our Western civilisation andunder the dawning influence of the New Age, the call remains the same but thedisciple goes not out, leaving all the familiar scenes behind and negating hisouter usefulness. He remains where he is, continuing with the outer and physicalfulfilment of duty, but within a great change and a definite re-orientationtakes place. His attitude to life and affairs is basically altered. His wholeinner life tendency becomes that of a planned withdrawing . He is passingthrough that stage upon the Way to which Patanjali refers in The Yoga Sutrasunder the term “right abstraction.” It differs somewhat from the process called“detachment,” because that process or motivated activity is applied primarily tothe astral-emotional nature, to the desire life, whatever those attachments ordesires may happen to be. This is a mental activity; it is an attitude of mindwhich affects primarily the entire life-attitude of the personality. It involvesnot only the detachment of the desire nature from that which is familiar,desired and appropriated from long habit, but it involves also a completereadjustment of the entire lower threefold man to the world of souls.It is here that right habits and attitudes in life to the world of business, andof family relations play their part, enabling the sannyasin to “continue on theupward way with heart detached and free,” and yet to do so whilst performingright action, through right habit and right desire, to all with whom his lot iscast. To this difficult task your soul is now calling you. It constitutes yourmajor life problem: To stand free whilst surrounded; to work in the subjectiveworld whilst active in the exterior world of affairs; to achieve true detachmentwhilst rendering to all that which is due. An understanding of your ray typesmay greatly aid in this process of release, of relinquishment, and of finalrenunciation.[315] The ray of your mental body is the fifth, and because it is the same rayas that of your personality, you will have to guard with care against mentalcrystallisation, and the undue influence of the critical mind. This ray givesyou ability in the field of knowledge, but it must be balanced by the unfoldmentof the intuition; it gives you the power to master your chosen field ofknowledge, but that power must be balanced by the simultaneous mastering of theworld wherein love and wisdom control.Your astral body is on the sixth ray but, as in the case of I.B.S., its majorquality is devotion and devoted persistence, and not fanaticism. This energy isof immense value to you because it is, curiously enough, your only link with thegreat second ray of love in this particular incarnation. But it is a strong andpowerful link.Your physical body is controlled by the seventh ray, and this, as you will note,is also along the line of 1, 3, 5, 7. This is a point upon which you shouldponder and reflect, for the aggregate of your ray tendencies constitutes for youa problem, and your sixth ray energy contributes the only balancing factor. Andyet, my brother, you are in many respects well balanced. One hint I would heregive to you in this connection and to all of you who study these instructions.The ray of the personality in a previous life leaves definite habits of thoughtand of activity; it has built into the life rhythm certain unalterabletendencies for which much gratitude can sometimes be felt. This is so in yourown life. In a previous incarnation, your personality was on the second ray,thus leaving you with a deeply loving and understanding nature and a power toinclude, which is a major asset; it serves to offset the first ray tendencieswhich are so dominant in this particular life. It is hard for the disciple whosees not the picture whole, and who only knows the quality of the present lifeand its natural tendencies (due to ray influence) to think truly about himself.Your rays therefore are:1. The egoic ray—the first Ray of Will or Power.2. The personality ray—the fifth Ray of Concrete Knowledge. [316]3. The ray of the mental body—the fifth Ray of Concrete Knowledge.4. The ray of the astral body—the sixth Ray of Devotion.5. The ray of the physical body—the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Magic.~BROTHER OF OLD: February 1938This group is nearing the time when it should begin to work with regularity atthe problem of dissipating the world glamour. This it will do successfully justin so far as the individual members have freed themselves, or are freeingthemselves, from their personal glamours. In these instructions, I have pointedout that you were one of those in the group who are in a measure freer than themajority from the blinding effects of glamour. I would ask you to preserve thiscondition for the helping of the group and as a group service. When it becomespossible to do this world work (done naturally behind the scenes) then therewill have to be a stiffening in the attitude of the group members in relation tothis problem in their own lives, for it will be the existence of personalglamours in the group members which—when they approach the problem of dealingwith world glamour—will let it in unless there is this “positive stiffening”—ifI may use such a term.It is dangerous work, my brother, and I am mentioning it to you in this placebecause your fifth ray quality of mind can serve a useful group purpose. You arein a position to build a protecting wall (but not a separating barrier) aroundthe group as a whole; it is to this activity I call you at this time. You canbegin to prepare the way for the group activity. I am, therefore, giving you ameditation which has this service intent and I would ask you to do it for thenext six months. It will strengthen your fifth ray quality, which is that ofknowledge, and which, when present, can produce illumination. It is that qualitywhich permits the man who has it, to stand steady in the light , to rest in purebeing , and to become the true Observer. These qualities of steadiness with theintent to reflect light, of centralisation of the self, and of right observationare essential [317] to this group. They must be developed as group qualities, ifthe work planned is to be safely undertaken. The producing of these groupattitudes can be greatly assisted by you and through their intensification inyour own life you can foster their growth in others. In a letter written to youa year or so ago, you will find another reason why you have this special serviceto render along these lines. Will you re-read that letter?One of the things which I have endeavoured to do with this group of disciples isto give them a grasp of their personality problem by telling them the rays withwhich they predominantly work in order to help them subordinate the lower man tothe spiritual man. You would profit by making a study of the fifth ray and byassimilating, as far as you can, the information anent this ray found in mybooks. It would be a profitable thing if students would gather together all theinformation they can anent their two major rays, with the view to practical workwith themselves. This is for you a peculiarly valuable thing for both yourpersonality ray and your mind ray are on the fifth line of force. You have,consequently, a real problem in connection with yourself and at the same time areal asset in connection with the group. You can aid them in gaining the neededgroup poise for the work to be done.The Old Commentary , in speaking of the work of those whose dharma it is todissipate world glamour, uses the following expressions:“They come and stand. Within the midst of whirling forms—some of a beauty rareand some of horror and despair—they stand. They look not here or there but, withtheir faces turned towards the light, they stand. Thus through their minds thepure light streams to dissipate the fogs.“They come and rest. They cease their outer labours, pausing to do a differentwork. Within their hearts is rest. They run not here and there, but form a pointof peace and rest. That which upon the surface veils and hides the real beginsto disappear and from the heart at rest a beam of dissipating force projects,blends with the shining light and then the mists of man’s creation disappear.“They come and they observe. They own the eye of vision; likewise they own theeye of right direction of the [318] needed force. They see the glamour of theworld, and seeing, note behind it all the true, the beautiful, the real. Thusthrough the eye of Buddhi comes the power to drive away the veiling swirlingglamours of that glamorous world.“They stand, they rest, and they observe. Such are their lives and such theservice that they render to the world of men.”I would commend these lines to your careful thought. They convey to you, notonly the field of your service, but also the desired attitude of your personallife. Most people have many glamours in their lives and link with facility withthe world glamour. You have only one real point of glamour in your life and youdo not tune in with facility with glamour. Could you see with clarity the onepoint of weakness in your astral life, based on devotion and idealisticinterpretation, you would work with greater power and freedom.In reference to your meditation work, continue as before, but when you havefinished the work of building the symbols, and have sounded the O.M. threetimes, then take as your seed thoughts the following and meditate upon thethemes indicated below:1. The power to stand within the light, leading to right reflection of thelight.2. The power to rest in spiritual being, so as to focus the soul within thechosen field of service.3. The power to attain right observation, so as to see correctly that whichshould be done.Do this meditation with the consciousness focussed in your fifth ray mind butwith your attention turned towards the astral world whereon your group isplanning to work. This may at first produce an intensification of your own pointof glamour and to guard against this you will have to institute watchfulness.Much good will eventuate if you make one definite and lasting gesture or act offreedom from your glamour (if you know what it is and face it with precision)and opportunity to do so may come to you in a few weeks’ time. I wonder if youwill recognise it, my brother, and have the spiritual independence to seize it.[319] I ask your assistance in this preparatory work and would ask you also toget in touch with L.U.T. who is also doing some work for me along another line.In conclusion I would point out that1. Your soul energy normally finds expression through your fifth ray mind and itis wise for you to link this up with my earlier comments on this matter.2. Your personality force is focussed in your seventh ray brain.~MY BROTHER OF OLD: September 1938You have now come back to your own group and to the one to which you wereoriginally assigned, and for that I am glad though—with the rest of you—Ideplore the cause. The glamour in which R.V.B. is involved is thick and atpresent impenetrable, but the primary reason for his leaving all hisresponsibilities and deserting his group brothers and his post, has been theneed for certain personality adjustments and the righting of a serious mistakehe made two lives ago. When he has worked through his karma and has achievedrelease from a certain thraldom, he will again proceed upon his way. In themeantime, his co-disciples will stand with silent faithfulness behind him,leaving him entirely free and yet ready, when the true freedom comes, to againrecognise the outer as well as the inner relationship.You have little to do, in order to pick up the threads of the group work, foryou have for some time been interested in telepathic work and you are startingwork with the group at a time when it is entering upon a new venture. There isno old technique to master but only a new one to be learnt—together.You yourself have a ray combination very similar to that of R.S.U., but owing toyour sixth ray astral body, the personality situation is saved. There is, as youknow, a preponderance of the will-mind-activity in you but a powerful and welldeveloped astral body has enabled you to express the love nature which youbrought to a fairly high point of development in a previous life. This life hasbeen for you a balancing one and [320] when you return again it should be with asecond ray personality because the shift of this life expression, in combinationwith the last life, should bring about the evocation of a second raypersonality, intelligently equilibrised.I would point out to you, however, the problem which emerges when you have astraight line of contact between the first ray soul, the fifth ray personality,a fifth ray mind and a seventh ray brain. This leads to intelligent high gradework in your chosen profession but negates the free play of the intuition. Thislatter, however, is aided by the fact that at this time , your first ray soulfocusses itself in the astral body and, therefore, greatly aids its expressionby giving you emotional power (if you care to use it) and enabling you torelease much magnetic force—again if you care to, which is seldom. The reasonfor this is that—through your definite soul contact—you tend to express theoutstanding quality of the first ray which is loneliness, isolation (notseparativeness with you, my brother, for that is not one of your faults), theability to stand alone and unmoved. Your personality, as you have probablyguessed, finds its focus of expression in the mental body. There is an easy lineof fusion there.For the rest of this life, your effort should be shifting the personality focusinto the astral body, thus producing the flooding of your life expression withlove, powerfully and intelligently expressed. This will also produce a closerfusion between your soul and the personality.The only meditation exercise I will give you, at present, is one that will aidthis fusion and release the magnetic quality of your life. You will have enoughto do to incorporate your aspiration, life content and intelligent consciousnesswith your group, plus mastering the technique of the new work which they, too,are learning. Do this brief exercise in consciousness and visualisation, priorto the group work and meditation.1. Sound the O.M. as a personality. Do so at the highest mental point, raisingyour aspiration at the same time, with the mind to the soul.2. Sound the O.M. as the soul, breathing it out in the will-to-love all beingsand arresting its descent at the astral [321] body. Do this by an act of thewill and the use of the creative imagination.3. Having thus vitalised the astral body and imagined the fusion of soul,personality, and astral force, then direct this triple stream of energy to theheart centre, rushing it there, if I might so express it.If you will do this faithfully and intelligently each day, with the power ofyour mind behind the work, you will very soon note results and those associatedwith you certainly will.My steadfast understanding and my love is yours, my brother.NOTE: This disciple is still actively cooperating with the Tibetan .~TO S. C. P.November 1931MY BROTHER:I would say to you in cryptic form: Study the meaning of the flame and of thewick and realise that there needs must be a wick to demonstrate the flame. Makeyour meditation definite and then anchor yourself to earth by certain specificactivities, carried through to completion. Let your service be group service andnot so much individual work as heretofore, and remember that the gift of powerin meditation and the capacity to bring through the vital energy which makesthings to be (which you can do) produces increasing detachment from physicalplane realities; it can produce also the severing of lower contacts unless theenergy is carried through on to the plane of earth happenings and works out inparalleling action. This faculty “to bring through,” you began to demonstratelast spring. It should continue.Carry your thought in meditation to the throat centre at the back of the neckand each day vitalise that centre so that the creative work is carried forwardby you and you continue to cause things to be . The lesson of Being is not yourlesson at present; it must be the lesson of selfless acting upon the physicalplane. Go forward with the ordinary routine work as I have [322] outlined it forthese members of my Ashram, and let your spiritual diary take for you the placeof speech. Strengthen the physical body and learn to avoid the taking on ofthose obligations which others can as properly handle.In your meditation work you have asked the question: What hinders that can besacrificed? Is this not so, my brother? I answer: Over-analysis of the reactionsof others to what you say and do and an over-focussing of your attention uponthe results of what you say. You know your field of service; therefore, serve.You know your group relations for this life; see that you are related!You are not clear as to the hindrances existing in your personality. This ispartly because your knowledge of the mechanics of that personality is less thanthat of the majority of my disciples because you have less academic knowledge.Avoid the glamour which comes from realisation of pure motive—and that you have.Your brain and soul have close alliance. A high grade astral body acts oft as adistorter where your vision of character is concerned. Where the Master’s workand your own field of service are in question, clearly and truly you see. Whereyou yourself are concerned, the vision is not so clear yet the method of closeself-analysis would land you in morbidity. In utter self-forgetfulness,therefore, know yourself and serve. Be silent towards your personality. Ponderon these cryptic words or phrasing, for they hold for you the truth.~June 1933I would say to you, my brother, that the instructions which I last gave to youstill carry for you the needed teaching—a teaching which, if followed, will leadto realisation. I have today but little to add. Will you again and with alighted heart read what I there have said? Your progress on the Way and yourpower to take the kingdom of Heaven by violence is very real and the keys of theentrance lie within your grasp. But this power itself carries with it its ownproblem and its own solution. Only one vital thing stands in the way of a lifeof utter usefulness and that is the sixth ray quality of your personality. Itis, as you know, the ray of devotion, of a fanatical idealism, of [323] undueemphasis and this ray, when conditioning the personality, is apt to cause muchtrouble. The lesser light of that minor ray (in itself, divine) can shut out thefull radiance of your soul. Study all you can find out about the nature of thesixth ray. Your point in evolution necessitates a dominant personality whichmust be understood by you if your full usefulness in my work is to be reached.Follow instructions, brother of mine. You can be used and when the lesser lightis dimmed, the first ray quality of your soul will be turned increasingly to thework of illumined building with the aid of other souls. There is much to beaccomplished if the work of the Hierarchy is to go forward as desired....Your work in my group is known to you. It is twofold and that you also know. Youcan stand in the group as the embodiment of dynamic energy which, as I earliertold you, causes things to be. You can also stand as a tower of strength and letthe strength of love pour through you.Say daily the following words, as oft as you feel the urge and when you choose:“The strength I touch and am, that strength I give. The central Light I reach sooft, I pass along the lighted Way to those who need that light. I seek to walkthe ways of men as light and love and power. My strength and power come from thesecret place and much I know. I live for others and must learn to lose myself inthem.”~BROTHER OF MINE: June 1934For you, there come now some months of inner consolidation. You have heightenedyour vibration since I last instructed you and have learnt and realised much ofwhat the inner path of reality signifies. Such cycles of realisation mustinevitably be succeeded by periods of quiet unemotional growth and assimilation.During these months, the high moments may perhaps cease and the work will go onwith no realised tensions and, consequently, with no moments of startlingimport. This is happily the case. A constant succession [324] of spiritualenlightenments and an unabated keying-up to high contacts would eventually dullthe instrument so that true recognitions would fade out. Ponder on this, mybrother, and be grateful for the days of coming duty, of quiet living, ofsteadfast orientation towards the light, of silent communication with your soul,of study and of thought. They are of as real value and of as true usefulness ase’en those hours when the technique of the Presence entered into yourconsciousness. They lead towards the time when the technique is superseded bythe Presence.The fiery force of your life is now one-pointedly directed towards your goal.Naught can cause you to step aside. The dynamic quality of your aspirationtowards usefulness in service indicates energies which have been directed to thewish or the will to serve. Can I make clear to you, my brother, that theseenergies must be now used differently, and that dynamic will must supersededynamic longing. You oft confuse the two. It is the will of the soul which mustbe brought into play for group ends and not the will and the aspiration of ahigh grade and consecrated personality. Ponder on this, for its acceptance andrealisation will open a door for you that has hitherto remained shut.~MY BROTHER OF OLDEN TIME: January 1935To you, I would say at this time that one of the wisest and one of the mosteducational things you have ever done is to start this group which you nowinstruct and teach. Remember that your function as a teacher in no way resemblesthat of those who are on the second ray of love wisdom. It is not the teachingaspect which is primarily yours but the awakening aspect. The group meetsostensibly for teaching and you give them what they need but your prime functionis to charge the group members with dynamic energy. Through the power of yoursoul you must awaken their souls into selfless activity. You can touch themdynamically and then never again will their orientation be purely personal. Thetask of re-orienting people can be yours. Some people work with groups and,through the inclusiveness of their auras and the potency of their souls, they[325] sweep large numbers of people into a higher aspirational attitude and intoa deeper spiritual tide. Others have the duty of finding the advanced men andwomen of the world, the individuals who stand at the portal of discipleship—butblindly, knowing not where they are or why. They then, through their dynamicsoul potency, call into living activity the soul imprisoned in these waitingpersonalities. Such is your task—to teach and vivify.And what, my brother, shall be for you the keynote of the coming months? Whatshall be the word I give to you which shall govern your personality until thecoming Wesak Festival in May? I am impelled to give you just two words ofpractical import. They are gracious loving-kindness . These qualities ofgraciousness and of loving-kindness mark the superficial (occultly understood)outer expression of the soul and for a first ray person they are ever difficult;their need is oft not recognised nor are they deemed necessary. The first rayperson frequently does not know he lacks them. The inner, dynamic and realisedgoodness of a first ray disciple can be marred by a haste and an outer quicknessof speech and attitude. So sure is a first ray person of his essential kindnessand love (and he is rightly sure) that he judges other people as himself. Theinner rectitude of attitude and the inner love matter more to him than the outerexpression. But lesser people and those upon the other rays are apt tomisunderstand. The potency of your work is so real and the opportunities openingbefore you are so great that if you add to that potency a gracious outerattitude of loving-kindness, you can be much used. Ponder on this, my brother ofold.I change not your meditation and will ask you to adhere to it until next May.This is for you a preparatory period in which the qualities of your soul must bewelded into those of the personality. In 1936 and particularly in 1937, if theplans work out as desired and you go forward on the Way, the door of opportunitywill stand wider open. These words are for you to interpret. Symbolically I sayto you:“The door before you has two leaves. One is now open wide. The other is ajar.Love alone can open the one that is ajar. The other opened to the force ofwill—this to the [326] pull of love. Behind this door there stands a Presence ,hiding another door which opens to a field of newer service.”I cannot impress upon you too strongly two matters, my brother: First that yourclosest work in the future lies with three people.... This you know already.Secondly, guard more your health and take not on your shoulders more than yourstrength can suffice to carry. Rest more. The ardent flames of inner love andaspiration oft burn too fiercely the physical vehicle. Pass on to greater workand live with joy the life of loving service.~BROTHER OF MINE: July 1935The note of my instruction to you this time can be best summed up in the stronginjunction to practise truth at all times. My word to you in my last instructionwas to ask you to inculcate in your outer expression upon the physical planethat gracious loving-kindness which first ray disciples ever need to cultivate.This you have attempted to do with marked success. The practice of thesequalities will extend your sphere of usefulness for there will be nothing,eventually, in your outer impact upon people to throw them away from you.Instead, you will draw them magnetically to the centre wherein the Masters arefound.Now I call your attention to the necessity for that crystalline truthfulness andthat precise accuracy which will release you increasingly from the prison of thelower self. People who work as you could work upon the distinctly abstractlevels of existence frequently have a difficulty in expressing the precision oftruth. They lack, if I may so express it, the capacity to bring through intoform and to build the concrete shell which can precisely express the idea. Thisyou also quite markedly lack; you have oft said, have you not, how difficult youfind it to clothe in words the ideas you contact and the field of knowledge inwhich—at high moments—you find yourself. This inability to express spiritualideas in the right words has necessarily its counterpart in the limitations ofyour personality. The ecstasy of divine knowledge which you know at times andwhich fails of right [327] expression in words, finds its inevitable counterpartin the exaggerated detail of daily life when recounted. There is ever thetendency to continue the ecstasy (known on abstract levels) into the concretelife on the physical plane. As it is stepped down, it over-stimulates other andlower aspects of the nature, and, therefore, removes itself further and furtherfrom the truth.During the coming year, brother of old, assume the task of watching with careevery statement made and every attitude assumed, so as to negate all tendency toemotional misrepresentation. But be not overwhelmed or discouraged by anydiscoveries anent your lower nature which you may make. Should you discover lackof precision in relation to those concerns which affect the lower man, rememberthat this inaccuracy is due to two things: First, to your power to work onabstract levels, involving ecstatic realisation. This reacts on the lower manand inclines him to over-emphasise all details, and to exaggerate the usual andthe commonplace into the unusual and the rare. Secondly, to your innate humilitywhich induces in you a tendency to reassure yourself constantly that you are onthe Way and that all you do is in line with soul purpose. The world of glamourwhich is the distorted reflection of the world of inspiration (the intuitivebuddhic plane) then catches you and the truth, with its clarity of outline andprecision of detail, disappears into the mists of illusion. Then all objects andaffairs loom too large and appear too important and too interesting. With themajority, the reverse happening is the case and everything dwindles inretrospect and becomes too small. Hence the word “exaggerated” in connectionwith the watch that I want you to make over all words and descriptions.This self-imposed attention to true accuracy must be your most rigid disciplineduring the next year and, when success is achieved, you will find yourselfwalking in a clearer world and discover that you will have potently increasedyour power to serve. This inability to produce a true picture of things as theyintrinsically are and to portray facts as they really exist, has militatedagainst your power to materialise that which is desired upon the physical planeand has caused you much concern and distress of mind. Your desire to help hasbeen urgent and your [328] capacity to materialise that which is needed hasseemed to you inadequate and oft futile. You have ascribed this inability to thefact that probably you have needed to learn patience. But that is not a lessonthat you need, brother of mine. Your weak point has been your inability to bringthrough the vision with accuracy. In order to do this you must learn to practiseaccuracy of thought and speech daily.Each Full Moon period, prior to entering into contact with the world ofspiritual realities as you have been instructed, check up your progress duringthe month in this respect, remembering that initial success will take the formof recognition of a hitherto unrecognised verbal inaccuracy. You have so littleto do (relatively speaking) in order increasingly to become a purifying flamethat I beseech you to do that which is needed.Let your meditation take the form more and more of contemplation. In order,however, safely to increase the length of time you can spend in contemplation,you must achieve an attitude of gentle unswerving intensity and not develop anyfurther that powerful dynamic intensity which imposes ever a strain upon thebrain cells. Your work must lie along two lines:1. Work on contemplative levels, functioning as a soul on its own abstractlevels.2. Bringing through from those levels the ideas and methods of work which mustmaterialise upon the physical plane. Hence the need for constant righttechniques in speech and the cultivation of right perception and right accuracy.Where there is the habit of accuracy, the clothing of the ideas in proper andtrue form will come more naturally.~MY BROTHER OF OLD: January 1936I have not much to say to you at this time. After the Wesak Festival, the neededchanges in work may be made if you and others in my group of disciples warrantincreased spiritual attention. I seek to let you know, however, that your realinner progress has been noted. You have stepped into clearer light and becauseof that progress you can shoulder greater responsibility in the future, providedthat you hold the ground gained [329] and lose nothing that has been revealed toyou. It is no easy task which you and all disciples have set themselves thesedays. It means facing up to the issue which each has for himself created andthis involves facing one’s life with truth as well as one’s environment, one’scharacteristics and one’s responsibilities. It is an arduous undertaking to dealclear-sightedly with the lower self, to see life and the self truly and to guardthe precious jewel of the vision untouched. You are evidencing increasingcapacity to do this; I want you to know that I am aware of your effort and yourgrowing success.Definitely, I ask you to study and to do some strenuous mental work. It willgreatly enrich you. If you will follow my instructions re study as indicated inthe work which I assigned to my group (you amongst the rest), it will suffice togive you the needed mental stimulation. The manifestation of intuitiveperception upon the physical plane is greatly aided by the effort to read, tounderstand and then to express that understanding in words. This is never aneasy task for a natural intuitive such as you are, but it is one that will bringhigh reward.Stand by your fellow disciples with renewed strength and inner realisation ofthe sources of power this year. It is the strong inner grasp of your true selfto which I appeal. This, my brother, is a year of crisis and, therefore, a yearof intense strain upon all the disciples in the world. They will need all thestrengthening that they can get and the sense of reliant confidence which comesfrom the knowledge that there are those who stand steady, who love strongly andwho aid untiringly. Give this kind of help, for well you can.In silence and in confidence and in a growing inner realisation must lie yourstrength and the strength of every member of my group of disciples.~BROTHER OF MINE: June 1936A new cycle is being entered upon by you, as it is by all in my group and forthis you have been prepared and this you have earned. The world itself entersupon a new cycle at the [330] end of this year but does so unconsciously.Disciples enter upon cycles or, rather, register their effects earlier than therest of humanity because their minds are somewhat awakened and subjectiverecognitions can be earlier accorded. This is a point which should be rememberedand one which has a definite bearing upon the Science of Prevision.It has been my wish to assign higher and more esoteric meditations but the timeis not yet; it will be dependent upon two things:1. The amount of group integration which this band of disciples in my Ashram canmanage to achieve.2. The power of the individual disciple to decentralise himself.This decentralisation is for you a major task, as it is for another of mydisciples who is working at the same problem as you are, but from a totallydifferent angle of approach. It should be interesting to both of you to helpeach other and see in what the differences consist and the entirely differenteffects which the same general outlook has upon two different ray types andpersonalities. Let me see if I can make myself clear to you for this matter isof importance.It would not have been possible for me earlier to have enlarged upon this matteras you would not have understood the truth of my words nor would you have beenable to profit by them. Even now I can only just touch upon the problems. It ispeculiarly yours and that of R.S.U. You have, however, made so much progress inovercoming hindrances that my help is warranted. Forget not, my brother, thatevery disciple has some major characteristic which requires transmutation. Someknow what it is and are working at it and the others fall into two main groups.They are either working furiously to bring about a general change in themselvesand thus succeed in bringing their faults to the surface and they do it withsuch potency that they temporarily handicap their service. Or, secondly, theyare overwhelmed and depressed by the discovery of their weaknesses. They resentbeing thus handicapped and the energy which should go towards the processes oftransmutation is turned towards their lower nature in disgust, self-pity or hurt[331] pride. All this leads to loss of time and produces inevitably theover-emphasis of the personality. The problem with which you and R.S.U. have todeal and which you must eventually solve is, above everything else, the problemof decentralisation. There is in both of you an over-emphasis of the “I” at thecentre of the stage. I am telling you nothing new when I say this, for you havebeen faithfully working at this decentralisation for some time and making realprogress. This, I, your friend and brother, tell you gladly. The emphasis uponthe little self is, in your case, based upon three things:1. A realised sense of divinity, of the beauty of the life of the spirit, oftruth and of the power of your ray life. It is due to the fact that you have—inpast lives—achieved a fair measure of soul control. Note my words with care.2. A desire to impose upon the personality and to make the lower self to be infactual living what you know yourself to be on the higher soul levels. This iscomplicated by the desire that those you love should likewise recognise yourdivinity, your service and your power.3. Being primarily astral-buddhic, demonstrating as intuitional developmentworking out in a high emotional reaction, your personality polarisation isemotional, even though you function, as a soul, on the power ray. You have,therefore, a consequent weakness in the mental polarisation. This I endeavouredto aid you in correcting last year when I suggested that you studied more anddid more mental work. Did you do this, my brother?As I said above, R.S.U. has the same problem of being too much in the centre ofher own life stage, but her whole attitude and life presentation is the exactreverse of yours. You, realising a measure of divinity, impose upon yourpersonality in speech and desire what you believe to be the effects of divinity.You over-estimate the capacity of the personality to respond to this. She,realising the same measure of divinity, is so conscious of the failure of thepersonality to express this, that she retires within herself and (if I may use aphrase of real ugliness) she there “wallows” in the sense of failure. Thisability to see such failure and to sense at the same time the beauty of divinityis due to [332] her mental polarisation which enables her to cast the light ofthe mind in two directions. She is largely an expression of the higher orabstract mind, invading the lower mind, via the soul. Yours is buddhic orintuitional reason, stimulating the astral-emotional nature, via the soul. Inthese two statements, you and R.S.U. have your problem clearly defined. Thebuilding of the antahkarana—more surely and more definitely—is the solution forboth of you, plus a trained and cultivated self-forgetfulness. In some ways, theproblem of R.S.U. is harder than yours because (through her sense of inferioritybrought about by the second of the two capacities of the mind which casts itsclear light upon the personality) she tunes in on the illusion of humanfailure—a gigantic thoughtform—and also upon her racial sense of inferiority.Her distress is deep-seated in her love nature. Yours is not so deep-seated asit is not fed so dominantly from the mental plane.The way out for R.S.U. is the cultivation of joy, as it brings release toothers. Yours is by the right control of speech and the elimination of allreference to personality activities. This must be achieved, not by the processesof inhibition, but by a true lack of self-interest. If my reference to thebuddhic-astral nature of your life direction is not clear to you, take thematter up with R.V.B. Your technical knowledge of these terms may not beadequate to true comprehension. You need to study in order to awaken your mentalgrasp, without losing at the same time your intuitional wisdom. R.S.U. needs tostudy less and to be more.Power can flow through you, my brother. As a channel, you can be potent oncethat channel has been better cleared. You can act as a distributor of strengthand power to your brothers once you have freed yourself from the centre of yourstage and can move with greater freedom on soul levels....Your work must continue to lie a great deal on buddhic levels. The calls tomeditation which so constantly come to you from somewhere must still meet withprompt response from your personality. This is one thing which you havemastered, the ability as a soul to call the attention of the personality. Thisability is your major asset and contribution where my group of disciples isconcerned for it enables you, if you so choose, to [333] send forth at willlight and strength and power. Continue with this work of attention.May the light of the Eternal shine upon your way, my brother and the power ofyour soul pour through you with increasing helpfulness to your chosen band ofcomrades. Such is my prayer for you as I gather you closer into my aura.~MY BROTHER: January 1937You have asked me a definite question and you have made one statement to which Iwould call your attention as it embodies a major truth which—graspedtheoretically by you at this time—can be practically applied if you so choose.You asked how one can definitely know my vibration. There are four vibrations towhich you respond and which you should carefully study and learn todifferentiate more accurately in the year of training which lies ahead:1. That of your own soul at moments of contact. These are the moments of lightand illumination and of released thought and for this contact and its expressionin these forms you should increasingly work. They are free from personalityideas, ideals and desires (of no matter how high an order) and from all tracesof personality love. But they should throw a flood of light upon thepersonality, revealing you to yourself. If this they do not do, then they arekept on too high a mental level and are impractical for they remain mystical andabstract, theoretical and divorced from consummated practice. They increaseresponsibility but remain relatively useless for they are futile upon thephysical plane.2. The vibration of your group of co-disciples. You sense this group of minemost potently and particularly at the time of the Full Moon. It producescollective heart expansion. This I think also you know and have at timesexperienced. It should deepen your love for your fellow disciples and shoulddestroy all barriers between you and them. If it does not do this, then thewhole activity is [334] kept on the level of theory and mentation and is notpractically expressed. What I say to you here I say to all disciples.3. You sense also the vibration of two in this group of disciples particularly;they are the most easily contacted by you and produce stimulation—the one of thehead centre and the other of the heart centre. Forget not, stimulation is animpersonal force and is unconsciously applied in your case by them and it feedsyour thought life more than anything else. This means that tuning in on thesetwo vibrations accentuates all your thought life—the good and that which is notso good. The three of you create in fact a triangle within my group and thisshould increase the interplay of love. At the same time, it could also produce atendency to drive apart when handled personally. Foster the love but tune not inwhen that sensed link of love is absent.4. You sense at times also my own vibration. This can be the tuning in to theperiphery of my aura, producing integration of your entire personality and alsofacilitating soul alignment; it can also be a closer contact, a tuning in on theenergy of my heart centre. How can you know that you have done so? Only, mybrother, by the after effects and not by any phenomenal vision, response orreaction. An increase of love and understanding, a developed impersonality and akeener response to need—these would be some of the true reactions.Study these various vibrations by practising the habit of contacting them withdeliberation and determination, tuning on one or other of these four at separatetimes, noting results and registering any response.The statement which you make and to which I seek to call your attention is asfollows: One must distinguish between essentials and non-essentials. This is astatement of deep occult fact and significance and holds the key to thespiritual life and to all the occult mysteries. It pleases me that you haveisolated this truth and have attempted to formulate it with clarity. Now, mybrother, use it as the keynote of your spiritual practice during the next fewmonths, living by it and abiding by it. Apply [335] it, however, not to the useof your time or to your physical plane active life but to the use you make ofemotion and of thought. Bring it as a touchstone to every problem and situationof an emotional nature and every glamorous, personality reaction and watch thelight which will stream in from every side. Ask yourself, for instance: Is thisline of thought or inner emotional reaction an essential or is it of noimportance in the light of the larger issues and is, therefore, a non-essential?Is my agreement or disagreement with someone’s ideas or point of view based onspiritual essentials or on personality non-essentials? Act then on the responsewhich you call forth as you stand in the light of your own soul. Ask yourselfalso: Are these comments of mine, this discussion in which I may be engaged,concerned with spiritual essentials or not? Are my words emphasising thespiritual reality in my brother or do they bring to light that which isnon-essential? Am I throwing the weight of my influence upon the side ofessential facts or am I fostering the non-essential and, therefore, theunnecessary? One could make lengthy application of a practical nature to thisoccult law but I have indicated sufficiently the usefulness of your statement.I am giving you no occult exercises at this time. You have evolved your own wayof working and of preparation for meditation and it will suffice you for thepresent. The occult phrases which should constitute your subject of meditationduring the coming months and which have in them the clue to increased releaseare:“The will dynamic sweeps from the centre to the periphery and builds the littleworld of form—the world of I and my, of me and mine. This world a prison makes.It hides the beauty rare; it shrouds the sound divine; it veils the Wordincarnate.“The will dynamic sweeps from that which is without to that which lies within.It builds the wider world of Thou and Thine, of Ours and That. The doors standopen wide; a light shines forth; a Word can then be spoken and many prisoners gofree.“The will dynamic sweeps around the world upon the wings of love divine. Itsweeps throughout the universal world; it acclaims with joy the All, the Whole,the One. [336] The Life then stands revealed. The universe stands free and withit man .”~July 1937You have an interesting and definite problem, brother of mine, which entails theorganisation and the right relation of the different aspects of your personalityforces and their eventual coordination with the energy of the soul.Your mental body is on the second ray. This, as you will note, is not usual. Itmakes illumination the line of least resistance. It facilitates contact with thesoul and provides your dominant problem. That problem is the demanding of loveand of appreciation where your personality is concerned. Think this out. Itmeans that you can always be depended upon to sacrifice everything in order thatthe desires, the will and the purpose of the soul—once they are made clear toyou—may be truly worked out. Nothing will be permitted by you to arrest yourspiritual achievement once the way appears open to you. But it means also, fromthe lower angle, that you will sacrifice much in order to be loved by people.This matters not at all in the case of the average person for in due time andinevitably a proper sense of proportion will emerge. But it does matter in thecase of those who are on the Path of Discipleship and who face at some not sodistant time preparation for initiation. Watch this with care and discover foryourself the situation. One clue to understanding would be that you studywhether or not, in moments of personality emergency, you sacrifice your sense oftruth or your friends.Your emotional body is on the sixth Ray of Devotion and Idealism; hence yourdevotion to those you love, to truth and (unknown and unrealised by you) to me,your Tibetan brother and teacher. Hence also your devotion to the Hierarchywhich I serve. Hence also the interplay between your sixth ray personality andyour sixth ray astral body which provides both spiritual opportunity but also adefinite problem.Your physical body is of a dominant first ray type. This again is not usually soexcept in the case of disciples, who are liable to build vehicles of any type offorce to meet the emergency, the need or the service of a particular life. This[337] first ray body enables you to handle spiritual energy upon the physicalplane. It enables you also to act as a force transmitter and distributor. Theforces, therefore, with which you have to deal are:1. The soul ray—the first Ray of Will or Power.2. The personality ray—the sixth Ray of Devotion.3. The ray of the mind—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.4. The ray of the astral body—the sixth Ray of Devotion.5. The ray of the physical body—the first Ray of Power.I have one personal word of commendation to give you at this time, my brother.Your sense of truth is growing fast. See that it continues so to do.~MY BROTHER AS ALWAYS: January 1938I would ask you to study the instructions which I gave you a year ago. By sodoing, you will be able to gauge any measure of growth to which you may haveattained (if you study with care and understanding). You will also be able todecide if you have gone forward as indicated. You have had a year of developmenton all planes and your task is now to balance, one against the other, thevarious aspects of your life so that (in the words of the occult phrases givento you a year ago and definitely chosen by me with an eye to your futureprogress), you can build that “wider world of Thou and Thine, of Ours and That.”Forget not, that what you build can be either a temple of the Lord from whichthe Words of Power can issue forth and “many prisoners go free,” or a prisonhouse, hiding and not revealing, veiling and not manifesting that which is ofbeauty rare.One of the problems with which all disciples are faced as they become dynamicand constructive on all planes (as they do and must) is to avoid becoming theprisoners of their own constructions or limited by that which they themselveshave created. They must learn to live with vision in the world of causes and ofmotive, adhering strenuously to “original intention”; they must not permitthemselves to be sidetracked [338] by the activities which they have themselvesset in motion, or by the details which emerge out of their creative activity, orby the lesser responsibilities and obligations which may appear. You know wellto what I here refer and should increasingly respond to these ideas. Keep thevision clear, my brother, and live upon the mountain top. It is this messagewhich I seek to send to you and to all in my group of disciples today. You areall living on the verge of new happenings, of increased opportunities, freshcomplexities and of definite spiritual crises. Then, remember the words which Ispoke to you last year. We grow by the presentation of moments of crisis. Facesuch times with detachment, with deep inner comprehension and consecration andwith illumined understanding, and swerve not from your basic objective to servethe race of men, the Plan and Us. Such is the appeal I make to all my disciples.I am not giving you a definite meditation till later. But I particularly beg youto concentrate attention each month at the time of the Full Moon. For one fullweek each month make your conscious, dynamic and intelligent approach and letnothing interfere with this. It will be the best method for your first raynature and will enable you to preserve your spiritual integrity; it will alsoserve each month to awaken your consecration and your dynamic spiritual will sothat your dedication to service, your consecration to the life of meditation andyour pledged obedience to your soul may move forward “from strength tostrength.” You will thereby be enabled (in the rush of new undertakings) topreserve yourself ever at the inner point of peace and from that spiritualcentre go forth to the day’s task, serene and unafraid, and with consciousnessof spiritual purpose, kept ever at its highest point of tension. Will you,however, take the following seed thoughts into your meditation?March . . . . . . . . .Spiritual Purpose.April . . . . . . . . . .Consecration to the Plan.May . . . . . . . . . ..Tension and Intensity.June . . . . . . . . . . Quiet Poise.July . . . . . . . . . . .Spiritual Carelessness.August . . . . . . . . Loving Understanding.September . . . . . Self-forgetfulness.October . . . . . . . Soul Purpose.~[339] MY BROTHER: January 1939May I start my instruction to you at this time by quoting to you some familiarwords: “In quietness and in confidence shall be your strength.” Have you evernoticed the occult significance of these words? Quietness refers to thenecessary condition of the astral or emotional body, and confidence, which isthe outward expression of an inward faith, describes that of the mind. Inquoting to you these words I have given you the working rules which shouldgovern your personality life during the next few months. Quietness leads to aright reflection in the quiet pool of the emotional life and this in the lightof the soul. Confidence is the expression of the personality faith in the factof the soul and of the Plan. “Faith is the substance of things hoped for, theevidence of things not seen.” These desired realities, when reflected in theemotional nature, evoke aspiration and develop faith.The focus of your soul is in the brain and that is why (when you came intoincarnation) you built a first ray physical body—which is an unusual thing todo. The energy of your personality ray is focussed in the astral body. Yourproblem is to swing the mind nature into greater activity without (at the sametime) developing criticism—a thing from which you are at this time relativelyfree though you are not free from certain unrecognised jealousies. You are freebecause the lower concrete mind, even if of good calibre, is subordinated inyour case to intuition and to feeling. Your task is to gather personality andsoul energy into the mind and—losing nothing of your present intuitive abilityand power to feel and love—to work from the place of mental power. If you can dothis, then your intuition will take due form and the power which flows throughyou will transmute feeling into understanding.Before, therefore, you meditate each day, I will ask you to practise the abilityto withdraw into the mind . You usually get focussed too high in the region ofbuddhic realisation (which is the exercise of the intuitive faculty) or you arefocussed too low, in the realm of astral perception. I do not here refer toastral vision or psychism but to responsiveness to feeling.[340] You must learn to see the mind as a centre of pure light. You must ridyour consciousness of any thought of the mind as intellect and must learn to seeit as simply a powerful reflector of the light of the soul, transmitting soulwisdom into the world of men. When you have found this centre of light, which isthe mind, there take your stand in the very centre of the sphere and from thatpoint proceed with the rest of the work which you are doing with my group, afterduly linking up soul and brain.Your objective in alignment will then be the mind, linked with the soul and thebrain. This is a little different to the usual presentation of soul-mind-brain.It is mind-soul-brain. Ponder on this.~MY BROTHER: November 1939The entire glamorous life today, presenting itself as a necessary pageant andone that must be accepted in its inevitability, involves your consciousness. Bythis I mean that there is little of the specific and the particular in theglamour which seeks control of you, as is usually the case with the man in thestreet. It is the whole, swirling miasma which well-nigh engulfs you because—asI told you some years ago—you are predominantly astral-buddhic in yourconsciousness. Your intuitional grasp of reality and of truth is far ahead ofthe average. Your sensitive response to glamour is equally so. It is for thisreason that your soul has led you into places where (in the competitive life ofmankind) your lower mind must perforce function and thus the gap between the twomajor factors in your life (the higher intuitive mind and the astral-emotionalnature) can be bridged, thus letting in the illumining control of the lowermind, plus normal concrete thinking. This is by no means an easy process, but,for a disciple like yourself, it is one which you can face with gallantattitude.My aim is to let you know the purpose of your present life activity. It is notthe seeking of money in order to live rightly and correctly; it is not the fulloccupation of your time, nor is it place or power. These are not the trueincentives. The real [341] aim of your soul is bridging work and the achievementof clear-sighted control over a powerful personality, thus leading you to faceyourself as you are and to make the needed changes. When the personality can beappraised justly and its achievements, its faults and its capacities rightlygauged, and when it is then deliberately subordinated to the aims of thesoul—then you will have made a very great step forward.And, my brother, you are making it. Your values are truer than they were a fewyears ago. The small social amenities and the calculated choice of friends nolonger entirely govern your attitudes, though ancient habits still persist.Twenty years ago you were governed by social considerations; today that is notthe case. It has been a long and hard lesson for you to attain a better sense ofproportion, a more correct judgment and a finer perception as to people andtheir values; this will actively aid you in the dissipation of glamour. You aremaking real progress in overcoming the glamour of the social world, of place andposition.You are beginning to think in terms of human beings, thus negating yourbackground. Does this surprise you, my brother? The glamour of caste still holdsmany nations and their peoples, and this the present war will bring to an endand from it will emerge humanity —whole, and able to function in human ways,free from the major trends and tyrannies of the past caste system, churchianityand financial grading. Ponder on this, for it is a point which you have not seenwith clarity, and right understanding of this will clear your way to a future ofwonder. In the lives of the world disciples at this time, great world problemsare being worked out. Their response to world conditions is more sensitive andquicker and in their subsequent clear thinking lies the hope of worldregeneration. So think and, my brother, lose not time worrying over what maylook like an implied criticism of you.NOTE: Inability to take criticism or to walk with humility on the Waytemporarily has glamoured this disciple and direct contact with the Tibetan’sgroup has stopped; the decision was the disciple’s and not the Tibetan’s.~TO P. G. C.January 1936[342] MY BROTHER:As I begin my work with you, I seek first of all to make two things clear. Ilook for no blind obedience from you. Such is not the way of the true disciple,nor is it your way. For this you may be glad. But I do look for evidence of thatspiritual experimentation which will be willing to give fair trial for anadequate time to those things which do not run counter to your developingintuition. You yourself are becoming increasingly conscious that your spiritualindependence (which is one of your most precious assets) can become too muchemphasised and prove in some ways a hindrance. Your position is clear and sound,but you fail somewhat to recognise the fact that your personality is not yet apure channel; nor is your alignment and your inner adjustment to the soul yetperfected. There is a chance, is there not, my brother, that your constantreaction against receiving any outer help may at times militate against yourprogress. Your extreme cautiousness may lead (if over-accentuated) to a spiritof isolation and separativeness which can be profoundly disastrous to theemerging and true spiritual ideals.There are always those whom you can aid and stimulate and whose consciousnessyou can assist to expand. This is your constant endeavour and realisation, foryou ever serve. But, equally, there are those who can give to you—in their dueplace and time—that which you need in order to take what is for you the nextstep upon the Path. And this I can give to you, if you care, for a year or so,to enter into some experiments with me and submit to some plain statements oftruth. In the process of this experimentation can you give faithful adherence tothe imparted instruction? You can at any time drop out. You are not asked togive to me any personality devotion. You will not be asked to do aught for whichI will not (at the same time) seek to explain the reason and objective. Butwhilst working in my group, will you not adhere to my instructions and refrainfrom criticism and from conjecture of too analytical a nature until I have hadtime to demonstrate to you the value of that which I am [343] seeking to do?Give me two years, my brother, and by that time you may value that which I andthe group can give.I sought to bring you into my group work for several reasons. My first reasonwas that your type of mind will be of value to the group and you can help mewith your teaching capacity, for you are well grounded in the academic side ofthe divine art and know more than do your fellow group members, just as I.S.G-L.is more deeply versed in the science of psychology than are any of you. Yourquestions and your occasional papers will be of value to the group.Secondly, if you will temporarily abandon your attitude of mental isolation(which is somewhat based on fear—a fear of losing time as you appropriate themental errors of others), the group identification required will greatly broadenyour understanding. Read what I have to say in the general instructions anentthis group endeavour and seek to cooperate—for a while at least. The value ofthe group work may even outweigh in its results the teaching which I may give toyou. In the New Age, which is upon us, all true work is group work , with theindividual subordinated to the group good. This identification you have yet tolearn. Members of the new groups have to learn to identify themselves with thesubjective aspiration and goal of the group, but not with the organisation anglewhich is ever kept in the background. This will not be easy for you. Groups,just like individuals, have their three functioning aspects. That of the outeractive organisation is only too familiar. It is the second aspect, of groupinclusiveness which you have to learn and with which you must identify yourself.Now, brother of old, let me give to you the meditation work which I wish you todo. For six months cease from the breathing exercise that you have been doing,which you call the abdominal breath, for it vitalises primarily the centresbelow the diaphragm and with you—curiously enough—it is the centre at the baseof the spine which is vitalised.... I seek to awaken the creative imaginationand release your sense of specialised force in certain areas.That the light may indeed shine upon your way, and lead you to increasedusefulness is the wish of your friend and co-worker, the Tibetan.~[344] MY BROTHER: June 1936You are a second ray soul and have a seventh ray personality.This seventh ray personality enables you to work actively in many ways upon thephysical plane, bringing together the subjective reality and the outer form.Your feeling that there is in you indication of a fifth ray activity is due tothe fact that it was your personality ray in your last life and is, for you, theline of least resistance therefore.First, my brother, I would like to thank you for the way in which you have takenhold of this work, and for your cooperation in attempting to fuse the groupsubjectively. You have worked well and hard, and though I know that you seek notcommendation, it is of value sometimes to know that one’s efforts are bearingfruit.This group of mine is by no means an easy one with which to work. In the sixmembers who are at present working together in it there are five second rayegos. This is interesting in that it indicates a predominant capacity in thegroup to heal and to teach, and these are, in the last analysis, your two majorobjectives. This should be grasped and understood. Healing need not necessarilybe physical in its objective. The highest form of healing at this time possibleis psychological. This, of course, produces physical results. When a healer cancombine in himself both fields of activity and produce that psychologicalsynthesis and a consequent physical healing, then much, very much, can be done.There are also to be found three sixth ray lines of force. These produce thatdefinite drive which tends towards ultimate success, but also a drift towardsfanaticism. This must be guarded against; for disciples in training, fanaticismis not desirable. In this brief analysis of the ray forces present in thisgroup, it is apparent that you should find points of contact. The problem of twoof your fellow disciples, though not definitely similar, has many resemblancesfrom the angle of the soul. May I add here, that the point of evolution of thedisciples and their status upon the Path of Discipleship lies [345] entirelybetween them, their own souls and myself, and need not engage the attention ofany other person. It is an entirely futile speculation on the part ofpersonalities. I have only called your attention to these points of rapport,because of their value in group integration.I am not, at this time, going to alter your meditation work. Rhythm throughmeditation takes time to establish and you have not worked at this for asufficient length of time to get your results. The rhythm which I seek to seecontrolling is not yet adequate and it will not hurt you to continue theseexercises. Endeavour to clarify and deepen your alignment between thepersonality and the soul.~MY BROTHER: January 1937You have worked hard the past six months and, though you need no cheering, yourwork has been amazingly selfless. I wanted you to know that this has been notedby me. You have worked steadily and subjectively at the production of groupharmony and understanding; you have endeavoured consciously to bring your secondray force to bear upon the matter of group integration. In doing this, you havetuned in on a vital problem for the group. This group of disciples (affiliatedwith my Ashram) cannot begin its real service until its individual membersfunction in an unbreakable unity. The problem is to aid and assist this processsubjectively and with true impersonality. So many disciples are apt to bringtheir concrete mind to bear upon these relations, and often end by disturbingits rhythm. All that is needed is love, understanding, and again love, followedby silence. This you have attempted successfully. Continue so to do and preserveever a watchful spirit so that your high standard can be maintained.There is much to be done during the coming year and it must all be approachedfrom the angle of soul contact, followed by efficiency on the physical plane.There is a point I ask you to work at during these next months, for itconstitutes for you the next step upon the Path of Discipleship.Seek to make such a dynamic contact with your soul each [346] morning (prior tostarting the day’s work) that the power and wisdom then contacted, and thepurity of the open channel, will carry you through the day’s activities withouta continual recollectedness of the need to preserve contact . This is one of thefirst steps in the newer conception of being . So many people labour at the workof being a disciple. At a certain stage, this is right, proper and mostnecessary, but it should be succeeded by a conscious, dynamic, rhythmic contactevery twenty-four hours. Then the momentum set up should suffice to carry youthrough your full life of service. Once a day you must seek recharging and, ifthe work is adequately done, it should suffice.Your other daily points of contact are not intended to aid you personally. Norare they for your own spiritual refreshment. They are the moments when you tunein on the larger life of the Hierarchy, and of the New Group of World Servers.This I want you to remember. How then shall you make this approach for dynamicstimulation? This is your immediate problem and, in order to help you, I suggestthe meditation outlined below.1. Alignment. Achieved consciously and as rapidly as possible.2. Then, in your own words, holding the mind steady in the light, and focussingyourself as high in the head as possible, offer yourself to the soul forrecharging.3. Follow this by three minutes (for this is quite a long time, my brother) ofcomplete silence, preserving, if you can, an unmoved consciousness. The chargingwith spiritual light and force can then take place. How is this done? It is doneby the soul, your true self, gathering you, its personality, into itself —aprocess of identification for which you must strive. This is what the mystics ofthe Catholic Church call the “true quiet of union.”4. To this should succeed a moment wherein you seek to realise that that whichthe soul has done is a fact. This involves the renewed activity of the mentalprocesses.5. Then, by the use of the creative imagination, carry this electrification (ifI might use such a word), this stimulation and this illumination down to theemotional body, [347] purifying it and endeavouring to dispel its glamours. Letit sweep through the astral body.6. Then in the physical brain consciousness, regard yourself as the consciousrecipient of the strength and the wisdom which you need in service.Go forth then to your life and service and expect and look for results.~October 1937Your enquiring mind, my brother, is a real group asset, but when couched interms of bewilderment, or critical intellectual questioning, it can let indestructive force. Use the knowledge which you have to emphasise the facts ofwhich you are sure. Take your stand upon the basic certainties, and remember,that in the synthesis of the apparently contradictory complexities, there willcome eventually enlightenment. Therefore, my brother, can I do anything elseexcept tell you to wait with patience? In occult training, the old adage remainsprofoundly true that “a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.” The Path leadingto omniscience is one of pitfalls and of difficulties. Has it ever struck youwhat complexities the Great Ones face as They deal with a constantly changinghumanity? Principles remain eternally the same. But techniques and methods ofpresentation alter with each cycle, because the receiving equipment of mansteadily alters and improves. This improvement does not necessarily mean aneasier type of pupil; it often means the reverse. The Teacher has not only toimpart the old truth in a new way, but has often to offset the establishedhabits of thought and the impatience of a too eager mind.Ponder on the themes below suggested.1st month—The use of the hands in healing.2nd month—The cultivation of patience in diagnosis.3rd month—The factor of time in healing.4th month—The “occult abstraction” of the personality in healing.5th month—The recognition of karma in healing.6th month—The interplay of love in healing. [348]I would suggest that after each month’s pondering, you summarise yourconclusions in six statements—brief and concise.~BROTHER OF OLD: March 1938I would ask you to cast your eye, the eye of the inner spiritual insight, backover the past eight years, and thus awaken the recognition that during that timethree things have happened to you:1. Your orientation towards reality has been stabilised; you are definitelyfaced towards your goal, and nothing is able to deter you. Your progress may beslowed by circumstance and human frailty, but nothing can arrest your progress.2. Your personality dependencies (upon yourself and upon others) are basicallyweakened and you have learnt a “divine distrust” of the reactions of the littleself and its attitudes. You were so sure of your own point of view eight yearsago, particularly in your own department of life and training.3. The significance of patient waiting, both in relation to people who are closeto you, your clients, your co-disciples and me, is becoming strongly developedin you and it is one of the first lessons which a disciple has to master.The implications of these three developments and their effect upon your dailylife in your office, home, environment and group is now quite definite, and Iwould remind you of this. You will know within yourself the reason that I havebrought these steps of progress to your attention. It is of real value to adisciple at times to summarise achievement and to accept it.A new cycle always eventuates from such a moment of recognition and ofconclusion, and into such a cycle you are now moving. Be therefore prepared bothfor deepened vision and for a fresh cycle of testing. You might ask me, mybrother, of what such a preparation should consist. For you, it should be asteady “standing in spiritual being” which in your case (because [349] of rayaffiliations) means to stand in the radiance of love—a love which wavers not andwhich permits no personality reactions to dim its lustre. I refer here to soullove and patience and not to any emotional expression of a well-developed astralbody such as you undoubtedly have. Such an astral body, duly disciplined becomesa channel for the soul, and is a group asset and of major usefulness.Earlier, I gave you some seed thoughts to be the germ of your meditation. This Idid with a long purpose in my mind. Meditation is so oft regarded as the meansfor establishing soul contact. People oft forget, however, that this contact isbrought about very frequently by an inner reflective attitude of mind, by a lifegiven to service and selflessness, and by a determination to discipline thelower nature so that it may become a true channel for the soul. When these threemethods of development are fully expressed and become a life tendency orpermanent habits, then meditation can be shifted into another category ofusefulness and serve as a technique for the development of the intuition and forthe solution of group problems. To this use of meditation I seek to direct yourattention, and it was towards these ends I was working when I chose the seedthoughts given to you earlier this year. I would ask you now to take thefollowing six questions, based upon these seed thoughts, into your meditativereflection and answer them, one each month, during the coming half year period.1. Why are the hands the distributive centres for healing and what do theysymbolise?2. What three major points should be considered in all true diagnosis?3. Which of the bodies does the factor of time primarily affect and why?4. “Occult abstraction” takes place in two directions in connection with apatient. What are these two directions? And what is abstracted?5. Do you believe that a man’s karma must inevitably lead always towardsphysical healing in this particular incarnation?6. What aspect of love is used by the healer when dealing with a patient? [350]You will find these questions of engrossing interest and well worth yourattention as a preparatory task for the future work in healing in which you mustprepare to take a prominent part. This group work I trust we can begin soon ifthe group continues with its task of integration, and learns the nature of thatquiet spirit which is free from criticism, undue questioning and goes forth toothers in love.I will now indicate to you the nature of the five rays which condition you atthis time. Of two of them, you already have some knowledge—your second ray souland your seventh ray personality. In many ways you know more about the soul raywhich conditions you than you do about your seventh personality ray. Knowledgeof this latter ray must come to you through the art of healing, and your soulhas rightly led your personality into its right line of activity.Your mental body is on the fifth ray. This is definitely what I might call a“left over” from the fifth ray personality in which you functioned in yourprevious incarnation. This fifth ray mind gives you the enquiring, questioningnature which is one of your outstanding characteristics—a great asset whenrightly used; a major problem and real deterrent to the inflow of soul lightwhen over-emphasised. Eight years ago it was thus over-emphasised.Your astral body is on the sixth ray and this is one of the factors which linksyou so closely to several of your fellow disciples. Both your major rays, as youwill have noted are the same as R.S.W. You can see how potent a part you canplay in this life if the force or influence which flows through you, via youremotional nature, is rightly directed by your soul. Being on the same line ofenergy as the soul—2, 4, 6—a line of least resistance for soul force is found.Your physical body is upon the seventh ray. This should give you facileexpression of your personality purpose upon the physical plane. Therefore, indealing with yourself, you have the following ray forces to consider:1. The egoic ray—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.2. The personality ray—the seventh Ray of Order or Magic.3. The ray of the mental body—the fifth Ray of Concrete Science. [351]4. The ray of the astral body—the sixth Ray of Devotion.5. The ray of the physical body—the seventh Ray of Order or Magic.It is of value to students to study what rays are not represented in thepersonality equipment. I commend this to your attention and also theimplications based upon the fact that the three rays of your three bodiescorrespond sequentially to the three planes in the three worlds of yourpersonality endeavour.~BROTHER OF MINE: November 1938I would start my instructions to you with stating my thanks for the steadinesswhereby you have evoked the greatly needed group integration. You have servedthe group well, e’en if you do not realise it yourself. But I have seen andknown. It is not oft that I pause in my strenuous life to tell a disciple thathe has done well. I pause here today, however, to tell you so with deliberation.The group should start its healing service in the late fall. By that time, allwill have assimilated and grasped the essentials of the group work. You will beeven more receptive to my suggestions than you have been, for you have workedhard at the task of spiritual acquiescent compliance. It was for you a hard taskfor you are an analytical personality. You can now receive the teaching with asensitive compliance and a spiritual integrity which seven years ago would havebeen utterly impossible to you. See that you lose not these qualities.One great problem I would commend to you, my brother, and that can be stated toyou in the form of the following question: Group meetings often proveundesirable for disciples in the early stages of their work together. They serveonly to foster personality reactions. How and in what way can the group meet, asa unit, for your future work in healing? This question will necessitate carefulconsideration on your part and I would ask you to ponder upon the followingpossibilities:1. That the group could meet at certain stated hours on [352] certain stateddays, sitting alone wherever they may be and thus do the required work.2. That the group could do the work each morning at their morning meditation,each in his own place, knowing that upon the inner planes, the time equationcounts not.3. That the group could meet together (as many as possibly can) in person forthe work of healing but should refuse to impair their usefulness by anypersonality conversation or exchange of views.In my last instructions to you, I advised you strongly to consider the nature,qualities and attributes of the rays which were lacking in your equipment. Didyou duly do so? They are, as you well know, the first, the third and the fourthor the rays of power, active intelligence and of that skill in action whichproduces conflict, leading to harmony. You have a sound grasp of the rays whichconstitute your equipment for this life but you need to understand wherein youlack certain attributes necessary to achievement. You possess four types of rayenergy, which work quite fully through you. It is not hard for you to show love,though you handicap yourself considerably through the over-emphasis of thewisdom aspect of love. This leads to certain forms of hardness in your relationswith those near and dear to you. Does this surprise you, my brother?The seventh ray in your personality and physical body gives you the desire touse your hands and it determines your life work, because the hands are theagents of the magician and you are most definitely upon the Path of the WhiteMagician. Your sixth ray astral body has given you your idealism, and theone-pointedness of your fifth ray mind has determined the nature of your mentalapproach to problems and to people; but you lack certain qualities which wouldsupplement your life expression and which would round out your nature. You needmore skill in action , a more firmly focussed will to understand; thus you willbring more of your brain cells into activity through the exercise of the thirdray qualities. Ponder on this, but become not over-serious about it.Continue with the group meditation along with the other group members and notecarefully the few changes I have made. [353] Add to it the following briefmeditation. It is planned in connection with your fifth ray mental nature, and Iwould ask you to do it with care. . . . Go in peace, my brother.~BROTHER OF OLD: May 1939One of the things which will, in two or three years time, emerge as part of yourcontribution in service will be a deep knowledge on the part of esotericists anda renewed interest in orthodox circles of the ray-gland-centre teaching. I wouldask you to let this knowledge percolate slowly (if I may use such a term) intoyour consciousness and there—without any sense of strain or pressure—it will begradually assimilated. It will then become an integral part of your scientificknowledge, of your mental equipment, and of your technique in service, so thatit will become instinctually available. Forget not, that the hardly wonintellectual perceptions have to become instinctual creative factors by the timea man is permitted to take initiation. The esoteric facts learned and the mentalawareness achieved, will have to fall eventually below the threshold ofconsciousness, of thought and of awareness; they must constitute an integralpart of the whole man, just as the animal instinctual nature or the reaction ofthe mind to the array of facts, presented by the use of the five senses, liesbelow the threshold of the animal consciousness, but is protectively available.The true healer (and you can most certainly be one) should be so centralised inthe higher awareness and subtly perceptive of the needs and the condition of theperson to be healed, that his reactions to the situation and to the needed help,will be automatic, intuitive and, consequently, reliable. The true healer alsocorrelates and uses all the various branches of the healing art—exoteric andesoteric, orthodox and experimental. He is not confined to one mode of serviceor to one scheme of presented healing. Again, I would ask you to ponder uponthis.I would ask you, also, to make a careful study of the use of the hands inhealing. I have given various hints in my different [354] books and there ismuch anent this subject in the doctrine of the Church as to the “laying on ofhands” and also in the oriental teachings anent the mudras, or the use of handsin ritualistic service. Find out all that you can about the hands. Later, I willindicate the future use of this science of the hands and give furtherinstruction on the purpose of the centres in the hands in relation to thehealing art. In the meantime, gather all the information upon the matter thatyou can and put it in such form that it may be available for use in the group.I give you no other special work to do nor special meditation. Your time isfully and constructively occupied, my brother.~MY BROTHER: January 1940At the centre of your astral life lies a hindering glamour and, as in the caseof your group brother ... I find it difficult to give this glamour a name. It isthe reverse of his but then your two natures are widely different. Perhaps I canexplain. You are working on the physical plane with distressed bodies and minds.You are also working on soul levels with thoughts and with concepts, and alsowith the assimilation of that inner and occult knowledge which has been yourchosen way this life. Your active and enquiring mind, therefore, moves in thedirection of the rendering of service and the acquiring of knowledge. You cantouch heights in your inner life. Your service, steadfastly rendered, brings youdown into the depths of human living. Yet the glamour of detachment, leading topersonal cleavages in your inner life, hinders the full expression of the souland the demonstration of a fusion which is much needed. For you, the word whichwould bring light is identification , as it is for . . . . By means of thatidentification the soul becomes at-one with all that breathes. That whichhinders . . . is different to that which hinders you. Your mind is more activethan his, and you are not so held by social considerations as he is. Hisintuition is more alive than yours and far more sensitive. You both need,however, a closer identification with humanity and release from a glamorouspre-occupation with [355] what goes on in the higher levels of consciousness anda closer interest in the reactions upon the planes of personality expression.This diagnosis of mine will, I think, surprise you. The fact remains that youmust continue your mental attitudes, cease in no way to be pre-occupied with thesearch for truth and for the occult significance of life, but in your own case ,through the medium of the brain and of physical plane contacts, you must aim atbeing more at-one with your fellowmen. It is perhaps an increased facility inthe dual activity of the searchlight of the mind to which I refer. See that thetwo become the two beams of light with which you increasingly work and that theybalance each other. When they do, all glamour disappears.NOTE: P.G.C. is still one of the Tibetan’s trusted workers.~TO R. S. U.November 1931MY BROTHER:I have a word for you as you enter on a period of wide usefulness and increasedservice. You know well your weakness and your strength. There is little alongthese lines that I can tell you. Your failure is in application of knowledge tothe situation. So oft with aspirants, the main weakness lies in one particularbody and for you it is the disciplining of the physical body and an inability toapply your ideals to it at need. You treat it oft too well, and yet at times youalternate good treatment with periods when you treat your physical elementalwith undue harshness. If you can bring about an evenness of treatment and abalanced method in your handling of your physical problem, much light andknowledge will pour through your brain consciousness. It lies in your hands andthere is little that I can do. You are primarily along the occult line. You workwith energy and, actually and mentally, you are fairly well controlled andcoordinated. You need to work with the physical body and use it in the work youhave to do and right there is where hindrance creeps in. You have richopportunity ahead [356] of you and have earned it. Be not sidetracked butcultivate that one-pointedness which is one of your most vital assets.One thing I would like to point out: In your breathing exercises which I notedas you worked this week, the lung and the inflation aspect is unduly emphasisedand there is too much effort in what you do. The power and subtlety of thepranayama process lies in the potency of the thought behind the act of breathingand not at all really in the inflation and deflation of the torso. The wholething is summed up in the aphorism, “Energy follows thought.” The main effectshould be upon the etheric nadis which underlie the nerves, and not upon thebellows-like activity of the lungs. You are not getting the results which youshould.... Your work lies largely with individuals and with the task of bringingsolutions into life problems; you have the gift of strength to offer to othersand the experience gained through many lives. This work can be increased if youdeal with firmness, humour and perseverance with the vehicle which hinders you.~MY BROTHER: June 1933You have trodden the upward Way with greater speed of late. Your horizon is,therefore, wider and your outlook much more impersonal. Keep steadily on themove and let not inertia drag you down and set weights upon your feet. The workto be done is steadily increasing, brother of old, and you are needed in thatwork and needed more dynamically than heretofore. Grasp that idea and standsteadily with me in the work I seek to do. Be ready to give of your wisdom andpower to unfold and teach when the need arises. . . .In your early work in meditation you were told to sound the Sacred Word seventimes consecutively. I wish you to take up now a sevenfold work upon the centresbecause some synthetic work will be helpful to you. I will not here outline itin detail as it is planned for individual need and is better not committed towriting for all to read. You will receive the needed instructions directly.Follow them with care and watch for the vitalisation of the physical body as aconsequence, and be ready for increased service as time elapses.[357] The gift of wise teaching is your gift to my group—a wisdom, divorced fromcriticism, coupled also to the reticence of the trained occultist. This gift youand F.C.D. have in great degree. Give of your wisdom, brother of old, wisely andstrongly and without fear. I indicate to many of my disciples their specificgift to the group with which I have affiliated them in order that, withdeliberation and knowledge, they may constantly give along the indicated linesand thus contribute to the group life. There is the gift of being these embodiedqualities. There is also the gift of realising that because one does embody somedivine attribute in some measure—large or small—one can act as a channel for itstransmission from the greater centre. This is the basis of the doctrine ofAvatars or Divine Messengers. The gift of Being and the gift of deliberateTransmission of qualified powers must be better understood.I have only a brief mantric sentence for you; it has the significance of adedication:“I plunge myself into the pool of wisdom. From thence I come, bearing aknowledge of its mysteries for my fellowmen.”Seek during the next few months to understand not only the way a disciple mustproceed, but seek to enter more deeply into the technique of understanding yourbrother’s heart by a study of the duality of ray energies (personality and soulrays) which make him what he is in this incarnation.~BROTHER OF OLD: June 1934The past six months have seen you making much effort and the work of refiningthe vehicles is proceeding apace. You have still several more months ofstrenuous work before the personality can measure up to the demands ahead butyour devotion and humility, your clear vision and your wisdom are such that youcan be depended upon to make the grade.There are two points of incipient glamour—faintly misty traces—which must bewatched with care lest they form a thickening cloud between you and the sun. Ispecify them not lest [358] in so doing I precipitate the cloud. Glamour is notdispelled by paying close attention to it. It disappears by the power of clearand steadfast meditation and the freeing of oneself from self attention. Can yougrasp the significance of that paradoxical phrase? I but indicate a vague miragewhich need never cause you trouble, provided you seek not self recognition, andthat you love with pure purpose all those you meet.During the next six months, your meditation work and the focus of your attentionmust be the stepping up of your awareness of the soul. You have an interestingand rather unusual problem; this is based on the fact that your consciousnessshifts all the time from the lower to the higher mind, but often fails to touchthe intermediate point, that of the soul on its own particular level. It is likethis, my brother:[Image00005.jpg]In the building of the antahkarana (at this stage) there is a gap in the bridgewhere the soul is and you jump from the lower to the higher Triad. This means abridging from the highest point of the lower triad to the lowest point of thehigher, the Spiritual Triad. Therefore, for you, there must be careful exercisein an elementary stage—the alignment of the soul and brain, via the mind. Workat that for a while with understanding, prior to doing your morning meditation.Make your meditation brief and quick. You have a habit of keeping the three“sacred points”—morning, noon and sunset. I am going to suggest that at thoseinterludes in the day’s activities you change your method considerably. Isuggest that you work with colour more than with forms of words, such as seedthoughts, or with ideas. You are a natural occultist and have the key to therealm of ideas and the words of many books are in your mind. I would, therefore,suggest the following process:1. Sound the O.M.2. After you have worked for a few minutes at right alignment then: [359]a. At your morning meditation visualise a deep rose-coloured lotus. Build itwith care and from its opening heart see a stream of rosy light (not red)pouring forth, engulfing you and your co-disciples.b. At your noon meditation repeat the same symbolic work but this time with ayellow lotus.c. At sunset again repeat the process only this time your lotus is of a deepelectric blue with its heart a golden sun.3. Use then the mantric sentence which I gave you in my last communication,pondering upon its meaning.4. Proceed with your usual linking up with those you ever remember in yourmeditation, giving them strength and light and knowing yourself to be anintermediary.5. Close with the invocation which you know and love so well:“May the Holy Ones Whose disciple I am show me the light I seek; give me thestrong aid of Their compassion and Their wisdom. There is a peace which passethunderstanding; it abides in the hearts of those who live in the Eternal. Thereis a power which maketh all things new; it lives and moves in those who know theSelf as one. May that peace brood over us, that power uplift us till we standwhere the One Initiator is invoked, till we see His star shine forth.”6. Sound the O.M.I particularly ask you to make your spiritual diary a more vital, more organisedand more easily available document for the teaching of others. You have in itmuch of interest. It is, however, somewhat chaotic and the ideas in it are noteasily understandable. Will you make it more sequential, synthetic and readableso that the arranged and presented ideas can be of service to other students?You have much to convey of occult knowledge and when you learn to write yourknowledge, then your real service will begin to emerge. . . . Present what youhave to offer; this can be much when you have learned with wisdom to externaliseyour knowledge.~[360] BROTHER OF MINE: January 1935There is entering into your life a little discouragement, a faint inner disgustwith yourself and a sense of failure which—if persisted in—may damage thebeautiful thing you are building. Such thoughts are not constructive in theireffect. In what does this discouragement arise?It is to be found in your realisation that your inner knowledge far outstripsyour outer usefulness. It grows out of your intelligent awareness that the innerworlds hold for you much of interest which you never bring through for use onthe physical plane. This is so. You are a deeply versed occult student and yourgrasp of the inner occult realities far outstrips that of the average student.But it is all introverted; it does not emerge for the helping of the world; itis accumulating and piling up within you and, unless you make some definite useof it, you may bring about a condition which it will be difficult later tochange. What causes this condition, my brother?Three things which I, with frankness, will put before you because you can betrusted to take with gratitude anything that may be said. The test for you comesin the use you make of the information which I give you as with other knowledgesyou acquire.1. Your inner sense of inferiority (a racial inheritance) is a definitehandicap. In your executive life in a great city, this inferiority complex isnegated a great deal because you see the fruits of your labour; but in thesensitive life of the inner planes, you succumb to it constantly; so great andso rapid is your reaction to the truth and to the inner realities that youpromptly absorb much more than you can use. You are rendered almost dizzy by theradiant kaleidoscope of truth which you sense and contact.2. You are handicapped by your physical body. You have inherited (for thefulfilment of karmic responsibilities) a not particularly high grade body ofSlavic-Semitic type with a touch of the Latin intermixed. That heritage givesyou your steadfastness and your persistence upon the Way; it gives you yoursensitivity to things of the mystical realm; it gives you also your love ofbeauty and your heart development. It has revealed [361] to you a little of themystery of pain and of suffering. But it has also given you a physical bodywhich has inherited the power to resist and the capacity to shut off the outerfrom the inner worlds of expression. Besides this, it has endowed you with abody of somewhat heavy and inert atoms which cannot be galvanised into theexquisite activity of which you dream except by tremendous effort and aself-imposed discipline of a drastic nature. Hence your soul’s choice of yourpersonality job—one that embodies service, that appeals to the heart and whichat the same time is of so necessary a nature that it perforce calls forth yourbest effort.3. The third cause of trouble is found in the fact that you are not making outerconstructive use of the knowledge which you acquire in meditation, through widereading and through your constant, interior thinking.My attention has been called to your meditation reports. My brother, you touchand tap constantly the fount of wisdom. Your intuition is awake; your power tointerpret symbols is unusual; your grasp of the synthetic plan of the GreatWhite Lodge is real. But of what use is it to anyone? You are like a reservoirwhich is too full and from which there is not enough withdrawn to meet the needof the surrounding thirsty country. All flows over the spillway and is wasted.This must be rectified, my brother. One of the first things we must do is toemploy the knowledge and the occult information which is stored up in yoursub-conscious mind and which finds expression only in your spiritual diary andyour meditation reports. I refer not here to the daily life to be lived. I referto the intelligent appreciation of truth which is yours, to the wealth of youroccult information which is being wasted and causing conditions which will leadto eventual astral trouble. You do endeavour to live the life and to serve but Iseek to see that service fed by your occult knowledge and by your head and notjust by your heart. It is essential that we tap the reservoir and make your lifefruitful as an esotericist. . . . What therefore, shall we do?First, instead of constant meditation, you must employ the time so given to theenlarging upon and the writing out of the ideas which have come to you so thatthey can be used by [362] others and can reach those who need help.... Expressedsymbolically, what I have to say to you can be embodied in the words of anancient Book of Rules for disciples which was extant at the time of the firstPatanjali:“The door opens into the world of that which can be known. It opens from theside of mind. Once open, there enters into thought the dropping rain of thatwhich can be known. The other door opens through deep desire. It opens into theworld which is that which all men know. When both the doors stand open wide, thedisciple serves the purpose of the Lord of Truth. The rain drops on his heartfrom out the farthest door. He pours the rain of that which can be known intothe world of that which all men know. Thus new thoughts can be carried into thehearts of men. Thus new flowers of ideas bring beauty to the dusty plains ofearth.”In peace and understanding go your way to the Feet of the Great Ones.~BROTHER OF OLD: July 1935. . . Last time I communicated with you I gave you much. This time I need togive you but a little as you have yet to work out that which I have suggested.Above everything else aim at simplicity. The fertility of your mind is a greatand useful gift, acquired through many lives of achieved knowledge. But afertile garden and a rank wilderness are both of them expressions of fertility,but the one is beautiful and the other needs attention—an attention which has tobe initiated by a definite process of destruction.You have been used in the past months to institute a work which can be of realservice and you have done well and have made possible future revelation. That isgood and for that I thank you, my brother. I know that you do not ask forrecognition but that is ever accorded by us, the teachers on the inner side,when duly merited. I can, therefore, tell you that your work is recognised.[363] But you have much to do within yourself before you can be used as fully asis possible. See that you, therefore, do three things:1. Lose sight of yourself. Your constant inner habit of self-depreciationindicates too much concentration upon the little self. You are handicapping yourwork and negating a fuller influence by seeing yourself as a failure and yet atthe same time omitting to take those steps which would make you a truesuccess—steps which I have earlier indicated to you. For a time, my brother,lose sight of the time process as a whole and for three months work only one dayat a time, making each hour of each day as beautiful and as selfless aspossible.2. The wisdom aspect in you is highly developed. Let the love aspect of thesecond ray now have fuller sway . You and F.C.D. have to reverse your lifetendencies. He has a highly developed love nature and must learn to expresswisdom more effectively. You have wisdom manifesting strongly and must learn tolove more widely and not to fear love, as now you do. Your work as an executivehas drawn forth your latent wisdom. Your work in my group and in the New Groupof World Servers must now draw forth the deep resources of your heart. Ponder onthis suggestion.3. Give more definite help in the work. . . . You can give that which is needed,if you lose sight of yourself and can teach yourself to work with joyousness. Isnot that the clue for you, my brother, the work of joyous service? May I ask youto cultivate the spirit of joy? If you give this more definite aid and work asit may be indicated to you, it will spell for you a large measure of release.You can aid in the work with your wisdom and ripe experience.Adhere to the simple outline indicated by me in my previous communication. Icannot change it yet, for you have not yet availed yourself of the help I theresought to give to you. But be of good cheer and go forward with joy upon theWay. There is no time these fateful days for that lost effort which is connotedby too close a self-introspection and analysis, leading to distrust. [364]~January 1936The only thing which I seek to do for you at this time, my brother, is to giveyou a meditation which I will ask you to carry forward until further notice. Iwill give you also six seed thoughts for meditation. Otherwise my earlierinjunctions to you hold good and your future usefulness in the coming spiritualexpansion is dependent upon your careful attention to self-forgetfulness, theright use of love (enabling you to love more easily. Please study my lastcommunication to you on this subject) and attention to practical, loving,efficient, regular service.Your progress in the outer expression of your inner knowledge has beenneedlessly slow. Given a right and more focussed attitude, you could leapforward into clearer light and more efficient living. This oft I have told you.Your keynote for the future is discipline and again discipline. The reduction ofthe physical body to your will through the imposition of a pronounced orderedrhythm is your way out into liberation. It is, therefore, a question whether youcare enough for the results possible to make the needed adjustments and imposethe required disciplinary measures. What these are, you also know. Are they notsimply the enforcing of certain rules of daily living which are so simple thatthey fail to evoke your will? It is the evocation of a dynamic will which I wishto bring about by the following suggested meditation.1. After effective alignment and the centering of the consciousness in the mind,then proceed as indicated below:O.M.a. Sound this as the soul, in its own world, using the creative imagination asyou do so.b. Sound the O.M. again as the soul, imposing its purpose upon the mind.c. Sound the O.M. as the soul, controlling the desire body.d. Sound the O.M. as the soul, energising by its will force the etheric body.e. Sound the O.M. again but this time with the cooperation of the personality,galvanising the physical [365] body into right action. Do all this very slowlyand thoroughly with a full, consecrated thought upon each of the five stages.2. Then visualise the entire lower nature as being gathered up into theconsciousness of the soul.3. Then meditate for fifteen minutes (not more) upon the following six seedthoughts. This entire meditation is intended to be dynamic and brief. It can, ifso used, break through obstructions and “clear the way” for the inflow of yourdynamic but hitherto ineffective will.1st month—My soul has purpose, power and will. These three are needed on the Wayof Liberation .2nd month—My soul must foster love among the sons of men. This is its majorpurpose. I, therefore, will to love and tread the Way of Love.3rd month—The purpose of my soul must show itself through burning. That whichobstructs and hinders must disappear before the power of God. That power am I.I, therefore, tread the Way unto the Burning Ground. There hindrances disappear.4th month—My will is one with the great will of God. That will is mine todayupon the planes of earth. It leads to service and my Master’s group. I,therefore, tread the Way of Service after the festival of burning.5th month—I dedicate myself to the purpose of the plan. I have no purpose butthe will of God. I seek no other way but the Way of Divine Fulfilment . I losemyself within the group which seeks the furtherance of the plan.6th month—The Way of Sacrifice is eternally the Way of Joy . The Way of Joyleads to the Place of Peace. The peace of God is only [366] found in losingsight of self and seeing naught but that which must be done and done today.~MY BROTHER AND MY FRIEND: June 1936Much that I have written to S.C.P. is also of prime importance to you. I refernot to it here as I have other things about which I wish to speak to you. I urgeyou from my heart (which enfolds you in its constant love) to look away fromyourself and dwell not with such constancy upon your failures to achieve.Recognise failure—if it is there—but then with a face lifted to the light and asmile upon your lips, turn your back upon such failure and go with steadfastnessforward.D.A.O., a member of my group of disciples, learns not with ease the lesson ofself-discipline, and the glamour of the fear of authority has descended uponher. She has asked permission to leave my group and for some one else tofunction in her place. I am suggesting to her that she regard herself assuspended from her group endeavour and from my so-called control and take oneyear for careful thought, prior to taking a final decision. To prove to you thatyour failure is basically superficial I am asking you to do for me a definiteservice. I could not so ask you if you had failed. For the space of a year Iwould ask you to take over the work and place of D.A.O. in my group and so helppreserve the integrity of the group relationship. This is not the first timethat you have done this and hence my immediate thought of you. But thoughinstinctively my mind decided to ask this service of you, I have a twofoldreason. You have a surety of touch and a freedom from glamour which is sorelyneeded by the immediate associates of D.A.O. in my group. You succumb somewhatyourself to the glamour of failure but are seldom glamoured where the principlesof group work are concerned. I can trust you to give what is needed. Secondly,you have a clarity of vision which is true and constructive—in those cases whereyour personality love is not involved. Where it is involved, you are prone toover-estimate the loved ones and see too much for them. Is this not so, mybrother?[367] In this case however, your vision will be clear and true. So take theplace of D.A.O. and give of your best in the situation. But vacate not your ownplace in my group.D.A.O.’s concept of freedom—as is the case with all such concepts—can act as aprison. Her idea of liberty can be a chain, holding her down. This is the lessonshe must learn. Her service in my group comes second to her love of her ownprogress and this I shall have to point out to her. Disciples, working in anAshram, are none of them entirely free agents. Each is held by a soul link tohis co-disciples. Responsibility undertaken and karmic relationships recognisedcannot be lightly set aside and must ultimately be worked out. The discipline ofthe group life is a higher living discipline than any self-imposed ideas of lifeand truth. When a disciple sees and relates his individual dharma and his groupresponsibility—then he can take right action.Will you assist me in this problem? I know you will, my brother. And will youtake this as an evidence of my faith and trust in you and also as evidence ofthe needless astral anxiety under which you so constantly labour?One small personal task I ask of you also. Please go back over all theinstructions you have received from me and list the specific information I havegiven you anent your actions upon the physical plane. Then note what you havesucceeded in doing and what still remains to be done. This will help you torenew your efforts to master the physical body which is the vehicle which givesyou the most trouble and which can be brought to heel far more easily than theastral or mental bodies. Yet it is this body in this incarnation which gives youthe most difficulty. If you mastered it, your work would forge ahead.~BROTHER: January 1937I seek to start with a word of commendation to you. You have progressed thispast year and have passed out of a relatively static condition into one ofincreased sensitivity and growth. Having in the past pointed out to you yourfailures and having frequently had the need to analyse you to yourself in termsof [368] reproof, it fills me with joy to register in you growth and anincreasing ability to move forward. Let me tell you now that three years ago, Iviewed your condition with questioning as to whether or not you had reached yourhighest point of attainment for this life and would (for the remainder of youryears on earth) simply hold that which has been gained. No light achievement, mybrother, given the equipment with which you started upon the Path three livesago, but not indicating your highest possibility which is to be based upon thework done in your last life on earth. Go forward now to greater heights ofachievement in self-forgetfulness and in love, and become increasingly a towerof strength and a source of illumining wisdom to your co-disciples.I have for you two words. One of them is based upon the instructions which Ihave given you in the past and which I will summarise by saying: Submit yourphysical plane life to discipline, self-imposed; adhere to that discipline atall costs. You can outline that discipline adequately for yourself. There is noneed for me to do so.The second message I have is based upon a comment you yourself made to me thatyou have permitted your life to be ruled by expediency and habit but not byplan. I would ask you to ponder deeply upon that sentence, asking you to applyit and carry the concept to the higher life of service and not just to adisciplined life, ordered and ruled by your own imposed plan but to that serviceto which this group of disciples is pledged. This lifts the whole theme out ofthe realm of the personality life and will fill your thought life with thevastness of our plan.All of you know so much. Your theory is so good and sound. But your practiceshould begin to be commensurate with your theory if this group is to go forwardas desired into real world work. Let rapid adjustment take place and a freshdedication and re-alignment among all of you so that, hand in hand, shoulder toshoulder and with eyes fixed upon the same vision, you can face life and itsvicissitudes together and thus lighten each others’ way. This is not always thecase.Therefore, my brother, let the plan itself mould your life and its activitiesand let discipline produce the instrument [369] which is needed for the work tobe done. Groups of disciples today are being trained in telepathic work and arerendering telepathic service to the world—a tiny replica of the work which theHierarchy is ever doing with the minds of men. Thus, when you start to do this,you can work to change conditions and to affect certain lives. This work willnot be truly possible where criticism, self-pity or wrong speech exist, for oneperson could block the outflow of the group thought. Therefore, I am asking mygroup of disciples this year to prepare for expanding service and to brooddeeply upon the work of thought transmission in world service.The occult phrases which I have for your consideration are as follows:“The blueprint lay before the Master Workman and the plan, in all its detail,lay disclosed upon the Trestle Board. Within the Middle Chamber waited those whohad to build the Temple according to the plan laid down.“But the plan was not complete. Some knowledge of the ground plan upon which theTemple must be reared was lacking and he who sought it and he who had it werenot there. The Master Workman waited.“The one who sought the needed knowledge, who guided those who laid the groundfor later building, he slept and ate and played upon the outer plain. And yet atevery hour, his thought was focussed in the Middle Chamber of the waitingartisans and recollection came. His soul at moments hovered o’er the blueprintsin the Inner Room and looked the Master Workman in the face. And still theMaster waited. Then recollection came and active work.”~MY BROTHER: July 1937You have, as you have oft been told by me, only one major problem and that isconnected with your physical body. Let me indicate to you your ray forces andthen, I believe, increased light will be thrown upon your problem.Your mental body is a first ray one and this is what makes [370] you a realoccult student. Your soul’s contact is so definite and real that your mentalbody builds no barriers between the soul and your personality or between you andyour co-disciples. Mentally, you always understand and are inclusive. I do notmean theoretically but in fact. But your astral body is also upon the first raywhich is an unique occurrence and rarely to be found. It is here that the senseof separateness enters in, for that first ray tendency does to you two things:a. It feeds your sense of separativeness and thus tends to isolate you.b. It fosters your fear of attachment.Thus you are oft emotionally and astrally detached and isolated from those wholove you and from your fellowmen. Hence there is a continuing conflict betweenyour loving soul and your isolated, lonely, astral vehicle. The solution will beimmediately clear to you.Your physical body is on the seventh ray. Ponder, therefore, the interiorrelations and the exterior effect of your ray forces as tabulated below:1. The soul ray—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.2. The personality ray—the third Ray of Active Intelligence.3. The ray of the mind—the first Ray of Power.4. The ray of the astral body—the first Ray of Power.5. The ray of the physical body—the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Order.You will note how much your soul has to do with the lines of energy which areall definitely related to the first ray: 1-3-7. You will consequently beencouraged also to note how much your life of love does control your work andservice. I am aware of it. Am I commending you or stimulating you, my brother?Perhaps both. Dwell much in thought upon these facts in the months which lieahead.~MY BROTHER OF OLD: January 1938What am I to say to you? If I remind you not that the need is for you to submityour lower nature to discipline, you would [371] have for me no respect for Iwould not be a true friend and teacher. If I remind you of this need I then butincrease your responsibility which is not the act of a true friend and teacher.Disciples come definitely into the aura of the Hierarchy. You are a disciple.Disciples evoke from us who are the teachers upon the inner side of life manyand diverse reactions. We look at some of you and feel that much time mustelapse before we can fully trust you with our confidence; integration, wisdomand soul contact must first be induced. Others emerge into the hierarchicalLight and we know—as we study them—that though there is contact and knowledgethere is also ambition, violence and selfishness and that these qualities mustbe offset and subdued before there can be freedom of action, both on our partand on theirs. Others again are lovely in themselves with a high and sweetvibration but they are weak and full of fear, sorrowful or weighed down withcare; they have to be taught the way of strength and of divine carelessnessbefore their service can measure up to demand. Others again come into our sphereof influence who are integrated, wise, trustworthy and with far more than theaverage capacity to serve and to prove useful. Their power to live, to influenceand to serve is very great. Yet in some one part of their nature there isweakness and their expression is limited. That weakness could be so easilyoffset, given sufficient illumined desire and spiritual will (qualities presentbut unused). Such a disciple are you, my brother and my comrade of longstanding. Your major hindrance is in your physical body which refuses disciplineand hitherto has bested all your efforts. This you know and to this you referwith a sense of blinding failure. How can I help you, therefore, when you knowthe causes of hindrance, the obstacles to wider influence and the nature of theproblem which you have to solve?There is nothing that I can do beyond telling you that once you have broughtyour physical nature into line with the demand of your soul, that you have farmore to give than the average disciple. You have wisdom and much experience,individual and racial. You have a deep love, of which you are afraid and,therefore, fail to express as you might and which your executive work hascramped and hindered. You have [372] seasoned occult understanding which can domuch for others. You have a magnetic radiance. But there is ever a point beyondwhich you seem unable to go—a point at which the physical body intervenes andrefuses to become a clear channel for the expression of the inner beauty andradiance.Having pointed this out, having begged you to bring this aspect of yourself intoline with spiritual demand and having indicated the wider field of service whichcould open up before you, I have to leave you to succeed in the task or torefuse to undertake it as seems to you best. Perhaps later, I shall see apronounced change—full alignment and heightened radiance.I would ask you to take much time each Sunday (for an hour at least) in theattempt to contact my aura and, through that, the aura of the Hierarchy. Theresults of this effort should be vital to you and of importance in handling yourproblem. I leave you with the last words of the occult phrases I gave you a yearago:“Then recollection came and active work.”I trust that soon that will be the statement which I shall be enabled to makeanent you and not the usual earlier one, “and still the Master Workman waited.”~MY BROTHER AND MY FRIEND: January 1939What can I say that I have not already said? I can remind you of the interestingfact that every one of the forces of your personality is on the first great lineof power, of isolation and of separativeness. The only second ray influencethrough which love can come is your soul and the implications of this you areapt to misunderstand. Therefore, your life of love is dependent upon the extentof your soul contact and that contact must be kept living and vital or else yourpersonality idea, your desire to hold people away from you, your sense ofisolation and of pride will dominate. The difficulty is enhanced for you owingto the fact that the ray which governs your race is the third ray and that alsogoverns your personality far more [373] strongly than you realise. Therefore theage-old separativeness of your racial background will increase your sense ofwithdrawing from all personality contacts. It will place the glamour before youreyes that the only contacts possible for you are those reached via the soul. Ifthat were truly so, my brother, why be in a physical body at all, why be in agroup of disciples, why be so much loved by those around you? Your co-discipleslove you and give you, as much as they can, the love of their souls. Those whoare near you on the physical plane give you also personality love and devotion.The first you accept with pride and understanding; the second you reject withpride and no understanding.Before you can claim the full prerogatives of an accepted disciple (which youare) you must penetrate behind the screen or the shutter of your personality andbecome aware of the violence of your true feeling on the question of racialdifferences, of social standing, of class distinctions and of personalityaffections. There is in you what amounts almost to an inhibited hatred. It ispartly racial, partly European, and partly a totally unnecessary sense of socialand personal inferiority. You assure yourself that it is not there. You refuseto recognise it with great deliberation. You say to yourself: I am all love andunderstanding because I am a soul. And you very frequently are a soul and yourinfluence is soul influence. But behind all this lies a blind spot. It is a“sticking your head into the sand” type of glamour, and a refusal to registeryour personality limitations along this line. You, with your wisdom and soulcontact, could most easily handle this, if you so desired.I am speaking to you thus frankly, my brother, because I have confidence in youand I know that you have confidence in me. I have confidence also in the love ofyour group brothers for you.Your problem must be approached differently to that of your co-disciples. It ismuch more difficult, owing to the unusual fact that your astral body is on thefirst ray. Your personality ray, the third, is focussed in your astral body,adding to its power, its glamour, and its hold on you. Your problem is to callin the energy of the soul in such potency that it [374] will drive out the firstray force and leave you, at the close of this incarnation, with a second rayastral body.The meditation I would give you is based on the words “as a man thinketh in hisheart, so is he.” I would have you, therefore, think out with care thedifferences that would appear in your personality expression if you had a secondray astral body. I will also set you the task of writing out for me , mybrother, a paper in which you will emphasise the characteristics of a second rayastral body. You will then endeavour each day to build in these second rayqualities. They are built in through the second ray methods of love, contact,attraction, understanding, sympathy and compassion. The latter two qualities arealmost totally lacking in your equipment and your career as an executivedirector has necessarily enhanced this defect. I would remind you that I did notsay that you lacked love. You used, in the past, to supplement this defect by anintuitive appreciation of people but lately you have hardened in onedirection—that of sympathy—and crystallised into a racial pattern which is notyours; it is based on the development of the heart centre which has, as yet,only opened in the direction of your own people and towards Masonry.Will you give ten minutes each morning to the exercise which I here outline....Then seek brain-mind alignment with the soul and see the love of your soulpouring into your personality, transmuting its force and working through on tothe physical plane. It will express itself as personality love, actuated anddirected by soul love. Can you see the picture, my brother, as I see it? Perfectlove casteth out fear. Your personality is not on the line of love but of power.It fears love and the expression of love. In this statement I have given you aslant on your soul problem.Your co-disciples love and will love you increasingly. At present, you do notlet them love you and you misunderstand and misinterpret them. Where there islittle real love, there is little true comprehension. When you function as asoul, you love much and quite impersonally. You are not yet a Master, however,and so able to give impersonal love without hurting. Therefore, there is needfor you to love personally also. I will [375] aid you where I can and I give youmy personal love—my impersonal love has always been yours.NOTE: Nothing has stopped this disciple from active cooperation with the Tibetanand with the group of His disciples.~TO W. D. S.November 1937What shall I say to you, my brother and my friend, that will do for you twothings: First of all, give you confidence in the rightness of your choice of afield of service, and, secondly, strengthen your will so that you can stand as atower of strength to others? Are these not the two things which you desire andwhich constitute your aim, and do you not require assurance on these points, oris it re-assurance?Go forward, my brother, looking not behind but with your eyes fixed insteadfastness upon the Way of a world Server. It is a hard way, with many upsand downs, and many steep hills and valleys of shadow, but there is rest andshade in the valley and sunshine on the hills. These difficulties your Masterknows, for He, too, has found the way hard, when He travelled it. In speakingthus, I refer not to myself; I am only your teacher and your friend.Your life lesson is detachment, and—in order to practise detachment as adisciple should—you need to strengthen your will to be . This I think you know.You are a second ray soul in a first ray personality sheath or vehicle. Youreffort this life has ever been to love, to serve and to understand; this hasbeen the outstanding gesture of your soul this incarnation. Now must come theeffort of your personality will towards directed orientation. The divine aspectof your personality this life and the major integrating factor is your will.Self-will you have negated, through love. This you have achieved, and it is wellto recognise it. But the integrating will of the personality, subordinated tothe will of the soul, must be developed and used with due detachment. In thesefew words I state your immediate problem. Ponder upon them, for in theirunderstanding [376] will come increased capacity to serve. This capacity I knowthat you seek, and the door of service stands wide open and you are needed whereyou stand.Strength to stand; strength to love; strength to be detached—these are andshould be your objectives. For you, in this connection, it is the evocation ofthe spiritual will (as it is applied to the personality and its problems and asit acts as the directing agency in the brain) which must be your immediateobjective.To this end, I suggest that you preface the group meditation which I am askingall of you to do with the following brief exercise:1. Take six long breaths, slowly and without effort, or any inflation of theabdomen. After the last breath say, with thought and consciousness alert: I aman expression of the Will of God. That Will directs my thoughts and guides me inthe purposes of my soul. To that Will I hold.Interlude of Exhalation.2. Take six more long breaths in a similar manner and then say: Let this divineintelligent Will govern my heart, and lead me in the Way of Love. In this Way Iwill to go.Interlude of Exhalation.3. Again take six long breaths and then say: Let this divine intelligent lovingWill direct my brain and service on the outer plane of Life. With my Will, Iwill to serve.Interlude of Exhalation.Will you also take six seed thoughts out of any book you care to choose andwrite down these six seed thoughts—one for each month? Take one, therefore, eachmonth for careful reflection during the day, as you proceed upon your lifeservice. At the end of each month send in the thought on which you have beenpondering, with the gist of your reflection, for the helping of your groupbrothers.You will note from the above that I am endeavouring to prepare you, as well asthe other newly chosen group members, for quick participation in the group work.~[377] MY BROTHER AND MY FRIEND: April 1938You are entering—if you so choose—upon an extended period of service. Thequestions before you are: Will you serve as and how service is needed? Or willyou serve as you believe you can and should? These questions are basic and canonly be answered aright by your endeavouring anew to grasp the vision as a whole. I refer not here only to the vision of the many groups, serving in the worldtoday and fulfilling their rightful function. That, they can and will do. But Irefer to the vision of the Plan as it exists in the consciousness of the NewGroup of World Servers. It is interesting for you to realise that the Planexists in four states of consciousness:1. As it is visioned and known by the Members of the Hierarchy, such as theaccepted disciples of the world.2. As it exists in the consciousness of the members of the New Group of WorldServers, stepped down into their minds and desires.3. As it exists in the consciousness of the men of goodwill.4. As its faint outlines are found in the minds of the average intelligentGod-accepting men of the world at this time.I would like to emphasise to you the necessity for your definitely grasping thePlan as the New Group of World Servers grasp it, pondering on it and identifyingyourself with it. At present, you grasp the Plan as the men of goodwill graspit: your grasp is not that of the New Group of World Servers who see the groupas an emanating point; the man of goodwill sees himself as the emanating point.Between these two positions there is a vast difference—the difference between acentralised consciousness and a decentralised consciousness. The efficacy andthe efficiency of all your future service depends upon your understanding thisdistinction, for it is vital and real.Much of your present difficulty is based on the fact that your personality rayis, as you know, that of the first Ray of Will or Power. This gives you a senseof centralisation, of uniqueness and aloneness. It makes the man who isconditioned by it “isolated.” It makes his attitude to his work one of anunconscious separativeness. It is the line of least resistance [378] for you tobe separated off from your co-workers or—when urged to identification by yoursecond ray soul—the response is one of going out to them with the innerdistinction ever clearly held. I am not here referring to any pride, brother ofmine, but to the absorbing, assimilating, isolating characteristics of the firstray nature. It is the great first ray Lord (to use an illuminating simile) Who,at the end of the age, absorbs all things into Himself and thereby brings aboutthe final and needed destruction of the form nature. This is a right and gooduse of His first ray qualities. But first ray personalities can also do thistype of work, that of absorbing, but this time with destructive results; intheir case the task is unnecessary and wrong.I call you to a careful supervision of your first ray personality and to agreater demonstration of your second ray, inclusive, loving soul. Ponder onthis, for a successful understanding and a consequent application of my wordswill greatly facilitate your usefulness and your power to bring a response oflove and cooperation from your co-workers which at present could be decidedlybetter than it is. You do not mind my frank speaking, do you, my brother? I dealthus with all my trusted disciples, of whom you are one.It will be of use to you if I also indicate to you the rays of your personalityvehicles; then you will have a complete picture of the forces with which youhave to work; or should I say with which I have to work as I seek, through you,to work out certain aspects of the Plan?Your mental body is not on one of the usual rays, but is strongly second ray inits nature, and is, therefore, responsive to your second ray soul force. This isan asset but also a liability, for the sharpening of the mind which is theresult of the effect of the usual fourth or fifth ray forces (the usual effects)is lacking. There is a lack of precision, of clear cut decision in you.Theoretically, my brother, this condition leads you—again theoretically—to betoo nice, too kind, too appreciative, but not in reality. Fortunately (thoughunfortunately at times) this is offset by your first ray personality which nipsyour second ray mental reactions in the bud and re-asserts isolation forinclusiveness and understanding. Yet, if you once [379] grasp the implicationsof this first ray personality and the difficulties engendered thereby in yourgroup relations, you can most easily put the matter straight, for your secondray soul can come in, in full tide, via your second ray mental body. Your taskis not, therefore, difficult and you have no cause for discouragement.Your astral body is on the first ray and again (as do many aspirants nearing theend of the Path of Probation or at the beginning of the Path of Discipleship)you follow not the normal procedure but complicate your problem by having apowerful astral body on the same ray as the personality. Being where you are,however, upon the Path, your soul planned this procedure in this manner so as tobring to the surface as many of the hindering qualities as possible—hindering, Imean, to group effectiveness and group cohesion.If I were asked what, at this time, constitutes your major group problem, Iwould phrase it thus: Learn to work with your equals as harmoniously andselflessly as you can. In your own department you do work this way with thosewho are subordinate or inferior to you in development. You, my brother, areafraid of your equals. You want to be the one alone as your first ray powerfulpersonality (focussed naturally in your first ray astral body) would normallyincline you. It is not easy for you to be one among the many—all equal, allworking as one, all engrossed with the one work. This you must learn to do, orelse you hinder the group.Your physical body is on the third Ray of Active Intelligence. This was thefactor which brought you originally into the business field and has, therefore,inclined you to field work, and organisation work. You will, from all the above,notice the lack of balance in your rays:1. The soul ray—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.2. The personality ray—the first Ray of Will or Power.3. The ray of the mind—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.4. The ray of the astral body—the first Ray of Will or Power.5. The ray of the physical body—the third Ray of Active Intelligence.You would profit much if you studied carefully the rays [380] which are, at thistime, lacking in your equipment. The forces of the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th rays arenot present. All your rays are major rays of aspect. The rays of attribute arelacking and hence your problem and your immense opportunity. What saves thesituation for you is that in a previous life, you worked through a fourth raypersonality. Harmony through Conflict is, with you, a deep-seated desire and abasic determination. You have inherited it and in it your present life isrooted.One of the best ways in which you can learn to solve your problem is to trainyourself to be—as are all true hierarchical workers—the one in the background,and not the one at the centre. You will still be the one, for you are still apersonality, but you can learn to work silently and through love, and carry allforward from the background. You will then gradually become a hidden force,galvanising others into activity and pushing them forward in their work,offering them their needed opportunity and training, but in completeself-forgetfulness.To aid you and in order to evoke your second ray quality of soul and mind, Iwould suggest the following meditation. This should be run through rapidly anddynamically, prior to the group meditation.... Assume always the position of the“one behind the scenes” and say dynamically and with due intent:“I am the one who never stands alone. Those days of isolation lie behind. Istand alone when trial comes, for I am strong and need not drain the strength ofothers. I stand alone when blame descends, for I am true and know what I shoulddo. I thereby shield the weak and leave them free. But in this work, I have noself but am the Self—the Self which knows itself to be the Self in all. And thusI do my work—alone, yet not alone, and thus—for aye—I stand.”Then proceed with the group meditation. Forget not also that I have given youdetachment for one of your keynotes. Ponder more deeply upon its meaning. Thefuture holds much of opportunity and of service for you, for the group, for yourchosen co-workers. It holds no scope for service for any isolated person.Together must the work be done.~[381] BROTHER OF OLD: December 1938I gave you a long instruction the last time I communicated with you. This,therefore, will be brief. I will not change your special meditation at this timeand would ask you to continue with it. It has done much for you, and through theinterior work which you have accomplished in yourself and through the process ofdefinitely forcing yourself to serve where needed (and not so much from theangle of where you yourself wanted to serve), you have aided many and gainedmuch strength yourself. The great need for all of you in this group at this timeis consciously to relate yourselves to each other in an increasingly closeunion. The building of the group antahkarana as a part of a great life threadcan only thus be carried forward effectively. See, therefore, that this groupidentification goes on with all the cooperation which you can render.I think also that you will have grasped more clearly than ever before thereasons I had in mind when I gave you the three key words—will, detachment, andstrength. You needed to have these objectives held before you, did you not?Today, your detachment is far greater than ever before and this definitely tendsto strengthen you. Your will nature, however, needs to be more pragmaticallydeveloped but from the angle of those interior determinations which carry a manforward along the path towards the portal of initiation. It is not will from theangle of self-assertiveness.No man takes initiation before his interior will is developed and consecrated tothe service of the Path, which is the service of humanity and of the Hierarchy.This, I think, you know. I would ask you to work along the line of the will,potently and definitely for a while, as it will serve to round out andstrengthen your character.I have for you at this time nothing but encouragement and a word of praise for alife faced and handled with humility and love.~[382] MY BROTHER: January 1940A kind heart is of potent use in our service, provided that it is kept in placeby a wise head and does not assume the form of a glamour. That then makes it adefinite and hindering weakness. We need today disciples who are capable ofseeing people truly; able to see them as they are and yet to love them and servethem just the same; we look for disciples whose hearts are awakened to groupusefulness and to the place an individual mind can play in the service ofhumanity, and whose radiation is love but whose head is equally responsive tothe individual as he is at his particular point in the evolutionary process.When the radiation is the radiation of love, the resultant words and actions canbe stern without hurting. That is pre-eminently a lesson which you need tolearn. Your need is also to awaken to the fact that it is one of service; thosewho represent us are alive and active in the work to be done but are notinterested in personality modes of reaction. A loving radiation and anintelligent assessment (or do I mean appraisement, brother of mine?) of thoseyou seek to aid will render you more effective in service to your fellowmen thananything else. I would, however, here commend you for the stability you areendeavouring to preserve. You are evidencing a purpose which the past two yearshave enabled you to make objective.NOTE: W.D.S. takes his work in this group most seriously and no matter whatobstacles present themselves, he continues to work in the Tibetan’s group.~TO D. P. R.January 1933BROTHER OF MINE:For years you have been working with steadfastness and with a certain amount ofebb and flow. When an aspirant for discipleship has worked with persistency foryears, his life tendency becomes oriented towards the light and this becomes asteady and fixed habit. This fact should prove a solace in [383] moments ofdiscouragement that all aspirants at times experience.It is because of this steadfastness that it now becomes possible to train yourintuition so that when again your path is trodden in a return incarnation, yourearthly life will start with that aligned attitude which will permit of earlyillumination.You are experienced in the Way and even though your physical body is no longeryoung, the remainder of your life expression holds much for you, if the comingyears are taken joyously and with high expectancy.You have sought with diligence to follow my directions and I think you realisethat much has been achieved. You have a greater clarity of insight (a thing youneeded) and a freer and more rapid detachment. Much remains, however, to be done(and this again you know). Follow the instructions given to you earlier, butwhen you retire to your room at the stated intervals to carry forward your tenminutes’ relaxation and thoughts on life and love, begin with the followingexercise. . . .~BROTHER OF MINE:July 1933Forget not to love with detachment. That is your main lesson, my brother, andyou have only grasped its true importance when the lengthier part of life hasgone. The ties through attachment over many years hold firm and on the physicalplane they must not, may not, be severed but ever within yourself they must becompletely snapped. This can be done before this life episode closes, leavingyou thus free in your next life cycle for service, a service to be rendered withundivided attention. This breaking can be done almost instantaneously if yourfirst ray soul power is brought into play, or it can be accomplished more slowlyif you work through the medium of your fifth ray personality force. Ponder onthis.As an exercise of needed discipline, I would suggest that three times aday—morning, high noon and evening—you sit quiet for ten minutes. Relaxphysically; permit no emotional distraction; refuse the entry of thought orfeeling. Ponder then [384] on the idea of Life and Love as they exist apart fromform. Keep the consciousness centred as high in the head as is possible.See the significance of all events and look upon them as symbolic indications ofspiritual, mental, or emotional causes. Your life is so full of detail and ofduty that the soul is oft irked thereby. Give it time to prove itself. It is notthe length of time that is given to the right accomplishment of these dutiesthat counts but the poise you bring to them, the energy you evoke in theirfulfilment and the intensity of your mental application.Let us, my brother, go forward on the Way. Let us together serve.~BROTHER OF OLD: January 1934Like other disciples and like all true aspirants, you have had much todiscipline you lately, and many opportunities have been offered to you whereinyou may demonstrate endurance. The particular group test has touched you not. Itdid not and would not constitute for you a test, but your test has been theholding of the attitude of steadfast endeavour in the face of circumstance, andof demonstrating not only endurance but loving detachment and joy. What happensto the personality is, in the last analysis, of small moment. The attitudeassumed towards all happenings and the methods employed in handling them is thatwhich is of moment. Skill in action is always needed, my brother, and for you inthis life it must ever be the demonstration of skill in emotional reaction, andnot so much the expression of efficient dealing upon the physical plane. Theachievement of physical efficiency is not for you a problem. The achievement ofemotional detachment and consequent right use of subjective force is still aproblem to you.There is no hurry or rush, my brother. Progress is being made and you will knowthe joy of eventual liberation from this limitation. One day at a time,perfectly lived, with each hour beautifully rounded out, is your soleresponsibility.Look not so much into the future with speculation or with [385] foreboding, noreven with hope, which is but a form of optimistic speculation. Live today asyour soul dictates and the future will round out itself in fruitful service. Youare stronger than you anticipate and have reserves upon which you can draw.These reserves will not fail you when you call upon them, nor will I, yourbrother and friend, nor will your group brothers. Forget not this, but relax andrest back on the strength which is in you and which surrounds you.I seek not to change your meditation, except to substitute a differentvisualisation exercise for the one now being followed.a. Visualise yourself as standing to one side of a vast field of closed lotusbuds which rest on their broad green leaves. Above you is the blue of heaven andahead of you—across the field of buds and leaves and on the far horizon—is agolden gate, with the two halves of its door closed.b. Then picture yourself as watching the slow opening of the buds, until littleby little, the field changes from green to gold, and all that can be seen is amass of golden flowers, wide open in the sun.c. Then imagine yourself, my brother, putting a foot upon the field and finding,instead of the mud and water which had been anticipated, a firm Path whichappears before you as you advance, dividing the field into two halves, andleading straight to the golden gates.d. As you advance along this path, imagine the two halves of the gate slowlyopening as you go forward in confidence, looking at the gate and not at yourfeet.What you see within that portal and what interpretation you give to thissymbolic work is for you to discover. You may ask: Of what use is thisparticular type of meditation to me? Two main uses, my brother. First, it trainsyou in the use of the creative imagination (which is an aspect of the intuition)and, secondly, it lifts you out of the rut of heavy mundane work with which youare of necessity so constantly occupied and brings to you refreshment andrealisation of the subjective world. Leave care and worry behind you as you walkthrough your [386] field of lotuses and for a few minutes each morning, centreyour consciousness outside your personality life. The effect upon your dailylife and service if you can really accomplish this exercise will be far morepotent than you can possibly anticipate.~BROTHER OF MINE: June 1934The buffeting of life has tried you in the past six months, and thereby you havegrown in understanding. For you, the intent of this buffeting process has notbeen to make you sweeter or more able to withstand. These are for you butsubsidiary effects. Your intended lesson is Detachment and, as you free yourselffrom the clinging chains of attachment to place or person, your intuitiveperception will thereby be released, and you will see in terms of reality andnot in terms of form—no matter how high or purified.You may perhaps ask in this connection: What is my main usefulness to this groupof disciples, should I gain this released perspective? You think ever in termsof service, my brother, which was one of the reasons (apart from karmicsuitability) prompting my choice of you for work in this group. My answer maysurprise you, for I give it in terms which are somewhat unusual. Your mainusefulness consists in the potency of your aura—that field of magnetic lifewhich surrounds everyone on all sides, and which in your case is of unusualextent. Little is known as yet anent the aura. I would define it simply as thesum total of the attractive forces in the field of individual activity. It isthrough the aura that an individual effect makes itself felt in a man’ssurroundings. My message, therefore, to you is to use your auric influence moreintelligently, to become more spiritually effective and less personallyattractive . I speak in symbols and ask for understanding. Ponder on this, mybrother, for your field of usefulness will grow as you detach yourself fromforms, no matter how dear or how ancient the rhythm by which they hold you.Turn, instead, outwards in the effort to aid your fellowmen. Aid people by usingwhat you are, which must express itself through the medium of the aura.[387] Preserve your meditation as hitherto, but change the colour of your fieldof lotuses from yellow to a deep and vibrant rose. This will serve to stimulatethe astral aura. This constitutes the third use or purpose of this meditation.The other two uses, I indicated in my last instruction.~BROTHER OF MINE: August 1934May I at this time indicate to you two things, my brother, knowing that, as anold and experienced aspirant, you seek ever to see life truly as it is?First, in each life there is reached what I might call a definite high watermark of achievement, and the age at which this is reached varies almostinfinitely. When it is reached, there is then a settled tendency towardscrystallisation, towards a recognition of the life’s thoughtform (this being thesum total of all the formulated ideas which have governed progress) and agradual slipping under the dominance of that thoughtform. This inhibits furtherprogress. When the high water mark is reached after the age of 55-70, thedifficulty is much increased by a perfectly normal physical inertia. So much ofthe life at that time is occupied with the processes of keeping in such physicalcondition that there may be the accomplishment of the needed duties of a fulllife. This high water mark has been reached for you in the ordinary sense andunder the law of normal development. It can constitute for you exactly what itis, and you need feel no shame over your accomplishment for it has been good.Your life purpose has been rightly oriented and in the next life you will reapthe results of your life-long discipline.But for you, as a soul and as a disciple under training, there need be noarresting of the process of development. The high water mark of your life cycle(in the broader and wider sense) will not be reached yet for many lives and,therefore, there need be for you no interlude of inertia and no demonstration ofa static condition. You may go on from point to point upon the Way, both now andhereafter. The decision and effort must come from you, my brother, and it liesentirely in your [388] hands. Go forward along the Way in the full vigour ofyour soul life, which is that of a mature and experienced aspirant. The power ofyour first ray soul can galvanise the personality into continued action andaspiration, into continued mental control; for you, therefore, there need be nocessation of activity and no settling back into inertia until the final activityof transition engrosses the dual attention of your soul and your personality,and the final detachment takes place. But to transcend the normal high watermark, there will be necessitated the imposition of that inner pressure whichwill refuse to let the tired body and mind rest back upon the past. There isneeded the incentive of a focussed will that plays its dynamic energy throughthe lower threefold man; there is required that purified, discriminative mindwhich (in the interests of the soul) will separate the essential from thenon-essential and so enable you to enrich your service through the wiseelimination of those factors which produce a useless dissipation of your energyand the use of your time for that which is negligible in results.I know you will realise the reason for my remarks and that you will face thisissue in the light of your soul and for the good of those who look to you forinspiration. As I told you earlier in your training, spiritual effectiveness isyour goal and towards this all your effort should be bent. This will not negatethe use of worldly wisdom and the right fulfilment of your many obligations, butit will aid you in the process of selection which is your main and self-chosentraining ground.I seek today to change your meditation work entirely. The focus given by thevisualisation work and exercise with colour and form has done much in the workof inner adjustment. I seek now to speed up the rhythm of your life so that afuller tide of will and purpose may dynamically pour through you.You may feel surprised at what I am setting you to do, and at my apparentomission to give you a set form at which to work. That I will do after youyourself have worked for a while at the problem.Much has for ages been said and written anent the practice of the Presence ofGod and today one of the interesting events of the time is the emergence ofvarious “techniques” for achieving [389] the realisation of this Presence, ofinspiration, of light and of contact.I will put to you three questions, and in their answering, we will findindication of the meditation to be given to you later.1. What do you understand by the thought of the Presence? Of Whom and what isthis Presence?2. What is it that prevents contact with that Presence and hinders you fromstanding in its light?3. Can you draw up a technique of meditation which will be for you the way intothe Presence?Answer these three questions and realise that for you the contact with thatPresence—consciously and with understanding of the process—is the goal for theremainder of your life experience in this particular body. I seek for nomystical understanding. That type of theoretical understanding is the heritageof most aspirants. They have the vision of this contact. I seek a definitecomprehension and I give you the clue to the work in the following sentenceswhich (if subjected to due thought) may induce revelation.“Duality is visioned by the seer. He sees the Presence. He sees, and seeingknows that he exists and likewise that which is seen.“The knower blends the two in one. He sees the Presence as himself. He mergeswith its light. Behind the Presence gleams that awful radiance which shrouds theOne and Only. Before the Presence stands the aspirant. Within the Presence,through the merging process, is peace, is union, the end of fear, the end ofdifference, joy, love and light.”Your meditation, therefore, is to be along these lines. The form you can draw upyourself during the next few months. The theme will emerge in your consciousnessif you move slowly, ponder deeply and feel no sense of pressure. Revelation willcome through quiet thought and daily brooding.May I close this message to you with the simple words: Please be happy, mybrother.~[390] MY BROTHER: February 1935There has been in your mind much thought in these past months anent the practiceof the Presence. This is well, for that is the objective that I had in mind foryou.It is said that “thoughts are things” and produce tangible results. It is alsosaid that “as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he” and that, therefore, thesetangible thought manifestations definitely produce effects in him. In theseancient platitudes lie, for you, much instruction, much light and understandingand the clue to your immediate problem. What is the situation, my brother? You,a soul in incarnation, are consciously aware of the fact—subjectively andofttimes dimly sensed—of your real Self, of the solar Angel, who is the Angel ofthe Presence. Your problem is to deepen this realisation, and to know yourselfto be the Angel, standing between you, the physical plane man, and the Presence.It might elucidate matters if we considered for a moment what reality isrepresented by that word Presence.The mystic is ever aware of duality; of the lower man and the indwelling soul;of the tired disciple and the Angel; of the little self and the real Self; ofhuman life expression and of spiritual life expression. Many other qualitiesstand for the same expression of reality. But, behind them all looms—immanent,stupendous, and glorious—that of which these dualities are but the aspects: thePresence, immanent yet transcendent, of Deity. In the nature of this One , alldualities are absorbed and all distinctions and differences lose their meaning.When you are told to develop the consciousness of the Presence, it indicates,first of all, that you are at this time somewhat aware of the Angel and can nowbegin to respond, dimly and faintly, to that great Whole which lies behind thesubjective world of being, as that world lies behind the physical, tangibleworld of everyday life.A symbol of this can be seen in the knowledge that the entire planet liesoutside of the room in which you are pondering my words and is only separatedfrom you by the window and the extent of your conscious awareness. The outeruniverse of the planet, the solar system and the starry heavens, lies revealed[391] to you through that sheet of glass which reveals, if clean and unveiled,but which acts as a barrier to vision, if soiled or hidden by a blind. This andyour ability to project yourself into the immensity of the universe, governs theextent of your knowledge at any given time. Think this out, my brother, and lookthrough the window of the mind to that Light which reveals the Angel which, inits turn, veils and hides the vast unknown, yet alive and vibrant, Deity.This practice of the Presence can be dealt with in so many different ways andthere are many techniques of contact. For you, the practice should connotesimplicity, peace, and joy. Cultivate simplicity of thought and remember thatbewilderment and undue concern as to conditions and people and a puzzledattitude towards life indicate mind activity but not soul understanding. It issoul activity towards which you should strive.You are a sannyasin and as such must work towards an increasing release fromties of any kind, though (and herein lies a subtle distinction) not from releasefrom environing conditions and responsibilities. What is required is an innerattitude of complete abandon to the will of your soul which is the Will of God,as far as any individual is concerned. This release will give you much that Ihave waited to see expressed in your life.To assist you in the continuance of the theme upon which you have been engagedin the past months, I am going to ask you to ponder over and answer thefollowing questions. You have a life tendency to over-emphasise detail andpoints of procedure with meticulous care and so sometimes lose sight of thesynthesis of the whole . The questions are:1. To recognise the Presence, I must stand free and unattached. To what and towhom am I now attached in such a way that I am prevented from clear vision andcloser approach?2. To recognise the Presence, I must function as the solar Angel. Can I, at thistime, discriminate between myself and that solar Angel?3. To recognise the Presence means that I am preparing to pass, as a solarAngel, through the gate, on to the Path of Initiation. Can I, in view of this,state clearly to [392] myself what are my major assets and my major weaknesses?4. Can I define clearly within myself what I understand bya. Myself, the disciple.b. Myself, the Angel.c. The Presence.The first three questions can be answered or not in writing exactly as youchoose; you may find them too personal and confidential to commit to writing. Ifyou find this to be so, then on the first day on which the Sun moves northward,answer these questions in my presence and to me, your brother and your teacher.Deal with them clearly and with truth, voicing your answers aloud so that youcan hear your voice, and thus pay adequate attention to your position andattitude. The fourth and fifth questions please answer in writing and elucidateas clearly as may be.5. Elucidate the following phrases, taken from a very ancient writing. I suggestthat you ponder them with care.“Before the throne of God, the angel, with all the other angels, stood andcried: ‘Lord of my life, grant me the strength to tread the path of revelation;to cross the sea of dark illusion, and face the lighted way of earth.’ God said:‘Go forth and far away.’“Before the gate which opens on the lighted way to peace, the angel stood aloneand said: ‘Lord of my life, the way of revelation is the way of manifested life:the path of dark illusion leads to the light which scatters every shadow. I seekto tread the lighted way which leads back to thy Presence. As yet that way isdark. What shall I do?’ God said, ‘Draw near and enter into thine own light, andin that light, see Light.’“Before the gateway of each newborn day, which holds within its sealed hoursordered responsibility, each morn I stand. I cry aloud: ‘Lord of my life, howcan I do the duty of this day yet seek detachment? Meet every need yet freemyself from ties and bonds?’ God said: ‘The sun draws near and vivifies theearth. Naught can [393] it take from out the earth. Live likewise. Give and asknaught!’”Brother of mine, gather around you afresh those who are seeking thus the lightedWay and learn to give them of your wisdom and to share with them that which youpossess. This is for you a duty in the coming months. This will not be easy foryou but will further the detaching process. Begin with those you have at handand those who know and love you and together set ajar the door to which seekersmay find their way and, through your rendered service, may find their way,perchance, to us.~MY BROTHER: February 1936You have had a year of strain and of much anxiety. But you have grown muchthereby and there is a greater measure of freedom to be seen in you subjectivelythan ever before. You are learning to detach yourself from people and from theclinging hands of those demanding presences who are to be found clamouring foryour attention in their lives. This freedom must increase as you endeavour tomeet perfectly the need of those around you, yet at the same time you must go onwith increasing power detaching yourself from their inner hold upon you. Theymust fail to reach you in the inner fortress of your soul. There you must learnto stand, detached and unafraid.I cannot too strongly urge this detachment on you and beg you to live henceforthmore bravely the life of the sannyasin. Two years ago I could not have spokenthus, for you would not have understood; but you have advanced far since thosedays, my brother, and are beginning to enter into the realm of freedom, e’enthough your freedom is as yet but relative and incomplete.I am now going to give you six themes for meditation during the next six months,gathered out of the paragraphs which I gave to you last time for yourconsideration. Let your meditation, therefore, follow the following lines.1st month—Why is strength needed to:a. Tread the Path of Revelation. [394]b. Cross the sea of dark illusion.c. Face the lighted way of earth.2nd month—What should I do? I seek to tread the lighted Way which leads back tothe Presence. What in my life obstructs that Way?3rd month—How can I do the duty of this day, yet demonstrate detachment?4th month—How can I meet each rising need, yet stand apart and unafraid?5th month—How can I enter into light and steadfast stand, seeing the truth onevery hand?6th month—How can I guide my brothers on the Way and with them find the secretof the dark light which reveals? How can I discover the agent which dispelsillusion?Dedicate yourself and life and all you have to the service of the Plan and dothis in full consciousness and not as a required duty. Stand with your groupbrothers in the light of the Presence. As a group, renew your dedication.~MY BROTHER AND FRIEND: August 1936The past six months have seen you subjected to much outer change; you havepassed through difficulties of various kinds and many adjustments andre-adjustments; you have known physical suffering and pain, accompanied, attimes by bewilderment. Is this not so? But none of these things have held you ordestroyed you, nor have they succeeded in tarnishing the white shield of yourfiery faith. This you have held ever before you. Such conditions of difficultymust be expected by all aspirants who have reached the point in their evolutionwhen they can find their way into these groups. All of your group brothers haveexperienced a hard time and, without exception, have been tested and tried, orare being tested and tried. They are wrestling with glamour, apparentlybewildered and held back by physical liability; their usefulness is apparentlycurtailed through financial stringency; re-adjustments through loss of some kindis apparently crippling the endeavour of others, even [395] to the point ofproducing a temporary inertia. Such is the group history at this particulartime.Let me put this still more clearly so that the group need and problem (which isformed by the sum total of the needs and the problems of all its members) maystand revealed and thus spur you all on to a closer cooperation with each otherand a more loving understanding. Let us look at the situation, as I see it, ofthe various members.Several have had re-adjustments to make of a very drastic nature in their dailylife. The entire rhythm of ordinary existence has been changed. This I foretoldmany months ago, and time has proved the exactness of my foretelling. Thedifficulties have been real, but service to others has increased.One of your co-disciples, as her correspondence shews, has had deeper innerproblems to solve, based on her immediate point of view and the fact that she isswinging more potently on to mental levels, as a result of her concentrated workwith me. This has brought about an inevitable reaction to the rhythm andtendency of the mental plane to produce a sense of isolation (which can beenjoyed in the earlier stages). All this has been complicated by financialanxiety, with its power to cloud the vision. She is on her way out, but hermental stress is definitely affecting the group life. It will enrich the grouplife if she achieves the grace of standing steady until she has time to clarifyher vision in either direction, and until she realises that no one achievesanything of reality by the laying down of any assumed responsibility.Another has been subjected to the strain of constant and, at times, serious illhealth, with its consequent reactions on the thought life and on the emotionallife. The struggle with sickness and with fatigue, plus an equally constant urgeto serve and to help, constitute no simple problem. This problem, shecomplicates by an undue analysis of circumstances and people.One of my disciples, close to all of you, has had a long period (extending overmany years) of strain, incident to environing conditions, much monotony in hislife outline and certain deep disappointments. He is dealing with them as onemight expect.You, my brother, know to what you have had to rise, as the months have slippedaway. You have met this with wisdom, [396] good intention and self-sacrifice.May I say (and I say it with a twinkle in my eye and with love) that you havenot yet learnt to enjoy them.D.H.B. has been through the fire. His tests and difficulties have been greater,fiercer and deeper than any that have come to the other group members. Pressureincident to his home karma, frustrations coming from his environment,misunderstandings of differing kinds, basic bad health at all times, plus theserious accident of the immediate past, loneliness, pain and clouds ofrecognised glamour have sought to engulf him. They cannot do so. This he alsoknows and is coming through.A member of your group of co-disciples has been through deep sorrow, as all ofyou know. The processes of re-adjusting the rhythm of her life, becomingaccustomed definitely to changed conditions, to loneliness and loss is weighingheavily upon her. She must realise that she is on her way to a greatly enrichedlife of service, and that her only present need is to stand steady and to giveherself time to stabilise into her new rhythm.Still another brother is fighting deep discouragement, and the glamour offutility (after so many years as a disciple) is seeking to swing him off thePath. His characteristic life tendency of pushing unemotionally straight aheadwill save him here, for he will penetrate the glamour in time and come out intothe light of the “Lighted Way,” but the clouds at times and at present seem tohim very thick.L.T.S-K. is experiencing a new opportunity to “come clear,” but the trial,testing and bewilderment are severe. He feels alone. He believes himselfmisunderstood and underrated. There can be many close to one and watching overone in a fog, and yet they can remain unrecognised.The point I am seeking to make as I give you all this brief résumé of theimmediate and basic problems which confront each of you is that these conditionsdo have a potent effect upon the group life and the group integration, and thatthe quicker they are handled and ended the better for the group. They are to behandled by the assuming of a right inner attitude and not by the changing ofouter circumstances. When an individual is occupied and pre-occupied with aparticular and [397] peculiar problem, he is necessarily introverted. The lifeof the group then necessarily suffers and becomes starved, limited andcurtailed. When the group members realise this fact more clearly, then they willendeavour to go through their experiences together (which prevents thedevelopment of an unwholesome and selfish introversion) and the problems of onewill become the problems of all. Not idly have you all been brought togetherinto this close relation with each other. Therefore give to each other morefreely, but without criticism and enquiry; love and steady each other as you gothrough the needed fusing and testing. This has to be undergone and more rightlyhandled before I can give you any definite world work to do along the line ofbreaking up the world illusion. How can you destroy (on a large scale) thatwhich you do not understand, handle and disperse (on a small scale) in your ownlives? This future work should be possible some day.I seek not to change your meditation, except to alter its monthly theme. Thesemonthly themes should, during the next six months, be as follows:1st month—Why is happiness needed in order to:a. Tread the Path of Revelation.b. Meet the needs of others.c. Clear away the obstacles I find?2nd month—What is the relation of happiness to joy?a. What do I know of each?b. Which is characteristic of the soul?3rd month—How can the words and the understanding of “the joy of the Lord isyour strength” affect my daily life?a. In what ways can I demonstrate joy?b. How can I shew forth happiness?c. What are the differences in these two?4th month—In what way can joy and happiness undermine fear, and liberate me fromfears?5th month—How can I enter into the joy which the Masters know?a. Upon what is this joy based?b. What effect can joy have upon the world of illusion? [398]6th month—Why must I bring joy to my group brothers?a. How can I do this in each specific case, for each case differs?b. What are the major hindrances to my own joyfulness?Thus, my brother, you can train yourself to build in that quality of joy whichis the characteristic of a personality which is consciously anchored in the soulrealm.~February 1937I have only the briefest of words for you, my brother of old and trusted friend.It is not the length of a message, however, but its quality which is ofimportance, is it not? I seek to say to you that you have, during the past sevenmonths, made more definite inner progress than in the previous three years, andthat my heart, as I watch your steps upon the Way, goes out to you withunderstanding and with joy. It is not often that I thus write.I have watched you stand amidst the wrecking of much that you have built, and Ihave seen you relinquish desire with a light in your eyes—the light ofperception of the higher values.The group meditation will give you much during the next six months, and theReview on Joy will stabilise the work you have sought to accomplish since mylast instructions to you. That is all I have to say, my brother. My blessingrests upon you.ON JOY1. What constitutes a review?a. Am I confusing a reviewing with a re-doing or with a re-experiencing?b. Am I asked to re-experience, or am I simply asked to observe as a detachedonlooker?2. Am I capable of detaching myself emotionally from any registration of joy?3. Can I see myself mentally, unbiased by any reaction from the emotional,personal self? Am I personally capable of this? [399]4. If I use this review on joy as it should be used, what will be the effect inmy life, and what will be the effect in the life of the group I seek to serve?5. Can I honestly say that I serve joyously?6. Which do I desire the most, to serve joyously or to serve intelligently? Do Iknow my reasons?7. If this review work is a definitely scientific method of development, have Iever given the method of joy a fair trial? Or the work of the review a fairtrial?8. What basis can I find in my study that this method of reviewing is the wayfor me, and that it will intensify my capacity for increased usefulness inservice and thus speed my progress on the Path?9. Is my progress on the Path of importance? Why?10. If it is true that the blind must advance by touching , and by keeping hold,but that those with sight move by seeing and by keeping free and unattached, whythen (having sight) do I close my eyes and hold on, and feel my way instead ofseeing it? Those who can see are full of joy, and can be messengers and helpers.Those who touch have simply to be led. Of which of these two groups am I amember?11. Is my mind the organ of vision for the spiritual man? Am I offering thisorgan to the higher self to use?12. Can I hold the mind steady in the light of the soul?13. As I review my day, what part has joy played?14. How do I define the word joy ?15. Have I been ruled by joy, and has it dominated my day?16. Joy is the quality which grows out of self-realisation. Am I able to forgetthe fragmentary personal self? Can I recognise the One Self in all selves?17. We are told that there is an archetype, a pattern, a way, a goal, and alight which shines upon the Path. But, realising this, do I know anything of thejoy which should irradiate my way?18. How is the archetypal pattern of joy (which is bliss ) reflected in my life?19. Do I recognise my fellow pilgrims on the Way of Joy?20. Is the objective of joy always before me? [400]21. Can I draw upon the Joy and Bliss of the Path when others need it?22. I am the redeemer of the lower nature. In what way does joy redeem?23. Does redeeming joyous force flow through me?24. My nature is in truth joy, or bliss. In what fashion does this joy manifestitself? Does it manifest at all?25. In which body do I most easily express my joy ?26. If I demonstrated joy, was it a task, or did I find it easy?27. What activities and qualities of my lower nature need to be eliminated if Iseek to serve more joyously?28. What truthfully hinders my being full of joy ?29. How does a joyous spirit affect my fellow men?30. In what way can I most joyously serve my fellow men?~MY BROTHER: September 1937The difficulties and the trials which the disciple experiences upon the Way are,as you have discovered, only relative; they are oft offset by the pouring in ofa sense of inner release. The compensations on the Way are not so oftenconsidered as are the difficulties. In the human being there is ever a tendencytowards sorrow and suffering which has eventually to be negated; this tendencyis one of the problems which the Hierarchy has to face, as it seeks strenuously,at this time, to lift mankind out of the morass in which it finds itself. This“tendency to misery,” founded as it is on an attitude of mind, is of suchancient habit that it seems inconceivable to man that a different point of viewand a totally different reaction to life affairs could ever be possible. I amreferring to this because (in the midst of problems and tests) you arediscovering the Way of Compensation. Do you think, my brother, that you couldwrite a paper on this theme, “Compensations on the Way,” for the helping of yourfellowmen and for the stabilising of your own inner attitude?I have given you much about which to think in my instruction; may it not bepossible that, before long, through the release from the load of business cares,there may come for you a time of widened service? This could be through the useof [401] your pen, for you have knowledge of that which should be said, andwords flow with ease from your pen, even if you realise it not. I commend thisto you for your consideration. You have been much occupied for many years withthe cares of a great business organisation and your imposed (and rightlyimposed) pre-occupations were with the more material aspects of life. Such wasyour dharma. Within that sphere of activity, you have preserved an innerorientation to the spiritual values and a fixed determination to tread the Waywhich naught has been able to alter.Much pre-occupation, however, with little things and the demands of the manyclamouring personalities who surround you have slowed the pace. You might,perhaps, have travelled faster had you been able, more efficient, to separatethe essential from the non-essential. This I think you know. Having realisedthis, a future of constructive beauty lies ahead, if so you will, or the moreordinary life of one whose vehicle is not young and who submits to theimperative voice of physical fatigue and the liabilities of a physical bodywhich has been used for many years. I say to you, therefore: Face the futurewith joy and know that it holds for you renewed opportunity, and later are-adjustment of your time and interests which will permit you the leisure fordeepened understanding and an increased usefulness in service. There is muchthat you can do and much in which you can assist me. Time will show you the waysand means. Have patience.It will, I believe, aid you in the relinquishing process and help you toreadjust your life to time and circumstance if you will ponder upon the fiveenergies which are dominant in your life expression during this incarnation.As you know, your rays—soul and personality—are the first and fifth; this initself presents a problem, for it produces a preponderance of force upon theline of the major first ray. Fortunately for you, it was the aspect oforganisation and the tendency to the occult life which were expressed throughthese energies and not the destroyer aspect or the over-critical mind, as mighthave been the case. You are not destructive; your outstanding qualities, if Imight so express it, have been the power to organise and rule, and also love ofthe hidden realities.[402] Your mental body has been outstandingly a fourth-ray one, giving you alove of harmony which has aided you in organisation rule, a love of beauty whichenabled you to see the real, and a discrimination which has enabled you togather around yourself that which unfolded beauty to you—books and beautifulthings. But it also gave you, as it ever does, a spirit of conflict, urging youforward to fresh victories in the cause of harmony.Your astral body has been governed by the second ray, and, from certain pointsof view, this has been the most powerful influence in your personalityequipment; it has been the balancing factor to the first-ray line energy,expressed by your soul and personality rays. It has linked you powerfully (andthis should interest and cheer you) with the Masters M. and K.H. Who togetherform a definite “unit of service” in the work of the Hierarchy at this time.Your physical body is on the third Ray of Active Intelligence. This has givenyou your capacity to work upon the physical plane, to handle money (though notin your own interests) and has tied you in closely with the material life ofyour environment, in a curiously symbolic manner. Ponder on this.You will be able to enlarge upon these ideas yourself from your knowledge of theray tendencies and qualities, and you will find it of real interest to study theproblem. My suggestion would be that you study the effect of this ray equipmentupon your immediate environment. Later we will go into this matter in greaterdetail. Your rays, therefore, are:1. The soul ray—the first Ray of Will or Power.2. The personality ray—the fifth Ray of Concrete Science.3. The ray of the mental body—the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict.4. The ray of the astral body—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.5. The ray of the physical body—the third Ray of Active Intelligence.~BROTHER OF OLD: February 1938You have lately been given work which will constitute for you an integratingpoint. Much can be done by you through [403] quiet thought, the pouring out oflove and of the first ray strength which you are so capable of giving, throughthe medium of your soul ray. On this opportunity to serve I would have youponder deeply and reflect. The way of service is opening up to you, as Iindicated to you in my last instructions, and your cooperation is welcome andneeded. Adjustments are going on with rapidity in your life and the processes ofliving will steadily simplify for you, if you so choose and if you mould thefuture by the impress of your soul.It has been interesting to note how, in your case, the fourth ray mental body(which is a part of your equipment) has used its force in harmony far more oftenthan in conflict, as is the effect in the majority of your brothers’ lives. Thisis due to the first ray activity of your soul which has resolved the conflict inharmony. Most of the conflict in your life has been the result of the activityof your astral body (working under second ray influence) with a reaction uponyour third ray physical body. A close relation between the second and the thirdrays often works out in difficulty, for they express two different ways ofbuilding. This I will take up in greater detail later.I would like to call attention to the fact that many of your co-disciples arefunctioning with fourth ray mental bodies. This provides a most interestingreason why you were all chosen to work at the dissipation of glamour. The astralplane is the plane of duality, of the pairs of opposites, and it is theinterplay of these opposites, plus the energies released by the individual,which has, during the ages, built up the world glamour. Harmony through Conflictis the characteristic and result of fourth ray activity. It expresses itself infullness on the fourth plane where the major duality of the Spiritual Triad andthe threefold personality meet, blend and resolve into a unity. I would commendthis thought to you for pondering and reflection; it has a definite bearing upongroup activity in connection with group dispelling of world glamour. The fourthray mental bodies of the members will facilitate this task.You, having rays one, four and five active in your equipment, can see where yourwork dovetails into the picture.I have not much in the way of personal instruction to give you at this time. Theproduction of a creative adjustment of [404] the imminent changes in your lifeand the establishing of yourself as a renewed centre of force in whateverenvironment claims your soul’s attention will be adequate for your fullspiritual employment, will it not, my brother?I would have you, however, ponder on the following facts.1. Soul energy is, for you, focussed in the astral body.2. Personality force is focussed in the mental body.We will leave the work of meditation as it is at present along with thecontinuance of the review of Joy. May Joy, indeed, rest upon you and enable youto go in peace.~MY BROTHER AND FELLOW WORKER: February 1939I am not analysing your personality forces, particularly your astral force as Ihad suggested doing, because I gave you a sufficiently complete analysis in mylast instruction. What I there indicated is all you need at this time. Later, Imay perhaps elaborate, but at present you have all you need to know in order tocarry on satisfactorily. In humility and in strength to love lies your release,my brother, and this I know you realise.This year has been one of supreme difficulty, has it not, and the end is notimmediate. One of the major lessons which all disciples have to master beforeinitiation becomes possible, is that of steady persistence in the face of allthat seeks to produce difficulty. Your personal problem is enhanced and becomesexceedingly complex because of the reactions of your immediate associates andyour strenuous endeavour to lift all that you possibly can off their shoulders.It becomes, therefore, a lesson in group activity and hence most valuable. Liftnot too much, my brother. It is the right of their souls to learn the samelessons as you have had to learn and an over-pitiful heart is not always themost helpful of possessions. A loving heart is always helpful. You learnt muchin your past incarnation along this line and learnt satisfactorily. Take notaway from others this right to stand alone by too great a display of thatshielding love which your powerful astral body so easily and so selflessly canexpress. Let them stand up to the issues of the soul which are brought to theirattention through the medium of the material [405] lesson, and thus enable themto enter upon their next life better equipped to love, to work and to liveunselfishly.Your one way out is to be focussed constantly in the soul, remembering that, asyou achieve this alignment and contact, the soul has its major point of contactwith your personality, via your astral body. This is for you a blessing, evenwhen it constitutes a problem. Perhaps you will grasp what I am seeking toconvey to you if I say that this relation was established by the intelligentwill of your soul in order to stiffen your astral reactions with first rayenergy and colour them with that detached and isolated strength which is themain characteristic of the first ray. The intent was to make you strong in whathad been your weakest point. Detachment, strongly felt in love (for forget notthat the first ray is only the first sub-ray of the great cosmic ray of Love) isthe factor which will bring release and understanding, not only to you but toall around you. The aspect of devotion which the astral body so easily expressesmust be transmuted into detached but selfless love. Remember that true love hassometimes to stand aside and look on peacefully whilst others learn theirlessons—a thing hard indeed for you to do, brother of mine.All I would ask you to do along the line of meditation is a simple voiced act ofconsecration to the service of the soul which is, in the last analysis, theservice of humanity and of the Hierarchy. Such is the sequence. Do this prior toparticipating in the group meditation. Let the personality identify itself withthe soul, detaching itself deliberately from all other contacts, by an act ofthe will and (from that point on) let the soul respond by sounding the O.M.three times as it “takes possession” of the personality for service.You think with clarity, my brother, when the emotions of others do not overwhelmyou and sweep your astral body into unison with theirs. Refuse then to beoverwhelmed and regard not yourself as failing in some respect when others failto meet the issues as they should. The reactions of others are not yourresponsibility. It is your responsibility to give them strength and detachment.Shoulder not, therefore, responsibilities which are not yours. This is one ofthe hardest lessons an initiate has to learn before he can be admitted as anactive worker into the Hierarchy of Love.[406] Life holds for you fresh changes. Be not dismayed, for those changesindicate an open door and a wider field for loving service.NOTE: This disciple stands steady in the Tibetan’s Ashram.~TO G. S. S.March 1935BROTHER OF MINE:I take up definite work with you in a spirit of expectancy because of your realsensitivity. I take it up also with a recognition that as we work together wemust proceed with due care and real caution. We must work definitely anddeliberately with a technique which will eventuate in sound foundations.You are in this group for two reasons: First, your enthusiastic endeavour andthe adjustments which your soul has forced you to make in your daily lifeattracted my attention and earned for you the right to a more specialised andindividual training. Secondly, you possess a definite gift of healing and thismust be cultivated, because it is consecrated and because it holds for you thesecret of your real field of service.One of the first questions you would ask me if we stood face to face would be:What is the thing I need most? What must I do in order to be released to greaterservice and deeper understanding? I would say to you in all earnestness, mybrother, that for you will come an increased expansion of consciousness as youlearn to conserve energy and rightly to utilise time. You are a good conductorof force and of the pranic elements and through you unimpeded (relativelyspeaking) soul force can flow. But, as yet, it serves only to intensify theatoms of your body and head, and to make a violent impact upon all those withwhom you are associated. It works out in a form of benevolent dominance, anddrives you before it, rather than being utilised by you. Therefore, you have tolearn to use the inflowing force, and to turn it into constructive channels. Youneed to be more occupied with those whom you can help, than with your ownreactions—both good and bad. Surrounding you, in your own setting and amongthose familiar to you, are many [407] whom you could help and release. They fearyou, however, and fear what you have because of the forcefulness of yourapproach to them; they hide their true need for fear that you touch them withtoo powerful a hand. You are too occupied with the mental formulations of thatwhich you know to be true and with a precise statement of that which is soprecious to you; and you have not, therefore, given the needed time and theheart of love to the deep need of those you meet—of everyone you meet, mybrother. All need love and understanding, and this they need more than clearlyenunciated occult truths, no matter how true or wonderful. Give them love andunderstanding. The impartation of the Ageless Wisdom will come later andnaturally when you have proved to them that you “stand in spiritual being.”For you, there must now be a period of steadfast stabilising of that which hasbeen acquired, and a gentle outgoing to your world of friends. Let them revealthemselves to you. They will, when patient loving gentleness meets them all thetime. Inclusiveness must take the place of your sixth ray one-pointedness, forthat one-pointedness has in it the quality of piercing , and this focussed workyou have carried forward long enough. Your sixth ray has also given you asensitive emotional nature which means a solar plexus too active in itsfunctioning. This you know well. Upon this, the heart quality must supervene.More I will give you later, but the above hints will give you that which youneed, if you ponder duly upon my words, and resent not what I say. My problem isto train each of you so that you serve the group without personality hindrancesand separativeness....The work of this particular group cannot really begin until the personalities ofthe members are subordinated to group purpose, and trained to be pure channels.This is a great objective, my brother, therefore, be not discouraged, but work,live and above all, love .~BROTHER OF MINE: December 1935You have been so short a time in this group that it is not my purpose now (norwould it be wise) to change the work earlier [408] outlined for you. Not yethave you established the needed routine and rhythm. It is never my intention tobe authoritative nor do I ever demand obedience. I but make suggestions andleave it to the student to apply himself or not as he may choose and as hisearnestness may dictate. But I do observe his work and its results. May I,therefore, say one thing? I would like to see in you a more steady applicationto the meditation work. Seek as far as possible to be regular in its dailyeffectiveness. Let nothing but that which is unavoidable interfere with yourquiet time in the Presence. Here perhaps is a point where you could disciplineyourself somewhat more effectively.You have grasped rapidly and well the point I made in my last instruction anentyour reaching people. Your service must be one of potent loving contact. Yourmethod should be that of a deep interest in them, more than an interest in whatyou may have to give them of an occult and intellectual nature. Their need isthe thing that is of importance. The effort to understand these people (withtheir reticences and silences, their weaknesses and strengths, their aspirationsand their failures, their devotions and their customs) and to enter into theirconsciousnesses will give you the training which you need and will enable youlater to be a server whom we, the teachers on the inner side, can more fullyuse.You are on the “lighted Way,” my brother, and your soul will carry you throughto a more assured understanding and a more established peace. This you oft haverealised you need.Give the next few months to a close study of all the group instructions. Attemptto master their contents and to be familiar with the group aims, objectives andthis preliminary teaching. Seek to comprehend more intelligently what is thisgroup experiment in which you are aiding. It is group work in which you areengaged and not simply undertaking a mode of personal training. . . . Theindividual angle of this work is of no importance, except in so far as it mayaffect the group as a whole. This is the point to be grasped by you and byseveral of the group members.And, my brother, may I add one parting word? Aim at demonstrating happiness. Bejoyous in your work and service. Be not so intense, but go happily along thelighted Way. Such is my prayer for you. [409]~MY BROTHER: March 1936The task of blending with any group is ever a hard one, and has been speciallyso in your case. This I foresaw, but I saw also that you would make a realeffort so to do, and I have not been disappointed. You need, however, a stilllonger period of adjustment before I dare give you either the meditation or thepersonal teaching which I hope sometime to give to you. This is not owing toanything that you might consider a fault, but is due primarily to your exceedingsensitivity to soul stimulation.In cases such as yours there is need to proceed with exceeding care. There is anemotional and physical balance and rhythm in you which is very easily upset.This is due to the tremendous potency of your etheric body. This vital body ofyours is of such strength, and carries so much energy upon the higher levels ofthe astral plane and also from the lower mental, that it upsets certainbalancing factors in the physical body. Thus the task of any teacher workingwith you is tremendously complicated. You both feel too intensely, and move andspeak with too great a consequent rapidity. It is a real problem for me (doesthis surprise you, my brother?) how to make clear to you your need for slowness.How can I, with my clearer vision of you and my knowledge of your subtler bodiesand their condition, enable you to grasp it also? I cannot do more than be veryguarded in what I give to you of stimulation and of attention, for yourreactions are so rapid and so violent. I have to judge with care what I ask youto do because the effects are so prompt, and contact with my energy so oftenproduces in you over-stimulation and excitation, with fatigue as a result.Perhaps I can help you most by saying that, owing to your ray combinations andyour background in other lives, your interest is more mental than aspirational.Your keen and active mind (which is, however, often an inaccurate mind) is swunginto intense interest with great facility; it is most easily fertilised and hasin it the promise of being both powerful and constructive, later. But at thistime, you cannot handle the force that comes through to your physical body, andwhich is directed [410] by your mind. Coming from the mind, it indicates,therefore, the force of a rapidly integrating personality, but this force, asyou do not yet live a full life of service, is too much for you. When you servemore truly and definitely, your problem will be solved.Your problem also is largely the problem of the right use of time; your lifewill be straightened out considerably, and a great deal of your physicalover-stimulation disappear when you use time rightly .My brother of olden time, you use so much time on that which is futile from theangle of world need and of the true and basic essentials. When I say this Iwould have you, however, remember that I am not suggesting that you should alteryour technique of daily living, nor that your home or your responsibilitiesshould be handled with less care and good results. I am referring definitely toan inner attitude towards time which you do not as yet hold.Upon what do you place your emphasis in life and how can I illustrate to you mypoint? You state that you are failing to find the time to do your meditationwork correctly. Why should this be, my brother? You may not be able to do it thefirst thing each morning before breakfast, but many people cannot. Yet surely,if your essentials are right, you could demand thirty minutes at some pointearly in the day for your soul contact. The structure of your daily living willnot break down if, for instance, you do not answer the telephone during thatperiod and permit yourself that time of quiet, delegating others to deal withthe telephone. You need to readjust your values.As regards your meditation, I will give you one that is very brief. I will askyou, also, to cease meditating in the head and for a while to meditate in theheart, remembering that the heart centre is between the shoulder blades and notin the physical heart. Do not, however, permit yourself to dwell upon the factof the centres or their locality. Simply drop your mental intensity and centreyour consciousness lower in the upper part of the body. Do not analyse thesituation, or the location or the purpose or the why and the wherefore too much.Simply, my brother, do as you are told, knowing that I may perhaps know a littlemore than you. [411]1. Imagine yourself as the soul, using the lower man as an instrument.2. Imagine the soul as working through and energising the centre of love in yourbeing. Relax then and sink down into the soul consciousness which is love. Letlove be the keynote of your meditation.3. Then pour out lovea. Upon your immediate family circle.b. Upon those with whom you associate in your social life.c. Upon your group brothers.d. Upon the New Group of World Servers.e. Upon the world.You will note how this involves a steadily imagined establishment ofconsciousness, in love. Do this sequentially, quietly, and definitely, with nohurry.4. Then ponder for the next six months upon the following seed thoughts:First month . . . . Love—“I tread the Way of Love. That Love irradiates mylife.”Second month . . . . Understanding—“The way of Love is the lighted Way.”Third month . . . . Integration—“The way of Love leads to the Presence of theSelf. That Self am I.”Fourth month . . . . Contact—“I see that Presence as myself. I merge myself inLight.”Fifth month . . . .Service—“The sons of men must all be led to tread the Way ofLove.”Sixth month . . . . The Plan—“The Plan for man has three great goals. Therevelation of love; the illumination of the mind; the evocation of the will.”The major task, however, which I set you will be most difficult for you to do,but I ask you most definitely to do it in the interests of your own developmentand, above all, in your growth and service both to the world and to your groupbrothers.[412] Speak little, and endeavour to work each day with a conscious, definiteprogramme, thus learning to organise your time to the best advantage, andleaving more time for service and quiet thought. Be slow to speak, slow to move,slow to decide, slow to form opinions.There is much to be done by this group of servers but I cannot begin to use thegroup until certain personality adjustments have been made. Make rapid progress,my brother, by slow stages.~MY BROTHER: October 1937It has seemed to me (as I have studied you) that you might again begin tomeditate simply. But there must be no intensity, and you should assume only theattitude of quiet reflection, which is meditation. No breathing exercises of anykind should be followed by you, but just the following simple form of soulrecognition, yearning after the presence of God, and an aspiration towardsspiritual love.1. Think of yourself as a child of God, loved by the Father, and a part of Hislife.2. Dedicate yourself, as a personality, to the service of your fellowmen, whichis the service of love and of God.3. Then reflect quietly and peacefully and happily upon the seed thoughts,taking one each month, as outlined in the preceding communication. This time,however, use the word “friendship” during the third month instead of the word“integration.”I am going to tell you the governing rays of your life equipment, but please donot elaborate upon them in your mind, as I am not anxious for you to focus anyattention upon the vehicles through which your soul seeks expression. I amsimply stating them in order to bring your information into line with that ofyour group brothers. Give, therefore, ten minutes each day, and no more , toquiet reflection within the limits of the assigned meditation. At the close ofthe next six months we will then see what has transpired and what will bepossible. The following is a statement as to your rays: [413]1. The soul ray—the seventh Ray of Order or Magic.2. The personality ray—the sixth Ray of Devotion.3. The ray of the mental body—the first Ray of Power or Will. Hence the facilitywith which you can bring in energy.4. The ray of the astral body—the sixth Ray of Devotion.5. The ray of the physical body—the third Ray of Active Intelligence.~MY BROTHER: March 1938During the next six months we must decide whether you are able to cope with thisplanned work or not. If at the end of this next period of study it is apparentthat you should not do any of the work then—for the sake of group integrity andthe purposed undertaking of healing—it will be necessary for you to drop out.Karmically, you have a relation to me and to this group of aspirants;sensitively you are adequate to the task; aspirationally, you desire to do it.Wherein then lies the difficulty? What causes the over-intensification of theglandular system?The answer lies in three factors, which I will put frankly before you, leavingyou to accept or reject my suggestions as may seem best to you.First (and above everything else) an intense attitude to life. You live alwaysat a point of tension. Such points of tension come, and should come, to alldisciples for it is at such critical moments that the real growth appears andtrue decisions are made, but you are always at such a point and never know whento relax. Even when amusing yourself, you are tense; when resting, you aretenser still. You could learn relaxation if you so desired, but this you do notreally seek to do, and the question is whether you would practise relaxationeven if you knew how to do so.Secondly, you have an inability to eliminate the non-essentials out of yourdaily life. You do so many things that you need not do and fail to realise thatperhaps it does not truly matter whether they are done or no. One of your majorrequirements, [414] if you are ever to function as a disciple, is the sense ofspiritual values. If you can learn this lesson, you will then occupy yourselfwith the things of lasting moment and not with the ephemeral activities whichnet you no true results.Thirdly, you take many things in life far too seriously, such as the work ofthis group. You think about these things too intently, and you handle the groupwork, your daily life, and your home problems, plus all your life interests,with too heavy a hand. There are two things which every disciple must some daylearn, my brother. One is to cultivate the ability to “sit light in the saddle”(to use an old proverbial injunction) and the other is to develop a sense ofhumour, a real (not forced) capacity to laugh at oneself and with the world.This is one of the compensations which comes to those who can succeed in workingin the light upon the mental plane. When you can do this, the constant tensionunder which you labour will adjust itself.How, my brother, does this tension come about in your case? It is based upon aninner inherent ability to touch soul levels and thus to be open to the inflow ofsoul force. This feeds the various centres with life and energy, and these—intheir turn—galvanise the glandular system into activity. When, however, there isnot adequate use of spiritual energy, it gets “banked up” in the centres (if Imay use such an inadequate expression) and this produces bad results. Yourthroat centre receives the bulk of this energy and the solar plexus, and henceyour excessive physical plane activity and nervous energy, and hence also yourtendency, via the throat centre, to much speech and vivacious talk. The heartcentre and the centre between the eyebrows should receive more of this energyand this would lead to a balancing of the endocrine system and greater freedomin spontaneous service. What aspects of your life, therefore, can be therecipients of spiritual force? Where can you serve spiritually and thus releasethis banked up spiritual energy? It is definitely energy with which we aredealing, as we live and serve, and this spiritual energy must be used for groupbetterment and for the meeting of group conditions. I refer not here to thisgroup but to all and any kind of right group activity which may come your way.How can you use this force [415] in service so that it is not accumulated butmade to serve a spiritual purpose? That is your problem and a major questionwith many disciples.You have oft made the remark that you know so little, that you have been forcedahead too fast, and that you have no background of acquired knowledge. But youhave been many years in touch with my work and—in spite of all you may think tothe contrary—you have the mental ability and the leisure (if you organised yourdaily life aright) to read and study. But this is a hard thing for you to do, isit not? But, brother of old, the way of the disciple is never an easy one. Thetension from which you suffer could have been very largely offset by a quieterlife of reading, gentle thought, organised activities, silence and the refusalto take on non-essentials (those things which other people can do just as wellas you can) or the ability to see things not done.I have written thus in frankness, because I seek to release you from yourpresent condition to fuller service, to better health, and truer happiness. Iseek to see you a quiet centre of spiritual force . I would like to see youre-arrange your life in such a manner that you can demonstrate that leisuredcalm through which strength can flow from you to those you love and to those youcontact. Can you take enough leisure to grasp at least the purpose of theseinjunctions? Can you endeavour to profit by them?Another source of your trouble is to be found in your sixth ray astral body (theray of idealistic, fanatical devotion) for it produces a real lack of balance,an undue attention to details of process, and of devotion to those details fromthe emotional satisfaction which comes from this attention; this brings about afailure to understand the larger issues and an inability to move gently on theWay. This your first ray mental nature can offset if you will give it a chanceand live more in your mind and less in your feelings and emotional reactions.Your third ray physical body inclines you to great physical activity (such asrapid movement and rapid speech); it keeps you working at something all the timeand often at something quite unproductive of good results, and not proportionateto the labour expended.Anyway, my brother, let us again endeavour to do some [416] work together, andto preserve, at the same time, emotional equilibrium, which will result in agreater measure of glandular balance. It will come more easily if you live aregular, organised life, move with greater gentleness, talk less and endeavourto polarise yourself in your mind nature.I would ask you to do some meditation each day regularly with a planned lack ofintensity carried almost to the point of lack of interest. Just follow the formand look not for results. They will follow automatically e’en if you realisethem not. Study what I say to you and meet the group requirements.NOTE: G.S.S. has resigned with the full approval of the Tibetan. The tension ofthe group activity proved too much for her. In a later life she will resume herplace.~TO D. H. B.January 1934BROTHER OF MINE:This is my first instruction to you. I gave it not to you earlier than thisbecause I was testing out your motive and your ability to work without attentionfrom me. It is the sign of real discipleship when a man works alone andapparently unaided and seeks not to intrude his small affairs into theconsciousness of his Master, realising, as he does, the pressure of work uponthe Great Ones. Those of us who prepare chelas for conscious discipleship, testand try them out in this connection. I had not forgotten that you have workedfor six months without any personal word. Today I seek to assign your work andto establish a closer rapport between you and myself.You are in a position, my brother, both from karma and the present worldcondition, to be able to give considerable time to the service of your fellowmenand to the helping of aspirants in your environment. This gives to you theopportunity of utilising all the powers you have of mind and of sensitivity, butthis necessarily brings its own problems and difficulties. One of the firstlessons every chela has to learn is the growth of that [417] inner detachmentwhich will enable him to merge himself in the consciousness of his brother andso know and ascertain the best way to help him and stimulate him to renewedself-effort . He needs also to cultivate that true humility which will force himto give all he has in selfless service, and then to forget that he has thusgiven of himself. He must have no thought of himself as a factor in the case.Only when detachment and humility are present can a disciple really serve.Cultivate, therefore, these qualities and continue the giving of yourself inservice.These are two of the keynotes which are specially yours, and these qualitiesshould be built into the very fabric of your life with the strictest attention.Your third keynote is being . Learn to stand in spiritual being, rememberingever that to be is a greater realisation than to know or to act. The constantsteady effort to dwell in the Secret Place of your own soul and from thence togo forth into the world of men, pouring forth love and understanding, should beyour prime endeavour.Also, my brother, work not under strain or with effort. Bring ease andeffortless expression into your daily relations. You will understand to what Irefer. The physical body is not too strong, and if there is any sense of driveor of pressure, your work and service will suffer. Conservation of energy andincreased inner work will produce a greater magnetic realisation but lessphysical plane activity. This is for you the part of wisdom. Handle what youhave to do more through meditation; see people and talk to them as heretoforebut reduce somewhat the time given to each. Intensive spiritual radiation andloving understanding will do more true good than long hours of talk. See as manypeople but give them less time, not from a sense of hurry but in order to dobetter and more intensive work.My word for you is: Work more in the light and see all people as in that lightwith you. All that any disciple or aspirant has to do in relation to hisfellowmen is to stimulate the light that is in them, leaving them free to walkin their own light and way upon the Path.As regards your meditation, I would like to suggest that you reduce the timeperiod of your meditation work but increase the intensity of your focus. For sixmonths I would like to see [418] you do a rapid and intense meditation, andevidence a one-pointed driving forward to a quick alignment and entering intothe light.As regards the rest of your work, conform to group requirements and rememberthat rapid intense work is for you the indicated method during the coming sixmonths’ period.~BROTHER OF MINE: August 1934My word to you today is brief. I think you will realise that the reason lies inthe fact that the intensity of the stimulation received by you at the time ofthe Wesak Festival, has so increased your sensitivity that more at this time isnot required. I write not to the members of this group for the sake of writing.As time proceeds and they come more and more into line with group purpose, intouch with myself, and in closer union with each other, it should be possiblefor there to be fewer communications and more inner realisation of relationship.You are getting the needed results from your meditation, so there is no need atthis time to change it.Recollect in your work that you are always a focal point for spiritual power andshould be an outpost of the Master’s love . Serve and work. Conserve your healthat all times. Seek to link up with D.L.R. You can serve each other if you will.~March 1935You have had a time of difficulty, my brother. Such times are growing times andserve to train the disciple. The deeper the capacity for usefulness and thedeeper the inner conservation, the more severe will oft be the disciplining. Youreceived a tremendous stimulation during the Conference and it resulted in aninner reorganisation of your subtle bodies, locating for you also those pointsby which glamour could enter. This is of value. Whilst this kind of activity istranspiring, there is usually produced such an intense activity of the innerbodily forces (that are the battleground of a man’s own nature) that theaspirant is temporarily submerged by these forces and by the [419] reactionproduced in his own environment. Frequently he can scarcely keep his head abovethe water (a neat, occult phrase, my brother, and one most applicable to yourown experience during the past six months). Two planks of the raft on which thedisciple eventually makes his escape can be called service and patience. By aclose attention to the needs of his fellowmen and by means of that uncomplainingendurance which is the hallmark of the disciple, he brings to an end the time ofdifficulty and emerges thence freer, richer and more useful. There come times inthe life of every true aspirant when he simply continues to persevere, no matterhow disinclined he may feel and no matter how acute may be the inner turmoil.You are emerging from the condition of difficulty and you are facing—as aresult—a life of fuller service and of deepened understanding of others. Freedomfrom difficulty will never be your lot. Would you have it otherwise? Lonelinessgrows as the aspirant detaches himself from the world of souls. There comes everan interlude wherein the disciple senses an intense seeming isolation, but it isonly an illusion. You know that you are not alone. You know well how rich yourlife is today, and how strengthened each and all of you are through contact withyour brothers.I have not much to say to you. You are coming closer to your Master; thegreatest help that I can give you at this time is to tell you this. You have thepersistence and the will (like tempered steel) of the second ray, and you candismiss all fear as to your capacity to transcend the difficulties or to makeyour grade. Nothing can stop you.Your work in the group and your power in relation to it consists in yourcompassionate comprehension. You must act in the group for that aspect of thesoul which expresses itself in understanding; that quality you can transmit. Beof good courage, my brother, and lose yourself in service.~MY BROTHER: October 1935One of the main things which I have to do for you at this time is to give youthe kind of meditation which is needed. It [420] should be one that will breakdown any tendency to crystallise which may be making its presence felt in yourmental body, and so keep you free and plastically ready for use.You have been subjected lately to three things:1. A tremendous stimulation, as a result of the Wesak Festival.2. A good deal of immediate environing testing.3. An increased and increasing field of service.The first has greatly expanded your mental body. The second has swept youremotional nature into a somewhat subdued tempest. The third has had a dualeffect: it has served to show you the futility of glamour and that which youdespondingly think is not glamour. It has also fanned into activity a few hiddenseeds of self-satisfaction, which still remain in your subconscious mind. I amspeaking plainly for you are a worthwhile chela and capable of much service inthe world and, for you, individual sensitivity to correction and to suggestion,should have no place. I realise that this is also your point of view and thathence I can speak with frankness.As I look at you, my brother, and study your aura, I ask myself, what are thetwo things which you most need at this time? By this I mean: What two things,dealt with at this time, would give you the maximum measure of release and soincrease your power in service? There is, first of all, an increased reticencein thought anent your environing conditions. This involves two subsidiaryfactors: firstly, freedom from criticism of those with whom you are dailyassociated, and silence as to yourself. Ponder on this, for in its practice liesfor you much liberation. Secondly, the cultivation of a spirit of happiness , ofjoy—which is based on an inner assurance as to the Plan and your future work inrelation to it.You are at a critical point in your career as a disciple. The present, rightlyhandled, will open up for you new fields of service. This, however, will only bethe case if you adjust in yourself those weaknesses of character which call forreticence and joy as their remedying agents. There is for you at this time noimmediate drastic action or change. You are temporarily [421] marking time, butyou can steadily increase the tempo or rate of vibration and so be ready toproffer fuller service and emerge into fuller usefulness; or you can continuemarking time—adequately and usefully—and make no further definite progress forsome while. Yet reticence (which is after all conservation of energy) and joy(which produces right magnetism) will inevitably quickly “speed you on yourway.”You will note that I have been lately using the phrase the “lighted Way” in manyof my communications. This is because I am seeking to evoke in all my disciplesthe recognition that the light which is in each and all of you will, and can,and ofttimes does, light your path of life.The meditation which I would give you has in it these two thoughts of silenceand joy, for these, rightly fostered, mean strength conserved and magneticservice. Continue the breathing exercise as heretofore, and then proceed asfollows:1. Withdraw your outgoing consciousness from the periphery to the point ofsilence within the head, to the place where the “gold and the blue meet, blendand merge.”2. Then endeavour to feel that utter silence. When you have entered into it andare aware of it, then3. From that point send forth blessinga. To your immediate circle of family and friends.b. To your co-disciples.c. To your group of students.d. To the outer world.e. To me, your Tibetan Brother.f. To the New Group of World Servers.g. To the Hierarchy.4. Then visualising a vivid golden yellow, ponder on the true significance,value and reward of silence.5. Next, visualising a vivid electric blue, ponder on the true significance,value and reward of joy.6. Sound the O.M. three times audibly, with the thought in mind as you sound it,ofa. The cleansing of the aura.b. The silencing of all discords.c. The expression of joy.[422] I would like also to suggest an interlinking (which you should keep inmind, and which will constitute a service to me and to the group) of four peoplewhose names will be sent to you.~MY BROTHER AND FRIEND: February 1936The past six months have been for you months of battle—a battle with glamour,with a tired and worn body, as well as with environment and home conditions. Youhave indeed had a battle with your entire lower integrated personality. The Pathof Purification, like a silver thread, runs through the golden path ofDiscipleship. The cleansing of the personality and the attaining of more lightupon one’s way is ever the preparation for increased and more adequate service.It appears to me, an older brother on the Way, that the law of non-resistanceholds for you the promise of success. Just stand with steadfastness, my brother,and let the turmoil of life and the noise of affairs pass over you unheeded.Establish within yourself a point of quiet and learn to retreat there and, inforgetfulness of outer happenings, live the life of spiritual tranquillity. Thewords, detachment and service, have for you much real and deep meaning, butperhaps their very familiarity, as expressions of your spiritual objectives,militates somewhat against their usefulness. Joy and tranquillity are the twowords that I would seek to add to the content of your thought. Joy is one that Ihave already called to your attention. The other, tranquillity, I seek to seeinterjected now into your life. There is little else that I need to say to youat this time. You know; you need no telling but, like all pledged disciples, youneed interludes of stabilisation before passing on to greater knowledge.~August 1936MY BROTHER:Again there is little that I need to say to you at this time. Much that is foundin the personal instructions of your group brothers must be also deeply studiedby you and applied; but the Technique of the Way, the particular need which youmay [423] have for a particular re-arrangement—either of your life or of yourdesires—and the specific next step is, for you, adequately clear, is it not? Along period of learning and of recognitions directed toward the soul and thelife of the soul in its own world, has been yours. An interlude of assimilationand of recognition directed towards the world of men is again—for you—an equalnecessity. In this way a closer integration can be set up between the two majoraspects through which you have to express yourself—the soul life, aspiration andnature (whose major attribute is love) and the personality life, aspiration andnature (whose major attribute is intelligence). The unfolding of the united lifeof these two must now go forward, with your predominant focus in the astralbody. Does this seem strange to you? Here in the astral body (as you well knowand as all true disciples know) is the battleground for those who are preparingfor initiation. The weapon whereby the battle will be won is that ofintelligent, loving service. Had you ever regarded service as a weapon for use?This statement is, as you will see, a simple and clear indication of thesituation. It covers the work to be undertaken by you during the next six monthsand for which the difficulties and the pain of the past year have prepared you.Think not, my brother, that I regard service as a new thing for you or assomething to which I am summoning you. Such is not the case, for your life isoriented thereto. But the strenuous aspiration and the active fight which youhave waged over glamour and your personality, must cease for a while, so as togive your tired nerves and the temporarily disturbed nervous system time torecuperate.In the last meditation outlined by me, I gave you two exercises to do withcolour, and it is this particular work which precipitated the crisis of the pastyear. Such was my intention, hard though that may seem. The meditations which Igive to my disciples are full of purpose and are planned to produce certaineffects, if faithfully carried out. I would have you think this out, and ponderupon the effect of the imposition of tranquillity upon the astral body. May notthe early stages of such imposition work out in potent agitations which can, intheir due time, produce definite physical effects? Tranquillity is theimposition of a quality of energy upon an agitated force, but—[424] when thesetwo types of force first come into touch with each other—a result, differingfrom that expected oft ensues. The achieving also of a tranquil centre in yourenvironment comes to be recognised by your associates. This, in the early stagesagain, may call forth turmoil. I give you these hints, because when you haveabsorbed the implications they will lead to the higher understanding. So littledo disciples, even the most intelligent, realise the effect, in the earlystages, of the higher forces upon the lower! They realise much more clearly theultimate goal and ideal, but the intermediate steps remain sealed to them.Go on, therefore, with your life of service and act as a wise helper to all youcontact, including your co-disciples. Your major asset at this time is adedicated influence and radiation. See to it that its medium of expression islove . You are predominantly on the wisdom side of the second ray. See to itthat the love side is equally developed. That will not be a hard task for you.I seek to change your meditation quite radically. All disciples who aresteadfast in their orientation entered, at the Full Moon of May, 1936, into anew cycle. This you also did. A most definite sifting and testing went on atthat time, on subtler levels—a testing which had for its objective the discoveryof those who had essentially the New Age characteristics, and could therefore betrusted to tune in on the newer and higher rhythms. Follow, therefore, theprocedure outlined until I again tell you to make a change. Breathing exercisesare necessary for you and aid you much. Attempt, therefore, the following....Be not deterred or discouraged by pain and by difficulty. You are not alone.Carry the work forward as indicated by me in the group instructions but add toit the further work which I assign you.~MY BROTHER: March 1937I have studied with care the replies sent in by this group of aspirants. I havestudied yours with special care for a reason which you know, but which may notbe stated here. Your replies indicate a glamour out of which you should at once[425] emerge—the glamour of depression, based on a sense of spiritualinferiority which is not warranted, being not based on facts. As an instance ofthis—read the list of failings which you give. My brother, even if there is somebasis of truth in your enumeration, still your replies remain untruthful, foryou omit all recollection or reference to the other side of the picture. You arecentred in your mind in the involutionary reactions of the personality vehicles.Yet, you are, as you well know, in preparation for certain steps forward uponthe Path. A clear vision of yourself is needed, and at each turn upon the Wayyou have to face three realities:1. The little or lower self.2. The Dweller upon the Threshold, in cases such as yours.3. The Angel of the Presence.Be not so occupied with the personality self, seek more frequently the companyof the Angel, which hides and veils (and yet reveals) the hidden glory of thespirit. Your faults are there, as are the faults of all upon the Way. Many passmuch time and thus slow down their active spiritual expression by an undueinterest and a too intent focussing upon the liabilities and limitations.Recognise this, my brother, and then pass on. They are not all you have to show;they do not give the entire picture.Five years ago you evidenced much spiritual pride; you had a strong sense ofseparativeness, and a highly developed critical mind. Today these demonstratefar less than formerly, and you are now quick to see any emerging wrongtendencies, and equally quick to repudiate them.Humble love is for you the goal this year together with the expression of aloving, understanding heart, thus aiding all you meet. Have no other aim. Thepractice of this will balance and round out your undoubted head development.I shall not change your work greatly. Continue to ponder upon the thoughts Iearlier gave you as seed ideas for meditation. Take them now, however, as thetheme of your daily recollection and not as seed thoughts for meditation. Followthe group meditation with care for it will give you what you need. For you,during the coming year, the cultivation of a poised [426] recollection and of areflective attitude (held with constancy) is of more importance than half anhour of intense meditation. Bear this in mind. Reflect upon your lastinstructions; they are full of thoughts which you have not yet “inferred” orsensed. Ponder upon them and seek the higher inferences. Clear away the glamourof depression and enter upon the new cycle with joy .~MY BROTHER AND MY FRIEND: September 1937I have much to say to you today but it must be said in a short space of time.Study, therefore, my words with an awakened intuition and with a gladwillingness to learn. You have already received an exceedingly brief line whichI do not wish to be incorporated in any book, having for you much understandingand a recognition of your sensitivity. There is no need for others to read it.It is in connection with this very sensitivity of yours that I seek to speaktoday for I think that I may thereby be of help and save you much futuredifficulty. That is, my brother, if you accept what I say and let not anyreaction to spiritual pride negate the import of my words.In my last Instruction to you, I pointed out the three realities in time, spaceand this incarnation, which you have to face. I warned you against the deepsense of inferiority which sometimes handicaps your life expression. I told youto dwell more constantly in the light which streams from the face of the Angelof the Presence. This you have sought to do. But you forgot one thing and thishas come powerfully to light. The light which streams from the “face of theAngel” (which is the face of the soul), reveals . How does it reveal, mybrother? It reveals by bringing to the surface the hidden things, and the germsof weaknesses, thus revealing defects and liability. I would here point out thatwhen this happens, the sum total of that which is revealed can contribute aglamour, a rising fog, a miasma of poisonous nature. It is like the effect of adawning sun in the early morning on a hot day which draws upwards the mists andthus temporarily forms a fog between itself and the earth. Such was your case.The fog is fast dissipating for, as I said, its appearance is only temporary.[427] Two questions I will ask you here, which I shall not answer for you butwhich, if answered by you with truth and in the presence of the Angel, willserve to dissipate the last traces of this glamour. I have told you that “theexpression of a loving understanding heart” was the goal that you must setyourself. Has this loving understanding been your outstanding quality this lasthalf year? Secondly, is there a possibility that there has been (unrealised byyou) an emergence of the spiritual pride which you were so fast overcoming?Certain knowledges that have come to you from me might tend to foster that prideif exceeding watchfulness were not your major care.One other point I would seek to make. You have a very frail and delicate bodyand the force of the Angel pouring through it will always produce in you quickerreactions than in the average person. Recognise these evoked reactions and thenpass on . Waste not time in too close a self-analysis, or in the agonies ofdisappointment. Forget not what you have been told of the goal which you may setyourself and pass on .Let me tell you the rays of your threefold lower nature. It is needless for meto remind you that your soul ray is the second and your personality ray is thesixth.Your mental body is on the first ray, and I think if you will study this withcare, much of your present problem will become clear to you.Your astral body is also governed by the first ray. This is an exception to thegeneral rule that the second and sixth rays govern the astral bodies of allhumanity. This rule varies occasionally in the case of disciples. Thiscombination of a first ray mental body and a first ray astral body isinteresting and provides you with a definitely difficult problem, for thenecessity to balance and to achieve equilibrium, is enhanced in your case.However, it also makes possible an easier control of the astral body by themind, if you so choose—and you do.The ray of your physical body is the seventh. This I presume you have alreadyguessed. Your rays therefore are:1. The soul ray—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.2. The personality ray—the sixth Ray of Devotion. Idealism.3. The mental body—the first Ray of Will or Power. [428]4. The astral body—the first Ray of Will or Power.5. The physical body—the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Order or Magic.One of the interesting things to be noted (as one studies your ray tendencies)is that all your three bodies are on the line of 1-3-5-7, yet your personalityray is on the 6th, on the line of 2-4-6. Why is this? The reason is that thecontrol of your soul is, in this incarnation, of sufficient power to evoke areaction in all the three vehicles of the personality, and the sixth subray ofeach of the governing rays of the three bodies is so active that it becomes adominating factor. Hence you have a sixth ray personality.~BROTHER OF MINE: February 1938I have for three months been seeking a closer contact with you and perhaps ofthis you are aware. The unit of disciples with which you are affiliated hasalways interested me, due to the importance of its task, and because of thepersonnel of the group and their individual problems. In spite of changes anddifficulties, a group of you within this group have stood steadily from the verystart despite the difficulties interjected by the defection of certain membersand the constant state of glamour in which another brother is habitually to befound; yet, in spite of these changes and difficulties, the group persists andmoves forward in strength. There is no need for discouragement. You, my brother,have done your full share in the preservation of group integrity; I should liketo take this opportunity to tender to you my gratitude for your unfailingcooperation, undertaken in the face of physical liability, home difficulties,personal glamour and deep depression. No matter what has been eventuating inyour personal life and environment, you have stood with steadfastness and havethereby won much for your group.It is not often that I thus commend a brother. More often have I chided orindicated place for improvement and in no case have I ever over-praised. But Iseek today to indicate that your steady service has been noted and I assure youthat progress has been made by you.[429] One hint I would give you also for your encouragement: Much that isregarded by you as faulty and wrong, much that seems to you of hindrance to yourgroup, much of the depression and of glamour in your life has a purely physicalor physiological reason and is, therefore, upon the plane of superficiality . Itleaves the real inner man untouched and leaves your influence, consequently,free to work and move among your brothers. Ponder on this, for it should bringyou renewed assurance of the Plan and of your part in it. Live, therefore,always above your physical body, ignoring how you feel and seeking to dwell asfar as is possible, with your waking consciousness blended and fused with thatof the soul. Even if you feel it not, then know that it is there.I wonder, my brother, if it is possible for me to indicate to you the life ofspiritual insulation which is in no way the life of personal isolation ? In thisstate of “insulated being” lies, for you, the solution of many of your problems.This insulation is brought about by emotional indifference to your environmentand to people, but it is a spiritual indifference, founded on spiritualdetachment and dispassion. When it is present, there comes the fulfilment ofobligation and the performance of duty, but no identification with people orcircumstance. The soul stands free, unattached, unafraid, and is not controlledby that which exists in the three worlds. This is the true spiritualindifference and—for your own release and for greater usefulness in service—Iwould have you meditate on indifference , during the coming six months as themethod to be followed, in order to produce spiritual insulation. I give you noother theme for meditation and no set form. I would suggest that each morning,when you awaken, that you give five minutes to an intensive consideration ofspiritual insulation, after a brief alignment and dedication, and thatthroughout the day you brood and reflect upon this theme. Then at night, orearlier in the evening if more suitable, use divine indifference as a theme forreview.Will you sometime summarise what you have learnt on “Spiritual insulationthrough indifference,” writing a paper upon the subject for the helping ofothers? This constitutes my only assignment of work to you.[430] Your first ray mental body should definitely aid you in this work,provided you ever bear in mind that insulation does not mean isolation and thatindifference does not connote an attitude of cold detached separativeness. Yourfirst ray mental body forms a good cooperating point for your second ray souland this too would I have you bear in mind. It gives you the strength of will topersist , and it should also give you the strength of will to understand, notonly the laws of life, but people and their need of love.1. Your soul expresses its energy through your mental body.2. Your personality force is focussed in your astral body.This year, my brother, should see much growth, for you have learnt and masteredmuch already.REVIEW ON INDIFFERENCE1. What constitutes a review on divine Indifference?a. Am I confusing it with dispassion, or with a refusal to suffer?b. Does it signify in my mind separation and consequent pain?2. Am I capable of seeing myself with indifference, detached emotionally fromany event?a. Can I see mentally, unbiased by any reaction from the emotional personalself?b. Do I ever do this?3. If I use this review on indifference as it should be used, what will be theeffect in my life?a. How would this affect the group in which I seek to work?b. Would this effect be desirable, and do I desire it?4. Is this review a scientific method of achieving indifference?a. Have I ever worked in such a scientific way to achieve this quality ofdiscipleship?b. Do I feel it a desirable thing to try out now?c. Can I be indifferent in a divine way whilst using it?5. What are the reasons for any belief that divine indifference is the way forme to tread today?a. What basis for this do I find in my reading and my studies? [431]b. Does my soul lie behind this urge or pressure towards indifference which isbrought to bear upon me?6. Would indifference intensify my capacity for increased usefulness in service?a. In what way?b. How does it help my progress on the path?7. If it is true that the blind must advance by touching , by keeping attached,and by keeping hold; but that those with sight, by seeing and by keeping freeand unattached; why then, having sight, do I close my eyes and hold on and feelmy way instead of seeing it?8.

Have I practised an indifferent attitude to myself when circumstances arosewhich threatened my emotional poise?10. We are told that self-realisation is our immediate goal; in view of this,what do I know about:a. The indifference of the soul or self to the fragmentary self?b. The illusion of identification of that self with the little self?11. Again we are told that there is an archetype, a pattern, a way, a goal, alight upon the Path.a. Which of these words expresses my personal objective and why?b. How far is the archetypal pattern reflected in my life?c. What attachments prevent its full expression?12.

What attitude and qualities will have to be developed in me if I am rightlyto practise indifference?15. What is the objective of such a practice? Can I express it formally tomyself?a. In terms of my three bodies or aspects?b. In terms of discipleship?Take each of these questions for two days at a time and give them concentratedthought each month for a year.~BROTHER OF MINE: February 1939I would like, first of all, to point out that this newly opened door for servicehas been earned by you, by your strenuous effort to meet the requirements ofyour soul and to subordinate your personality to these demands. You have mademuch progress along this line and will find release and the reward ofopportunities to serve in this new development which has come your way. Shoulderit lightly, my brother, remembering that it is your task to set things in motionand to aid others by your poise and your wisdom so that they can carry on. Letnot the glamour of time, of sensed need and of feverish activity descend uponyou. Your task is to fill the hours of other people with indicated service,which is suggested and outlined by you; it is to meet the needs, one by one, asthey arise but not to meet all the need at once. You must build for theimmediate future and should engineer those controlled activities which willdemonstrate success because they work through from the mental plane, via theworld of evoked desire, and so into physical plane manifestation. This processyou must demonstrate. Therefore, work through others; this is the way theHierarchy works, [433] watching and suggesting and developing the innate facultyof prevision—a thing which you can easily do. This faculty is being developed inthe race of men through the foresight required in meeting business needs. Trainothers to do the detailed work and work yourself behind the scenes—as we work.You have made such a close study and analysis of your rays that there is no needfor me to elaborate the theme. You have studied them in the light of your souland have grasped the peculiar danger inherent in your two first ray personalityvehicles. They are a real source of difficulty if not mellowed and motivated bya loving spirit and qualified by that divine indifference, the acquiring ofwhich has been your major lesson this life.Be of good cheer, brother of mine. You are needed by us.NOTE: This disciple has never wavered from his determination to work in theTibetan’s group and is there actively engaged.~TO P. D. W.January 1936MY BROTHER:With patience you have handled life. Your moments of deep depression (mountingat times in the past almost to crises of despair), are well nigh over. You arebecoming more and more immersed in the service of your fellowmen, and aredrawing closer to the goal which has been set you.One of the problems which all sincere disciples have to solve is to learn tolive as if the physical body did not exist. By that I mean that its limitationsand the hindrances which it imposes upon the expression of the free, spiritualconsciousness are negated by an inner attitude of mind. It is the cultivation ofa detached attitude to life and to circumstances which has constituted yourmajor lesson in this particular incarnation. You are learning it. With a senseof inner freedom, you must learn to function as a Messenger, despite allhandicaps and the demands of a physical vehicle, too frail really to handle theforce [434] which must flow through. Some people, my brother, are so constitutedthat they become servers and centres of light publicly before their fellowmen.Their influence and their power are great. Others work (with equal power ) froma quiet centre of relative retirement, and they wield, if I may again repeatmyself, an equal force. For them comes the practice of that spiritualdiscrimination which does not separate, and yet which wisely chooses where theavailable strength, effort and light must be placed. Put your strength and lightbehind that of the workers who serve the Hierarchy upon the open battlefield oflife. That is my word for you this day. Let the workers and those who wieldinfluence find in you an understanding comrade, and, withal, one who knows . Inthe heat and pressure of the fight and the fatigue incident to the strain ofactive service for the Hierarchy, let them feel that in you they have someone towhom they can turn—detached and consecrated. Let them find in you someone whoseeyes see clearly because they are not dimmed by the fog and smoke of the outerworld battle. Such is your service, and for it I ask on behalf of those who (astime elapses) I shall send to you. Watch for them; recognise them and help them.This I can trust you to do.I have given some thought to exercises which may aid you and some measuredconsideration to your meditation work. I have kept you waiting for your personalinstructions, because you were capable of carrying on the process of integrationalone and unaided, and it is always better so. I have decided to give you nobreathing exercises for the space of six months, but I will ask you to do twothings: First, lay the emphasis of your attention upon the full moon work.Prepare for the work to be done at that time throughout the entire month,working with deliberation and scientifically each day with the thought in yourmind of those five climaxing days of esoteric work each month. Build towards thefull moon moment, when, in company with your fellow disciples, you make your“approach” and can be the recipient of certain forces which you must learn towield. Will you shoulder responsibility in connection with a certain piece ofwork? You will know to what I refer. Secondly: Follow each day the meditationoutlined below, keeping careful record of all that may transpire. At the end ofsix months, prepare [435] a digest of your spiritual diary and an analysis ofprogress and of events. This need not be seen by anyone unless you so desire.But keep the diary and analyse results.The meditation work and thoughts suggested are to preface the group meditationwhich I would be glad to have you do, along with your group brothers. After duecomposure and a clearing of the mind in any manner which may be to you familiarand adequate then proceed as indicated. . . .The following seed thoughts can be used by you in your meditation, if you sodesire:1st month—Joy—Like a bird on the wing, I fly towards the sun. I sing in my soulso that all I meet can hear.2nd month—Strength—Like an ox that is yoked to its fellow, I carry the load oflife. Yet I am not alone. With my brothers and Master, I share the load.3rd month—Impulse—Like a child that calls forth the love of those around, I tooevoke the love of my brothers. That love I render back, unthinking andunattached.4th month—Power—Like a cistern that gathers and stores that which is needed byman, the water of life that nourishes, I, too, store that which is needed byothers. I store not for myself. Power is needed for their work; therefore Igather and store, seeking the source of supply.5th month—Beauty—Colour is mine. I claim it for my own, for colour and qualityare one. Yet I share with my fellows.6th month—Understanding—Sorrow is mine, but it is the fruitful seed of wisdom.Like a sage, I endure and garner the fruit of wisdom for others.I add no more to the above outline of meditation. Incorporate the groupmeditation and any work that you yourself choose to do. Only one thing I ask: Ateach meditation, pour out love and wisdom on your group brothers, making yourlink with your soul, with me, and with the group, and regard yourself only as achannel through which help may come. My blessing rests upon you.[436] Your rays are as follows:The egoic ray—ray 2, the Ray of Love-Wisdom.The personality ray—ray 6, the Ray of Devotion, of Idealism.In your last life your personality ray was the first, which fact may explainmuch to you anent your reactions in this life.~BROTHER OF MINE: November 1936I am giving you only a short instruction this time. We are often in touch andyou are occupied now with fresh adjustments to life. These adjustments arenecessary and right, and I do not seek to interfere or to complicate your mindin any way. The past three years have brought to you many changes—some of themin circumstance, environment and in the field of human contacts, but most ofthem of an interior nature and in the realm of consciousness.You are entering into a period of intensive work. Two things, however, I wouldsay to you, my brother and my friend, at this time:1. Guard with care the physical body. You are one of those people who must learnto work through the medium of a frail and delicate physical body and you couldgreatly hinder its usefulness if you forced it to do too much active externalwork. It is not capable of much outer physical contact or of rapid and frequentchange and of hard work. Guard it well and cherish it with care.2. Remember that it is not where you are but what you are that matters and whichis of importance. From the quiet spot where you have lived and where you canrightly care for the physical body (your instrument of service on the outerplane of life), there can emanate such spiritual force and living wisdom thatyou can serve a multitude. You can serve them from there without the rough outercontacts that more physically robust workers can endure. Serve from the centrewithin yourself by pen and thought and interview, but go not out into contactwith the world.[437] If you can do these two things, there is much that you can accomplish forus and much service that you can render to the Hierarchy which you love andserve, and you can do it over your full period of time. But if you forget thesetwo suggestions, it will not be easy for you to carry on and you will not beable to fulfil your intended task for us with the desired perfection. Your workis along the lines of radiation and interpretation.The only other thing I seek to do today is to tell you the nature of yourpersonality rays and thereby bring you to a clearer understanding of yourself.As you know, your egoic or soul ray is the second Ray of Love-Wisdom, and yourpersonality ray is the sixth Ray of Devotion. There is no need for me to do morethan indicate to you that the following contacts are easy for you to make, owingto this combination.1. A contact with your soul. This is already made and established.2. A contact with the Hierarchy, through the medium of your soul.3. Contact with the astral plane, through your sixth ray personality whichfunctions easily, therefore, on the sixth plane, the astral.4. Contact with ideas, through an active intuition.These are definitely assets and are the hallmark of the advanced disciple. ThisI think you know without my telling you. But all these contacts involve thehandling of force and present their own unique problems.Your mental body is on the fifth Ray of Concrete Knowledge or Science. Henceyour interest and usefulness in the science of astrology which is in many waysthe science of sciences. Hence also your keen mind, your untiring search fortruth and your power to achieve light on many matters. The one point you shouldremember is that the fifth ray is a crystallising factor and (in conjunctionwith the will and power developed by you in your last life) could tend to makeyou dogmatic and consequently separative. This must be offset by your second raysoul.Your astral body is on the sixth ray, as is your personality, and this greatlyaids you in your life task, provided that you [438] use the astral body as themedium of soul expression and not as an agent, per se , on the astral plane.This ray force gives you devotion, idealism, a dynamic will to pierce throughall glamours and misconceptions and thus achieve truth and freedom, both foryourself and for your group and those you serve. It could give you also, if youpermitted it, a tendency to be yourself glamoured and overcome by illusion.Your physical body is on the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Order or Magic; here isto be found the source of much of your ill-health. The seventh plane is theplane upon which spirit must express itself. It is the receptacle of spiritualenergy. Your physical vehicle and medium of expression is of such a sensitiveand refined nature and so frail a receptacle that your life problem is to handlewisely the spiritual energy which seeks to pour through. This constitutes a veryreal problem which you have faced for years and must continue to face.This present cycle or period in your life is one in which you are called upon toface certain definite decisions. For this reason, I give you no work, exceptthat which the group is doing, and no special meditation. Your major work atthis time (and the theme of your meditation) is the arriving at right decisionas you enter into a new period of spiritual activity. The problem goes deep. Butyou can solve it if you act with slowness, if you call on your soul to throwlight upon your way, and if you bear in mind the two suggestions I made to youearlier in this instruction. Also, my brother, as has often been the case inother lives, I stand by you in love and understanding.~MY BROTHER AND MY FRIEND: May 1937Our relation has been close for many lives and is particularly close today.Unknown perhaps to you, I have guarded and shielded you from many unhappy worldimpacts, for you are sensitive in nature and frail in body and are alreadyhandling as much of the world’s misery and suspense as you can and perhaps morethan is good for you—physically and emotionally. You are like so many disciplesupon the second ray who are in training for future world salvaging. Like ourGreat Master, the Christ, you must and do shoulder your share of the world [439]suffering, thereby forming one of the great group of His companions who arepledged to the “fellowship of His sufferings and His patience,” as He is pledgedto His great Master, the Lord of Shamballa. He, as you know, will not leave Hispost until the “last weary pilgrim has found his way home.” You see, therefore,do you not, the true significance of the three keywords which I gave you whenyou entered this group —endless patience , with yourself, with others and witherring humanity; dynamic thought , giving you power and usefulness upon themental plane and teaching you to work there as does the Christ, as does K.H. andall who are serving in connection with the Hierarchy; wisdom , enabling you toreap the fruitage of many lives, spent in acquiring spiritual knowledge.Your field of service is real. Be not discouraged, my brother. Your physicalproblem (e’en when you give it a technical name) is far more concerned with thepouring in of vital forces, which make a violent impact upon a frail body thanit is with disease, per se . Remember that inner acquiescence with physicallimitations is the key to much release for you. When that form of divineindifference is active in your life and consciousness then you are free for afuller mental service and to that service you are called.Your problem closely resembles that of A.A.B. whose health is now seriouslyimpaired and who also has to fight an inner revolt against her limitations—as doall active and hard-working disciples whose equipment is not strong enough tohandle adequately the forces which are flowing through them to the world.Therefore help each other.I want, my brother, to give you a visualisation exercise which may help yousomewhat. Breathing exercises are not advisable in your case nor are theyparticularly necessary. I would ask you for a few minutes each morning (prior todoing the group meditation) to rest quietly back in your chair or bed and,closing your eyes, link up with your soul and with me, your friend. You willthus create a triangle of light between your soul, your head centre and myself.Fix and hold this triangle firmly in your consciousness through the power of thecreative imagination. Then see it next as a solid triangle of light and not justas an outline. The base of the triangle is on the [440] mental plane where Iwork and where dwells and works your soul; the lower point or apex touches thetop of your head. Then see, pouring down, via the triangle, a stream of light,golden in colour and not white . It is more light orange than white. See thisflooding your whole body. When you have visualised this as perfectly aspossible, then rest back in that light and bathe in it as you would bathe in thewaters of the sea. See it permeating every part of your physical equipment andlet it do its work without your having any definite ideas as to what should beaccomplished. The rest of the activity is in my hands and you can safely leaveit to me. This exercise will aid you in handling your life problem and yourservice, until such time as you enter into that light wherein consciousnessawakens, free from the bonds of flesh. But that time is not immediate.The blessing of your co-disciples is upon you and yours on them.~BROTHER OF OLD: January 1940Of all the members in your particular group, you are perhaps the freest from anyserious glamour and the one which (almost necessarily and protectively) controlsyou is the glamour of physical disability. This physical difficulty initiates inyou a profound feeling of futility and a constantly wearing realisation ofincomplete service. This is most definitely a glamour. The power of an unimpededchannel in the hands of the Hierarchy is far greater than you know and, thoughfor you there can be no activity in the front rank of the battle, I would remindyou that the Hierarchy Itself stands behind the scene of world affairs and worksever through others; It stands between those who are bearing the burden of thedirect contact and the immediate work in the warfare now raging between theForces of Light and the Forces of Materialism.Will you so stand, my brother? Will you cease from the constant urging desire tobe of greater outer usefulness? The Law of Acceptance is a divine law andreleases from glamour, freeing the soul for the reality of service. I stand byyou at all times.~[441] MY BROTHER OF LONG STANDING: August 1940I have for you a brief message which I am asking A.A.B. to incorporate in hernext letter to you. I would have you know that I have had you in my thoughts, mycare and my love; that there is not a moment of the day when my shielding loveis not around you. You will remember the three words I gave you some years agowhich were to be the keynotes of your life? The patience you have for long yearssustained; the service to your fellowmen in giving dynamic thought should beyour service today, reaching out to me and embracing your fellowmen. From thesetwo—patience and clear thought—wisdom must come and wisdom is sorely needed inthe world today. Your field of service is around you and embraces all who comeyour way, and the path of this service leads straight to me, my brother....NOTE: This disciple was an ex-Jesuit priest and a Frenchman. He resided inHolland. The last two communications from the Tibetan were received by himshortly after the Germans entered Holland. This gives great significance to theTibetan’s words. P.D.W. died later in the year, and “ceased from the outeractivity,” referred to by the Tibetan .~TO W. O. I.August 1936BROTHER OF MINE:For some few years now you have been definitely orienting yourself to the lifeand status of the Path of Discipleship. This has involved, in your case, thecareful training of yourself in selfless service, and the speeding up of thestimulation that your soul was imposing upon your personality and applying toyour psychic nature. The first discipline you undertook willingly and understoodwell. It was definitely self-imposed. The second, emanating more directly fromthe soul, has caused you at times a certain amount of bewilderment, as all entryinto the world of psychic events and psychic phenomena inevitably [442] must.The focus of your attention being upon the soul and its life and world of being,it has been difficult for you at times to interpret other phenomenal happenings.With all this, however, be not unduly concerned. The fitting of yourself to bean interpreter is an important part of your training; for this purpose your soulhas brought you into incarnation in this cycle. Apart from the fact that you areequipped for your professional duties, the particular field of activity hasprovided for you a needed forcing ground. The group activity with which you areengaged, the play of adolescent minds and emotions upon your psychic equipmenthas given you the stimulation needed to evoke certain reactions and responseswhereby you, the Observer, can learn. Your weaknesses and equally your strengthswill be revealed to you.The essential attitude for you to cultivate is that of the One Who looks on,that of the Beholder, the Perceiver, and the Observer, leading—upon the Path ofDiscipleship—to that of the Interpreter. In these words I give you the keynoteof your present soul cycle, which will cover several incarnations, but whichwill eventually release you and send you forth as one who can prepare to treadthe Path of the Revealer of Wisdom. I would remind you in this connection thatthe second ray expression falls into two categories—wisdom and love. For you, itmust be the way of wisdom. Ponder upon the significance of wisdom. Your egoicray being the second and your personality ray, the fifth, you will note howthoroughly equipped you are for your undertaking in this life. This, it is ofassistance to know. In the next instructions, when I shall indicate to you therays governing the threefold personality, you will then have before you the fiverays with which you are concerned in this life and which are instrumental inlaying the foundation for your next life. You will then understand still moreclearly.In the meantime, work steadily at the assumption of the position of theObserver, making it a habit of your life. To this end, you will find attached tothis instruction a review on the attitude of the Observer which may be ofassistance to you as you prepare for work in this group and for the gradualdevelopment of your psychic powers.As you work at this problem, will you endeavour to take and hold the position ofthe “one at the centre,” carrying this [443] consciousness with you at all timesand dealing with your associates and those whom you instruct from this attitude.This will, in itself, constitute an arduous undertaking and will serve tostabilise your orientation and your direction, using this last word in itsesoteric meaning. I would suggest, therefore, that you start your meditationeach morning by achieving this position as well as may be, focussing yourself inthe head and raising your consciousness to as high a point as possible.Then, for the next six months, take the following statements for the seedthoughts in your meditation work, thus building in the idea as profitably as youcan and—during the day—endeavouring to work out the spiritual concept in yourdaily life. This effort should serve to link your personality and soul and tocoordinate your mind and brain.First month I am the Observer, Who dwells ever at the centre. Second month I amthe Interpreter, Who works ever from the centre. Third month I am the Desirer,Who draws all unto the centre. Fourth month I am the Dweller in the High Place,Who sees ever from the centre. Fifth month I am the Lover of men, Who pours outlove from the centre of love. Sixth month I am the Educator, Who, learningmyself at the centre, lifts thereto all I seek to help.At the end of six months’ application to these ideas and to this vision, youwill comprehend the motive that has prompted me to give you these seed thoughtsand will then be ready for the more intensive work I propose for you and myother disciples.REVIEW ON THE ATTITUDE OF THE OBSERVER1. What constitutes a review?a. Am I confusing a re-viewing with a re-doing or with a re-experiencing? [444]b. Do I understand what I mean when I regard myself as an Observer?2. What or who is the Observer? What is under observation?3. Am I capable of learning to observe, and of freeing myself from those resultsof observation which may not be desirable?4. Can I observe myself mentally, unbiased by any reaction from the emotionalpersonal self?5. If I use this review on the attitude of the Observer as it should be used,a. What will be the effect in my life?b. What will be the effect in the life of the group I wish to serve?6. Can I honestly say that I can stand aside and observe with dispassion?7. If this review work is a definitely scientific method of development, have Iever given the technique of observation a fair trial? Do I feel it now to bedesirable? Why?8. What basis can I find in my studies that this method of reviewing is the wayfor me, and that it will intensify my capacity for increased usefulness inservice?9. In what way can right observation speed my progress upon the Path?10. If it is true that the blind must advance by touching but that those withsight move forward by seeing , and by keeping free and unattached, why, then,having sight, do I close my eyes and fail to observe? What is the mainhindrance?11. Is my mind the organ of observation for the spiritual man? Can I offer thisorgan to the observer to use?12. Can I hold my mind steady in the light which streams from the Observer? CanI hold it as the searchlight of the soul?13. As I review today, what part has observation played?14. How do I define the word “observation”?15. Observation in the spiritual sense is a faculty which grows out ofSelf-realisation.a. Am I able to forget the fragmentary personal self?b. Can I centre my consciousness in the Self?16. Observation is a power of the Observer. It works in association [445] withthe mind. Do I understand and wield this power?17. We are told that there is an archetype, a pattern, a ray, a goal and a lightwhich reveals these higher patterns or divine ideas. Do I know anything of this?I mean, practically, in my daily life.18. What is the archetypal pattern of observation, and how can it be expressedin my personal life?19. Do I recognise and am I in touch with other Observers of the way of life?20. Can I draw upon the power of observation and the wisdom of the Observer whenothers need it?21. I am the redeemer of the lower nature. In what way does observation aid inthis redemption?22. Does redeeming force, released through observation, pour through me?23. In what fashion will the observation of the Observer bring changes in mylife, my habits, and my attitudes?24. Through which body do I most easily express myself? Which of my bodiesrequires the most observation and control?25. Have I demonstrated the powers of observation today? Have I been inconscious contact at any moment with the Observer?26. What activities and qualities of my lower nature (good as well asundesirable) need to be observed if I desire to serve more intelligently?27. What is the major hindrance to my constant practice of observation? How canI offset this difficulty?28. How does the assumption of the attitude of the Observer assist my fellowmen?29. In what way can I most truly serve them? And how will observation help me todo this?~BROTHER OF MINE: March 1937I fancy, if you were asked the question, that you would regard the past year asone of the most educational and most developing that you have ever experiencedthis incarnation. [446] Something has happened to you that has “carried rightthrough” from your soul to your brain. The result has been integrating,satisfying (in spite of incidental suffering) and relational in its effects.Such interludes of unfoldment in the life of an aspirant carry with them a highresponsibility and, for the remainder of your life, you can—if you sochoose—produce a definite effect upon those whose lives you are privileged tocontact and to whom you can stand as a tower of strength in a world whereadjustments and re-orientation are going on. Because of these adjustments,certain great transitions in consciousness are in order and taking place. Someof the lessons you have learnt have not yet emerged into your waking brainconsciousness, but that is of no moment for they can still bear fruit interiorlyand, my brother, it is our subjective effort which is the most potent at alltimes.I would ask you, in view of the past year’s events, to proceed for the next fewmonths with a relative slowness and with a real patience with yourself. Irecommend that you do not indulge in any self-analysis, for you will thus givetime for the desired unfoldments to stabilise and the processes of spiritualassimilation to proceed, unhindered by the activity of the lower mind.With you, as with my other disciples in preliminary training, I would like toindicate the conditioning rays of the personality for—if you accept mysuggestions and then test and prove them—you will arrive at a betterunderstanding of the intended personality task and be free to participate in thegroup work as time proceeds. It should always be borne in mind that when I speakof the rays of the various bodies, I am referring to the dominant force whichconditions them in any particular life, to the possible effect that the impactof that force—regulated or unregulated—may have upon surrounding people, and tothe responsive, sensitive or impressionable substance with which the soul hasperforce to work. I refer to what constitutes the material expression. This isperhaps one of the platitudes of the occult position, but it is of value attimes to reiterate. In the case of students such as those of you in this group,it is one of the fundamental recollections and upon it all your effectiveness inwork depends.[447] As you know, you have a peculiar combination of dominant rays, the secondRay of Love-Wisdom being your soul ray and the fifth Ray of Concrete Sciencebeing your personality ray . I would have you ponder on the relationship whichnecessarily exists in your case between knowledge and wisdom. You would find itof value to put a considerable amount of thought into the relation of the threeaspects of intelligent manifestation: the higher, abstract mind, the intelligentsolar angel, and the lower concrete mind. Intuitive understanding, love-wisdomand concrete knowledge should be and can be developed and related by you in yourdaily life; to this I call your attention.Your mental body is on the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict, and hence thepattern of your life has been what it has. With you, however, the majorexpression of this activity should be in relation to those with whom you have towork in your chosen field of life service; the harmony achieved is theresolution of the conflict in the lives of those around you who are in processof adjustment to life. The conflicts within yourself are understood by you andcan be rapidly resolved. It is the effect of your mental body upon others that Iwould seek to have you most definitely consider. Upon the probationary path, theforces of man’s lower nature and their interior interplay is of paramountimportance; he must learn to know himself. On the path of discipleship, thesesame forces must be studied in relation to those with whom destiny, karma andvocational choice has thrown the disciple. On the path of initiation, these sameforces are used in conscious cooperation with the Plan, and with adequate skillin action, due to the lessons learnt on the earlier stages of the path.Your astral body is on the sixth ray. This, I think, you have yourselfsuspected. This gives you intensity in aspiration and the dynamic will to pushforward which has sufficed hitherto to carry you over all obstacles. You havesucceeded in avoiding the usual difficulties of personality development wherethe sixth ray is concerned, and fanatical adherences to people or schools ofthought. That is good. The transmuted, reoriented, higher attributes of thosequalities should be your goal.[448] You have a seventh ray physical body . You will note, therefore, in yourpersonality equipment two lines of force which are in the first ray field ofvital effectiveness: The fifth Ray of Concrete Science and the seventh Ray ofCeremonial Order or Magic. The other energies which constitute your workingmaterial are all on the second ray line: 2-4-6. Along that line you have a fulland adequate equipment. You have only one major ray energy working through youin this incarnation, and that is the second. It was the recognition of thatwhich induced me to give you the word “interpretation” as your most importantkeyword, for it would evoke in you qualities along the line of the third Ray ofActive Intelligence, which is closely allied to your fifth ray personality.Will you, during the coming months, take the theme of Interpretation as yourmost important meditation task?~BROTHER OF MINE: November 1937There is little need for me to say much to you at this time. Your spiritual lifeduring this past year has been vivid and alive. See that it so remains in spiteof any interludes of aridness and of reaction which might come your way. Alllife is cyclic and this is a point which disciples are apt to forget andoverlook; they then find themselves discouraged when the intensity of feelingleaves them. The initiate walks ever a straight course between the pairs ofopposites, serene and unafraid. Are you not all upon the path of discipleshipwith the inevitable goal of initiation sometime, some immediate living moment,just ahead?I gave you some keywords which should be for you a source of inspiration duringthe coming year. I would ask you to study them and to ponder deeply theirsignificance. Take one word each week for a few minutes’ careful consideration(prior to the group meditation) and make it the keynote of your week’s endeavourin the practice of spiritual living. Do this with the point in view ofexternalising these concepts in your service in your chosen field of work. Youwill gain much practical and experimental experience thereby. During the fourthweek review your life in the light which these three words can throw [449] uponit. You will never regret doing this exercise. There is no further need for youto do the review on Interpretation.And this is all I have to say to you, my brother, at this time. The servicewhich your group can render, as outlined by me in this instruction, must engrossyour attention and will give you much. The inner link upon the spiritual sidebetween all the group members is growing firm and clear and I am encouraged itis so.~MY BROTHER: January 1940How shall I make clear to you the nature of the glamour which at this time canhinder your close integration into this group of brothers? It is of so subtle akind that, perhaps, I cannot make it present as a fact in your consciousness;only where glamour is recognised and seen for what it is, is it possible todissipate it. It is not the glamour of criticism or of undue analysis that isyour problem. It is in some way a result or sequence, growing out of these twoaspects of mental activity and yet it is neither of them exactly. Perhaps Imight call it the “glamour of the Judge”—trained, wise, experienced but foreverexercising (as a life habit) the prerogative of the judgment seat. A case inpoint, my brother, which may serve to illustrate my point was your reaction tothe ——. For several days I watched your inner turmoil and distress until youescaped by the door of decisive judgment distributing the blame, exoneratingsome and resting back upon the assumed correctness of your decision. Yet youknew not enough—even about your own group.At the same time, your rays are such that they constitute a deep pool or well ofloving understanding; it is only your fifth ray personality that stands in theway of a full expression of the love which is truly your major and outstandingquality. This, your mental and astral vehicles (being both along the line of thesecond ray) will aid you in expressing. But it is the task of the fifth ray(when dominating the personality) to dissect, to analyse, and to come toconclusions and this is a glamour, requiring most careful handling or a barrierwill be set up—in your case—between the soul and the three vehicles through themedium of the synthesising of personality energy. Ponder on [450] this. Think itout, for when you have clarified the issue in your own mind, you will havecleared away one of the most potent of the relatively few things which hold youback from a very important step forward.It is not easy for disciples or initiates to identify themselves with weaknessor with failure, and yet that must be done. They constitute just as much a partof the expression of humanity as does strength or success, and there can be noseparation in attitude or failure in identification. Disciples have to learn toidentify themselves with the whole.~BROTHER OF MINE: June 1940In dealing with you as an integral part of my Ashram, I have for the first timesince you were admitted into this group relation a sense of freedom inapproaching you. You have learned much and unfolded much during the past twoyears. There are still areas of unresolved doubts and the presence of manyquestions in your mind, but your attitude towards them is definitely changed.You are not so sure and you are entirely willing to wait for, and later to putto the proof, the answers and the solutions. That is much to have achieved.Matters in the world today are in great confusion, owing to the appallingdisturbance and condition of the astral plane. Though world affairs seem to bebad enough upon the physical plane, they are nothing to be compared to thepresent level of awareness where glamour rules, where desire and aspiration arerampant and where those on the inner side (who possess the eye of vision) cansee the turmoil and the whirlpool of terrific forces, seeking violent outletupon the physical plane.Broadly speaking, these forces can be met in three ways. There is the long andalmost endless process of letting things work themselves out under evolutionarylaw, leaving to the inevitability of evolution and of law the stemming of theastral cataract and the quieting of the hurricane. In the meantime, millionswould suffer needlessly and for too long, which is perhaps the most importantpoint. That the process of patient waiting in idealistic and prayerful idlenesswould finally triumph is incontrovertible but to what avail, if humanity is too[451] worn out and too exhausted and too retarded and hindered by aretrogressive materialistic civilisation to profit by the long awaited turn ofthe tide in human affairs?I, a member of the Hierarchy who necessarily knows more than you do, tell youtoday that humanity as a whole (distributed over the entire planet) has enduredalready its full quota of karma and that what may come now of grief, sorrow andpain is that which may prove too much. Just as there is a point in the life ofthe individual where he can stand no more but lapses into unconsciousness, loseshis reason, or dies, so it can be equally true of mankind as a whole. Bear thisin mind. It is to this that those who would take no steps to arrest disaster(because they believe in what they call the will of God or karmic retribution orsome beloved ideal) would condemn humanity. I am endeavouring here to give youthe wider picture as We see it and so to answer some of the problems of yourrightly questioning mind. There is a general principle of timing involved and ofthe right moments for action as well as those moments in which inaction is thecorrect approach.Then there is the second possibility in which the world situation can be handledand solved in terms of force—the force to be applied being evoked under the lawof action and reaction, and then utilised by those who see the vision of thefuture and the larger picture and issues, and who are pledged to the releasingof humanity . It is not force (as applied upon the physical plane) which is atany time wrong; it is the motive and method used, leading to and governing theuse of force which are the factors of momentous import. Though no person orgroup of persons or nation at this time knows the meaning of motive (for that isonly really known and comprehended by those who have advanced beyond the thirdinitiation) yet there are persons, groups of persons and nations in the worldtoday who can be permitted to use force against forms and materialism because ofthe preponderance of pure motive to be found present in their consciousness. Theright use of obstructing and of death-dealing energy can be trusted to those whoare consciously endeavouring to help humanity and to liberate it, as a whole andnot as a part. This must naturally include themselves and is safe, provided thatthe voices of those who see the [452] vision of the future are given freeexpression and permitted a hearing. There is, therefore, in this method theprobability of a quicker ending of the present conflict and world crisis and theconsequent release of the new order.The third way has in it much of danger to the unfolding consciousness ofhumanity and that is the way of divine intervention. With this I do not intendto deal as I said all that I find it possible to say in connection with the newInvocation.My brother, there are points which revolve in your mind and which, in spite ofthe application which is obvious, can all three be applied to situations andconditions which exist between individuals, families and groups or to the largerunit, the world.Those of you who are in a position to aid unfolding minds, as you are today, andwho possess fifth ray personalities as you do, can affect many minds and lay thefoundation for lives and activities based upon right thought. It is in yourfield of activity that the world must eventually find the instruction which willlead to right action, based on right understanding of the Plan, and to a righthandling of the younger generation (a thing hitherto totally unknown). In thisway, the world may be remodelled by wise planning, placed will (if such a phrasemeans anything to you. It involves conscious focus) and increased activity andmomentum. But such right activity will only be possible and the desired endshastened when people of your generation and opportunity can—in this interludebetween the old order and the new—think with clarity, see the issues clearly andin their true relativity, and can inspire the young ones also to see.The process of expanding your consciousness to grasp the larger issue is nevereasy, particularly with a fifth ray personality and a sixth ray astral body.That is why you have a mental body which is conditioned by the fourth ray; yourbattle for vision and inclusiveness must be fought out in the mind and onrealised mental levels; that is for you definitely a mental issue. Your task isto link the emotional and the intuitional nature and so evoke spiritualsensitivity to revelation . To that, you must add the conscious bringing throughof the unfolding light into the area of the physical brain, thus making what[453] you know and see available to others. This must be done in three ways:1. By evoking the intuition more potently.2. By stimulating the mind to greater scope for recognition.3. By throwing the light of the intuition and the knowledge possessed on to thefuture as well as on to the coming world order.You will see, therefore, why I have dealt with the world problem; you can onlyachieve a steady, forward-looking attitude and really work at futurestabilisation and reconstruction from the vantage ground of your own ascertainedand controlled beliefs.I am not going to give you an ordinary, set meditation to follow. I am going toask you to give fifteen minutes intensive thought each day to the problem of thefuture, asking you, first of all, to achieve as stable a measure of alignment asyou can, to raise your consciousness to as high a level of awareness aspossible, and then to take the three following topics into your reflections,dealing with them in two ways:1. As they grow out of the past, seeking to note what should be rightlydestroyed.2. As they should evolve, from your point of view, in the future, giving theircontribution to the coming period of reconstruction, and providing that bridgingnew thing which will be in line with the requirements of the New Age—again asyou sense and interpret these.I will, therefore, give you three such topics:1. The coming nature or type of world government, considering what should emergeout of the present, major, world ideologies.2. The coming world education and what should develop in that field of training.What are the needs of the coming generation?3. The coming world religion and what should constitute its major and universaltenets.I would like you to give nine months to this work, giving three months to eachof these world topics. If I might suggest, my [454] brother, I would like to seeyou give two months to reflection, meditation and mental activity on the themeof the period, and then (during the third month) I would have you reduce yourideas to form and on paper. Will you do this nine months’ work for the aiding ofyour group usefulness in the world, for use and aid by many others and for me? Iput these incentives in the order of their importance.There is an unusual depth of love and understanding in your nature. Give of itfreely to all.NOTE: This disciple severed his relation with the group because he felt that theTibetan failed to appreciate what the group was doing. It was his own doing andthe door stands open for his return whenever he so desires.~TO D. I. J.July 1933MY BROTHER:The possibility of a definite step forward is yours—a step which will enable youto take up your life’s burden, when it is next imposed upon you, in fullconsciousness of what you are and of what you must do. The period of gropingalong the path with only the dim light of an illumined aspiration, is slowlygiving place to the sure knowledge of an illumined mind. You ask me at times:“What prevents fuller light and understanding?” I reply: “A sensitivity whichrenders you so constantly self-conscious (by that I mean conscious of thepersonality) that your very assets as an aspirant seem to you sometimes to standin your way.”Forget not, brother of old, that a consecrated personality must not loom solarge that it shuts out, at times, that to which it is consecrated; neither musta realisation of your failure to achieve your high ideals afford you a handicap.The time comes now in your life wherein you must conform to the ancient rule andbecome the sannyasin, the detached follower of the Way. You are now in the worldbut are not of the world; you must now dwell in that high and secret place where[455] divinity is ever sensed. Some call this the practice of the Presence ofGod; others regard it as walking in the light of the soul; still others term itthe conscious treading of the Path. It matters not the name. For you, it is thesteady transference out of the heart into the head and this, I think, you know.Follow the breathing exercises with care and with attention. Seek also tostrengthen the physical body. For you I suggest also the following exercise, tobe performed at some time convenient to you, though not at the morningmeditation.1. Take seven long deep breaths, though hold not the nostril.2. At each breath, as you inhale, say the following words: “Power and strengthis mine.” During the interlude, gather in as much of the golden-orange prana asyou can; then, as you exhale, send it by an act of the will to the throat centreat the back of the neck.3. In the interlude, between exhalation and the next inhalation (whilst thethroat centre is subjected to golden-orange prana) say: “Let the Word soundforth through me.”4. Then sound the O.M., very softly.Be attached to souls, my brother, but detached from personalities. Souls healand aid each other’s personalities. Personality relationships drain anddevitalise. I shall have more to say in six months time when you are furtheradjusted to the work.~BROTHER OF OLD: January 1934The past six months have been for you a period of change, of readjustment anddifficulty. The testing of the intuition to which you and others were subjectedhas not constituted for you, the chief problem. Your intuition functioned andyou saw clearly the group implications, as you did also in the matter of Dr. . .. . For you there has been the long test of endurance, and that is for you—asfor many—a test of real importance and significance. The power to persist whenphysical liability and [456] disability call aloud for cessation of the effort,the ability to stand steady when the sense of futility seems to overwhelm, andthe capacity to function as a soul detached from personal reactions—this is foryou the desired achievement. So be it, brother. This you have demanded foryourself; but remember that the incentive, leading to success, must beachievement for the group . Freedom from personality problems does not interestyou basically. Such problems provide not for you sufficient or adequate motiveto warrant the strain and effort. But usefulness to the group and the providingof a channel whereby spiritual light and love may enter into the living organismof the group, that must be for you the requisite motive, and this must be bornein mind when the strain and effort is at its height.You are at the point in your development where the helping of others must beyour constant outlet, beginning with your home circle, and reaching out to yourfellow disciples and your environment. It is not for you the adding of increasedwork but the constant inner pressure of constructive thinking. In all groups,each unit contributes somewhat to the group thought content. Your contributionmust be the pouring in of mental devotion, thus stimulating the clear shining ofthe group aspiration and love. That which you have to give must be brought downfrom the levels of consciousness which are abstract, mystical or egoic. Contactmust be made with the physical plane and through physical brain awareness. Work,therefore, for the next few months at strengthening your alignment, linkingconsciously brain-mind-soul, and producing a deepened and more stabilisedinter-relation and awareness. Use the imagination whilst so doing, and for threeminutes each morning stand before the window and visualise your head (the areaaround it and in it), as a centre of force into which is streaming a ray or beamof light from the soul, the Oversoul. This is seen as pouring down into the headcentre from the soul, via the mind, gathering thus mental intensity; through theastral body, gathering to itself high aspiration and devotion; and through theetheric body, vitalising it in every part; thus it streams into the head. Then,holding this stream there, divide it into two streams and send one, by an act ofthe will, to your splenic centre. (Note: This is found a little to the left and[457] below the heart centre, above the solar plexus and somewhat under the lefthand ribs.) Send the other stream of force, by an act of the will, out into theworld through the hands held out in blessing.~MY FRIEND AND FELLOW WORKER: August 1934All periods of stress and strain end when the experiencing soul learns to livewithin itself and to serve and work, to think and feel with the consciousnessever withdrawn to the “secret place of the Most High.” You will know whereof Ispeak, because that is one of the lessons which your soul has been teaching youduring the past twelve months. Physically, mentally and emotionally, you havebeen tried and tested and the trials which are applied to aligned personalitieshave been applied to you. The mark of the true aspirant is that all the threeparts of the lower nature are linked more or less to the higher, thus producinga unity. This results in two things:1. All the three parts of the personality can react simultaneously in somemeasure to the life and energy of the soul.2. All the difficulties and trials (karmic or educational, testing or purifying)are felt in all the three bodies at once.This is good, but it complicates the disciple’s progress for he has to fight onall three battlefields at once. I tell you this for your encouragement. . . .That is all I have for you today, my brother. Go in peace.~BROTHER OF OLD: January 1935Have you realised how intense has been the testing time to which the members ofthis group of disciples have been subjected? Have you any idea how active hasbeen the discipline to which they have all, including yourself, willinglysubmitted themselves?First there was the glamour which descended temporarily upon the group, and theeffects of this are only now beginning [458] to pass away. This has beensucceeded by a period of personality difficulties through which the bulk of themembers have been passing. You would be surprised could you see it all as I seeit; it might be of value to you all if I stated the type of discipline which hasovertaken several of the group. They were subjected severally to:The discipline of recovery.The discipline of adjustment.The discipline of physical disability.The discipline of inner isolation.The discipline of astral purification.The discipline of recovery of truth.The discipline of light.I have enumerated the above disciplines in order to show three things:1. The variety of discipline to which an aspirant can be subjected.2. The reality of the group life with its similarity of inner activity andtraining.3. The emerging fact that none of you is really alone. All of you are seen andwatched and, on the inner planes, you walk together; your outer circumstancesmay differ but the training and the objective are one. Loneliness will end whenthe inner group continuity of consciousness is established.Your work for the next few months, my brother, must have for its objective adecentralisation which will set you free from yourself. It should also bedirected toward a wise care of the physical body and its fitting for betterservice. Can you combine these two apparently contradictory objectives? You willnote that in a subtler way I hinted at these two objectives in your lastinstruction. Your physical body has called for attention. Give to it all that itneeds but be not anxious. Your environing circumstances and the pressure of yourdaily life have militated against detachment and this you know. But you havelearnt much these past two years, both about yourself and others, andemphatically I tell you that the work of the next six months [459] should renderinto your hands the high results of the process of discipline—if you approachyour problems in the right spirit and consecrate your life anew to service.One practical suggestion I would make, my brother, anent the study work assignedto the group. Might not the ideas underlying the Lord’s Prayer unfold to youwith greater clarity if you took it for the theme of your study and teachingwork. In teaching we learn. It would profit your pupils much (and you also) ifyou together were to give some thought to the magical formula which that ancientprayer embodies. The deepest esoteric significance which may emerge in your mindneed not necessarily be imparted to your group but much may be given. In soteaching, your thoughts may take shape and these when later embodied in wordsmay carry real benefit to your group brothers. This is but a suggestion. I wouldseek to reiterate at this time, as always, that my work with this group is neverto be regarded as authoritative or dogmatic. From my wider knowledge of truthand from my capacity to know you all on the inner plane, I but make suggestionsfor fear that I may unduly influence.In my last instruction, I pointed out that the battle ground in your case was tobe found in all three bodies simultaneously. This increases your problem but italso increases your opportunity.I seek now to give you a meditation form which is based on a recognition of thisfact and which will help you to gain a more perfect alignment and the furtherrelease of the inner channel of contact. Continue as heretofore with thebreathing exercises and with your moments before the open window. Thismeditation is to be followed with the cultivated realisation that you are thesoul, the Christ within. . . .Eliminate fear, my brother. That continuity of the spiritual consciousness whichis one of your dearest dreams can be ultimately developed, but you must proceedwith care. Dreams are sometimes a guarantee of reality.~August 1935There is little that I have to say to you at this time, brother of old. I seeknot to change your work or meditation. You [460] have followed the one Iassigned for only six months and I seek to have you work at it for a full year.One change only would I make and that is in connection with the third point andthe use of the Lord’s Prayer. Instead of pondering on the words of that prayer,I give you here some sentences which I would ask you to make especially yourown, for they are peculiarly yours. There are three such sentences and you mightregard them as constituting a magical phrase for each of your three bodies. Youshould all remember that ancient phrases (such as these I ofttimes give) arereally untranslatable; I but put them into English words which will make theirmeaning clear. I make no attempt to preserve more than the sense.Phrase I. For the mind.“Like a golden butterfly which flies in the face of the sun, I find myselfpoised upon the lotus petal of the earth. I hover; I stay a little moment andthen I fly—into the golden pathway that leads unto the sun.”Phrase II. For the emotional nature.“There is no darkness and no fog. There is no night or day. There are no stormsnor peace, no rest nor strife; only the steadfast will of God which works towardgood.”Phrase III. For the physical body.“Down from the mountain top I come, bringing the light of Life, the life ofLight. Into the chalice of the form I pour that light which life confers, thislife which light sustains. I see this golden light transform the darkness intoday. I see the blue of life divine pour through the form, healing and soothing.Thus is the task performed. Thus is a man of earth transformed into a Son ofGod.”Give the coming months to these three phrases in your meditation and ponderdeeply on their significance.1st and 2nd months—Phrase I.3rd and 4th months—Phrase II.5th and 6th months—Phrase III.Otherwise keep your meditation unchanged. One of the purposes of thesemeditation seed thoughts is the physical transformation [461] of the lower man,but your success will be dependent upon the changes wrought in the two inner,subtler bodies through the medium of the first two phrases. . . .Let the discipline of light carry on its work with you. And, my brother, may Imake one practical suggestion to you? Your main problem from the angle of thesoul is a physical one in this incarnation. Your tenseness and over-anxietycause much of your physical disability.To most of your co-disciples and to you I feel the need of saying simply: Bejoyful, for joy lets in the light, and where there is joy there is little roomfor glamour and misunderstanding.~BROTHER OF OLD: February 1936The next few months, until the time of the Wesak Festival, must be for youmonths of inner recognition, of a spiritual withdrawing and of intensepreparation. Though you may not see immediately, or during the Festival itself,the significant aims of this period of opportunity, or of your previous weeks ofpreparation, that is of no importance really for the gains will be there andwill register in due course of time.The ajna centre (the centre between the eyebrows) is overactive whilst the headcentre should be stimulated into increased aliveness. This, as it takes placethrough the steady focussing of yourself in the head centre, may induce a periodwherein it may seem to you that nothing is happening subjectively. This, again,is of no importance. The time has come wherein all true disciples (and suchindeed are you) must transmute phenomena into spiritual realisation; theninstead of the constant registering of that which is seen and heard, there willarise a spiritual awareness which will register bliss and power. This willenable you to see the soul in all things and the inward beauty of all createdforms. This awareness will be of such a high order that it will deal primarilywith that which is formless, and its attention will be turned upon thesubjective life which exists within the form. Such is the true course ofsymbolism to which you, as a disciple, are pledged.[462] Your love and knowledge should begin to lead you more and more into theway of the divine psychologist; it is to the service of psychology that I directyour attention and to which you will find yourself pledged when next you takethe Path of Rebirth and return to the battlefield of life. For you, today, thebattle is one of endurance, of the control of the emotions, of the rightunderstanding of the astral nature and a steady shift of your point ofconsciousness on to the next plane. I think, my brother, that you recognise thisfact.Meditate upon the following mystic phrases and where colour is mentioned,visualise the colour.Phrase One. First and second months.“The golden rays that issue from the heart of the sun pour forth and bathe mysoul and the soul of all created forms. Within those forms, the life of Godawakens, and the power of God streams forth as Will, as dedication to the Plan,as strength to work and give—as must a son of God.”Phrase Two. Third and fourth months.“Within the darkness of the soul, prisoned within the form, a point of light isseen. Then there arises, all around that point, a field of deepest blue and thisbecomes irradiated by the soul, the inner sun, shining within a brilliant fieldof blue. The points of light become the many lines or rays of light; these linesthen merge and blend until the lighted Way appears before the eyes of each tiredpilgrim on that Way. He walks in light. He is himself the light, the light uponthe Way. He is the Way and always walks thereon.”Phrase Three. Fifth and sixth months.“With industry I work as doth the ant. With speed I travel as moves the hareupon its path. With joy I climb as doth the goat which scales the precipice andstands upon the mountain top. Industry, speed and joy must be the keynotes of mylife; diligence with the task assigned; speed to assent to all the Master says;speed on my way to service; and joy to shower forth on all I meet. Such is theWay for me.”[463] My blessing rests on you, my brother. My strength lies at your disposal,for you will not call on me unless the need is great. When it is great, you havepermission thus to call.~BROTHER OF MINE: August 1936All severing of links produces severe reactions. Yet if you could but realiseit, the severing of outer physical plane links is the least severe and the mostimpermanent of all such events. Death itself is a part of the great illusion andonly exists because of the veils which we have gathered around ourselves. You,as a worker in the field of glamour (which is the new field in which humanityhas consciously to work), have been deeply honoured and trusted. Death comes toall, but not for you should there be the usual glamours and distresses. I wouldsay to you, my brother, look not back at the past. In that direction liesglamour and distress. It is the usual direction and the line of least resistancefor the majority. But such is not the way for you. Look not either to revelationor the imparted illusory comfort of those who hover on the dividing line betweenthe seen and the unseen. That way is not the way for you. You are not adistressed and bereaved disciple looking anxiously at the separating veil andhoping for some sign to come through which will convince you that all is well.Such, I reiterate, is not the way for you.Reach up to the heights of the soul and, having sought and found that pinnacleof peace and that altitude of joy whereon your soul immovably stands, then lookinto the world of living men—a threefold world in which all men, incarnate anddiscarnate are found. Find there that which your soul can and will recognise.The glamours of one’s own distress, the maya of the past distorts one’s point ofview. Only the soul stands clear from illusion, and only the soul sees things asthey are. Mount, therefore, to the soul.I would like here to point out to you that earlier I gave you a hint that theremight arise a need for you to call for added strength, and the need, perhaps tointensify your inner contact with myself. I gave you “permission thus to call.”I foresaw the agony of your coming months and sought to have you know [464] thatI was standing by. This I still am doing. I remind you of this for thestrengthening of your faith, the deepening of your assurance and yourintegration in this group work.I shall not at this time change your meditation work. As outlined, it shouldserve gradually to stabilise you and lift you up on to the mental plane. Forceof circumstances has driven you to live much upon the astral plane for the pastfew months in an emotional vortex. Mount up, my brother, into the light and intorenewed power and detachment. Find surcease from sorrow in the task of aidingothers. You can call and find me if your need is great.~MY BROTHER: February 1937You are entering upon a new cycle of life and of usefulness. You stand on theverge of opportunity and yet you seem to recognise it not. You are ready forcomplete service and yet you hide yourself away from it. You have the capacityand the time, could you but grasp it, and likewise the needed physical strengthto be an active focal point for us and yet you hold back in your mind andconsciousness and seem to realise it not. I have put the truth thus bluntly toyou, for you are a strong and pledged disciple, and you do not fear theknowledge of reality.You have passed across the burning ground and now it lies behind you, but thesmoke which hovers round it still obscures your vision. Pass on with rapidityinto the clear light of day and leave behind remembrance of pain, of theheart-searching and the problems and —lifting your face to the light—for theremainder of this earthly way be a tower of strength and a radiant light toothers. This you can do.If I could summarise my thought for you, my brother, I would clothe it in wordsof great simplicity and would say to you: Be happy. Be happy as the sannyasin ishappy who (through detachment from the little self and attachment to the greaterSelf in all) has left behind all that might hinder and hamper his service.Henceforth, you belong not to yourself or to any earthly friend or claim. Youbelong to the servers of humanity and to us.[465] I give you no particular meditation to do these next six months. Occupyyourself with the group meditation and with the Full Moon Contact. These are foryou of greater usefulness than the personal daily meditation. For you, theyconstitute your major service. My instructions to all the group members havebeen brief this time. I gave you all much in my last communication and not yethave you assimilated all that I gave. Study the messages again, all of you, andsee anew in the light of the new year and fresh day of opportunity.~MY BROTHER: September 1937A very difficult half year has gone by for you. You have come through it, and itis with commendation that I look at you today. That is all that I have to say, Iam pleased . I know that for you that suffices. If you stand steady with an openheart, a seeing eye and a ready response to all who come your way, the door torenewed service will open and much can be done by you. My brother, you have thepower to help individuals, and you have an unusual capacity to fan a dim sparkinto a white-hot flame. Do not distrust yourself, but go ahead. Your field ofservice lies all around you.The problem that has to be faced by all who have passed through the fires ofRenunciation, who are walking the way of humility whilst conscious of thegrandeur of the soul, and who are, at the same time, far from young in years isthat of facing the last decade or so of life with understanding, and with nofear of physical limitations. So many in the final years of life live, think andact in such a manner that the soul withdraws its attention. Thus only thepersonality remains. To all of you who have passed the half century I would say:Face the future with the same joy as in youth, yet with an added usefulness,knowing that the wisdom of experience is yours, the power to understand isyours, and that no physical limitation can prevent a soul from useful expressionand service. I would remind you of something which is often forgotten: It is fareasier for the soul to express itself through an older experienced body thanthrough one that is young and inexperienced, provided [466] that there is nopride and no desired selfishness, but only longing to love and serve. These areyour desires and the future holds for you much service.It will be of interest to you now if I tell you of the rays which govern thelower self.Your mental body is governed by the fourth ray, and if you study this thereasons for many of your life reactions will become apparent to you. There islittle of the first ray line of energy 1-3-5-7 in your equipment, but almost anoverbalance of the second ray line 2-4-6. You will note that all these threeappear in your equipment.This condition is still further complicated by the fact that you have a firstray astral body. This is again an exception to the usual rule. In the case ofthe disciple who is occupied with some particular rounding-out process thisexception does occur, and the first ray personality of your last incarnationleft you the legacy of a first ray astral body in this. Therefore, in thisparticular life, you have a very difficult task and a complicated problembecause (if I might so crudely express it) there is in you too much of thesecond ray.To aid in the process of balancing and off-setting the danger, your soul chose aseventh ray physical body . This is of real assistance to you and helps in thesynthesis of the two lines of energy. Your rays therefore are:1. The soul ray—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.2. The personality ray—the sixth Ray of Devotion or Idealism.3. The ray of the mental body—the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict.4. The ray of the astral body—the first Ray of Will or Power.5. The ray of the physical body—the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Order.I would ask you to follow the meditation and continue with the breathingexercises that you are now doing. There is no need at this time to change what Ilast gave you. During the half year ahead I would counsel you particularly togive much time and attention to the Full Moon Approach. I would also like toassign you a special task which will be of value to [467] you, to your groupbrothers and to others. Will you gather out of all that I have given in mybooks, everything that has been said about the Full Moon. There is no need,however, to give long extracts or to copy out my detailed instructions of theBuddha’s Full Moon in May. I want you to gather together out of those longinstructions and from many isolated passages the reasons:a. For the importance of the Full Moon.b. What should be done and happen at the time of the Full Moon.c. Any information that you may find of the cause of the spiritual opportunity.~BROTHER OF MINE: February 1938In these instructions I have given my disciples much information re the fourthray, for so many of them have fourth ray mentalities. This is not a very usualstate of affairs at this time and is one of the major reasons for their beingchosen to form part of this group. The possession of a fourth ray mind is anessential factor in my planned work and I would have you ponder deeply on thisfact. You have, outstandingly, this type of mind, and it is going to be of realservice to your group if you will learn to focus yourself there more easily and,shall I say, more frequently. Your personality ray is naturally very dominantand should give you power upon the astral plane—the plane of your chosen work.But this attitude must be balanced by the attitudes of the fourth ray mind. Iwould like here to point out that1. Your soul ray seeks expression through your astral body.2. Your personality ray is focussed in your seventh ray brain.If you will think out these imparted facts with care, you will see that thebringing together of the personality ray and the ray governing your physicalbody presents you with a very definite problem. It produces an over-interest andover-emphasis upon the form side of manifestation and group expression. Thisleads to a devotion to the known forms. It is this [468] focussing of yourpersonality ray which is the psychic cause of the headaches to which you havebeen prone. Mistake me not here, my brother. I do not say that you have undueinterest in form as it affects your personality. You are definitely the observerand “look out upon a world distressed.” Your ray combinations lead to a quickreaction to the existent forms instead of leading to a long range vision of thePlan, such as your soul ray can give. You need increasingly to focus yourself inthe soul and less and less in the personality consciousness. This will producethe expression of love through devotion to all men as souls, and not of devotionto forms and methods which your personality ray approves.Your service is, as I earlier pointed out to you, the task of “lifting”individuals and clearing away the problems which confront them. Increasingly,you must also stand with your group, giving them the knowledge which is soabundantly yours. You have a few personal glamours, but they are not of the kindwhich hurt your group. You see with clarity the outlines of the task ahead towhich the group is dedicated. For long you have tried to help L.T.S-K. to freehimself from the rhythm of his glamours. Will you continue still a little whilethe effort to help him, writing to him in frankness and standing by him in love?The group meditation is of importance to you and to all the group, for it holdsin it the seeds of group integration. Continue, therefore, with it. I give you,however, a brief morning exercise to be done prior to the group meditation.1. After achieving alignment, inner poise and rest, see each of yourco-disciples (whom you may know) in the light.2. Then visualise them each with a star between the eyebrows, as the symbol ofan awakened ajna centre and of an integrated personality. It is a four-pointedstar. The star of initiation is, as you know, a five-pointed star.3. Then say something to each of your brothers, after due effort to link up withthem. Study the ideas which give utterance to your words and note, in writing,their general import.4. Then rise, and going to the window, send out love and light to those whoguide the destinies of men upon the [469] earth (I refer not to the Hierarchy)in London, Leningrad, Washington, Berlin, Geneva and in Rome. Do this with asmuch love as you can and without much thought, for thought can be separative andcritical where there is not adequate knowledge. This is an initial part of thetechnique of dissipating group glamour.5. Then sound the O.M., raising your consciousness and coming as close to theHierarchy as possible.~MY BROTHER: February 1939This last year has not been an easy one for you any more than it has been foryour group brothers. Each and all have had a most difficult time. Your problemshave been psychological far more than physical; they are relatively simple indefinition, though hard to solve. Perhaps I could express what I have to saybest by remarking that the main part of your difficulties has been a wrestlingwith bewilderment —a bewilderment which is not a glamour but which could easilybecome one if your soul were not so constantly and definitely guiding,controlling and leading you away from the more pronounced glamours of which itcould be the tiny seed. Bewilderment is a state of incipient glamour. The wayout for you is not to concern yourself with the world problem which is too greatfor you to handle. The entire planetary Hierarchy is concerned with it and isseeking a solution. Yet the plans for the world of humanity are materialisingand maturing; the world situation is moving ahead with such rapidity that theaverage aspirant and intelligent man has no sooner adjusted himself to certainconditions or to a particular attitude of thought and mind (which he with realdifficulty has assumed), when sudden changes occur and the work—as far as he isconcerned—has to be repeated.So, my brother, stand controlled at the centre, permitting your soul to pour itsillumination and its love through you and out into your environment, rememberingthat all men are your brothers. This is a statement of fact, e’en if it is aplatitude. Remember also that in the setting where your personality stands atthis time is the place where you will have to make your soul [470] impact; it isnot upon the world in general. To meet world need and solve world problems isnot your dharma. The world cannot be helped on a large scale by any oneindividual unless there has been complete release from all selfish intent, fromall blind personality decisions, and from all belief that crystallised views areright, particularly when such views are unduly conditioned by environment,background, tradition and a myopic point of view.So, brother of mine, release your thoughts from all that limits your love (fromall , I repeat) and love widely, generally, impartially and intelligently.I would have you note that the rays governing D.H.B. and J.S.P. very closelyresemble yours. You have all three got the same soul ray, and the same raygoverning the physical body. This should bring the three of you particularlyclose together; I would call this to your attention and ask you to stand witheach other in the closest relation. You can form a triangle of spiritual forcewhich should be of real value to the group and greatly facilitate the plannedgroup work. Correspond with each other and stand by each other in love. Allthree of you have much with which to contend, but both the others have far moreto contend with than you have. Therefore, be to them a tower of strength and letthem draw from you what they need of love and understanding.I would have you continue with the exercise I gave you in your last instruction.As a preparatory exercise for the group meditation, it will prove effective forit is along the same general line, only in the group meditation the work is morespecific and focussed.The factor which will produce increasing integration between the soul and thepersonality, in the case of D.H.B. and J.S.P. and yourself, is the attainment ofthe power to love with purity, with no sense of distinction, and with that lovewhich the Eternal One shows—poured out alike upon all and not biassed in any wayby the temporal activities of man. This must be based on long vision, and thepower to release yourself from the thoughtform-making faculty of the mind. Inyour case this faculty is swept into activity by emotion. Guard your emotionalbody with peculiar care during the coming year. Let not anything [471] upsetyour equilibrium or cloud your vision of reality. And my brother, be happy.Learn to feel joy—a joy which is based on the knowledge that humanity has alwaystriumphed and passed onward and forward in spite of apparent failures and thedestruction of past civilisations; a joy, which is founded upon the unshakablebelief that all men are souls, and that “points of crisis” are factors which areof proven usefulness in calling in the power of that soul, both in theindividual man, in a race, or in humanity as a whole; a joy which is related tothe bliss which characterises the soul on its own level whereon the form aspectsof manifestation do not dominate. Ponder on these thoughts and remember you aregrounded in the centre of your Being and can, therefore, see the world truly andwith no limited vision; you can stand unperturbed, knowing the end from thebeginning and realising that love will triumph.God guard and rest you and increase fourfold your usefulness. Such is my prayerfor you.NOTE: This disciple still persists in his endeavour to work in the Tibetan’sAshram and remains steadfast and sure.~TO L. U. T.October 1932MY BROTHER:You face real opportunity and can make real progress, if you so desire. You areconsiderably younger than some in my group of disciples and have, therefore,less background and more undeveloped resources. You have passed and are passingthrough a hard experience and out of this you are not getting the full benefit.The reason for this is that you have built a shell around yourself owing to anatural sensitivity which—as a child and in your youth—caused you to protectyourself in this manner. Another reason for your failure to get all you mightout of the present experience is the inordinate pride of the Taurus individual,who is on the first ray where his personality is concerned.Will you let me speak with clarity, my brother? I believe in your sincerity anddetermination, but I have questioned your capacity to make progress in thislife. It was, however, your [472] karmic due to have this opportunity offered toyou. The doubt in my mind arose from my knowledge of the two tendencies in youwhich have hitherto held you back from the lighted Way.One is a stubborn determination to go your own way and handle situations as youchoose, e’en when others suffer through your so doing. You go bull-headedthrough life, knocking down and hurting as you go. This you know full well. Youstop not to right or to adjust wrong action, e’en when you recognise it aswrong. The second is a tendency of thought and action which must be cleaned upbefore you can pass through the doors of purification which hide the door ofInitiation. More about this hindering activity I need not say, for you know wellwhereof I speak. I offer you the way out in four simple rules:1. Clean up your thought life. I shall not be more explicit. Again I say: Youknow whereof I speak.2. Eliminate self-pity. All that comes to you is the working of the law andoffers opportunity. Cultivate happiness through understanding. I mean notjocoseness and jollity.3. Think lovingly of all and, when you have hurt anyone, right the wrongimmediately and go forward with humility.4. Demonstrate will in action and live up to your own high moments. This takeseffort. You are stubborn but your will is weak.As regards the work that you now should do, I would say: Drop all meditationwhich you may now be doing and concentrate on these four rules. Learn to knowthe soul as purity, as bliss, as love and as power in service. Do not reflect onthe needs of the personality or on its lacks and defects. You need the mysticvision far more than the occult method just now. The keeping of a spiritualdiary is of real importance to you. Learn to keep these four rules and note eachday their fulfilment or non-fulfilment with careful analysis. In a few monthsyou should be able to note definite change and then can begin meditation alongoccult lines. Learn to express yourself quite fully in your diary, for you needto find an outlet in this way.~[473] BROTHER OF MINE: March 1933It is not often that one speaks a word of encouragement to aspirants, and inyour case such a word is not needed. You have undertaken a task and will notrest short of accomplishment. But you were told that, for a few months, certainwork needed doing and, at the close, fresh work might come to you. The pastperiod has seen much inner progress towards realisation.... You are much freer,my brother, and the energy of the soul is beginning to sweep more freely throughthe vehicles—cleansing and revitalising. You have presumably followed myinstructions and suggestions and the result has justified the experiment. Isuggest that you still continue as you have been doing, building in the attitudeof constant and continuous meditation.~MY BROTHER: August 1933Still for you I have no changed word. Go forward as you are now doing andcontinue to focus your attention upon the four rules I earlier gave you. Youhave, as I have told you, made progress and a little longer work along theestablished lines will see you breaking—past recovery—old thought habits andancient forms.Be not discouraged because I am making no change in your work. The task youundertook was a hard one and the effectiveness of sustained effort andreiterated endeavour is adequate. Why then employ a different tool when the oneto hand is effective and clean? I will, however, make one suggestion: Work morecarefully with individuals, with people you meet, with your friends in the sameline of thought and with your co-disciples. Give them, in love, more ofyourself. You have more to give than two years ago. Give of what you have gainedand lose yourself in active service. Work more intensively, therefore, from theday you receive this communication from me.One hint I will give you as to your personal concern over the little daughter.Be not unduly concerned as to her unfoldment. Let not your anxiety for her tomeasure up to your ideal force her to tread a way which is one that you desire.She also [474] is a soul and has her own path to go. Your part is to lovewithout a change, no matter what occurs. Take her each day into the light and,by the use of your imagination, link her with the master of her life, the soulbehind the scenes. Do this as a soul yourself; your soul and her soul then willwork out the problem together.~BROTHER OF MINE: January 1934Certain changes have taken place in your life lately and by your decisions yougrow and by your decisions you must abide. You have endeavoured to take thosedecisions in the light; it is intent that counts with us, the teachers on theinner side, even if this intent is not correctly realised by the physical brainconsciousness. Now you are entering into what might be regarded as a newincarnation. At this significant moment of your life, therefore, I would say aword of warning and of guidance. Live not so utterly within yourself but forgetyourself. The past lies behind you. The future will be of your own making in atruer sense than ever before. There is no present moment but each coming seconddetermines simultaneously the future and expresses the past. The past works outthrough the medium of the very qualities you demonstrate; the future sows theseeds of further good or evil. For you particularly those seeds originate in thethought life.The group unity and life is affected by the thought content of the disciples whoform the group. See to it that what you put into the general current of thoughtpower is of significance. Continue with the work of purifying thought but dothis not so much by constantly fighting undesirable thoughts as by substitutingdynamic good thought for those facile thoughts which are the result of wrongthought habits. Endeavour, therefore, to be of a vital usefulness to my group bycultivating beauty in your thought. Read deeply and widely—a thing you havenever done. But read with the intent to serve your fellowmen through the mediumof that which has been gained in this manner.See that your friendships are with men and with your fellow disciples among themen. With men, your work will lie when [475] the lower nature is better purifiedand cleansed. I am training this group of disciples, affiliated with my Ashram,for service and they will have to function as a group—both on the inner and theouter planes. Have this in mind in all you do.I seek this year to give you some set meditation form to follow and I include init a mantram which you can use daily or when swept by the self-pity whichtroubles you at this time. The attached meditation form can be followed by youfor the rest of the year, when I will again take up the matter with you. It isto be done rapidly , with strict attention and a one-pointed focus, using thefollowing seed thoughts.1st month—I think no thought, I dream no dream that could harm my brother, andthereby dim his light.2nd month—I see my brother in the light and with him walk the Path.3rd month—I say no word that might direct the thoughts of other men and thusbring harm; I shield my brother from every harmful word.4th month—I hear my brother’s note and with it blend my own.5th month—Unto my group I give the gain of all the past, my love andunderstanding.6th month—That wisdom which is mine, that strength and power belong to all. ThisI must deepen and, with love, contribute to the whole.Above all, my brother, arrest each unloving thought; stamp out each criticalaction and teach yourself to love all beings—not in theory but in deed and intruth. Peace be to you and strength to tread the Way.~MY BROTHER: September 1934You have made many changes both in your life and in yourself and so encouraginghas been the result that I do not seek to alter aught that I earlier gave you.Keep up the meditation work but increase your field of service by your readinessto recognise the need of others and then to give them of your [476] supply.Train yourself to recognise need during the next few months. It will aid inincreasing your occult sensitivity and drive out the last few signs of yourancient and deep-seated self-pity. Study with care what I earlier gave you,renew your consecration and re-orient yourself to the light ahead and within.One practical suggestion I make with a view to your increased facility inexpression: Write more . Correspond more with others and put your thoughts andideas on paper in so far as they can be of service to other people. You need alarger field of expression and your spiritual diary could aid you much if youwould seek each day to use it to the full. I urge not the writing down of morbidthoughts and self-centred ideas and aspirations. I urge you, however, toregister in writing the fleeting ideas, the dimly sensed teaching and theintuitions which are sent to you from your soul or which surround you as a partof the group aura. Reflect on this and work at increasing your responsiveness tospiritual ideas and in recording those ideas in words. . . .~MY BROTHER: February 1935How shall we deepen the expression of love in your life? How can we intensifythe activity of your soul through the medium of your personality? Are yousatisfied with the way you have “loved all beings” during the past six months orhas that side of your life been somewhat inhibited?In loving other people in the true and spiritual sense and in serving them (nomatter who or what they are), you will find your main and immediate objectiveexpressed. For you, the releasing power of love is essential but it must be thelove of the soul, and not personality love, which must be demonstrated. Whenyour personality is flooded with love, you will learn this significant occultlesson that those people whom you despise and those people who are antagonisticto you are as you are; between you and them lies no difference, save perhaps thedifference of greater knowledge on your part and, therefore, greaterresponsibility to express the love of the soul.You are still separative, my brother and the magnetic quality of your soul stilllacks. You still occultly “repudiate” certain [477] people and your owncritical, self-centred mind frequently relegates many to the limbo of yourdislikes. When this is the case, you inevitably receive from them that which yougive to them, and the wall of separation continues to mount higher and higher.I always speak to those who are in my group of disciples with frankness. Hencemy criticism of your attitude and hence my emphatic statement to you now thatyou do not love enough. You are too prone to criticism, to self-defense and toself-assertiveness.But having said this I must be equally frank and tell you that you have madereal progress. You have stood steady under several years of strain anddifficulty and you have not deviated from your allegiance to your soul. Nor willyou. Years ago you pledged yourself to tread the Path; your pledge was noted andrecorded. Those who watch have realised that your determination is as strong asever and your will to progress is as intense as in the early days. Let me,therefore, assure you that it is the life tendency that counts. Your lifetendency is towards the light and you will enter into light some day. Your workat this time is along the lines of an intensive purification. The need for thisyou have realised and you have demanded to be purified. The work is goingforward.My brother, when I say that you need to love more, I speak not of the distortedlove of the emotional nature but of that pure disinterested love which acts as amagnet to other souls because it is a soul quality, universally shared. This,you know you lack. That which clogs the channels and hinders its free and fullflow is your sensitive self-assertiveness which sees everybody in relation toyourself and is not concerned with what you, as a person, may mean to them.Reflect on these words for they hold for you the key to progress. I am takingthe time to write to you on this matter for it is of prime importance in yourcase. Your patient endurance of difficulties, your earnest and keen aspirationand your service to the work which I am doing is oft rendered null and void byyour inner antagonisms and your outer separative attitude to those whom you donot like and who do not like you— consequently.[478] I told you earlier to teach yourself to “recognise the need.” Had you donethis during the past few months, your way would have been easier and your workwould have been much simplified. Everybody you meet has some need and many arevery unhappy. Give them of your fullness and know yourself to be a soul. Youhave been taught much. You walk somewhat in the light. They do not. Hence yoursis the responsibility to understand, not theirs. Work, therefore, strenuously atattaining love to all beings and fit yourself to serve the Plan more effectivelyand your group brothers more understandingly. My heart goes out to you, mybrother of old, for I know the problem which you face but I also know yourstrength and courage. You will succeed—some day.Keep in touch with W.D.B. and talk your problem out with him. He can and willhelp you from his own experiences and you can also give him much. I hadconsidered changing your meditation but feel, after due thought, that there isstill much in it for you. . . . My brother, may the strength and the light ofyour soul inspire you and may that deep love which is your soul’s heritage pourthrough you. Should you, during the next few months, need my thought and help,you have my permission to approach me as you do at the time of each full moon. Ican trust you not to call me from my work without due cause.~MY BROTHER: September 1935I sometimes wonder what I can do to help you or what words I can say which willenable you to break through the limitations which surround you. There is ameasure of freedom possible for you at this time and which will mark the highwater mark of this incarnation for you but as yet you have not managed toachieve it. If I tell you that you have made little progress the past fewmonths, you will be discouraged and that I do not desire. If I tell you thatyour self-interest has intensified lately, you will perhaps not believe me andin any case you will be distressed. Of your sincerity, there is not theslightest doubt. Of your ultimate success, I am equally confident. Of yourpresent static condition I am, however, equally sure. What [479] then can I say,my brother? What can I do in order to destroy this old and limiting rhythm?One thing I do feel the need to point out and that is that you and L.T.S-K.—eachin your different ways—are holding back the group. Your co-disciples cannot goon as a group until you have both stepped your vibration up higher. Your presentvibration is lower and slower than theirs. The problem would not be solved,however, by your leaving the group or resigning. You are an integral part of thegroup upon the inner planes and that remains an esoteric fact.Will you please study anew my last instructions to you and ponder upon them withrenewed interest. Note again what I said to you—for your encouragement—anentyour life tendency and be not the least discouraged by my present frankness.Remove your eyes from off yourself and seek liberation in serving others and inloving all men. There are those you do not love. Until you love them as a soulshould love, you will not tread the Way of Liberation. There is hatred in yourheart and a sense of strong distaste for some you know and who are close to youin this incarnation. Wrench that hatred out and seek to offer love andunderstanding. Therein, frankly, lies your problem. Get rid of hatred andself-pity and you will leap ahead upon the Path.I stand by you, friend of old. I know and—believe me—understand. I see yourstrength and I know your weakness. In the vision of the world’s need and in themagnitude of humanity’s hour, take hold of your problem; learn to love andunderstand and so enter into light.~MY FRIEND OF OLD: March 1936For such you are and have been and such I trust you will remain. I say this foryour strengthening and encouragement. You have made a real effort, and progresshas resulted during the past few months. Today, you walk not all the time in thedarkness of self-pity and of self-interest. You are freer from the thoughtformsof the past. I can look towards you and catch your aura with greater ease andwith not too great a vibratory shock.[480] Forget not, any of you, that for senior disciples upon the Path (and sucham I), it is relatively as unpleasant from the vibratory angle to contact you orspend some time within the radius of your aura as it would be for you to enterthe sleeping room of those of soiled environment and persons. Disciples are aptto forget this. The way for all of us is the way of sacrifice. Your aura is muchclearer and the impediments to contact are twenty per cent less. For this, I canand do commend you and, in commending, urge you to proceed with the task ofpurification and cleansing. I ask this for the sake of your own soul and forthat of your fellow disciples. There is real need for this group to work as agroup ... but this will only be possible when unity of purpose, steadiness ofrhythm and purity of the united auras have been achieved. See to it, my friend,that you continue to do your share.All I seek to do today for you is to speak this word of commendation and to giveyou certain words and phrases upon which you should meditate until I againcommunicate with you. I am hoping that after the Full Moon of May (the WesakFestival) I may be able to change your work so that you can begin the nextmeditation. This will depend upon the adequacy of the preparation done until theFull Moon of May. It will also depend upon whether you and L.T.S-K. can freeyourselves from glamour—you from the glamour of the personal self and he fromthe glamour of his own thoughtforms. The words and phrases which I have chosenfor the theme of your meditation are as follows: [481]1st month Freedom. I stand upon the mountain top and breathe the air whereby thesons of God must live. 2nd month Detachment . I seek to love and with my love tolive. I seek not love for my own little self. 3rd month Purification . Let thefires of divinity burn out all dross. Let the pure gold emerge. Give me the goldof living love to shower upon the sons of men. 4th month Light . Into the lightof the radiant Presence of the Self I pass and join all souls in service. 5thmonth Service . I tread the lighted Way into the hearts of men. I serve mybrother and his need. Those whom I, the little self, love not, I serve with joybecause I love to serve. 6th month Release . Naught holds me now, except thebonds of love I hold in my own soul.~MY BROTHER OF OLDEN TIME: September 1936Forget not that it is not simply this group work and the fact that you have beenchosen to work in my group of disciples which accounts for that which has beenbrought about. There is a karmic link with me which persists and holds. I say nomore.The commendations which I gave you in my last instruction stand repeated. Iwaste not time over such matters. You have the power to go on whether commendedor not and whether successful in your efforts or not. There is somewhat,however, that I have to say to you today and it can be stated in simple words:You need fuller emotional expression. There is such an intense focussing withinyourself as the result of a long spiritual struggle—with yourself and withcircumstances—that pent up forces are gathered into the personality which musthave release. How shall this release be brought about? What can you do whichwill intensify your outer expression and thus break the personality tension?I have pondered upon this on your behalf, my brother. You have been triumphantin your battle and are much freer from your lower inclinations than ever before.But you stand now like a tired and disillusioned soldier wondering if it hasbeen worth while. You feel at times that you can do no more; you are still asoldier, still pledged to the fight, still undeterred, but all your forces areinteriorly focussed; the tide of life and the [482] play of energies—asunderstood upon the Path of Discipleship—are dammed up within you. This is inreality a form of static personality glamour. The personal crisis and problemsloom too large. You do not see things in their true perspective.I have decided that the way of release for you will come in the writing each dayof a diary which will embody certain releasing forces and which can—if truly andconscientiously carried out—bring you much and eventually carry to yourco-disciples something of beauty and of joy. I am not fanciful or undulyoptimistic nor am I asking you to undertake something which will land you stilldeeper in the maya of futility. I am suggesting something which will fill yourlife with vitality, expression and make you radiant.Each evening write your diary from four points of view. Let it be written withreal thought and a determination to find something to relate in connection witheach point. This will engender in you a constant watchfulness over your dailylife, a vital attentiveness to life as it is lived around you and a reflectivedaily meditative attitude which is to take the place of the prolonged, definite,morning meditation. The four points to be dealt with and covered in your diaryare as follows:1. What things, attitudes, and words of beauty did I come across today? Notethese down and note also your reactions to them when recognised—a sunset ofradiant colour; a face or look which brought good remembrance; a paragraph in abook which illumined your mind. Write it all down so as to share it with yourfellow disciples. Write, for instance, the paragraph which attracted yourattention or the spoken words which brought you light. Hunt every day for beautyand record it.2. What act of service did I render which was other than my usual programme?What services did I note that other people were rendering? List what you seeyour fellow-men doing each day that strikes a note of selfless service and learnthereby the wonder of the human being. Give your reactions to that which yourecord.3. What colour or colours predominated in my life today ? Upon the physicalplane—a blaze of sunshine, the grey of a rainy day, the blue of the sky, theriot of colour in [483] the flowers in a garden or a shop? Upon the astralplane—the rose of affection and of friendly feeling, the blue of an inspiringcontact, the gold of physical well being, the interplay of colours which youremotional nature can be trained to recognise?4. What dramas came my way today, in my own life or in the life of others? Seekfor drama under the dull exterior of a person, in the world of daily happeningsas you see it functioning around you. See it everywhere—the drama of life aslived by yourself, your environing associates, and also the nations of theworld. Evoke and cultivate the sense of the immanent beauty of drama, and notethe recognition of it in your diary; note also the lessons to be learnt as yousense and study them.This diary will reveal to you what you lack; it will train you in the objectiveand subjective recognitions which you so much need; it will lift you out ofyourself and will carry to you revelation and joy and an enlarging horizon.Ponder upon the words: Beauty, colour, service, outer relationships, innerlinkings. No more I give you now except my blessing.~MY BROTHER: February 1937You are awakening to reality. You are arriving at a truer estimate of yourselfand your personality shell is fast crumbling. Is that not true? The way ofliberation for you, however, lies not through outer activities and so-calledreadjustments or personality resumption of various earlier activities butthrough a poised attitude of mind which (sensitive to the call of the soul andthe call of humanity as heard on soul levels) brings about automatically andwithout pressure the needed changes in the physical plane of life.To these words of mine pay special attention or you will undertakeresponsibilities or take action which will be based on the reasoning of thelower, concrete mind and not on those simple impulses which bear the hall markof the soul.One thing I would urge upon you: Follow with great diligence the keeping of thediary to which I referred in my last [484] instruction. I am not changing yourwork at this time. I only seek to emphasise to you the four points of interestto be noted in your diary. Keep it in fuller detail; not only will it train youin the recognition of the essentials of the spiritual life but in theirexpression in words. This will carry for you much release. Otherwise, mybrother, go your way for another few months and attain still greater release.What I have said to you this time, though brief, is of importance. Ponder on it.~BROTHER OF MINE: November 1937I write to you today to call you specifically to increased service. You are nowmore ready to serve than at any other time in your life. I think I might saywith truth that (for the first time since you came into incarnation) you cangive something to your fellow-men which will open a door for them. Your astralpurification has proceeded with rapidity. This, your diary indicates. Thekeeping of that diary serves, and should continue to serve, a most usefulpurpose. Therefore, continue with it during this next year, for it will tend tostabilise in you that which we have wrestled to discover and develop during manyyears of difficulty. I believe that you yourself will have recognised by now thewisdom of my suggestion and that, through the medium of your spiritual diary,the true “colour” and quality of your life will emerge with significance.Forget not, however, that the purpose of all training which I have given you andall my disciples is to produce a greater capacity to serve. I would like to seeyou doing some definite service in relation to your fellowmen.... I refer tothat service which a disciple renders when he approaches every human being as asoul.This type of service involves the recognition of one’s own capacity, theintensification of one’s ability to love one’s fellowmen, the power to drawothers to one with the request—spoken or implied—for spiritual help and then thepower to work with the person and give him right help in the right way. This, inits turn, involves an inner brooding upon the quality and the need of the one tobe served. This subjective process must precede all outer work; upon thestrength and the persistence [485] of it depends the success of the attempt tohelp. This process of inner, brooding reflection is oft omitted throughenthusiasm and self-confidence. When, however, it has been accomplished and theserver stands ready to help, then he can depend upon the needy one andcircumstance to indicate to him the next step. I would have you reflect deeplyupon this and I would have you begin—in a new and a fresh way—to endeavour tobring light to individuals with a pure, disinterested selflessness. I would haveyou work with discrimination, with purity of motive and with an effort toeliminate all personality reactions, for it is upon the rock of the personalitythat many well intentioned servers wreck their work.You now can be trusted. With that thought in mind I urge you to go forward. Onlyone other suggestion would I give. Keep yourself out of the picture altogetherand your private affairs, your personal likes and dislikes entirely eliminated.Let this work with individuals and this part of your service to humanity and tome be entirely divorced from your personality life, permitting no rapport. . . .You are entering upon a period of fruitful service—if you so choose.Let us now consider the rays of your threefold personality. In their rightunderstanding will come much illumination upon the way of service. Your soul rayis, as you know, the second Ray of Love-Wisdom and your personality ray is thatof Will or Power. But your astrological sign has been one of the major factorsin constituting your life problem. However, this has been a blessing indisguise, for the problems that it has brought and the difficulties which youhave encountered under the sign of the Bull are fitting you for the Scorpioexperience in your next life—the greatest experience upon the Path.Your mental body is on the fourth ray. Hence the conflict and hence, at the sametime, the deep-seated love of harmony. These have warred together in your life.I would have you note this. It is possible to love harmony so much that you willfight to get it and struggle to achieve it; in this way you enter into a worldof glamour from which it is oft difficult to emerge. Your fourth ray attributesconnect you closely to several of your co-disciples. I would suggest that youavail yourself of this relationship by an intensification of rapport.[486] Your astral body is on the sixth ray and this intensifies your Tauriantendencies for, as the Bull rushes straight forward seeing only that which liesdirectly ahead, so does the sixth ray fanatic. When, however, this aptitude isapplied to the path of service, much progress can be made. Herein lies a hint toyou.Your physical body is upon the third ray but so strong is your personality ray,the first (for you are an integrated personality), that it colours the nature,type and quality of your physical body which is definitely not a third ray type.Your rays, therefore, are:1. The soul ray—second Ray of Love-Wisdom.2. The ray of the personality—first Ray of Will or Power.3. The ray of the mind—fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict.4. The ray of the astral body—sixth Ray of Devotion or Idealism.5. The ray of the physical body—third Ray of Active Intelligence.You have, therefore, three vehicles on the line of the second ray 2-4-6 and twoon the line of the first ray 1-3. Three of your bodies are consequently governedby major lines of energy.~MY BROTHER AND MY FRIEND: April 1938I have for some time watched you with concern, not because of any failure onyour part but because of the very real success of your spiritual effort. Thatsounds a paradoxical thing to say, does it not? But success can sometimes bebought at too high a price and a special effort, leading to success which leavesthe personality in a state of complete exhaustion, must in itself be considereda problem requiring solution and—in your case—prompt solution.So great has been your determination to purify and cleanse your lower naturethat you have worn yourself out in the process; so great has been yourintroverted attention to the call of your soul that your “normal outer-worldhearing” (as it is esoterically called) has been dimmed. So great has been your[487] determination to achieve the good way that all the forces of your naturehave been expended in the work of re-orientation and now that the task has beendone, it would appear (I would ask you to note the word “appear ”) that there isnothing left in you wherewith to serve, by means of which to express the resultsof achievement or to express that joy and peace which is the soul nature and ofvalue to others.In physical convalescence, when the patient has won the battle but is too ill asyet to know it, there comes that difficult time wherein there is no desire toreturn to life, no power to be or do anything, and no ability to be aught elseexcept passive and uninterested; no capacity is left except (with the aid ofsome outside help) to hold the ground gained and to hope, somewhat hopelessly,that the time will come when one will feel differently. This aptly describesyou. My problem is how to help you back to happy, significant living, mybrother. Almost all that I can say to you at this stage will fall on listeningand willing but uncomprehending ears. Should I commend you for successful work,you care not. But, my friend, you have cleaned house; you have fought a goodfight; you have gone through the waters of purification and come through on theother side. You have stood steady and held the ground gained e’en though yourealise it not. But so great is your psychic fatigue that you see not the gains.You care not for the future nor for the past. Life has been hard and yourproblems great. All that was in you has been expended in facing up to life andto your initial problems; you believe, sometimes, that there is nothing left nowwith which to feel, and at other times you feel too much. You feel that there isnothing in you with which to go forward, with which to face the future—no joy,no optimism and no hope of real betterment of conditions. Yet you do go on. Youare still young and life can hold for you much if you face it as it should befaced.What shall I suggest for your helping? First of all, I would ask you to drop allthe esoteric and spiritual work which you are now doing—all personal meditationand reflection, the keeping of a spiritual diary, and (this may surprise you), Iam going to ask you to be one of the first in my group of disciples to begin todeal definitely with the problem of world [488] glamour. Will you provide a tinygerm of active life from which a greater work could grow? I am asking you tolink up definitely and consciously with certain of my disciples whose names Iwill give you and who are senior to you. Their task it is to swing their unitedeffort into the strengthening and helping of groups, occupied with collectiveworld service. Seek each morning, at a suitable time, to contact them—asindividuals and collectively—and draw on their strength until your own strengthhas returned in some measure. Some weeks ago, several of them tried to reach andhelp you, under my instructions. Now I would ask you to endeavour to reach them,not because you are desiring help for yourself, but because you need strength atthis time to undertake the task which I am giving you.... Let their strength andlove pour through you for your strengthening. Let the restorative forces oflight and love do their work in you and expect results . . . .One practical suggestion I would make to you: When right opportunity comes, seekphysical plane activity in some other place than the one in which now you findyourself. A change of environment with new faces and new scenes would be of realvalue to you and should be found. Seek this change and seize it when it comes.One final word I would say: It is the conflict between the pairs of oppositeswhich produces world glamour. It is the resolution of these opposites throughthe activity of a fourth ray mind which can, when united with others workingalong these lines, aid in the dispelling of glamour. To this task, your soul andI now call you. Live above the world of feeling and, because you have felt somuch and suffered so much, work now in the world of mind. Live on the mentalplane, in the realm of the soul and of the mind.In closing, I would add for your help the following information:1. The energy of your soul (second ray energy) has been expressing itselfthrough the astral body. You have been, and are Arjuna.2. Personality force has been turned to and works through the physical body.~[489] BROTHER OF MINE: January 1939If you will study your last instructions in the light of the happenings andchanges—there hinted at and foreseen—you will see how correct were my commentsthat you had in reality come through your life’s major battle and that yourpersonal conflict and your individual and culminating “points of crisis” forthis life had been handled and left behind. You are free now for service and thedestined service has come your way. The door to that service stands wide openand you are ready now for that measure of personal happiness which will tend tomake your service more effective by releasing you in your personal life from thefrustrations and the pressures which have so long blocked your soul’sexpression. Herein lies your opportunity, your guarantee, and yourresponsibility.The service to which you have been called is an arduous one but you will beworking with some of your co-disciples and when that is the case, there is addedstrength and more than adequate compensation for any strain and difficulty. Sonow, my brother, in this hour of strenuous world tension and of bafflingproblems let the light of your soul direct and the love of your soul determineattitudes, guide policies and release into your field of service the power whichwill bring the desired results. . . .I have little to say to you at this time. There is no special work to which Iwould assign you, beyond impressing upon you the necessity for making andholding each day a very steady and felt alignment. If you achieve this eachmorning with power and clarity, you can handle efficiently all that you have todo and work with ease and happiness. There is so much for you to do inconnection with your change of circumstances and so many adjustments to be madein relation to other people and so many problems of an executive kind with whichto cope and which grow out of the urgency of the times and the necessity of thework that, if you will do your meditation work and the other work alreadyassigned to you, I will ask no more. I would, however, emphasise the need forattention to the time of the Full Moon and to note down any reactions which maycome [490] your way. This will enable you, now that you have passed your worstlife crisis, to sum up the situation, to leave behind the past, and to goforward into the new life with a sense of freedom and with a just appreciationof the gained results.~MY BROTHER: July 1939The discipline of life has brought you far upon your way in this incarnation andthe door of service, as you know, stands open. Enter with joy , for that is aquality which you need to express. Only one thing should engross your attentionat this time and that is the avoidance of the glamour of pre-occupation. I knownot what else to call it. The disciple with a first ray personality is apt to beunduly one-pointed in his service or in his particular line of thought and ofactivity, or else he is entirely engrossed with some individual or group ofindividuals. This dynamic and intense pre-occupation can often hinder theexpansion of consciousness and the unfoldment of that inclusiveness which isessential before any of the major initiations can be taken. I seek to see thisglamour lessened in you. The dual life of the disciple is never an easy one tothe man whose personality is basically upon the line of directed power andfocussed will. This you should most carefully bear in mind, for oft thisdirected power is not being adequately diffused, and minor or near objectivesbeing too closely seen, can destroy that which it builds or seeks or loves,through the very intensity of the focussed energy.What can prevent this in your case will be the continuous application of yoursoul light and love with increasing intensity. Be not afraid, my brother, to bemore outgoing and more consciously inclusive, because by so doing you will fuseand blend both soul and body and thus balance your qualities and increase yourusefulness (and also ours) in the service of humanity. It seems a curious formof glamour, does it not, but if you will study yourself and your environmentwith care, you will discover the justification for my reasoning and my argument.Ever the soul has to learn to be the “turning wheel” or the “moving lotus,”contacting life in all directions and radiating [491] out from a focussedcentre, and this as a result of right pre-occupation with the Plan. Forget not,that a glamour is merely a distortion of the truth and a faulty reflection of areality.~MY BROTHER: January 1940What I have to say to you grows out of your earlier instructions. I wonder howmuch you have read and pondered upon the ideas therein conveyed? The thought maycome to you that in all probability I know and hence the needlessness of myquestion. Disciples need to learn that in the intense preoccupation of our worldwork Those Who serve humanity have not the desire, nor have They the intention,to study the details of a disciple’s life or to intrude into his own personalaffairs. All we are concerned with is to ascertain the growth of the inner lightand the quality of his service. We look at both of these as they emerge intoreality upon the physical plane. I would remind you that as individuals or asactive personalities (which is it, my brothers?) you “occultly evade myattention,” for I work with you entirely on soul levels and on the plane ofmental illumination. With you, my brother, the inner light is intense indeed,but it does not radiate. It shines at the centre of your being and with suchintensity that it serves almost to blind you. Can you imagine, as you considermy words, the effect of this condition? A light that shines in a closely shutlantern may serve to irradiate the inner walls of the lantern but of what use isit to its owner or to others? This simile is—as are all similes—faulty, but itwill serve to demonstrate pictorially the theme of this instruction to you.You have an intense inner light and one which emanates from the knowledge petalsof the egoic lotus—speaking symbolically. You have much knowledge and muchintelligent understanding or theory. Some of it you have applied; most of it youhave not. This inner light or knowledge does not serve to reveal to you theinner walls of your being—those aspects of the form nature which we call intheir aggregated effect the personality. You are conscious of your lower self,of your limitations, of your desire nature, of your moods and reactions, of yourfrustrations, [492] difficulties and disillusionments; you are aware of what youwould like to be, but what you are in expression engrosses your attention to thepoint of inertia.In my last instruction to you, I referred to the “glamour of preoccupation”which engulfed you, surrounded you and conditioned you. That glamour stillpersists, perhaps even more strongly. It means an intense, unavoidable (fromyour point of view) preoccupation with yourself, with what concerns you, withwhat you like, with how you feel, physically and emotionally, with your reactionto people and environment and with the material aspects of daily living—money,health, surroundings and people’s personalities. This condition is now so acutethat you whirl at the centre of your daily life, seeing nothing of reality asyou might see it, hearing nothing but the reverberations of your own thoughtsand, my brother, getting no true joy or pleasure out of the life of service.I seek not to discourage you, for even your discouragement is a preoccupationwith which you can well dispense. I seek to lift you out of the bog in which youare foundering (or should I say, floundering? These niceties of the Englishlanguage still present difficulties to me) and to send you on your wayrejoicing. Is it any use for me to point out to you that, in the light of worldpain, you have little whereof to complain; that in the sight of world sorrow,your life holds nothing comparable; that before the woe of the women and thelittle children and of human beings in most countries, your life has in itlittle to cause you concern? There are people around you who care for you insecurity; you have co-workers who are your friends and from whom you are notwrenched by the cruel uses of war; you have a life task wherein you can serve Usand humanity; you have no lack of life’s necessities and know not thesignificance of cold and starvation or of a future which holds nothing butfurther agony; you are not wracked with pain nor have you to look on at the painof others.What, therefore, is the cause of your condition? What lies at the root of yourmalaise (as the Latins call it)? What leads to your sense of physical ill and tothe gloom and depression with which you greet the world? Just the glamour ofpreoccupation—[493] an intense preoccupation with yourself. If I should callthis attitude “self-pity,” will you accept it and use your intelligent mind toreason yourself out of your impasse?Disciples need to learn discrimination in the use of the instruments which theyshould use to free themselves from limitations and liabilities. There is toomuch loose talking re “calling in the soul” or similar terms. Yet it is not thesoul which must be called in; for you, the use of the mental processes (whichyou possess in full measure for your need) will clarify the issue. Reason outthe causes of your sense of frustration and of blocking—both materially andspiritually. Specify to yourself the nature of your grievances against life andplace before yourself your paralleling sources of content. Cultivate a sense ofthe relative values, comparing your life of adequate possibility of expression,your wherewithal to provide the three necessities of life (a roof, food andwarmth) and your environing conditions with those which today face countlessmillions and in which and through which they must triumph. Where is yourtriumph, my brother? Initiation is a process of graded triumphs and I seek toaid you towards that process.Having said this, let me at the same time remind you that any reaction ofdepression as the result of my words will but prove the extent of my truthfulpresentation.For your comfort, I would point out that were you not in a position to triumph,were you not upon the Path of Accepted Discipleship and were you not a man intouch with his own soul, I would not take the time or trouble to help you seeand wrestle with your problem.I, your Master, believe in you and in your capacity to throw off the glamour ofpreoccupation. I have confidence that no matter how hard the struggle, you willpersist unto the triumphant end.Your isolated first ray personality at its relatively high point of integrationhas now undue control. It must be dominated by the soul whose nature is love.Knowledge you have. More love you need. When I say “love,” I refer to soul loveand not to affection, emotion or sentiment. I refer to that detached, [494] deeplove which can pour through the personality, releasing it from limitedexpression and at the same time streams out into the environment.How release the love aspect of your soul? That is for you the major problem atthis time. By meditation, and by certain practical measures. These latter youmust work out for your self; the Master can point out to you the goal, indicatethe hindrances and suggest solutions. These three conditions I have met. Thedisciple studies the situation and then applies those methods which seem to himto be promising and to be rightly indicated.I suggest, therefore, a careful process of reasoning for you so that the rootsof your pre-occupation with the little self may be discovered by you. It is notacceptance of my statements which is required; it is a mental activity carriedon by you alone which will enable you to find out the truth of what I haveindicated and lead you to take the needed steps. Having reasoned the matter out,then struggle not with the discovered condition but apply to your life theopposing quality with determination and persistence. Self-pity must give placeto compassionate interest in others—those in your own home, in your businessrelations and in all whom you meet and life and fate throws in your way.Isolation must give place to cooperation, not an enforced cooperation but aspontaneous longing to be with and to share with others the processes of living,loving, occult duty. Ponder much upon this last phrase. It is a seed thought foryour life at present.The second suggestion is the cultivation of indifference—that spiritualindifference which pays no undue attention to the physical body, or to moods andfeelings or to mental illusions. The body exists and must receive due care; thefeelings and moods are potent and exhausting and from them, my brother, comemuch of your physical discomfort. Deal with them not by struggling but bysubstitution of other interests, ignoring them and treating them withindifference till they die of lack of attention and of a slow attrition. You paytoo much attention to the non-essentials.The third suggestion I make is to give you a personal meditation which may serveto aid you: [495]PERSONAL MEDITATION1. Relax. Identify yourself with the soul and strive to eliminate the personalconsciousness. Herein lies your battle ground. An intense interest in some othertheme is your major way of escape.2. Sound the O.M., seeking (as you do so) to call upon the soul. This soundingof the O.M. is directed upward from you, the personality, to the over-shadowing,waiting soul. It is the threefold call of your personality vehicles.3. Accept the contact and the response and believe that it does exist. Here liesrelease—belief in the fact of the soul and its relation to you.4. Meditate then upon the implications, using knowledge and mind as the methodof understanding. Accept the implications at which you arrive, provided they arethe highest you can reach.5. Centre your consciousness in the ajna centre—the centre of personality forceand integration. Then sound the O.M. again, this time as the soul.6. Then again sound the O.M. as the soul and see it:a. Purifying the mind so that the illusion of the separated self disappears.b. Driving out selfish pre-occupation and substituting intense interest inhumanity and God’s plan for man.c. Vitalising the etheric vehicle so that the physical body is galvanised inservice and flooded with vitality.Believe that this is so.7. Then linking up consciously with the soul, the real, inclusive self, go forthto your work.You will note that I here call on the functioning of both your imaginativecapacity to believe and on your power of reflective reasoning. The right use ofthese two aspects of your personality, within the radius of soul light, willbring you release. But in the earlier stages of this process you will have toaccept my word for it and go on, therefore, with the work even when you yourselfsee or feel no results of any kind. [496]I look to you for vital service, my brother; I am confident in your power totriumph. I would remind you that the triumphing must begin in your home and inyour office by bringing happiness and release to others.~MY BROTHER: August 1940You have been close to me for many years, even though you belong, in reality, tothe group of another teacher. He has, however (because you were new in Hisgroup) asked me to help you—a brother on the same ray. For years you have beenassociated with me and will continue so to be.When He asked me not long ago—as occasionally He does, though at widelyseparated intervals—what progress you were making, I made reply in the followingterms. I state my exact words because they also embody my message to you. Isaid: “He would make much progress were it not for laziness, physical inertiaand a refusal to make sacrifices on personality levels for the work.” This, mybrother, is a statement of fact. You block yourself on every level by inertiaand by the physical alibis of ill health—an ill health which is non-existent.The first ray personality can always be swept into dynamic usefulness andconsequent good health by an act of the will, the spiritual will. Your physicalsense of being ill is due purely to spiritual laziness—a thing you can offset atonce if you choose. You have a loving and understanding heart, but you are toolazy to use it. You could have exerted a constructive influence during the lastfew years, but you were too lazy to do so. You do the minimum of work for us inthese times of stress, instead of the maximum.Yet, my brother, out of all this analysis emerges the interesting fact that yourlimitations and hindrances and shortcomings are relatively small andunimportant. They could be easily overcome, if you so choose.When He heard my brief reply, He made no comment for a minute and then He said:“Only the will-to-good will aid this man and prompt him to excessive service.Tell him to aim at that! For excessive service carried to the point of deathitself, [497] is his only way of release from this life.” Having told you this,my brother, I have no more to say.NOTE: The inertia proved too strong and this aspirant withdrew of his own freechoice from participation in the Tibetan’s work during this life.~TO D. E. I.April 1938MY BROTHER:Your admission into this group and the assigning to you of greatly increasedresponsibility in the service of the Hierarchy is practically co-incident. Iwould ask you to ponder upon the significance of this. Increasingly you willhave to be more and more out-going, in a subjective sense, to those with whomyou have to work, for your physical plane contact with them is necessarilyrestricted to a very few, but your range of influence—through correspondence andmeditation—can be very wide. See, therefore, that it deepens with each newcontact, for otherwise there will be a steady thinning of the stream ofinfluence, will there not? You have much to give, and much to learn and toacquire. You are only beginning your life service in the field wherein we, theteachers and initiates work. You will make mistakes. They will not matter,provided you learn by studying them and are willing to recognise with truthwherein you may have erred. You will succeed, which is far more dangerous toyou, and will have to offset the consequent satisfaction by the development ofthe faculty of comparative relation. Ponder on this suggestion. You will beprompted to self-defense, and to excuse yourself, perhaps more easily than most;but a trained silence where you yourself are concerned, and a cultivated senseof values will protect you. I point out these matters so that you can, withpromptness and exactitude, make the needed adjustments and orientation whensituations occur. Your whole problem is tied up with your ray qualities, for youare on the second ray where your soul is concerned, whilst you function througha first ray personality. You have, however, a strong seventh ray developmentbecause that was the ray upon which your personality was found in your lastincarnation. Hence your capacity [498] to organise (which is of the seventh ray)and the ease with which you handle detail (which is a second raycharacteristic).But it is the first ray personality, with its quick response to criticism andits dislike of outer control or interference which must be regulated. There isno one to control you through your responsibility for them or to interfere withyou, and hence the difficulty of your problem. You have to make your own way,then, of learning and of cultivating self-forgetfulness. The man who standsalone, and who has determined that condition of isolation for himself has aharder problem, in some ways, and certainly a different problem, than the manwho is disciplined by the constant, ceaseless impact of others upon hisconsciousness. You stand very much alone. It has been your own wish, and theright way for you. But you must offset its unavoidable difficulties through aself-imposed discipline. I leave it to you to find the way. You will, I know,comprehend that whereof I speak.Your astral body is the most influential of your vehicles of expression and yoursensitivity is the result of that. If I might express it, I would say that yoursoul can express itself through your astral vehicle more easily than through theothers. The balance of influence is there. You are on the way to transmuteknowledge into wisdom, and it was this latent capacity in you which prompted meto place you where you are, for you are expressing the wisdom aspect of the loveray. Remember this. It is that latent wisdom which must be developed, and forthis, your service will provide an adequate field. Astral calm,self-forgetfulness, and the development of wisdom are the three things to whichyou need to pay the most attention. Conform to the group requirements during thecoming months. I will also ask you to follow the meditation here outlined. . . .Meditate on the following themes:1st month—The Plan. What it is.2nd month—The immediacy and urgency of the Plan.3rd month—The possible expansion of the Plan.4th month—The New Group of World Servers.5th month—The work of the groups of my disciples.6th month—World synthesis.7th month—The New Age.[499] These suggested seed thoughts may seem to you too large and general. It isjust for that purpose that I have chosen them. Your sense of inner contact, thepower to intuit, and the ability to enter the world of ideas must be constantlydeveloped. These concepts will aid by stretching your mental body. In quietnessand in confidence, my brother, must be your strength.~MY BROTHER: October 1938The way into the sphere of your richest service is, for you, the way of theheart. It is the way of renunciation but always the way of joy. So, as you passon to fuller surrender and to a more complete usefulness, I give you simply somewords on which to brood. These words have held the key for me and for many otherservers. In understanding them and in integrating them into your life, you willjoin the ranks of all true servers.1st month—I go the way of deep surrender.2nd month—The way of joy enriches all my life.3rd month—Renunciation takes the place of grasping for the little self.4th month—Before me stands The Presence.5th month—Behind me lies the road of broken toys .6th month—Peace rests upon my life.You will understand, my brother, the purpose of these particular phrases.~MY BROTHER: April 1939You have been so occupied with service during the past twelve months that youhave had little time to be pre-occupied with yourself or with your owndevelopment. That is very good and this will ever constitute for you therightful method of release, because it is the true technique for those whose twomajor rays in any incarnation are the second and the first. When the second raybecomes at any time intensely pre-occupied with the life of the personality, andthat personality, at the [500] same time happens to be on the first ray line offorce, a situation is always evoked which has in it the seeds of real danger.The dramatic instincts and attitudes of the first ray personality are therebyencouraged and fostered by the inflow of second ray force which, finding nooutlet adequate to the intensity of the forces brought together, produces awhirlpool of energies which prove always destructive. This you have succeeded inavoiding and I felt it would be of value to you if I made this clear. There mustalways be for you the line of active service, of constant pressure, and ofardent helpfulness. This is for you the Way of Salvation. Hence the emphasisupon decentralisation which I earlier suggested to you.I have not much to say to you at this time. Your mind and time and heart arefully occupied with responsible work for us. All I would indicate to you is thenecessity for preserving a due sense of proportion, a just sense of values andthe avoidance of all fanaticism or tendency to crystallise. Preserve, mybrother, a sense of humour and a tendency to play, bearing in mind thatrelaxation is as much a part of the spiritual life as is the strenuous effort tosave the souls of men or—perhaps more truly—aid them to invoke and evoke theirown souls. When you do at times cast your eye over your personality equipment,noting its usefulness to the soul in time and space, I would ask you to notewith care whether you are achieving a truly rounded-out development, and whetheryour time includes (as should the time of all executives) a due proportion ofrelaxation and cultural interests.You have a second ray mental body and, therefore, are not adhering to the rulewhich usually governs the choice of the forces isolated in any particular mentalbody. Those upon the Path do not always adhere to the rules. This type ofgoverning mental energy enables you to do three things:1. Respond with facility—if you choose—to the impulses of your second ray soul.2. Hold the mind steady in the light and thereby discern the basic principleswhich your first ray personality can so easily recognise.3. Work with order, skill and precision in your chosen field of service.[501] You must, at the same time, guard against too much attention to detailwhich is always the line of least resistance and of satisfactory experience tothose who possess your combination of ray forces.Your astral body is on the first Ray of Will or Power and hence much of yourdifficulty in the past. A first ray astral body is a powerful asset but requiresmost careful watching and skilful harnessing. When not rightly handled, it iseasily stirred up into storms and tempers or into the condition wherein thedramatic “I” is centralised in the life. But upon its difficulties and problemsI need not enlarge. You know them well. You are learning to handle them. Iwould, however, call your attention to the lack of balance which the forces inyour nature could produce; this calls for your constant care and yet—at the sametime—it opens the door of unique opportunity for you. The two major rays (ofyour ego and your personality) are repeated in the two rays of your personalityequipment and you have, therefore, a repetition of 2.1 2.1. Ponder on this. Whataids you considerably in this connection is the fact that you have a third rayphysical body. This may surprise you because the outer, physical indications arethose of the first ray, but that is due to the development of a powerfulpersonality and to the preponderance of the energy of that equipment. But thethird ray energy of your physical body is definitely one of your major assets.As I earlier pointed out, much seventh ray energy also governs you—fortunatelyfor you—because it was your predominant energy in an earlier incarnation and is,in your case, a well-established force. The above information should prove ofservice to you.I assign you no special work but would ask you to do the group meditation withregularity and with as much dynamic first ray intensity as is possible.In conclusion, I would call your attention to the fact that your rays areidentical with those of W.D.S., but would have you note how racial andastrological differences and your freedom from any dominating influence upon thephysical and emotional planes, have released you in some measure from thefactors with which he has still to contend.~[502] BROTHER OF MINE: October 1939I have practically nothing to say to you in this series of papers. Go on as youare going. Keep humble, sensitive to others and unmoved by circumstance.Remember ever that, in the work you are seeking to do, the key to all success isto realise that you are only a channel.I give you, however, the same exercise (in connection with certain words) whichI gave to W.O.I. Ponder with care upon these words and make each quality forwhich they stand an integral part of your life experience. Beyond that, you knowalready what I would have you do.~BROTHER OF MINE: February 1940In these days of saturated living (and this phrase will mean more to you than toyour brothers) I would like to say that I have naught but commendation for you.Thus to commend is not my habit, as well you know, but there are occasions whenit is of definite usefulness and I deem it so here. One of the keywords which Igave you several years ago was decentralisation and that quality, the very forceof circumstances is aiding you to acquire. The situation of constant danger inwhich you find yourself, as well as of concentrated usefulness will either evokethat quality in you or drive you back into a focussed attention to the littleself which distinguishes many. But you have chosen the selfless and the morefluid way and the effects will be lasting in your experience. This is for you amajor life crisis and there stands before you an open door. You will passthrough that door with rapidity according to the measure of yourdecentralisation.I have not the intention to give you a long instruction. Your instruction isyour present life circumstance and I need not say more. I will only say that Istand beside you and that, at this time, my protecting aura reaches out to you.It enfolds you. The aura of protection with which Those Who are linked to theHierarchy and Who are Members of the Hierarchy are primarily concerned isprotecting the integrity of consciousness, [503] even though it may (if sodesired and oft it is) protect the physical man also. It is the preservation ofthe rightly focussed and rightly oriented consciousness which we seek to guardand preserve and which the frightfulness of war and of drastic conditions orcircumstances may disrupt. You will understand whereof I speak; it is because ofthis knowledge that I tell you that I stand by you and that you may call upon meat will, for you can now be trusted to do so wisely and for right reasons.In the pressure of life today as you are living it, I give you no set work. Goon your way, my brother, with joy and service, with freedom from concern andanxiety; you are learning the occult significance of divine indifference. Yourdesired focus is not within the personality; the mainspring which can and willanimate your life is the surety of the knowledge that humanity and the Hierarchyare approaching each other with increasing rapidity and ever more closely.~MY BROTHER: September 1940You are in a position of trust and—if you so choose—your responsibilities canincrease and you go forward in the service of humanity. You are now passingthrough a cycle of difficult preparation, prior to moving out into a widerexpansion of consciousness and, consequently, of usefulness. This, I think youknow and have always sensed. You have, at the same time, a sense of beingblocked and frustrated in your ideals and of failing to express them as youwould like. You feel unable to demonstrate and to be what you know you are .This is a very useful point to have reached, provided that you do not staythere.The reason for this sense of frustration (as I could easily prove to you) isthat the glamour of pride holds you in its grip, working out usually as a quickself-defense and constantly erecting carefully prepared barriers. I do not seekhere, however, to enlarge on this. I would ask you to ponder on my suggestionsuntil May when I will give you, along with the entire group, your personalinstructions and your individual direction, and detail to you the readjustmentsand changes which you would be well advised to make in your life attitudes. Ifyou [504] can then avail yourself of the hints which I seek to give you, you canbe of definite service (all of you) in the coming period of reconstruction,provided humanity comes through the terrific crisis now upon it.Note, if you will, how this pride controls so much of your physical planeactivity and reactions; note also how your first ray personality and your firstray astral vehicle tend to increase this tendency in you. Here, in theovercoming of pride, lies your major life task and the crux of your life’sbattle. Sweetness, humility and the willingness to recognise values which atpresent are not quickly recognised by you are for you the way of release. A deepbut temporary distrust of your own judgment where people are concerned will bemost useful to you, for you see them ever in relation to their reaction to youand not from the angle of what you can give to them, and—in your giving—aid themto greater usefulness of life expression. Your positive and powerful temperamentleads you to draw to yourself negative people and you are happier with them thanwith more positive people. When you can attract the positive kind of people andfind your major pleasure in your contacts with the positively polariseddisciples of the world, you will have the first indication that the glamour ofpride is disappearing.I have confidence and trust in you, my brother.NOTE: This disciple continues in the same position of trust and is cooperatingdiligently with the work of the Tibetan.~TO C. D. P.November 1931To you, my brother, I have but little to say—not because you do not merit muchbut because you know the work that must be done and I have but to look on insilence to see eventual achievement. Overcome fear, my brother; kill outsuspicion and those vile children of fear—nervousness, foreboding, worry andthat instant jumping to conclusions which are dire and full of disaster. Achievethat inner poise which faces all that comes in the light of the Eternal. You areimmersed so oft in the terror of the moment (yes, terror is the word I wish to[505] use) that the astral turmoil permits not the clear light of truth and ofknowledge to shine in. Both are yours. You are wise and experienced in manyways. Sympathy, understanding, loyalty to the cause of occult truth andsteadfast endeavour (plus selfless thought) are yours and these qualities arerecognised. How else your inclusion in this group of mine? But much hindrancecomes through fear.Etheric weakness also exists and I suggest to you that in your meditation workyou imagine to yourself the pouring in of divine energy (which is a creativefunction, my brother) and that you send it on a mission to the ethericcounterpart of the spleen. Find out from a diagram where the spleen is located;visualise not the physiological organ but the etheric area surrounding it andpicture it as bathed in pure golden prana. This should prove an exercise ofvalue to you. Long experience in meditation should enable you to do this withfacility. . . .Be the sannyasin for the remainder of your life and in detachment seek to servethe Plan. Ponder on this last sentence, because for you it holds the secret ofrelease.~MY BROTHER: June 1933I have for you today a word of cheer. Part of your life trouble has been thatnot only have the physical and the etheric bodies been too loosely combined,tending, therefore, to a devitalised condition; the integration between yourmental body and your emotional or astral body has also been very poor. Lately,you have changed that condition and your mind and your astral body are nowintegrated. Reflect on what this means, my brother. It means that no longer willyour astral body (which walks in the veil of illusion) be the dominant anddeciding factor in your experience—as has hitherto been the case—but that yourmind nature will come increasingly into control and become the transmitter ofillumination as you hold steadily upon your way. You have to make therealisation of an hour, the habit of a lifetime. As you know, nothing mattersbut the soul. Nothing counts in the long run but service. Take your mind awayfrom all your personality problems and the problems of those with whom you havechosen to walk, in this [506] incarnation, the path of life. Trust their souls.Make and keep contact with them, via their souls, refusing to be glamoured bytheir personalities. Note, as the months slip by, what will happen as you holdthis attitude of soul attentiveness.Know you not that as you add your soul force to theirs (ignoring the formaspect) that you can galvanise those souls into increased spiritual activity?But, my brother, as you note these happenings, be not tempted to aid. Leave thepersonalities to their own wise, pure and loving souls. Rest back in thesimplicity of this thought and for the next few months cease from wrestling andbe content with the path that your soul has chosen you should follow.Refrain from breathing exercises for they ever give you discomfort, and ahaunting sense of failure. Each morning for five or ten minutes work with theart of visualisation—a creative art. Visualise to yourself a garden in disorderthat you are restoring to order and beauty. Rearrange that garden and fill itwith flowers, with the song of birds and with what you have visioned to yourselfas the garden of your dreams. See two things happen: there must be restorationof the garden and its growth in beauty. Let your imagination guide you day byday into the steady work of restoration, remembering the goal of this exerciseis to focus your attention in the region of the ajna centre, of the pituitarybody. There learn the power to organise. When your problems descend upon you,when you are swept by an ancient habit of thought that you know to be wrong butwhich has as yet a rhythmic power over you, then retire into your garden andwork there for a short while. In time, make your retreat into the secret gardenan instantaneous reaction when distressed and stay not there for a long time. Itwill aid you to break the power of ancient thoughtforms.You ask: What is my gift to the group? I answer: The gift of a pure andunselfish spirit and a rare capacity to give. No greater gift can be yours—thedriving urge to give selflessly with no motive but that of a pure and lovingspirit. For you, I have these words which are your own to use:“Let the pure light of reason and understanding dispel the fogs in which I longhave walked. Let the mists disappear [507] and let the clouds of care dispersewithin the radiant light of the sun which shineth ever in the fog. That sun isfound within my mind. Within that sun, I stand.”~BROTHER OF MINE: June 1934You are facing up to your crisis and to your final test of fitness for accepteddiscipleship. There is little that I can say to you except that, withunderstanding, I watch and wait. This is not the time for further words, for itis the time in which you must take action. You say to yourself time and timeagain: “If there were some one thing I could do to break the prison of thoughtin which I find myself, how easy it would be and how quickly I would do it.”But, my brother, there is just such a simple thing and yet, until you do it youcannot walk in the light. Also, until you do it (as this is a group endeavour)you hold back this group of co-disciples from fuller revelation and service. Thesimple rule is: Talk less and love more.I have no special exercise to give you. I have told D.R.A. to stand by you withdeepened love but to talk no more to you about your problem. The reason for hissilence and mine is that you now enter the stage of the solution of your problemwherein you must stand exoterically alone and fight the battle on the outerplane to its conclusion by yourself. But on the inner plane, there is a drawingcloser to you of those who care and can help.Will you understand me when I say that symbolically and psychologically yourfight must be fought out in your garden? Will you comprehend me when I tell youthat only love can free you? Not love of yourself or a freeing of yourselfthrough desperation over your own unhappiness; not love of those you so easilylove but the very love of your soul must be called in and, therefore, soulcontact is your solution, persisted in steadily throughout each day.Meditate therefore upon love. Say to yourself each hour—if you can develop thattime consciousness—I must love. Only one request do I make to you, my brother,and that is one that may puzzle you. Sit still every day without fail for onehour, [508] refusing to interrupt that hour’s silence and stillness. Simplyrelax, rest, read and think happily but let nothing, except real emergency (nowild and unconditioned fear, no suspicion or urge to investigate) permit you tobreak into the rhythm of that period. Sit still, not tense, but quiet andrelaxed. It is but a small thing to request but if you conform to thisrequirement, the results may be more potent than you think. It is an hour forthinking love ; for pondering upon the source of disinterested, detached soullove . Study along these lines, if you like, but sit still. Love and quietness,not resentment and restlessness, are your immediate task and in the achieving ofthese two things you will solve your problem and liberate yourself.Silence, serenity and loving service to all, without exception and withoutthought of self—these should be the keynotes of your life during the comingmonths. Restlessness and resentment, self-pity and suspicion are your presentproblems. Substitute love for these and all will be well. You evoke love inmany. This means that you have the gift of love. Use that power to love andbreak your chains in order to serve with freedom and to go forward in my groupof disciples to greater usefulness. I stand by.~MY BROTHER OF OLD: January 1935My message to you this year is the one with which I ended my last communicationto you: I stand by.When I last said it to you, I was under no illusion as to the extent of yourproblem or of the weakness of the agonised equipment which you brought to itssolution. The outcome of your struggle a year ago was very problematical. It isnot so now. The ancient habits of thought and the quick submerging by the oldrhythms are still possible; you are oft profoundly discouraged by the croppingup of the hydra of resentment and of suspicion with its many heads. Yet muchprogress has been made and your astral body is really quieter. This you knowyourself. You are finding it easier to swing into other interests. The periodsof submergence in the old lines of thought do not last so long and yourunderstanding is growing.[509] The fight is not yet over but by May, 1936, you should have reached apoint where the sense of inner freedom will be so strong that you will realisethat the things which affect the personality and which come from the point ofdevelopment and from the lack of control of the personalities with which you areassociated will fail to exert any real power over you. You will be fastattaining the attitude of the Observer, of the one who looks on—knowing himselfto be the controlling soul.Will you, my brother, take the various personal instructions I have given youduring the past years and—on some quiet day—read them through uninterruptedlyand at one sitting? You will, in this way, get a picture of your spiritualproblem (and of my effort to help you solve it) that will be constructivelyuseful. You will discover also that there has been real growth on your part.Your problem is not this or that circumstance in your life. It is not concernedwith the activity of this or that person. It is not tied up with your familylife, your financial circumstances or your health. These are but the stagingaround which you struggle for liberation. These are but the opportunitiesoffered by your soul which, when rightly used, will set you upon the Path ofInitiation. Yes, that is what I said, my brother—upon the Path of Initiation andnot upon the Path of Discipleship. You are already upon the latter path. Youknow well within yourself that if you could achieve detachment and if you couldarrive at a stable, focussed mind that the whole of life would simplify for you.Initiation is simplification.You are rich in the real love of many people. Your physical plane circumstances,viewed in the light of the present world problem, are good. Your health problemis rooted in your astral condition. By overcoming the glamour in which you walk,you would find yourself so free and so useful that you would look back withamazement upon your past life of illusion and self-induced misery. Your personalproblem is far from unique. What has constituted the main difficulty has beenbased on the fact that you are a disciple. The glamour and the illusion which adisciple can evoke is far more potent than that of the average person. Yourmind, as a result of the glamour, may be ever restless and shifting, but theglamour is the result of potent emotional thinking and of a prolongedattentiveness [510] to the circumstances of your physical plane life. The sameattentiveness and potency of thought, directed away from your circumstances andto the things of the soul, will free you.Do you still work in your garden, my brother? Would you be willing to work in itanother year? May I (who have looked on for years at your struggle and who todayfeel certain of your victory) make another suggestion to you? Build in yourgarden an ivory tower and from the summit of that tower survey your life eachday. Build it until the time of the Full Moon of May and then at the time of theWesak Festival and for the three days of that Festival live in your tower andthere abide. In moments also of distress or of imminent failure mount to yourtower and steadfast stand. The tower is only symbolic but, if you grasp theessential underlying meaning, you will literally slip out of the glamour as youmount your tower and pass into the clear light of day. There is oft a mist inyour garden, but on the top of the tower there is sunlight, space and air. ThereI can meet with you, if you rightly build and learn the method of ascent. (Adescription of this garden will be found at the end of this disciple’sinstructions. A.A.B.)Be more strict in the keeping of your quiet hour. Build then your tower of ivoryand may the light of your soul pour upon you and flood your life; may yourealise the uses of joy and of caring nothing about the separated self and maythe blessing of your Master rest upon you.~MY BROTHER: July 1935If I were to ask you to measure your success or failure during the past twelvemonths, do you know for yourself what your measurement would be? Would you say:Real success with occasional brief relapses through old habits of thought notyet completely transcended? Your success is real and there is much more light inyour aura.One of the things which I seek to take up with you in this instruction is thesubject of glamour. Glamour is the powerful enemy of all who tread the Path ofDiscipleship. The whole world is subject to glamour, as well you know, but whena man becomes a disciple, he contacts so much force (especially in the [511]early stages when he does not know how to handle it) that he attracts,consolidates and precipitates upon himself far more of the world illusion thanwould otherwise be the case. To this experience of the disciple, you are noexception, being a disciple in definite training. Disciples who live on mentallevels are freer from glamour than are those whose polarisation is more purelyemotional. Therefore, one of the first things we seek to teach all of you is towork, live and think in freedom from the astral plane. Perhaps the best way tohelp you, my brother, and any of your co-disciples who may be interested in theteaching which I give you personally, is to cite to you the conditions in dailylife which lead to a state of glamour. Then you can make your own applicationand see where those conditions are to be found in daily life. When found, thenglamour is an inevitable result. When recognised, however, they can be handledand the glamour will then disappear.Glamour is, of course, such a subtle thing that it ever masquerades as truth. Itis powerful because it finds its point of entry into a disciple’s consciousnessthrough those states of mind and those habits of thought which are so familiarthat their appearance is automatic and constitutes an almost unconsciousmanifestation. There are (for the average disciple) three main attitudes of mindand of feeling which predispose him to being glamoured:1. Self-pity. To this all disciples are prone. Their lives are necessarilydifficult and they are more sensitive than the average. They are also beingconstantly tried and tested in this particular direction. Self-pity is apowerful and deluding force; it exaggerates every condition and isolates aperson in the centre of his own life and the dramatic situations evoked in hisown thoughts. It permits two kinds of glamour to enter: First of all, theglamour of special training wherein the disciple over-estimates his importancein ratio to the testing applied and his reaction to it. This is not one of yourfailings. Your sane humility is a great asset, provided you do not give way toself-depreciation. The second is the glamour produced by such a deepself-interest that the disciple is isolated in a cloud of his own thoughts sothat the light of his soul is shut out; he sees things in wrong proportion andthe glamour of his isolation [512] in his trouble, and sometimes a fixed idea ofpersecution descends upon him. Here again you are not guilty. Others in my groupof disciples are more prone to this failing than you are.2. A spirit of criticism. This induces more states of glamour than any other onefactor; and here, who shall say he is immune? When harmlessness and kindness inthought and word are practised and automatically become a part of a disciple’sdaily life expression, then glamour will end. My brother, this one factor letsin more glamour into a disciple’s life and into your life than you can realise.Consequently, you frequently fail to see people as they really are, for you seethem through the illusion induced by criticism of them. That which is voiced inwords becomes a thoughtform, attached to its invoking agent and then the personis never seen except through the veil of this glamour. Consequently again, theweaknesses which are looked for are found and the real self is hidden from youreyes. You can check the accuracy of the above statement in a couple of days by acareful noting of the theme of all your conversations in the circle of yourdaily life. Are you discussing reality or a temporary failure in a divineexpression? Is your reaction to people in general kindly or critical? Are youprone to see the good and ignore the weaknesses and errors? Is there animmediate interest evoked in you by the relation of some wrong action ormistake, or do you lock up your knowledge of peoples’ faults in the secret ofyour heart, loving your brother more because of his frailty and refusing to passcomment or to criticise him even to yourself? I commend these questions to youand to all in my group of disciples. Right here for you—as for so many—lies theusual point of entry for glamour and until this opening is sealed, you will notbe free from personal glamour.3. Suspicion . The most poisonous of all weaknesses is this glamour; it isusually the most false and—even when well founded—is still capable of poisoningthe very roots of being, of distorting all attitudes to life and of bringinginto activity the creative imagination as its potent servant. Suspicion everlies, but lies with such apparent truth that it seems only correct [513] andreasonable. This tendency you have fought for long, and a good measure ofsuccess is attending your efforts. Give not way to suspicion; but be careful notto cast it away from you into the hidden depths of yourself, whence again itmust inevitably raise its head. End its power in your life by doing threethings:a. By assuming more definitely the attitude of the Onlooker, who sees all peopleand happenings through the light of love and from the angle of the eternalvalues.b. By leaving everybody free to live their own lives and to shoulder their ownresponsibilities, knowing that they are souls and are being led towards thelight. Simply give them love and understanding.c. By the fullness of your own life of service which leaves you no time for themoments and hours of suspicion which blight so many lives.These three things, if persisted in and practised, will do more to release youfrom glamour than any other one thing.The fact, brother of mine, that I can thus write to you indicates the measure ofyour achievement. Two years ago, you might have recognised theoretically thetruth of what I say. Now you not only recognise it but have in the past and willin the future deal with the problem in a practical manner. For a while it willbe an hour by hour and day by day fight; but the power of your soul is adequateto bring release, and the love of this group of disciples is sufficient to carryyou through. . . .As to your garden, my brother, I would ask you to enter into it early eachSunday morning. See your garden sleeping in the darkness of the dawn—no reallight, no sound or movement and no life apparent. It remains just dreaming andcolourless. Enter your tower and climb to the summit and then release the lightwhich is in you; this will be to the garden of your soul what the sun is to thegardens of the world. Watch the rays of light pouring out over the garden,awakening it to colour and beauty, arousing it to movement and life, and callingforth the song of the birds and the hum of the bees and evoking it to aresponsive loveliness. There I may meet you when the clouds of glamour rollaway. Ponder on the symbolism [514] hidden in this garden and work steadily forthe next few months from this centre of love and light.~MY BROTHER AND MY FRIEND: January 1936The same instructions, the same objective and the same necessity to cultivatethe spirit of liberating love will suffice to occupy you during the next fewmonths.You are now entering a period of crisis. Forget not that I have told you thisand warned you to meet all circumstances in the light of that knowledge. Thecrisis (which may focus itself in some aspect of your personality) must beregarded by you as an indication of a strenuous effort on the part of your soulto bring about a large measure of liberation before the May Full Moon. Your soulis mobilising its forces in order to effect this release and so enable you toprofit by the precipitating spiritual inflow. When such a determination existson the plane of soul experience, there is an inevitable reaction on the plane ofdaily life. For this you must be prepared and so be ready to profit from it.Your strength is far greater than you realise because you have never yet drawnfully upon the resources of your soul. This you will have to do to gain therelease for which you long.I tell you also assuredly that—for you—the cultivation of harmlessness is theguarantee of a constructive outcome to your crisis this coming spring. In mylast instruction I urged you to eliminate self-pity and this would then producea harmless handling of the personality. The elimination of criticism will renderyou harmless where others are concerned and the refusal to be suspicious willdispel your particular glamour, which amounts almost to hallucination. So yousee, my brother, that I am only re-emphasising my earlier teaching to you. Ofits value, I know you are assured and in voicing the expression of your need, Iam only voicing your own deepest wish.From May 1934 to May 1935 you made very real progress and your inner spiritualstrength was notably augmented. The past six months have marked an interludewherein there has been a great deal of fluctuation. You have been more subject[515] to external impression and less focussed as a soul on the subtler planes.There has been no marked gain. Such interludes are inevitable; there is no causefor depression, provided they do not continue, once you are aware of theirexistence. Now the sun is again moving northward and there comes for you renewedopportunity and the possibility of a powerful period of release from your lowernature and from the claims which hold you so potently. My prime message to youis (and I give it with the earnest wish that you will understand to whatspecific factor I refer): Let go. Drop that which you hold. Stand free at anycost, relinquishing that which holds you back.During the next six months take the following words and thoughts as seedthoughts in meditation:1st month—Detachment from that which holds the Self in chains.2nd month—Release of the imprisoned Self for service.3rd month—The burning ground whereon pure gold is seen.4th month—Liberation of the inner light, and then the treading of the LightedWay.5th month—Radiance which evokes the light in others.6th month—Sacrifice which reveals the glory of the Self.Be of good courage, my brother, and fear not. Fear itself creates a glamour andthe glamour hides the light. Love freely those you love.~BROTHER OF MINE: June 1936There is little that I need to do or can do. Until “the sun moves northward,”your work is difficult and yet of so simple a nature (when put into words) thatperhaps you may not regard it as of adequate importance. Yet I tell you withlove and not a little concern that upon your achievement much rests—both toyourself and to the group. It might be of value if I touched here upon aquestion which oft arises in the minds of disciples working together in groupformation and in a Master’s Ashram. Just how far does the progress ornon-progress of any individual disciple help or hinder the group of disciples?Because of the [516] innate sincerity of the true disciple, the next questionthat arises is: Which do I do—help or hinder? Let me answer this last questionin connection with you. You do not hinder. Your gentle nature and your lovingunselfish attitude militate powerfully against what you yourself are inwardlyrecognising—a slowly growing spirit of criticism. You are deeply loved by yourfellow disciples and the gentleness of your vibration—with its persistent noteof service and of love—have an unconscious “holding” effect even upon thosedisciples in my group whom you do not personally know. I ask you to rememberthis. But you could help more definitely and consciously if you could freeyourself from ties and begin to function in your home and in all yourrelationships as a true sannyasin. This I earlier pointed out to you. I calledyou definitely to the Path of the Sannyasin. But you are still only playingaround the fringe of that idea. For you, it is a symbol of a detachment whichyou erroneously feel you cannot achieve. You under-rate yourself, my brother.You have a persistence which is undaunted and which has guided you from yourearly days until now. This persistence is the hall mark of the pledged disciple.Will you remember this? You have never wavered in your search for light and fora field in which to serve your soul and to evidence your devotion to humanityand to the Great Ones Who guide the destiny of the race of men—and Whom youtruly love.You have also an inner recognition of truth and of the Plan which is far greaterthan you suspect and which we tested out years ago. You have steadily held tothe Path and to the work which we sought to have done, and have aided where youcould and have stood loyally by those who have sought to do our work. The sameundaunted persistence demonstrates thus and will continue to do so. What thenlacks? Undoubtedly something lacks and you would be the first to say so.What lacks is something most simple to state and most difficult to express. Thislack almost constitutes your Waterloo, to use a current phrase. It is simply thefailure to be detached. You tie yourself to those you love and oft the clinginghands of love can hinder progress—not only our own but also that of those welove. Do you realise that? As you live and love those in your immediateenvironment, do you ever ask yourself the [517] question: Am I strengtheningthem as souls to handle life and serve?Again, you tie yourself to certain people by thoughtforms of depression and ofsuspicion. Do you not, my brother? More than you think are their number. Theseare, however, less hindering to your progress than your absorption in those youlove, because they are well known to you and you are consistently strugglingwith them. It is your love, your clinging possessive love for those you havegathered close around you in the karmic process of life, that hinders yourloving them in the strong, true way.... I ask you to love more truly. Yourstrength and detachment have never yet been used. I ask you not to cease fromloving but I ask you to love as a soul and less as a personality. As you readthis, your inner truthful nature will respond. Your problem, let me repeat, isdetachment . You are beginning to learn it. What makes your lesson doubly hardis the lack of a major activity and a dynamic interest which would engross yourfull attention. This, however, is your problem to be solved in some way, if you,as a soul, can take hold of your personality in a new and vital manner.I can but give you a word and one hint: Let not your physical body dictate toyou. Physical disability is the refuge sometimes of those who feel that theirlives do not provide them with that which they desire, or it is the refuge ofthose who feel that they have failed upon the Way.You have not failed, my brother. I repeat this to you: You have not failed, andI know whereof I speak. Those of us who function with full vision on the innerside of life see the equipment and the karma, the struggle and the destiny in away that is not possible to you. But I do say to you that the remaining years ofyour life can be a gradual drifting into a comparative uselessness—theuselessness of a fruitless old age—or they can climax the career of a free soul,whose wisdom, service and selfless love can be the means of bringing inspirationto many souls throughout the world. You can now—if you so choose —capitaliseupon the garnered fruits of a life of constant orientation towards the light anddemonstrate the wisdom which comes from having been the onlooker, the studentand the servant for so long. Will you not become more actively the participator[518] and the active cooperator? One thing only can prevent this—not ill healthor circumstances—but a failure to be detached. Will you follow each day (notnecessarily at night) a review upon detachment and will you do itconscientiously in the holy and silent place which we call your garden? My loveand blessing rest upon you, my brother. This is a thing I say but seldom.~MY BROTHER AND MY FRIEND: January 1937For you (as for R.S.U.) I have at this time a word of commendation and a word ofreproof. It is a reproof of so gentle a nature that you will not mind. You havedone much to dissipate glamour in your life this past two years, more thanperhaps you realise. We, who look at all of you from the inner side, cansymbolically gauge this fact more easily than you because (as we seek out asoul) we are in a position to note what is occultly called “the depth of hisimmersion.” You are now more easily “discovered and disclosed” to the watchingeyes of all of us and this is due entirely to your own effort and to the growingpotency of this group of disciples. You are not so deeply immersed in the fogsof glamour though you are still held back by fear—not fear for yourself butneedless fears for those you love. You do not, therefore, see them, the problemswhich they face, or their individual paths of destiny with clarity; this, as youmay well surmise, prevents your being as spiritually useful to them as you mightbe. The usefulness of disciples to those who are linked karmically to them andfor whom they feel—rightly or wrongly—a sense of responsibility shifts fromstage to stage with growth. One’s physical care for one’s loved ones may andmust persist in some measure, though a mother’s care for a child cannot persistinto adult years. There may be a responsibility which one chooses to shoulder(again rightly or wrongly), but it must not offset or undermine anyresponsibility which it should be theirs to shoulder. One’s mental assistanceshould be always available but it should not be given when one’s mind isbewildered by the fogs of questioning and doubt or when there is a spirit ofcriticism. One’s spiritual responsibility is, curiously enough, usually the lastto be recognised; [519] and action taken on that recognition is equally slow.Yet, in the last analysis, it is by far the most important, for one’s spiritualinfluence can be lasting and can carry with it releasing power to those we love,whereas the other responsibilities—being those of personalityrelationships—always carry with them glamour and that which is not of thekingdom of the spirit.For the remaining years of your life lay the emphasis upon your spiritualresponsibilities and your spiritual effect upon all you contact, or with whomyour lot is cast. Work ever along the line of soul contact, leading to soulrelease and to the soul activity of those you love, and e’en of those you maynot love! Thus you will begin to work on and from spiritual levels and yourpotency as a worker will silently increase. This will in no way negate yourright usefulness on planes other and lower than the spiritual.You are learning fast, my brother, and can break through to a deepened and morerealised knowledge if you can train yourself in detachment from personalityactivity with its unwise speech or silences, its criticisms or its bolstering ofthat which is undesirable in others and its moments of agonised indecision,based on a fear which—in your case—is ever that of and for the personalityaspect. This is apt to sweep you into unwise action or words, and prevent yourfollowing of the light and the service which appear so clearly to your vision inyour high moments. Is this not so, my brother? But this is all that I have ofthe nature of reproof and it is tempered by a just need of recognition for truepast achievement and for your unfaltering aspiration and steadfast service.For you the group meditation is peculiarly suited and useful; it brings thestrength to you that is needed and serves to clear both your vision and yourpath. Adhere, therefore, to it with closeness and attention.... And, my brother,follow the occult exercises indicated and return again to your garden whichstill can be found—serene and fair—within the world of thought. The summit ofits tower pierces the world of souls and, when you mount the steps which leadthere, you will find yourself in the realm of clear vision, wide wisdom anduniversal love.Stand with steadfastness during this coming year and stand detached. Let not thelesser voices crowd out the voice of your [520] soul or my voice. Keep thechannel clear. This is my final word to you: Keep the channel clear. If you willdo this, then the decisions of moment which may come your way will be faced inthe light of the soul and clear, prompt action supervene with good results. Theadvice which you may be called upon to give will not then be based on fear orany weakness of personality love but will carry the triumphant note of the soulwho knows. Break through, my brother, from the trammels of the past and be thetrue sannyasin, desiring nothing for the separated self, and carrying that trueselflessness—which you have ever evidenced—to the heights of full surrender.~MY BROTHER AND FAITHFUL FRIEND: July 1937How can I put your problem to you so clearly that you will accept the statedfacts and live by them? In no way, except by giving you information, suggestingto you that you act upon it and wait for the results, acting with theintelligence which outstandingly is yours and the persistence you have shownthroughout this life.Your mental body is on the fifth ray and, therefore, you have an intenselyanalytical mind. I would, however, remind you that you are analytical but notdiscriminating. Ponder on this distinction.Your astral body is governed by the sixth ray and is as yet largely subservientto the will of the personality. This leads you to devote yourself to yourpersonality surroundings and to the conditions which karmically you have evoked.Your physical body is also on the sixth ray which makes it—and, therefore, yourbrain—predominantly the servant of your astral body but it also makes youintuitive or astral-buddhic. Therefore, I would have you note that, in yourcase, there is an exception to the usual rule controlling the physical body, forvery few physical bodies are on the sixth ray, as is yours.1. The soul ray—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.2. The personality ray—the sixth Ray of Devotion.3. The ray of the mind—the fifth Ray of Concrete Science. [521]4. The ray of the astral body—the sixth Ray of Devotion.5. The ray of the physical body—the sixth Ray of Devotion.It will be clear to you, therefore, that much of your problem can be summed upby the recognition of the relation existing between the personality, the astralbody and the physical body. The physical body and the astral body are,therefore, automatically the servants of the personality. Yet the relationbetween the sixth and the second rays is so close that the problem of your soulis not insuperable in this life.~MY BROTHER: January 1938The past few months have seen the working out of much inner tension. This hasmaterialised upon the physical plane as a sense of real fatigue and has climaxedin a period of illness. But—when inner causes have spent themselves in physicaleffects—there then follows a period of liberation and of adjustment. My word foryou is, therefore: Let not the inner tension resume its sway. You might at thispoint rightly ask: How shall I prevent this happening? By remembering, mybrother, that though the environing conditions may remain relatively the same,you yourself are not the same. You have arrived at a new measure of detachedfreedom and to this freedom you now must hold. The dominant note which shouldrule your life during the next few months is to stand steadily in spiritualrealisation. This will necessarily involve a close watchfulness over thepersonality. You will have to see that old thoughtforms of fear and of worry donot resume their ancient sway and that old emotional reactions are not permittedto take form. Note how I have worded this injunction.Stand as the soul and (as a constant habit of life) develop the attitude ofrecognising your own divinity in daily expression. A close watchfulness over thefirst faint tendency to swing into the old rhythm will be necessary, coupledwith a sane and immediate handling of old forms of weakness. For you the word,“substitution,” may prove of real help, enabling you to substitute a fresh andvital interest in the place of the old emerging ideas; and to substitute adefinite physical plane [522] activity in the place of emotional crisis; and todiscipline your lower life into ways of joy and of happy activity. Joy wouldprove for you a major healing factor.For years, my brother, I have referred frequently to your garden of beauty.First of all, I had to lead you to create it; later I taught you to perfect itand then to use it. I taught you also how to dedicate it and to turn it into ashrine of consecration and connect it in your mind with the thought of service.That which is thus created and used, exists. Today I would like to tell you thaton the inner planes your garden is of service to my group of disciples and toothers—in larger numbers than you think. It is a place of gathering for many anda place of refuge for a few. Ponder on this and continue your task ofbeautifying it. Remember ever, that those who seek its loveliness come not onlyfor the garden but also come in order to contact you who, upon the inner side,appears other than you fancy yourself to be in physical incarnation.Now there remains for you to make for others a garden of your life upon thephysical plane. Much you have learned during the past years and though oldrhythms and thought habits often draw you back outside your garden of peace, youfind your way there again with greater speed. You do not wander quite so ofteninto the mazes of worry and into the foggy lowlands of glamour.See to it that during the next nine months you preserve an attitude of spiritualindifference or of divine carelessness and emotional detachment. Upon thesethree words—particularly the first two—I would beg you earnestly to ponder.Stand in your garden but when there comes the urge to venture forth upon anerrand of concern, of anxiety or to satisfy suspicion, treat it withindifference and care not what may eventuate. Naught can occur that can reallyshatter your achieved balance. Know this.Stand as a centre of strength to all you meet and cast not my suggestion asidebecause your personality rejects the possibility of achievement. Upon the innerplanes you have achieved; upon the outer plane today see that that achievementis also demonstrated. From the place wherein your physical plane life is lived,let there go forth that which can heal and [523] bless. Nothing can stop thisblessing; it speeds forth upon the wings of detachment and from a heart that hasno care for itself; it goes upon its mission because you have learned to trustthe souls of those with whom your lot is cast. . . .I will give you the following eight sentences as seed thoughts for yourmeditation and would ask you to ponder them with care during the next eightmonths:1st month Upon my tower I stand and naught can reach me here. Thus to the workwhich comes my way I dedicate myself. 2nd month Only my soul can reach the pointof strength whereon I stand and to my soul that way is always open. To the taskmy soul assigns, I dedicate myself. 3rd month From the high point I oft comedown and walk the ways of life and beauty with my brothers. To the task ofhelping them I dedicate myself. 4th month The radiance of love I seek to showeron all I meet and to this life of radiant love, I dedicate myself. 5th monthWith carelessness divine, I face my daily life, knowing that all is well. To theaid of those I serve, the Masters of the Way, I dedicate myself. 6th month Withtrue divine indifference I shoulder every load that comes my way, for naught cantouch my soul. To manifest this confidence, I dedicate myself. 7th month Thosewho are given to me to love, upon the ways of life, I love and serve. I gazeupon them free from fear. To strengthen them within their souls, I dedicatemyself. 8th month Upon my tower, in the high place of vision, now I stand andfrom that point I live and love and work. To this high destiny I dedicatemyself.If you can grasp the reality of the service and the usefulness of the servicethat you can render, you will have made much progress when next I instruct you.~[524] MY BROTHER: January 1939You have made real progress. That is the first thing I wish to say to you. Alittle more clear thinking and acceptance of the facts which you know aboutyourself will set you free. Your problem is difficult. It is not based upon thedifficulties of your life, for your life problem is not at all unusual—thoughyou have given unusual attention to it. It is based upon the fact that you havea sixth ray personality, a sixth ray astral body and a sixth ray physical body.This constitutes a terrific combination of forces, but you assumed theresponsibility of handling these forces in order to break the sixth ray holdwhich that type of energy has had on you for three lives in sequence. You havereached the age of sixty (or is it a little more, my brother?) and have not yetbroken it. Therefore, your soul purpose has not yet been fulfilled. Thedifferences between your attitude now and your attitude thirty years ago is thatthen you did not realise what it was all about and now you do. Then you had, inreality, no responsibility for you did not know the nature of the task to bedone. But, through soul contact , you do know now what the problem is and yourresponsibility to do something definite is, consequently, heavy. The glamour ofties and relationships has held you for years. The personality umbilical cordstill links you to your children and it should have been severed (and rightlysevered) several years ago. It would have been of real benefit both to you andto them. This, you know well when the glamour of the responsibilities ofmotherhood is not upon you. You have to realise now that you have no suchresponsibility.Forgive me for my plain speaking, my brother, but I seek to see you free beforethe time of passing over into the “clear cold light” comes to you. I knowwhereof you are capable. You are not using the power of your second ray soulwhich can love and sever at the same time; which can convey the deepest love,subjectively and protectingly, and yet—on the outer plane—can set people free.Let me repeat again: You have no responsibility for your children and never havehad since they reached maturity and the right to live their own lives. You haveearned the right to your own soul’s freedom and expression. [525] Will you takeit now and free yourself, or will you muddle through the remainder of thisincarnation and, in another life, have to face the identical problem of familyrelationships and financial responsibility? As yet, you have solved nothing butyou have made progress and your eyes are open. Only fear, plus the deliberaterefusal to take the strong and right steps, holds you back from a fullparticipation in the service of humanity and in my work. . . .You have so much to give. I refer not here to money though that too must beincluded in the life offering of a disciple, at this time of world stress, Irefer to greater and deeper gifts which you possess and are apt to refuse torecognise—a loving heart, a mind enriched by years of study and lives ofservice, and by a loyalty and a gift for friendship which is rare, indeed, tofind.Your soul contact is established and this is a fact upon which you can count.Devitalisation of your physical life is due to the cramping to which you havesubjected yourself and your pronounced, inner, subjective withdrawal to themental and astral worlds. You do not express the reality which you are, upon thephysical plane. The thoughtforms which surround you drain you of vital force andyet, physically speaking, you have no organic trouble or disease. Thesethoughtforms sap your vitality and are definitely destructive—to yourself and toothers. Of these thoughtforms there are three. . . .I am giving you a special exercise. Go into your garden twice a week and meet methere. Discover first of all the point within the garden which I havemagnetised. At that spot within your garden, talk your problems aloud to me,pausing at intervals and listening for my replies or the replies of your soul.We shall speak when the silence of the outer life and of the personality hasbeen achieved. Keep nothing back but talk aloud to me . Do this with a listeningand attentive ear and, by the May Full Moon, you may find that we may havetalked the matter out, the glamour may have dissipated, the thoughtforms bedestroyed and the path shine clear before your eyes.May the rest and peace of consecration be yours, and my blessing rests upon you.It is not in appreciation of you that I take this time with you. Ancient karmicties with me, your [526] Elder Brother, and the deep love which D.R.S.unchangingly bears for you are reasons adequate to me. Besides—my love is yours.We are on the same soul ray.~MY BROTHER: January 1940You have no particular glamour, for you live in a perfect sea of glamour. Hencethe difficulty of your problem, for had you (for instance) one major glamour, ashas D.E.I., it would be (for one of your devotion and mental capacity) arelatively easy thing to break down, and so walk in the light. But you havesurrounded yourself with a myriad glamours of no great importance but, in theiraggregate, they tend to make you walk continuously in a fog. You have thecapacity to walk constantly in the light. Your glamours come to you from twosources. Your reactions to all life’s happenings and to your environment arethose of a superficial fluidity; it is not basic or fundamental, for your lifepurpose is undeflectable (is there such a word, my brother?) and your lifetendency is firmly and unchangeably oriented. But in dealing with circumstanceand people, you are pre-occupied with the effect this may have upon you and withyour failure to handle them as should a disciple. Your inferiority complex keepsyou in a state of glamour and is purely a personality reaction. As a soul, youare strong in knowledge; as a soul, you love all beings; as a soul, there are nocircumstances which you cannot handle; as a soul, you can dominate dynamicallyyour environment. But the glamour of inferiority (which is the result ofnumerous little glamours) controls your life expression on the physical plane,plus the second glamour of physical disability. Upon that, I will not enlargebeyond pointing out that pre-occupation with the work you could do for us,carried down from the mental level of awareness (where you always truly live inspite of many excursions on to the astral plane!) to the physical plane wouldrelease you physically.I ask you not to work as does A.A.B. who chooses with deliberation to work inour “suicide band” (as it has been laughingly called by one of M.’s group ofdisciples) but I would ask you to cease from the glamour of inferiority and[527] pre-occupation with details which keep you always devitalised. Enter intothe joy and strength of non-frustrated service . I will know better what to sayto you when I note what conclusions you come to in this connection, prior toMay.~August 1940I have for you the briefest message, my brother. You are today in a condition ofphysical distress and you, at the same time, are emerging out of a life crisisinto greater surety, light, knowledge and usefulness. You have naught to do nowbut relinquish all anxiety and rest back upon those realities which life hasconvinced you exist. Of certain things you are unalterably sure—of love, courageand the soul. Use not the mind just now but simply be and let the love of allwho know you, which, my brother, includes mine, flow through you; permit thecourage of your soul to strengthen you. This courage is not a fighting courageor any sort of struggle to be what is called “brave.” It is the courage of sureknowledge, held steadily and unquestioning in the midst of difficulty anddiscomfort. One thought only will I give you to repeat whene’er you are discouraged, tiredor weak:“At the centre of all love I stand and naught can touch me here and from thatcentre I shall go forth to love and serve.”NOTE: Four months later this disciple went forth “to love and serve” on theinner side of life. Though out of the physical body, she is active in theTibetan’s Ashram.MY GARDEN - BY C. D. P.In the Himalayan Mountains, I seemed to see a high and fair plateau. A windingroad leads up to it from the valley beneath. Mountains look down upon theplateau from the east and west, lower mountains to the north, and a steep slopeto the south, with the path to the valley.[528] This beautiful land in the high, bright air, has been made into a gardenwith walls—oriental walls—fourteen feet high, with, in each corner, aChinese-looking little minaret. A stream runs the entire length of this garden,from east to west; it comes in and goes out of the garden through arches in thewalls, where there are iron grilles. Above these grilled arches, supported uponshort stone beams projecting from the wall, are two narrow, stone-and-woodChinese-curved bridges, backing on the wall, and with a latticed hand-rail onthe side towards the stream. The gate to this garden is in the middle of thenorth wall—one of the long sides—the garden being more long than square. Whenone approaches the gate from outside, one sees written over it the words Peace,Rest, Service. It is an arched gate set into the thickness of the wall. Abell-rope leads to a bell hung in the arch. There is also a light, which shinesat dusk, on the three words.On being admitted, one steps inside, onto a path in the green lawn which slopesa very little towards the stream. Twenty feet down this path, on either side ofit, is a flowering apple tree, the branches touching. A border of red peoniesextends east and west from the apple tree, for about fifteen feet, ending, eachin a red rose bush, a most fragrant rose. The path continues down the slightlysloping green lawn to the stream, which is about fifteen feet wide, and hasrocks and ferns, depths and shallows. Butterflies and birds fly over it, andstepping-stones cross it at this place.The stepping-stones over the stream lead to a path which wanders towards apagoda of Chinese design, large, and with open sides. A circular table of someIndian wood is in the centre of the pagoda—and upon it a statue of Buddha facesthe entrance. Before the Buddha is a carved wooden bowl lined with silver andcontaining water, on which floats a single white lotus.There are brackets in the open sides of the pagoda, containing sweet-smellingflowers, mignonette and heliotrope. There is a circular seat around the wall,and rugs of some eastern grass on the floor. On either side of the entrancethere are panels with shelves, containing scrolls and occult manuscripts forreference. Just outside are four beautiful spruce trees, two [529] on each sideof the doorway, and firs and pines continue to the back of the pagoda, and godown the entire length of the long south walk, forming a plantation abouttwenty-five feet wide, including native mountain trees, and our dogwood andsmall oaks. There is a path through this plantation, which is full of ferns,rocks and wood flowers. Between two rocks is a spring. It is a place of reposeand peace for those who love the woods. Although one cannot see the lawn, onecan come out on it when one wishes, over the pine-needles and moss, leavingbehind the cool shade, and the birds and shy, small creatures—who sometimesfollow—and then one sees, a few feet away, midway between the woods and thestream, a long flower border set right in the lawn, and containing every flowerone ever loved! They are of every colour and every fragrance, except that red isnot predominant, because of the red peonies and rose bushes across the stream.Towards the western end of the lawn, a little beyond where the flower borderends, a lone oak tree seems to have marched out on the grass for a Druidicpurpose of its own, a shapely young tree, taller than those in the wood. Thereis a bench beneath it.Not far off, between the oak tree and the stream, there is a lotus pool,embedded in boulders and large flat rocks, like some of the rocks along thestream’s edge and in the woods.The lotus pool is kept replenished by water piped from the spring in the woods.Seated on these rocks one looks over and down about a foot or two, and seesthese beautiful lotuses of different colours.But the two ends of the garden are the real beauty spots—the eastern end, onboth banks of the stream, being a mass of roses, beds branching out from thestream in the form of wings, going as far up as the narrow, hidden path alongthe eastern wall, so that one, standing on the curved stone bridge (at eitherend of which are feathery clumps of waving pampas grasses), looks down onseraphs’ wings of glorious roses, shaded from faintest rose to golden yellow. Atthe western end of the garden the seraphs’ wings are of lilies, from the purpleof the iris to the radiant white of the Madonna lily. The shrubbery at the endsof the western bridge are “yellow bush” and lilacs. A fine [530] green vine runsall over the wall here, where, at the other end, it is rambling roses. Theseseraph-wing rose and lily beds, though large, do not extend into the corners ofthe two ends of the garden; trees are there, spruce, pine and Japanese yews;more plentiful in the southwest corner, as they form the beginning of the woods.In the northwest corner there are three tall yews, only—and the same in thecorner to the northeast. The southeast corner is filled by the pagoda, with thewoods behind it and the spruce trees to right and left, in front. Across thestream from the pagoda, in the middle of the lawn (the eastern line of thepeonies and the red rose bush not being very far away), is a circular stoneseat, called the Disciples’ Seat. It has a small willow tree and two shortcopper beeches behind it, and has an English box bush at either end. In front ofit is a natural rock, of chair shape and height, where the Master sits to talkto the Disciples.When one stands on the path and looks towards the entrance gate, one sees fruittrees, en espalier on the wall to the right, peaches and nectarines—and on thewall to the left, vines of white and of purple grapes. A narrow path runs thelength of the wall. To the left on the lawn is a rustic, moss-coveredwell-house, enclosed by bushes of sweet shrub and white lilac, behind and at thesides, certain small, shade-loving flowers, a very few lilies-of-the-valley,here and there a fern.There is a small, gravelled space in the front of the well—it contains a rustictable, where the grapes and fruit are brought to be arranged in flat baskets, tobe sent down the mountain, by donkeys, in care of those who have the right to beadmitted to the garden, to the ill and weary in the town below. (Old Aleck, asaintly old gardener, these many years dead, may be one who helps with thiswork. I do not know!) The well water is very cold—a bucket is always ready forthe descent. I believe this water has the property of giving one greater vision.It is pure joy to offer it to the thirsty and weary, and each day, among thesouls arriving, there is a different well-keeper, always one who has had aglimpse of the vision.I believe this is the picture of my garden!As you can see, it is a magical garden, for all the flowers bloom all the time,and of course there are many in that long [531] flower border that I have notmentioned, only to say that all the flowers one ever loved were there—but I haveplanted dahlias, for childhood memory, canterbury bells, pinks, phlox, smallchrysanthemums, platycondon, evening primrose—still memory!—sweet geranium,lavender, lemon verbena, sweet alyssum, old-fashioned roses, day lilies, tigerlilies (in spite of my rose and lily beds to the east and west!) and in thestream is growing mint, near the western exit, and other water-loving herbs. ButI think every brother who enters this garden sees his own favourite flowers—Iwant to think so.~TO R. L. U.April 1935BROTHER OF OLD:In this address, you get a clue to the answer of your question: Why was I chosenas a member of this group? Because an old time link connects us, and because ofa hidden development which is very unusual, but which as yet is hindered fromall outer expression by your inhibiting personality. These two factors: your oldrelation with myself, and the beauty of that which lies revealed within you,prompts me to offer you this opportunity for specialised training. You have beenpuzzled over this choice, having no particular admiration for the quality ofyour personality. Is this not so? I am choosing my words with care. You areprone to be disgusted with yourself—an inchoate and oft unrealised disgust. Thatis due to the ferment of the hidden spiritual life which you have yet to offerto your fellowmen. You have a faculty for understanding which you have seldomused, and a power to work as a psychologist which is as yet entirely unrealisedby yourself, either mentally or in fact. It is this hidden something that I haverealised and sought to draw forth.Your life setting had to be changed before it was possible for you to releasethis soul quality in service. As you draw it forth during the next few years,you will find it shedding a light upon your own past relationships; you may thenfeel pained at much that you may have failed to do in the past. [532] Forgetnot, that under the Law governing disciples, opportunities will inevitably arisewhich will enable you to adjust past conditions and any faulty handling. Seethat the dawning spirit of love irradiates your life and pours through you toothers, and see to it also that you render back to all, the love which you havereceived and will receive.I am asking A.A.B. to give you a copy of a meditation used in the Arcane School.I have made certain changes and enrichments which I will indicate to you. . . .Follow this, my brother, for the next six months. For your seed thoughts Isuggest the following words:1st and 2nd months—The golden light of love irradiates my Path. I am that Path.3rd and 4th months—As a beacon light in a dark place, I radiate the light. Istand in spiritual being.5th and 6th months—I affirm gratitude to all Light-bearers. I affirm love to allI meet. I am myself the love of God, the light that shines, the Way.The very simplicity of my instruction may almost disappoint you, yet there isrelatively so little to do before the inner beauty finds release that I seek tohave you first achieve that. Then we can begin our work. In my next instruction,if you make the expected progress, I will start the occult training which you somuch desire. One thing I will ask you to do, however: Ponder upon the use of thecreative imagination and the power of visualisation. I will also ask you toembody the results of this pondering and thought in a paper, thus externalisingyour inner recognitions.~BROTHER OF OLDEN TIME: October 1935It will be apparent to you that there would be no gain in my changing your workat this time, for you have been so short a time in this group that you havescarcely mastered the initial stages or the scope of the assigned work. That“ferment of the spiritual life” which lies deep hidden in your personal life is[533] increasing in its activity, and that which you have to give to your groupbrothers and to your fellowmen is nearer to the surface than it was six monthsago. He who walks with you along life’s path has had much to do in releasingyou, for the major liberating force in life is love . Hence for you the endingof the old life and the beginning of the new.Again, for the next six months, I want the theme of loving understanding toconstitute the focus of your attention. Forget not that your soul ray is the Rayof Love-Wisdom, and that, therefore, through the right alignment and thediscipline of the personality, will that love nature of yours (in all itsfullness and richness) be poured through you to others. Your power to expresslove increasingly will be the guarantee of the effectiveness of your alignmentand the success of your meditation. Before the time comes for you to pass overto the fuller life, lived by a soul when separated from the body, the expressionof love will be for you the line of least resistance. I mean love, and notsentiment, my brother.The seed thoughts for the meditation work during the next five months will be asfollows. You have that which should occupy your thoughts during several months.1st month—The soul and the self are one. Between the self of the lower natureand the self on the higher plane there must be at-one-ment.2nd month—When I, the emotional man, am dedicated to the soul, love poursthrough. Thus can I serve.3rd month—I raise no barriers ’twixt myself and others. I am as they, and onewith all I meet.4th month—There are no changes on the way of love. I stand at-one with all, andthrough the lower self, love flows.5th month—Give me to love, and give me those who need my love and let me fillthat need.Be not misled by the apparent simplicity of these seed thoughts for meditation,my brother. They are deep and profound and contain the mystery of the soul andof the cosmos.~[534] March 1936It is not my habit, brother of mine, nor is it ever necessary where disciplesare concerned, to express undue appreciation of work accomplished or to feed thevanity of the average aspirant. However, I would like today to tell you that youhave done good work in this readjustment process with yourself; you have mademore real progress during the last three years than you did in the previous ten.There has been a definite expansion of your consciousness and a decideddeepening of your spiritual life. Of this I am confident you are yourself aware.The recognition, by an older disciple, of definite growth in a younger,constitutes a responsibility to that younger disciple. I point out to you,therefore, that I recognise your progress, and I do this in order to spur you onto renewed effort, and also to give myself the opportunity to indicate to youthe need for your widening in the life of service. Vertical growth andhorizontal growth must parallel each other.Two things I seek to say to you. These are days of spiritual opportunity and ofworld crisis. They are for you, as an individual, days of opportunity. Adisciple makes his own crises and where a life is devoid of crisis (at yourstage of development) it means the disciple is standing still. It means that hiswork is of such a kind that it makes no impact on his surroundings and hisassociates. It, therefore, has no value. For you the necessity is to stand inyour circle of life as a quiet centre, but let it be the quiet which is achievedby the mastering of turmoil and not the quiet of a stagnant pool.I have watched you, my brother of old, for nine years, for there is, as youknow, a karmic link between us. I have seen you grow and deepen, and I have seenunder the exterior man, a new, tender and understanding man come into being, forI can see both that which the world sees and also the subtler person. There hasbeen for many years an exterior hardness, but the time is near when the subtlerperson (known and recognised by one or two) will appear and make its impact upona wider circle. This will be done not by deliberate effort but by therecognition of release and of accomplishment. Ponder on these two words. As asoul, stand free in your environment.[535] The second thing I have to say to you has reference to the definiteorganisation of your life. You must and should fulfil all your needed and rightobligations to those with whom your lot is cast, but you should also havedefinite times for the life of a disciple. In putting the situation thus beforeyou, my duty ends. The way, the means and the methods are yours to decide.Release will come for you through the right comprehension of the time elementand due discrimination between the essentials and the non-essentials. Upon theseI ask you to ponder.A more intense inner life and a more vital life of service are, I know, yourideals, but the one is dependent upon the other.I seek now to change entirely your meditation. The earlier one given hasaccomplished its intended preliminary purpose. I suggest to you, therefore, thefollowing. Do it with regularity, laying your major emphasis, however, upon thework of the Full Moon Approach and for five days in each month substitute thatfor your usual meditation work.1. As a soul, link up with your group brothers and with all who are close to youon the inner planes and send forth the spirit of love and peace.2. Then do the following visualisation exercise, after centring yourconsciousness in the head.a. See in your mind’s eye a lake of blue water, entirely surrounded bymountains.b. It is night, and there is no sound upon the lake, except the lapping of thewater around the little boat in which you are seated. You can see nothing.c. Then, as your boat rocks on the waters of the lake, slowly you watch the dawnawaken in the east behind the mountain tops.d. As you see the light grow, you become aware of other boats that are allslowly making their way towards the gleaming gold at the eastern end of thelake.e. The rest of the visualisation exercises, dating from the points indicated toyou above, are entirely at your discretion. I leave the picture unfinished,[536] leaving it to the unfolding opportunity of your creative imagination. Ishall be interested to know, after six months’ meditation, what you have done inyour little boat.3. Then raising the consciousness as high in your head as possible, meditate “inthe light” on the following seed thoughts:1st month—For me there is no light apart from others. If they are in the dark,into that dark I go.2nd month—I am a window through which the light can shine. That light must reachmy fellowmen.3rd month—In service to the nearest and the farthest I must each day dedicate myprime endeavour.4th month—I heal not with my hands. I heal through speech. Thus must I learn tospeak and speak aright.5th month—The mind reveals the truth. That truth am I. My words must open up theway to other hearts and minds.6th month—I have no barriers and no preferences, no choices and no separatingwalls. Upon the Path I walk and all to me are one.4. Then say the Great Invocation:Let the Forces of Light bring illumination to mankind.Let the Spirit of Peace be spread abroad.May men of goodwill everywhere meet in a spirit of cooperation.May forgiveness on the part of all men be the keynote at this time.Let power attend the efforts of the Great Ones.So let it be and help us to do our part.5. And close with the benediction:“May the Holy Ones, Whose pupils we aspire to become, show us the light we seek;give us the strong aid of Their compassion and Their wisdom. There is a peacethat passeth understanding; it abides in the [537] hearts of those who live inthe Eternal. There is a power that maketh all things new; it lives and moves inthose who know the Self as one. May that peace brood over us, that power upliftus, till we stand where the One Initiator is invoked, till we see His Star shineforth.“May the peace and the blessing of the Holy Ones pour forth over the worlds.”~MY BROTHER: September 1936The hidden gift of the intuition, released through love, is what you have togive your group. The technical foundation of truth is there but being the same,practically in detail, as that which your brothers already possess in greater orless degree, they need not that help from you. They need the intuitiveunderstanding which the soul possesses, and they need it displayed through love,unblinded by personalities. When you love people, you are frequently blind totheir faults and accept them at their own valuation. When they mean nothing toyou personally, you are indifferent. Neither of these attitudes is right. Clearvision, love to all beings and a pure radiance are yours to give, if you sochoose. Therefore, give.~MY BROTHER: March 1937There is no need to ask you to go on and climb the mountain of attainment. Theseed thoughts suggested below will give you needed hints upon the mode ofclimbing.1st month—Lift up thine eyes. Look not upon the ground.2nd month—Recognise the group of fellow climbers and not just the two or three.3rd month—Let thy feet be swift, and hampered not by earthly friendships.4th month—Let thy heart be full of love, and love the many.5th month—Stretch out a hand to all, and aid the stumbling on the way.6th month—Give strength to those who work for others, and work thyself.[538] Write then an article for your own clarification upon the use of love inservice and give seven rules for climbing—rules you have wrought out foryourself in the crucible of service.I have also for you a somewhat unique task. Think out and design a symbol—anesoteric form—which will embody the objectives of the group of my disciples withwhom you are affiliated, and indicate the way of service.~BROTHER OF MINE: October 1937I have but a simple message for you today, and yet the methods whereby you mayconform to the hints I seek briefly to give you are not by any means simple.Your major need is for an intensification of your inner spiritual aspiration .You need to work more definitely from what might be called a point of tension.Study, in the new group instructions, what I have said about tension andintensity. It is intensity of purpose which will change you from the plodding,fairly satisfactory aspirant into the disciple whose heart and mind are aflame.Perhaps, however, you prefer to go forward steadily, with no group effort,making your work for me and for the group an ordered part of the daily life,which you can adjust pretty much as you like, and in which the life of thespirit receives its reasonable share, in which the service aspect is notneglected, and your life presentation is neatly balanced and carried forwardwithout much real strain. When this is the case, it may be your personalitychoice or your soul decision for a specific life, but it means that you are notthe disciple, with everything subordinated to the life of discipleship.I would like here to point out two things to you.First: If you can so change your tension that you are driven by the life of thespirit, it will entail a galvanic upheaval in your inner life. For this, are youprepared? Secondly: it will not produce any outer change in your environingrelationships. Your outer obligations and interests must continue to be met, butI am talking to you in terms of inner orientations, dynamic inner decisions, andan interior organising for service and for sacrifice. Perhaps you prefer theslower and easier way? If that is so, it is entirely your own affair, and youare still on your [539] way. You are still a constructive and useful person. Iam simply here facing you with one of the crises which come in the life of alldisciples, wherein choices have to be made that are determining for a cycle, butfor a cycle only. It is pre-eminently a question of speed and of organising forspeed. This means eliminating the non-essentials and concentrating on theessentials—the inner essentials, as they concern the soul and its relation tothe personality, and the outer ones as they concern you and your environment.I would give you three key thoughts for deep reflection during the next fewmonths; will you ponder on them, within the head, and, later, brood on them inthe heart. These key thoughts are:1. The necessity for speed.2. The reorganisation of standards of thought and of living.3. The expression of:a. Sincerityb. Sacrificec. SimplicityI would suggest then that at the close of this period and as a contribution tothe life of your group, you write a paper giving your understanding of thesefive words—speed, standards, sincerity, sacrifice, simplicity—and their innersignificance. One of the key words which I gave you when admitting you to thegroup was the word understanding . Mental understanding you have in largemeasure; it is the understanding of the heart to which I called your attention.You can go far along the Path of Discipleship, my brother and my friend, whenyour heart centre opens and you can think with love . Do you understand theparadox of that?As with the others, I will tell you what are the governing rays of yourequipment. As you know already, your soul ray is the second; you will,therefore, see the reason for my emphasis upon the heart unfoldment, for it willnecessitate the effort of your soul and mind, working in conjunction, to bringabout this result. Your personality is on the fourth ray, and you haveconsidered this as constituting for you the ray of the artist, of the creativeworker. But it is necessary to remember that this is [540] also the Ray ofHarmony through Conflict, and it is to this aspect of the ray in relation toyour personality that I call your attention. This inner conflict, God-given andof deeply spiritual import, is a service.Your mental body is on the fifth ray, giving you your grip of facts and yourgrasp of the contours of the occult sciences. But this mental body must beguided into being an instrument of illumination and not simply a recorder offacts; this only becomes possible when head and heart vibrate in unison.Your astral body is upon the sixth ray. This gives you the one-pointedness whichis such an asset to any disciple, but it also gives a measure of narrownesswhich at times handicaps you.Your physical body is on the third ray. This gives you an active, intelligentgrip upon life and a coordinated physical vehicle. Shift your focus of attentionaway, however, from the physical vehicle which, at times, engrosses yourattention, and shift it also away from the mental body into that of the astralbody. Use the force which will then come through into that vehicle in the taskof understanding the “heart of things and of people,” through the medium of youropened heart. Your rays are, therefore:1. The soul ray—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.2. The personality ray—the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict.3. The ray of the mental body—the fifth Ray of Concrete Science.4. The ray of the astral body—the sixth Ray of Devotion.5. The ray of the physical body—the third Ray of Active Intelligence.~MY BROTHER: March 1938You are to be commended in that you have preserved your sense of the goal andsucceeded in fulfilling your group tasks in spite of continuous change ofenvironment and constant movement. I would have you know this and that thispersistence of yours has been noted and received due appreciation. Out of awidened horizon and greatly extended contacts should emerge [541] a richer and afuller life of service and a less satisfied reaction to your personalityenvironment and condition; a sense of values should be apparent to you whichwill necessitate certain basic adjustments in your daily life. Thesereadjustments will be basic, interior and subjective. They will produce (as Itold you in my last instruction) no faltering in your relations and your duty tothose you love and with whom your destiny is cast for the remainder of thislife; they will permit no slackening in your responsibilities to those whom youare pledged interiorly to love and to serve. But they will serve to provide awidened scope for more magnetic service and for a life of outer spiritualaccomplishment. For this you are well equipped and yet, with the exception ofsome words spoken at times to friends and acquaintances and the fulfilment ofyour home duties, plus your executive work in the group, your life is not yetdynamically focussed on service or on doing your share in meeting the worldemergency. You are not oppressed with the need to serve; you are not strugglingto plan your life so that you can render some definite service and you have noinner spiritual programme of service beyond the right fulfilment of your dutiesas wife and mother and of your social obligations. You lack as yet that “plus”which indicates spiritual efficiency; much of your time is frittered away inprofitless doings of some kind or another. It is that “plus” for which I amlooking in you, my brother, and for a life lived stably, wisely and based upon abetter standard of values.Part of the problem is connected with your third ray physical body which demandschange and requires variety; it dislikes quietness and stability; part of it isthe result of your fifth ray mentality (your personality focus is pre-eminentlythere) which renders you non-magnetic and gives you a vertical and not ahorizontal attitude to life. Your personality ray, being the fourth, opens widethe door for soul contact and (when that contact is made and established) itwill bring in your second ray energy. This, in your case, will express itself aslove more than wisdom, and it will render you creative in a newer and morepowerful sense, and make you so magnetic that you will become a focal point ofinspiration and loving service to all around you.[542] Resume your creative work, my brother, and let the love that is deeplyhidden in your nature emerge more fully to the surface in relation to the manyand not only to the few.I would suggest that you follow the meditation suggested below. It is definitelya fifth ray meditation and has for its purpose the revelation of the science ofservice. The fifth Ray of Concrete Knowledge is, in reality, that on which a manlearns to use all acquired knowledge of the “form divine” in such a way that theinner life is served and the outer form becomes the magnetic expression of thedivine life. It is the ray of intelligent love above all else, just as thesecond ray is the ray of intuitive love —a fact which is seldom remembered orknown.SUGGESTED MEDITATION1. Alignment. Focus attention in the mind nature to the vibration, the qualityof the overshadowing second ray soul.2. Then make the effort to achieve a point of fusion, holding the consciousnessat that point as steadily and for as long as possible.3. Then sound the O.M. as the aspiring personality and again as theovershadowing soul, and once more from the attained point of fusion.4. Ponder then on the following fifth ray seed thoughts or symbolic phrases,endeavouring to see them visually in symbol form.First month . . .The great Wheel turns—the Potter’s wheel. The vase of life isformed.Second month . . . The ivory puzzle box contains the many lesser forms, all trueto type, conforming to the pattern. They veil a central ball—the seed of life.Third month . . . A chrysalis appears. Upon its outer shell, upon the innerside, appears the pattern of the form which is to be. What is that future form?Fourth month . . . A block of marble, deep within the quarry lies. Hidden withinit lies [543] likewise a form of beauty rare. The sculptor works, patterningtrue to that which lies revealed unto the inner sight. He patterns true andbeauty comes to life.Fifth month . . . A bridge is built. Two forms are brought within each other’sreach. Build thou a form, a bridge.Sixth month . . . I saw all forms gathered within the Form of God. Thus onegreat Form appeared.5. Sound the O.M. and vitalise the pictorial vision which you have succeeded inevoking in your imaginative consciousness whilst pondering on the monthly seedthoughts.~MY BROTHER: March 1939My words to you in the last series of instructions have sunk deeply into yourconsciousness and, little by little, the inner programme which should governyour life is slowly taking form—even if you remain as yet somewhat unconsciousof it. How seldom do those who have the time and the leisure serve as do thosewho have no time or leisure! Reflect upon this statement and see to it that someform of life service takes shape in your consciousness which is other than thedaily round which falls to those who tend a home. So oft the tending of a home,the functioning as a wife and mother and the performance of the social round, isdeemed an adequate expression of service. For some it may and should be so. Forothers it is not, and you are among those who should function creatively andwhose life should be dedicated to the expression of inner reality through themedium of some outer form. What will you, therefore, do if these words of mineare true?The world emergency is such that those who are affiliated with or who aremembers of the Hierarchy are calling for all the conscious creative aid that wecan find. I call on you.[544] It is for you to find the way to serve and to gain the needed sense ofproportion, the necessary realisation as to the basic essentials of thespiritual life, and the tested discrimination and discerning faculty which willindicate to you the manner, the time and the mode of your service.I give you no change in your meditation. I would ask you to continue with theone which I last gave to you, eliminating all the preliminary stages and—after arapid alignment—take one of the symbolic phrases and reflect deeply upon it.Then proceed with the group meditation, for the united group work and thefacilitating of its preliminary technique of service is the major task for allof you during this next period of work.NOTE: Temporarily, this disciple withdrew from the group of the Tibetan’sdisciples, influenced thereto by friends, but in so doing, learnt much, and onthe inner side remains close.~TO K. E. S.August 1935BROTHER OF OLD:This method of beginning an instruction is one oft used by me, as you well know.It is necessarily a wide generalisation, based on true experience inrelationship with each other. Thus, in other lives, I have stood to you inrelation of teacher to pupil for some time, and that relation is now to bestrengthened upon the physical plane. For long you have sensed my presence, andsensitive people also, who know you well, have likewise sensed it. This you alsowell know. The contact is now to be more closely established; your instructionon the path will now be more definite and your way more accurately defined.This, too, your friends may sense, and being not free from human error and,walking oft in the vale of illusion, they may be led to see, hear and relatethat which is not the case, and which certainly can be ascertained by you atfirst hand. Use, therefore, discrimination, my brother. That which they havesensed is but my distorted reflection upon the astral plane, for all that isthere reflected is not seen correctly. My contact with you must, in the [545]future, be more direct, increasingly self-ascertained, and based upon thelinking of your soul with mine upon the mental plane. Ponder on this.Each expansion of consciousness is preceded by a period of testing in some oneof the three bodies, and in some aspect of the lower nature. To this, you havebeen no exception. For two years now you have been tested, consciously orunconsciously, and this climaxed in the illness of the past summer. This I knowyou realise. Such tests produce an inner unfoldment which may be more apparentto those who teach you than to yourself. This testing and its results constitutea responsibility, and open up avenues of approach to the central reality of thesoul, hitherto not employed.You are entering now upon a few years of intensified training. For this you mustbe prepared. Are you willing for a while to submit to what may be suggested byme, and, patiently, willingly and without looking for results, conform to mysuggestions? If you do so, you will find changes taking place in your interestsand outlook, and will arrive at fresh ways of dealing with life. You will alsofind repudiations taking place, which will alter the trend of your lifeinterests, and these will be based on a changed attitude of mind and a morepositive inner focussing. This process of repudiating constitutes one of thehardest aspects of the disciple’s career. You have moved forward upon the Pathof Discipleship and must be prepared.Two things require adjustment in the inner life of your experiencing. First, youmust enter into a deeper and more assured soul experiencing. This will involveouter detachments, inner re-adjustments and the steady development of theability to stand as a conscious soul in the light. You are not yet used to mymethod of instruction, as are senior disciples in my group. I only seek tosuggest. I give hints in the ancient occult manner, leaving it to you tointerpret and to act as seems best to you. I ask for sincerity of purpose on thepart of those I teach, and a willingness to act when the next step is illumined.I do not indicate to any of you at any time if there has been rightinterpretation of my words and suggestions. I seek to train conscious,responsible souls who will duly weigh suggestion and accept and act when theintuition indicates a procedure. [546] You will have to ponder deeply upon mywords until the rapport between us is more strongly established upon the mentalplane. I point you to positive action in line with clarity of vision could youbut see it. Perhaps you promptly will.Secondly, there are two adjustments in your relationships with people which youwould find it wise to make; these would have a releasing effect upon your soulinfluence, and thus incidentally upon your personality life and environment. Ispeak not more clearly as the latter lies between you and your soul and is noconcern of your co-disciples. The situation exists in the field of relationshipsand attitudes, and does not involve particularly drastic physical planeactivity. If you see not clearly to what I am referring, wait in patience for awhile, conform to my suggested technique for you and realisation may eventuateas time elapses.For a year you must proceed with care in your meditation work and for six months(until I next communicate with you) I would have you do no breathing exercisesat all. Later, when your physical health is better established, such exerciseswill serve a useful purpose.I outline for you below a simple meditation exercise to be duly carried forward.Proceed with it carefully, and use not too great an intensity as yet. It is ameditation which I give at times to my pupils and is called a “Meditation on thePath of the Inner Light.” This meditation comes at the close of this relativelybrief communication which has for its main objective the intensification of thelink already existing between us. This meditation with the general work assignedto my disciples is all I ask of you during the next six months.1. Sit erect, but relaxed, and in a position of physical comfort.2. Withdraw the consciousness inward in successive stages, using the imaginationin so doing. The imagination is a creative activity, producing definite innerchanges. Upon this you can depend, for it is one of the forces influencingsubstance itself. Therefore, withdraw your consciousness:a. From the physical brain, after definitely centering it there, to the astralbody. [547]b. From the astral body to the mind. Then recognise yourself as being anintegrated personality.c. From the integrated personality to the soul.3. As you do this work, endeavour to see the thread of golden light whichconnects these three bodies, keeping your consciousness steadily in the head, atthe centre between the eyebrows, the ajna centre. This thread, dual in naturelike two golden cables intertwined, passes from the heart and head and connectsyou, as a personality, with the soul.4. When you have thus carried it upwards, and seen it aligning and relating allthe three aspects of the personality, then pause in your meditation andrealise—quietly and silently—that:a. You are now face to face with your own soul, and standing before the Angel ofthe Presence, who is yourself.b. You, the personal self, and the Angel, the divine Self, are one essentialReality, manifesting through three aspects. You are, therefore, a reflection ofthe Trinity of Deity.c. There is in reality no separation or duality, no I, or Thou, but simply a Godin manifestation, Whose nature is Light.5. Then say:a. Having pervaded this world of the little, manifested self with one fractionof myself, I remain greater, wider and overshadowing all my daily living.Ponder on this thought for five minutes.b. I, the manifesting Self, through the magical power of my nature, revitalise,redeem and re-absorb this fraction, dwelling in the body.Ponder on this for five minutes.6. Then carry the life and light of the Angel of the Presence back againconsciously into the body and know it to be there, illuminating your mind,rendering positive and quiescent your astral nature, and invigorating andstimulating your physical body. Do this definitely and slowly, using the will.[548]7. Then send forth the incoming light and love in strength and blessinga. To your group brothers.b. To all in your immediate family and environment whom you seek to aid.c. To distressed humanity.As you do this regard yourself as working consciously as a soul and as a tinyrepresentative and channel for the Hierarchy of Masters Whom you seek to serve.These can only reach your immediate personal circle and environment through you.8. Then say aloud the following invocation:“May the energy of the divine Self inspire and the light of the Soul direct; mayI be led from darkness to light, from the unreal to the real, from death toimmortality.”~MY BROTHER: May 1936I have watched over you with a good deal of close attention during the past fourmonths. I realise that your major need at this time is increased physicalvitality far more than the virtues, characteristics and realisations usuallyregarded as spiritual. Some day, the sons of men will come to the understandingand recognition that all the modes of being, of expression and of contact arespiritual and of equal importance to the observing, contacting soul. This, Iwould ask you to remember and strive to realise.You have two things, my brother and my friend, to do during the next few months.One is to establish and hold a closer re-collecting contact with your soul. Thatcontact is already made and upon that assurance you can depend and rest back.But I would ask you to bring that realisation into your every day consciousnessby counting on it and by availing yourself of the resources and strength whichyou possess, particularly when endeavouring to be of assistance to others. Thesecond thing I would ask you to do is to follow a breathing exercise I will giveyou. I shall not tell you its objective as we will let the physical [549]results take care of themselves without any mental impress from you....Keep busy, my brother, about the affairs of the Great Ones. You can do much bythought and pen to aid your brothers to work with greater power in the outerworld. You must work from a quiet inner centre; it is not your task to strugglewith the forces of life in the market place of life—if I might be permitted tospeak thus symbolically. Know you not that we—the teachers on the innerside—need those whose lives can be shielded from the rougher contacts of lifethrough whom we can work? If some of our aspirants and disciples in the torturedcountries of the world could grasp this fact, they would not struggle so againstthe outer physical conditions in which they find themselves. They would livewith quietness, developing increasing sensitivity to our impression and wouldwield greater power through rightly directed thought. Ponder on this.Your mental body is on the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict, as you mayhave suspected. This facilitates contact with and impression from your secondray soul. This will become increasingly apparent to you as you learn to focusyourself in your mind. You will, therefore, bring in a fuller tide of soul forceas time elapses.Your astral body is on the sixth Ray of Devotion or Idealism. This accounts formuch in your life interests, which provides opportunity for service andindicates certain lines of impressionability. These require watching andnecessitate correct interpretation. Upon this suggestion, I would ask you toponder, remembering that when the astral body is upon the sixth ray there isnecessarily established a line of least resistance between it and the sixthplane, for you have the sixth vehicle, the sixth plane, and the sixth ray allclosely related. Students would do well to bear these relationships in mind, forthe lines of least resistance are seldom the lines to be followed. Yet, attimes, they are. Hence the need for discriminating consideration.Your physical body is on the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Order or Magic, and henceyour interest in spiritualism, for one thing, and hence also your choice of alife profession, for another. Hence also the facility with which you couldestablish [550] and hold a steady contact between soul-mind-brain. You have muchwith which to work and for the remainder of your life should remember this.There is much you can do to increase your ability to unfold continuity ofconsciousness between the various planes. I would commend this thought to yourclose attention.~BROTHER OF MINE: January 1938Will you study carefully the visualisation exercise which I have given to P.D.W.and then follow it yourself with care? It will be good for both of you for youare equally feeling the limitations of the physical body, and both of you—beingswept by the urge to serve—have much to endure in the cultivation of patienceand a right sense of proportion.I would call your attention with emphasis to a word which could give a key toyour life: direct knowledge . Do you not realise that in the quiet of your ownroom and away from the chaos of modern life (which is your present privilege)that you have the priceless opportunity to acquire that direct knowledge? P.D.W.has already acquired much of it and for him there comes the training (again inthe quiet of his room) to use it dynamically in the realm of thought. You mightrightly ask me the question: Direct knowledge of what? and I would reply:Direct knowledge of your own soul, so that it is a fact and a reality in yourlife and not only a belief and a hope. The way to that knowledge is throughalignment .Direct knowledge of your fellowmen, so that you understand them and can prepareyourself for fuller service in your next life cycle. The way to that is throughlove , plus mental study of esoteric psychology which you can gain through astudy of A Treatise on the Seven Rays .Direct knowledge of the inner group of workers with whom you are affiliated.These include your Tibetan brother, your teacher and your friend, and theyinclude your co-disciples. I would ask you to endeavour to get in touch withthem through meditation and by going out to them in love and an attitude ofhelpfulness. You could do much for F.C. D. from the quiet of [551] your room. Imight add, that he is seeking to help you physically and to strengthen you withlife (where’er you live that life). Seek also to be in touch with him. May I addthat my blessing and my thought rest constantly upon you.NOTE: It is apparent from his first instruction that the Tibetan knew from thestart that K.E.S. had only a few years to live. In his last instruction he usesthe phrase “where’er you live that life.” K.E.S. died a few months later.~TO O-L. R. D.August 1935MY BROTHER:You have for some years been actively and consciously working at your spiritualunfoldment. Prior to this, your life tendency was towards the light, withintervals of forgetfulness and engrossment in the things of every day existence.There was, in these earlier times, but little of steadfast, coordinated purpose.Now your insistence upon making the transition out of the lower into the higherlife, and your pledge to your soul that you will recognise no impediment orhandicap, has been noted. Assistance, therefore, will be given to you, and Ishall be glad, through suggestion and watchful cooperation, to aid you on yourway. I would remind you at this point also that, under the laws of the New Age,such assistance is given only to those who have transcended selfish aspirationand have lost sight of their own progress in the desire to serve. The Law ofService, as you know, is the governing law of the future and embodies the newtechnique. In past ages, it was the service of one’s own soul (with the emphasisupon one’s own individual salvation) which engrossed the attention of theaspirant. Naught else was considered. Then came the period wherein the serviceof the Master and also of one’s own soul was considered of dominant interest;the Master was served and duty to Him emphasised because thereby the salvationof the individual was aided. Now a new note is sounding forth—the note of growththrough the service of the race, and through a cultivated self-forgetfulness.[552] You are in this group of my disciples, as are all the others, in order tostudy a mode of service for which you are well adapted—the service and art ofhealing. All that occurs in your life, my brother, and all preparation that youmay make for future lives and all that you seek to do should, for the future, bemade subservient to that basic idea of service through healing.The best way in which you can develop the needed understanding and technique isthrough meditation. To you, the way of meditation is of no profound difficulty.In earlier lives you established the line of approach. You can orient yourselfeasily upon that way. For you, however, there must come (during the next twoyears) the mastering of the technique whereby:1. You learn to utilize the meditation period in order to bring about an intensefocussing upon the subject of healing, its laws and methods.2. You master the technique whereby you can project your thought consciously insuch a manner that healing can take place where and when needed.In the one case, you train yourself to be a “point of contact” for the healingforces of the planet. In the other, you train yourself to be a “channel ofdistribution.” Ponder on these two objectives, but expect not yet to be able toreach them. In the work of the disciple, the time element counts not. Growth,deep rooted and established, is the goal, and growth, if sound and good, isslow.In connection with your own character development, seek to bring about twothings:1. A decentralisation and self-forgetfulness which will offset and negate thatspiritual diffidence and dissatisfaction with yourself that does colour much ofyour thought.2. A tenderness which will grow out of an increasing capacity to identifyyourself with other people and their problems.Life has held for you much of difficulty during the past three months; manyadjustments, inner and outer, have been required. Detachment has been the lessonwhich you are learning [553] and indicates to you the way of release. Like alldisciples, in training on the Path of Accepted Discipleship or preparing to beso trained, much has had to be broken in your life in order to establish the newrhythms. This process is still to be continued and for it you must be prepared.You have, however, adequate light and sufficient strength to enable you to treadthe way of the disciple. You can count upon yourself and upon your own divinity.I commend to you the careful keeping of your spiritual diary. In writing in it,day by day, do so with the recollection that your ability to express spiritualthoughts must be used for the helping of others. “The heart knoweth its owndevelopment. The onlooker tastes the fruit thereof.” This thought, of ancientimport, will mean much to you. Ponder on it.I suggest the following meditation and breathing exercises. . . . It may take alittle while to accustom yourself to it but, given time, you should get realbenefit therefrom. . . .Then, focussing yourself in the head and remembering that you are the soul, doyour meditation work with an in creased intensity and purity of purpose. Giveabout fifteen minutes to this work.Then, give fifteen minutes to a close pondering upon the thoughts of healing.You could, if you so choose, pick out certain key thoughts from my words andmake them the subject of your close attention. Upon them make and keep notes.Then, give five minutes to some definite work in helping someone to a greaterlight and freedom, remembering that healing can be on all planes.I would ask you to go slowly and do all this work most thoughtfully.~BROTHER OF MINE: March 1936In establishing, as I do, a close and more enduring contact each time Icommunicate with one of my disciples, I feel that until later in the year thereis little need to change your work. You have been relatively so short a time inthe group, and there has not been time, therefore, for the meditation, which Iassigned [554] you at my last communication, to perform its intended function.Your grasp of teaching is so quick and so intuitive, and your mind processes areso apt rapidly to grip essentials, that it is vitally necessary that thereshould always supervene in your case a time for quiet reflection for theassimilation of the recognised truths, and for their incorporation into thedaily life.This group is today, for the first time, a completed group unit. The time forfusion and for blending and for the permanent establishing of a correctinter-relation must be prolonged, however. I definitely ask you to hold thegroup in the strength of your love and thus aid its progress forward. . . .Particularly, however, do I ask you to take peculiar care and interest inconnection with the Full Moon Contact for the establishing of a rapid and easyrapport at this sacred time, not only with me, but with your co-disciples. Thiswill do more to release this group and to align them with myself and with what Irepresent than any other one thing. It will aid in blending them together in thebond of understanding. In this particular work you can help materially, mybrother and my friend of olden time, because of your natural “facility incontact,” regarded as a service that you can render to the group.Go forward with strength, love and understanding and let not the lower reasoningmind deter you from anticipating and expecting great things. You have strengthand power and a dynamic will, my brother and friend. These are divine assets. Asyou yourself well realise, you hinder their divine expression through a failureto love enough. Be not hard, but learn in tenderness to walk with others.Thereby all that you have becomes constructive. Give loving strength.~MY BROTHER AND FRIEND OF LONG AGO: September 1936Will you take the following ideas into your consciousness and ponder on themduring the coming six months, seeking earnestly their subjective value and theirobjective realisation:1st month—The Way of Love is the lighted Way.2nd month—The will-to-power must be galvanised by love.3rd month—Each pilgrim on the Way is worn and tired. [555] All are sincere.Forget this not.4th month—Each life crisis can lead to extended vision or to a separating wall.5th month—The time is short. Only the thoughts which blend and fuse can last.The isolated Way is dark.6th month—Let the radiance of the heart lead thee to peace. Desire earnestly theloving, radiant heart which showers peace and healing strength on others.I would ask you, my brother, to study all that I have said in my variouswritings on the relation of the head centre and the heart centre, and on therelation of will and love. Write then a paper for the helping of your fellowservers.~MY BROTHER AND MY FRIEND: February 1937The past six months have produced in you a definite orientation towards yournext expansion of consciousness, and of this you are yourself aware. It is thisstate of awareness which is of great importance to you. It would also be ofvalue to you if you could—clearly and in words—express what you believe (in yourhighest and deepest moments) is the next step which lies immediately ahead ofyou. As a soul, functioning through a personality, what is the next recognitionor realisation which your soul seeks to have your brain consciousness register?To aid you in doing this, permit me to formulate three questions which may be ofassistance in this effort to express clearly something perhaps only dimlysensed:1. What exactly is the vision, as I see it, in connection with my immediateunfoldment?2. What will be the practical outcome in my daily, outer life of thematerialising of this vision?3. What will be the quality of the experience when I have made it fact in mymind and brain consciousness?You see, my brother, you are essentially the occultist, being a first ray souland working through a fifth ray personality. This is a combination of greatvalue but it carries with it its limitations because it is entirely along onemajor line of energy, [556] 1-3-5-7, and this is intensified by the fact thatyour mental body is on the third ray and your physical body is on the first.This last force type utilised by you in the physical body runs counter to theusual rule but with disciples the rule is not unchangeable. You will see,therefore, how the line of the will or power energy, intelligently applied,dominates your equipment in this life. Your astral body is on the sixth ray;this constitutes your “door of entrance” to the major ray of the solar system,and to the Heart of God and of your fellowmen. In your next incarnation, youwill need to balance this condition, and the balancing will only take place asis desired, if the impetus for it originates through the potency of the lovewhich your astral body can succeed in expressing in this incarnation. Therefore,for the remainder of your present life, the right unfoldment and the achievedcontrol of the love nature, as your sentient astral body can express it, is ofparamount importance. It is essential for your rapid integration into thehierarchy of souls and servers.You have done much of mind preparation and of personality coordination. Yourfifth ray personality makes the reception of illumination easy, for yourintellect and your intuition could be put en rapport with facility. You haveachieved much that others are still struggling to achieve. It is your astralbody now that should receive the largest measure of your attention and thenthrough it the world of true being will open out before you and you will add toknowledge, wisdom, and to intelligent understanding, its practical but mysticalaspect, the vision which is motivated by love. It is your astral body whichpresents you with your major problem.As we train disciples, we seek to develop in the occultist mystical awarenessand, in the mystic, practical occult knowledge. Your vision can be on highlevels, and that is where you, as a soul, must consciously walk. That visionmust, however, be brought down to a lower level of consciousness. The area ofyour natural being which is as yet the most inhibited, is that of emotionalreaction. Be not afraid of emotional devastation, my brother. Some disciplesmight ask me what I mean by that. I need not explain to you, for you willrecognise that whereof I speak. I enlarge not here upon the hidden significancewhich is apparent to you.[557] It interested me to see that you discerned the seed thought which wasintended to arouse your resistance. It was, for you, the most important of themall. The idea is not negative, as you suppose. The personalities of the “wearypilgrims on the Way” are indeed tired and worn. Humanity today is very weary.The vehicles have been used for many cycles and their potency (in a positivesense) is wearing out, which is the approaching goal. For long cycles, the soulhas been negative in its effect upon the personality, and the personal equipmenthas been the positive expression of the spiritual man. Then that loweraggregation of forces begins to wear down; its vibration weakens and, becausemuch of the consciousness is still identified with the body nature, the discipleis conscious of fatigue, pain, distress and a deep weariness. It has been the“personality fatigue” of the human race which partially was responsible for theexcessive misery complex, the sense of inferiority, and the pining-for-releasepsychology of the Christian presentation of truth.As still further progress is made, the joy of the soul begins to pour throughthe worn and weary vehicles, and gradually the positive nature of the soul takeshold. When this is strong enough and the man is sufficiently decentralised, itis the soul quality which will persist in spite of physical limitations, and theinner sense of weariness will then be carefully negated and consciously andintelligently transmuted. There will be the recognition of personality distressbut also a planned effort to transcend it. This process of “divine imposition”gradually brings in the healing force and thus perfect health in some life isthe reward of the initiate’s effort to live as a soul and not to feel as apersonality. It is this divine pouring in of the soul’s quality of life which isthe true key to self-induced healing.Will you remember, what I have elsewhere pointed out, that:1. Happiness is the goal of personality desire and its most desired sentientreaction.2. Joy is the quality of soul life and that quality can be imposed upon thepersonality, thereby superseding happiness and imparting the gift of truth.[558]3. Bliss is the nature of the spiritual Being and is, in its turn and in duetime, imposed upon the rhythm of the soul. It is the gift of synthesis.You see clearly from the angle of mental observation, acutely and intelligentlyapplied. Now learn to feel as clearly that which you see, both the good and thatwhich is not so good, and love steadily in both directions. As yet, you love notwhere you criticise. This you must learn to do and that love will shed new lighton that which you perceive and you will learn to feel. Life will then open upbefore you in new rhythms of service and of usefulness.It is not my request that the three questions I put to you earlier in thisinstruction should be answered by you for any eye but yours and mine to see.Should you, however, care to answer them in such form that they may be ofservice to your group brothers, that is entirely your own affair.Another hint I give you and a suggestion which only you will understand. Thereare three people that you should take to your heart and love. As yet you lovethem not. One loves you not. Two seek your love. Learn to love all three, nottheoretically from a high, cold, mental altitude, but down on the planes ofearth; love them with your heart. Life will then change for you. And,furthermore, my brother, love them not in obedience to my hint or through adisplay of the magnanimous spirit, or as the result of intellectual reasoning,but because you love . Two out of these three have much to give to you, and canlead you with them along the Way. I mention not their names, nor have I toldanyone who they are. It is your own affair, not mine, nor theirs, but yours.I give you now three phrases upon which to meditate during the next six months.During the first three months will you meditate upon them within the headconsciousness, and during the last three months will you repeat the meditationbut this time within the heart and seek to feel their significance. Thus willrealisation come.Phrase I .Like a golden butterfly, which flies towards the sun, I find myself poised uponthe lotus petal of the earth. [559] Held by the breath of love I hover. I stay alittle moment and then I fly into the golden pathway which leads into the sun.Phrase II.There is no darkness and no fog. There is no night nor day. There are no stormsnor peace; no rest, nor strife. Only the changeless love of God, which workstowards good.Phrase III.Down from the mountain top I come, bringing the light of love , the love of God.Into the chalice of all forms I meet, I pour this love which light confers, thislove which life sustains. I see the love of life divine pour through the form,my own and others. It heals and soothes. Thus is the task performed. Thus is aman of earth transformed into a Son of God.In summarising the ray qualities with which you have to deal in fitting yourselffor progress in world service, they might be stated to be as follows:1. The soul ray—the Ray of Will or Power.2. The personality ray—the Ray of Concrete Science.3. The ray of the mental body—the Ray of Intelligent Activity.4. The ray of the astral body—the Ray of Devotion.5. The ray of the physical body—the Ray of Will or Power.For your reassurance and that of your co-disciples, I would like to point outthat the group work of healing can be started, if the group continues with itswork of integration and grows in love and understanding. Continue with the groupmeditation and with the work of the Full Moon Approach, paying close attentionto the latter. Learn the way into the Ashram of the second ray through the open(though secret) door of your own heart.NOTE: In the March 1936 instruction, the Tibetan told the disciple that heneeded to learn “in tenderness to walk with others.” This he failed to learn andtemporarily at least his work in the Ashram is in abeyance. [560]~TO S. R. D.August 1936MY BROTHER OF OLDEN TIME:One of the things which is strongest in your consciousness is the realisation ofour ancient link and tie. You have known for years that such a tie exists. Youhave oft wondered of what use it is to you. You have reached middle life andmore without having discovered to what purpose is this realisation or what youcan do to be of definite service, for, my brother, you must (for the remainderof your life) be of greater service than heretofore. If you are a disciple, youmust bear in mind that you are such because of a capacity to serve and notbecause of any karmic links. You and L.R.U. are karmically related to me and,therefore, karmically related to each other. Unless such a relation works out inservice to your fellowmen, it is of no use. It is service to be renderedselflessly and with sacrifice that is your lesson, as it is hers also.It is not for me to tell you how to serve or in what field it is to be rendered.I have watched you grope your way into increased usefulness during the pastthree years, and I know well your determination that naught shall stop you.Remember, my brother, that we are oft hindered by the unexpected, and not bythat which we anticipated.If you should feel in months to come, a lessening of contact with me, be notdeceived by the illusion. This recognition will in reality be based upon adeepening mental grasp of truth, and upon a lessening of attention to astralsensitivity. That, it is essential that you outgrow. You are over-sensitiveastrally, and you need increased polarisation upon the mental plane. This willlead to two things:1. A firmer grasp upon the lower self by the soul, so that your soul will meanmore to you.2. A deeper integration into your group of kindred souls, with a consequentgrasp of group contacts and less interest in the personality, plus less interestin your teacher, the Tibetan. I, your Tibetan brother, am interested in thegroup but not in the individual. This is the first lesson [561] which I seek toteach you. Work strenuously at contacting your fellow disciples. Think far lessof me and of your relation to me. Speak not of me to anyone at any time for ayear. But at the time of the full moon, seek to contact, establish andstrengthen your link in relation:a. To your group brothers.b. To L.R.U.c. Karmically with myself.Then for the remainder of the month, and until the next full moon, ponder on thegroup work and not on the Tibetan. I fancy, my brother, that you will promptlysee the wisdom of this.You are naturally a teacher, and a teacher in training; you can teach and shouldteach. Seize every opportunity so to teach and to gather together those who canthus be served. Choose quality and not quantity, and teach from the angle ofknowledge, carefully thought out in meditation. In this sentence, I give you theclue to your meditation work. . . .After your meditation, say the following obligation:“I play my part with stern resolve, with earnest aspiration; I look above; Ihelp below: I dream not, nor I rest; I toil; I serve; I reap; I pray; I mountthe cross; I tread the Way; I tread upon the work I do; I mount upon my slainself; I forego peace; I forfeit rest, and in the stress of pain, I lose myselfand find my Self, and enter into peace.”For your seed thoughts for the next few months, will you use the following?1st month—The mind reveals the Real.2nd month—The Light is dual. It shows forth that which is not seen. It sheds itsrays upon the daily way.3rd month—All that is, shows forth some seed idea.4th month—A thought of God, some real idea, must reveal itself within my heart.5th month—The world must be saved by ideas.You will note, my brother, what is my objective in this initial training towhich I ask you to subject yourself. Let me [562] make it clear to you. I seekto see you polarised more definitely upon the mental plane. I seek to see youless committed to the attitude of the devotee, and more impersonal, more free toserve for the sake of service and not to serve because of your devotion to ateacher, a cause or a belief. Is not this also in line with your deepest andhighest idea?~MY BROTHER AND MY FRIEND: March 1937The lessons of true humility and reticence are not as easy to learn as mightappear, particularly when the inferiority complex is as strong in you as is thecase. It is so easy to confound a natural self-depreciation with true spiritualhumility, but you are learning fast.One thing I seek to point out to you: humility must always accompany a spiritualself-respect which forbids a disciple to stand anywhere upon the Path, except inhis rightful place. The fact is that discipleship warrants recognition. There isno false pride in knowing that one is a disciple. This I point out to you and toall disciples. Recognition of status, however, is purely a personal matter; itshould be faced and accepted and then followed by silence . What is, therefore,the lesson I seek today to give to you and which I preface by the above words?Simply this: Recognising your link, and knowing that your ancient aspiration isbearing, and will bear, fruit. Take your eyes off yourself, take them off thepersonalities of your co-disciples, and take them away even from me, your friendand teacher of several lives, and forget everything but the need of those youdaily meet. Then serve . Shut the door upon each thought of self, and upon thosereactions which may be engendered by your group brothers; shut them also uponthose devotional aspirations which you direct so oft to me, and cast them fromyou. Then with a tender heart of love and pity, serve all you meet, knowing that“each heart hides its own bitterness.” This constitutes your major lesson on thePath at this time, my brother—the lesson of utter self-forgetfulness. Forget thepast and all that it brought to you of pain and of joy; forget the personal selfand all that it has to give or what it withholds; forget that which you said orhas been said anent [563] you and your ways, and seek simply to serve. Servewith a joyous heart and equilibrium.One of your great limitations is over-sensitivity. Your outer shell needshardening; you must learn to tune out and to leave unrecognised that which mightdisturb your life of service. The proverb runs: “They say. What do they say? Letthem say.” For you this holds much truth. Disciples waste so much time indistress over the words, thoughts and deeds of other disciples and thus time islost that could be more constructively employed. Do you not know that theminutes mount into hours, as the disciple wrestles with himself in order toregain equilibrium? Ask A.A.B. She knows the meaning of those lost hours and canhelp you there. Remember, also, brother of old, that all suffering along thelines of super-sensitivity indicates self-centredness, and this in turnmilitates against the needed inclusiveness which will eventually make this groupwork successful in service. I point this out, because you have had to wrestlealong these lines during the past six months; your major weakness is thissensitivity, which leads to an undue focussing upon the little self.I would ask you to continue your study along the lines indicated in my lastcommunication, and for the next six months to deal with the theme ofillumination through ideas. You are beginning to grasp a little the significanceof ideas. Now consider what these ideas can do for you, illumining your mind andenriching, therefore, your service. All that you learn must be related toservice. Therein lies your particular lesson. You have equipment; you haveadequate outlook; you have a mind which can be illumined; you can teach and youcan serve. With this you have not yet adequately begun. You must learn to serveas a soul, and not as a high grade personality. Herein I give you a hint, andyou care enough, I know, to take it. As to your meditation, carry forward asbefore. I make no change in any way.~MY BROTHER: September 1937Only a brief word this time, but it will suffice.Release the hidden beauty which lies in real self-forgetfulness, [564] and letyour devotion (tried and proved) and your sincerity stabilise your group. Be notpre-occupied with the non-essentials of personal living. Be generous of yourselfand time, and give to your group brothers with a clear impersonality which asksnothing for the separated self. This is not yet the case.~BROTHER OF OLD: January 1938During the next few months of quiet study and preparation, I would ask you totake the ideas, cited below, into your meditation and to reflect deeply uponthem, making them in this way distinctive characteristics of your life. I have adefinite purpose in mind as I give them to you.1st month—The present embodies all the past. The future depends upon the clearseeing of the immediate vision.2nd month—Forget the past and press anew into the glory of the Coming One.3rd month—Let silence reign as the result of a heart free from self-questioning,and not the result of the shutting of a door.4th month—Let humility and strength be your gift to others.5th month—Certain treasures are too valuable and frail to be exposed to others’sight. Keep them within the locked seclusion of thy heart.6th month—Give of thine uttermost on every plane, and give again. And thus, ingiving, gain.~MY BROTHER: June 1938There is little that anyone can do when tests and deep distress and anxietyoverwhelm a disciple except to stand by in love, send healing thoughts and evokethe inner strength of the soul that the vehicles can be used. You have beforeyou some weeks and months of selfless service. Give of the service with nothought of self and in a spirit of joy; give of your [565] strength and lovewith no self-reference in your heart or words and no thought in your mind of thelittle self. I give you no set study work at this time, but I will give you somenew seed thoughts and would ask you to ponder upon them in deep reflection. Theneach month will you embody the results of these reflections in a paper which canbe very brief but which will be your elucidation of the intended idea? Did younotice, my brother, the value and the significance of the seed thought I gaveyou for the sixth month? It gave you the key for your immediate service.First month . . . Let the song of the soul be sounded forth by me, and the clearhigh notes bring peace and joy to others. My word today is Joy .Second month . . . Let the quality of the soul be seen in me, the quality oflove. It is a love which visions not the little forms of self, but the One Selfin all. My quality today is self Forgetfulness.Third month . . . Let the word of my soul go forth in strength to others. Thatword for me, in this short period of my life, is Understanding .Fourth month . . . Let the vision of my mind be clear and sure; its outline trueand real. That vision is one of mankind’s need, of suffering and of pain, for itis there in all the world. The key for me today is Service .Fifth month . . . Let the glory of the Lord Who is my life, be seen. That gloryis the glory of the One. Distinction and all differences fade away. The wordthat is for me the meaning of that life is Identification .Sixth month . . . Let the actions of the soul be the motives of my daily life. Iam that soul and unto that I dedicate myself. That soul is one in all myfellowmen and I am one with them. The keynote of the action of the soul isSacrifice.[566] A real understanding of the purpose of these thoughts will cause basictransformations in your life and attitudes, leading to a new ability to serve.In connection with your rays, my brother, it is of interest to you to know, as Ihave earlier told you, that your soul ray is the second and your personality rayis the sixth, both these rays being along the one line of 2.4.6. It is necessarythat there should be some conscious and definite rounding out. This over-balanceis accentuated also by the fact that your mental body is upon the fourth ray,thus completing the direct representation of this line of divine energy. As youwill naturally see, this complicates your problem considerably, because the lineof least resistance, when it is as powerful as it is in your case, becomes adefinite hindrance.Like a few others in my group, your astral body is not found upon the usualrays. These are normally either the sixth or the second, but you have a firstray astral body and the focus of your personality power is found in youremotional nature. This is a residue of a sixth ray personality in your lastincarnation, which was one of great potency and wilfully actuated by what Imight call the will aspect of devotion. I know that you will comprehend that towhich I refer.Your physical body helps in the balancing of your predominantly second raynature, for it is upon the third ray and, as you know, the first and third raysare along the same major line of force. The astral and physical bodies being soclosely allied, accounts for the dominance of your devotional will in yourphysical expression. Ponder upon the above and later, we will deal with yourproblem more definitely. Your rays, therefore, are:1. The soul ray—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.2. The personality ray—the sixth Ray of Devotion.3. The ray of the mental body—the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict.4. The ray of the astral body—the first Ray of Will or Power.5. The ray of the physical body—the third Ray of Active Intelligence.~[567] BROTHER OF MINE: January 1939One of the things which you have done in this group of disciples is to act as astable, loving, integrating force. This you have steadily done during the pastmonths and your group brothers should be aware of it. Continue with thisintegrating work.Once in the recent history of the group who compose part of my Ashram I gave acertain injunction to a brother. I told him to go forward with his group work inforgetfulness of me. I forbade him to take me into his mind or to ponder upon meas his friend, his teacher and his brother on the Way. His pondering upon me andthe offering of his devotion as a result in no way affected the facts. I was hisbrother, his teacher and his friend. It was a hard saying, and he suffered muchin the effort to meet my requirements. Why did I give to him this suggestion,amounting almost to a command? Because his loving estimation of me and hisbelief that I was in constant touch with him was becoming a detriment toindependent spiritual life, his own life as a soul; his devotion to service wasbased on his devotion to me and he spent much time studying my words, and notenough time in serving humanity; or, if he served, he did so because I expectedit and it pleased him to please me. This situation could not go on withoutserious danger to his progress on the Path.He forgot three things: First, that his soul and my soul were one soul and that(on the soul plane) we were equals. The difference between us was one ofcapacity for soul expression in the three worlds. Ponder on this thought.Secondly, that I am much occupied with world work and, with the exception of thetime of the Full Moon Approaches I cannot and do not occupy myself with any ofyou, as individuals . I am not seeking to get in touch with you, except once amonth and then only with the group as a whole. I am not engaged ever in speakingwords of wisdom and of cheer to any of you, except in one or two cases of direneed and difficulty, such as have not arisen in connection with any of youlately. Thirdly, that there is a potent thoughtform of me upon the astral plane,built by the thousands who have read my many words, and whose thoughts [568] atsuch times are turned towards me in gratitude or criticism, in devotion ordislike. Thoughts, brother of mine, are things; they are creative, creating andcreated entities, and every time anyone sees this thoughtform of me and respondsto it, he increases its strength and power. From its magnetic aura, my disciplesand followers must free themselves, for it is but man’s thought of me, and not Imyself. It can side-track and delude you; it can speak good words of mediocrecheer and encouragement, but they are not my words, and this I would have youbear in mind. Your sixth ray personality and your first ray astral body make youprone to this beautiful yet deceptive force, flowing from an illusory form.So, my brother and my friend, I would ask you to concentrate on three thingsduring the next few months and to leave me out of the picture altogether, exceptat the time of the Full Moon Approach, which is a group activity lasting fivedays, as you know. These three things are:1. An effort to achieve a deepened and a more direct contact with your soulthrough a focussed alignment and the understanding and effective use of yourfourth ray mental body.2. The development of a greater spirit of service and upon a wider scale. Yourservice at present is vertical and concerns those who are with you upon theupward way—your group brothers, your personal friends, and yourself. For youserve yourself unduly, my brother, and at your stage of unfoldment this shouldnot be. You render to yourself too much service, too much thought, too much careand too many things. Your service should become horizontal and expandinglyinclusive, for the hour of the world’s emergency is upon us and who can meetthat need but those who know! And you, my brother, know!3. The attainment of a mental polarisation is also essential. This (on accountof your having a third ray physical body) will be greatly facilitated by theinstitution of certain physical disciplines. See to it, however, that they arereal disciplines and hurt you in their application and are not simply theelimination of those things which it hurts you not to give up.I would have you do the group meditation but, prior to doing it, will you pondervery deeply upon the following [569] thoughts (six in number) which I havechosen for you—which my brother, I repeat, I have chosen for you. If you will dothis, when the work starts in the autumn you will bring to that field of servicea better equipped instrument, particularly if you apply the results of yourmeditation in a practical way, seeking to get the point of view of the soul asto your daily life.First month The purification of astral desire. Second month The purification ofthe physical body. Third month The means whereby the brain can be renderedsensitive to the higher impression. Fourth month The elimination of those habitswhich tend to cloud the mind and render the man insensitive to the highercontact. Fifth month The nature of purification, from the angle of vision of thedisciple. Sixth month The formulation of those disciplines which will aid inpurification.If you will do this faithfully, in six months it will be apparent to you why Ihave stressed this aspect of training in your life and work.~MY BROTHER: July 1939You have been through deep waters during the past year, and the lesson ofdecentralisation is hard to learn—particularly for you, after years ofself-centred life. In order to aid you in this task and to teach you that youare not the focal point of your small world, you have had to learn to walkalone. To you, it seems hard but can you not grasp the thought that the lovingcare and constant consideration of those connected with you, or with any person,can emphasise unwittingly your selfishness and make it hard to free yourselffrom the enveloping net of sensuous life—the life which lays its emphasis uponmaterial possessions? You stand alone now and like it not. Yes, for the firsttime in this incarnation your soul has made what I have called “the effort tocall you to the horizontal life.” It is now a possibility to you, whereashitherto you have had the vertical [570] life of spiritual aspiration and theself-centred life of personal comfort. The way of considered unselfishness liesopen to you—a way you never yet have gone. By that I mean, my brother, that youhave never served with a completely sacrificial spirit. You have done kindthings and made small sacrifices but you have never yet served as asoul—possessing nothing and asking nothing for the separated self. This is yourlesson in the coming year—the lesson of a life given to service, todistribution, to out-going, to self-forgetting, to the life of full surrender,of discipline and of relinquishment.I could not put this to you so baldly, crudely and so definitely, did I not knowyour deep inner love, your true consecration and your developed devotion. Icould not count upon your acceptance of your soul’s demand, did I not realisethat the way of the soul and the fulfilment of your soul’s obligation and theshouldering of the responsibility of our service is for you subjectivelyparamount, even if it has to be made objectively apparent. It is of vital momentto you. It constitutes your highest aspiration. But I count upon yourunderstanding and upon your acceptance and endeavour to meet the need and toserve, not only on the subtler planes and levels of awareness, but on the outerplane of tangible, material, physical living.I would ask you to give five minutes each day, prior to the group meditation, tomeditation upon one of the following terms or phrases:Relinquishment Silence Discipline Horizontal living Self-effacement Freedom fromself-pityThese six phrases should form the theme of your personal meditation.You have much to give, my brother and my friend. You have a deep and vitalknowledge of spiritual and esoteric truth and can, therefore, serve upon themental plane. You have a growing love and understanding and a devotion that hascarried you through to the very portal of life itself. You can, therefore,serve. You have served with efficiency upon the [571] astral plane. You havealso much to give upon the physical plane when you have mastered the science ofdetachment, and the discipline of relinquishment. This I have told you before,but your perspective remains as yet distorted. But you are on your way toachievement and spiritual success, and for that you should raise your heart withthankfulness.NOTE: The perspective of this disciple apparently still remains distorted. Sheis not actively working in the Ashram. She still is an aspirant and fails totake that decisive step which transforms an aspirant into a disciple.~TO H. S. D.March 1934Have you ever thought, my brother, how enthusiasm, being of an astral nature,can blur the vision? This is the first question which I seek to put before youas you join my group of disciples. The second question is: Are you willing tosubmit to as intensive a psychologising in your own case as that to which youseek to subject others? Your answer to both these questions will be, I know, inthe affirmative, for of your intense sincerity and your one-pointed devotionthere is never any question. I have sought to find an approach to you that willin no way be open to misinterpretation by your over-active, lower mind. I haveasked myself the question: Can this brother be so trained that the field ofsubjective realisation can take the place of exterior and objective analysis? Inthese words I give you a clue to your whole endeavour for your first year ofwork with me.You have much to give this group of disciples but it is not that which you thinkyou have to give. The thing of beauty and of wonder which is your realcontribution lies as yet deeply hidden; only a close attention to my impartedinstructions, a humble willingness to readjust your own preconceived ideas willlead you into that lighted realm where the path of true service for you willappear.[572] All groups of disciples, seeking to work together under the guidance of aMaster, have their own peculiar problems. The formative first years hold in themthose testing difficulties which will try the mettle of the group, and put theendurance and the faith of the group members to a more than adequate trial. Manyamong your co-disciples present peculiar difficulties to me—a teacher on thesecond ray—because of the powerful development of the critical faculty in someof the members. (NOTE: During this world crisis the Tibetan has been caring forthe disciples in the groups of several other Masters so as to release theseMasters for different and more important work. A.A.B.) From this criticalattitude, one or two are singularly free; the rest of you are too prone to viewthings externally, from the angle of the outer detail and from the standpoint ofthe non-essential. This acts as a real deterrent to progress. I, therefore, begyou to reserve opinion as to my techniques and objectives until you know moreabout them! I ask you to subject that which I have to give you to due trial, andnot to analysis, for at least one year.First, brother of mine, let me readjust your ideas as to yourself. You are asixth ray soul, functioning through a first ray personality. In telling youthis, I indicate to you your group contribution and likewise your individualproblem. Your personality polarisation is predominantly mental. For you,one-pointedness both in soul matters and personality relationships is the lineof least resistance; you have a one-pointed approach to problems, conditions,and situations which in many cases constitutes a one-pointed attack. I say thisnot from a spirit of criticism, for it is the right use of this faculty and itsre-orientation which will land you before the Portal of Initiation. This I holdbefore you with deliberation and not as an inducement to progress or even as anencouragement but as a prophecy of a probability. You are on the Path ofDiscipleship. Opportunity stands before you and the Way can be trodden by youwith assurance. Have no fears, my brother. Take your eyes off your personalitywith its dominating first ray will and your tendency to mental dominance (as youyourself have termed it) and focus your attention upon your soul problem whichis to transfer your consciousness off the sixth [573] ray on to the second raybefore any major initiation can take place.My problem is, therefore, to aid you to do this—as easily and as intelligentlyas possible. The secret of success lies for you, in an effort to shift yourfocus of attention out of the head and into the heart. This, incidentally, mayaid the head condition of which you complain. Your monadic ray is the second rayand hence your soul, being on a minor ray, must transfer to that line. As youknow, the sequence of activity is ever the transfer of the fourth and sixth rayson to the second and the third, of the fifth and the seventh rays on to thefirst ray.We will, therefore, begin with a meditation which should aid you in this shiftof focus. Before giving it to you, may I ask you to eliminate out of yourconsciousness all elements of hurry and thus begin to deal with that excessivetension which wears out your physical body and makes your impact upon yourco-disciples (whenever you contact them) so unduly forceful. There is no hurry.There is no need to emphasise speed in your life. Relaxation is for you a neededattribute, but it has to be achieved through an attitude of mind rather thanthrough relaxation exercises; these are apt to focus the attention upon thephysical body and produce—owing to your mental polarisation—an increased inflowof energy. Energy follows thought. There is much time for growth both here andin other states of being.... Carry forward your meditation in the heart and notin the head, watching carefully for any physiological effects of an undesirablenature; report them should any occur.After the breathing exercise which I have given you, please do the followingmeditation work:1. Sound the Sacred Word, the O.M., audibly, breathing it forth from the head tothe heart.2. Then visualize a golden sun, slowly rising above the horizon. See yourselfstanding before it and slowly being absorbed into its beams. Then imagineyourself acting as a lens or transmission point through which the “light of thatradiant Sun which is the light of Love” may pour forth upon all whom youcontact. [574]3. Meditate upon the following words:1st and 2nd months—The light of love.3rd and 4th months—The power of loving understanding.4. Insert at this point any intercessory work or service idealism which you maycare to do.5. Close with a dedication of yourself and of all that you are and have, to thework of service and primarily to the service of the New Group of World Servers.You will ask what your service is to be. That, my brother, will grow out of yourmeditation. It is not for me to tell you what activity your personality mustfollow; it is your own soul which must so do. Some of it you already know, andto that I may refer. As far as in you lies, stand firmly in your endeavour toaid the New Group of World Servers. That should be the prime effort for manyyears to come of all true aspirants in all esoteric schools. Their help isneeded by us.I give you no exercises to follow other than the outlined breathing exercise norshall I deal specifically with your physical condition. The transfer of yourfocus out of the head into the heart is the best way to aid your general healthand relieve the condition in the head which is causing you concern. Rememberagain that energy follows thought; this can have a bad effect, producing unduetension, or a good effect, producing a release of energy in various directionswhere it can best be of service. Remember also, that with you I must go slowly,both because of your inner psychological hurry and your outer tension. Studywell the keynotes of your life; this will aid your soul growth, and lead toperseverance unto the end.~MY BROTHER: July 1935A very definite process of re-organisation has gone forward in your life, underthe direction of your soul. This has brought about three events in your life:1. A shift in your attention from certain focal points (well known to you) toothers of wider import. [575]2. A re-orientation of your entire life to the soul and to work in my group ofdisciples.3. A re-arrangement of the energies of the subtle bodies, producing a temporarydiscomfort but of real and lasting value.This process has been far from easy and I have sought three times during thepast four months definitely to help you. I wonder if you were aware of myvibration and my thought when these points of contact were brought about by me?Seek to develop sensitivity to my vibration during the next few months,particularly at the time of the Full Moon. There were two paragraphs in the lastinstruction I gave you which I again call to your attention. They summarise youropportunity and your problem. Please study them and ponder deeply on theirimplications. When the task is clearly outlined and the problem squarely faced,it is easier then to work intelligently and constructively.Your work for quite a time is to continue with the re-focussing, re-alignmentand inner re-organisation. Forget not my earlier injunction to go slowly.~BROTHER OF OLD: January 1936The pressure of the times is very great and yet, at the same time, great needfor care prevails. I want first of all to point out to you where your major risklies and I use the word “risk” with intention. You realise it for yourself, Iknow, but re-emphasis on my part will not prove unavailing.Your physical body is very frail and, therefore, you have to handle force andspiritual energy with especial care; where there is a weak and delicate outershell, the inner subtler bodies can become too dominant; as force flows in,these subtler bodies become more vital. Much force flows through you at thistime. Do not infer from this remark that you contact and attract more force thando your co-disciples, for such is not the case. But your physical equipment isof such a nature that it constitutes a real problem.The consequent influence and potency of the inner bodies—particularly the mentalbody with its critical faculties—is over-strong [576] in expression upon thephysical plane. This, I realise quite well, you yourself know.One of the problems that faces every Master (teaching a group of disciples suchas this) is how to lead them on to the next step when much that He can say tothem is simply an emphasising of what they—as most intelligent aspirants—alreadyknow. There is little that I can tell you personally at this time. You have somuch knowledge and you do realise that your major problem is the right handlingof force.Perhaps I shall help you the most if I beg you not to handle force sopowerfully. Learn to approach yourself and your life problems, your work as adisciple, your relationship with my group of disciples and with all that comeyour way, with less intensity . You consciously handle yourself so powerfullyand with such violence that you are constantly shattering yourself andconstantly tearing down the contacts you make, the work you do and the bridgeswhich you establish between yourself and others. This again you know.Will you understand me, my brother, and believe me when I tell you that, foryou, the achievement of an inner stillness is the way out of all your problems?Your intensely active mind which moves from personalities to the Plan, from theNew Group of World Servers to the details of everyday life and which is neverquiet for one moment from its thoughtform-making activities, must learn to restquietly in the light. It must learn simply to reflect , both in the sense ofquiet thought and in the sense of a quiet radiance. Then your thoughts willharmonise and blend; then your plans will be constructive and free from self;then you will become a centre of peace and a point of radiant energy which willbring people together and act as a coherent force.Let, therefore, your effort for the next few months be the attainment of thisinner quiet. This will in no way affect or change the goal of your work; it willnot negate in any way the methods in which you seek to help my work. It will,however, affect the quality and the rhythm of what you seek to do and save youmuch time which is at present spent in constant rebuilding.Guard yourself at the time of the full moon each month and particularly at thetime of the May Full Moon from over-stimulation, [577] yet evade not contactwith that spiritual energy. Preserve yourself from over-intensity and thus gaina truer sense of proportion. The Hierarchy waits with patience the fruition ofits efforts, after doing all that can be done on all planes. This constantattention and watchful waiting must be emulated by all disciples. Dwellconstantly in the House of Quiet, my brother, yet lessen not your service. It isall a question of inner orientation and of attitude; it is not a question ofouter exoteric activity. That may remain the same or even quicken and becomemore potent, but the quality and the actuating living principle may be higher,more loving, closer to the centre and, therefore, more still .The only exercise that I give you at this time is as follows:1. A simple breathing exercise. . . .2. Then, sit in perfect inner silence and quiet for fifteen minutes, notnegatively drifting into a semi-tranced condition, but actively becoming awareof that inner centre of stillness and of peace where joy and bliss have theirhome.3. When you feel that all your bodies are quieted and that you have “come hometo the place of silent, holy rest,” then dedicate yourself to the service of thePlan, placing yourself at the disposal of those who serve that Plan.4. Then say: “Asking nothing for the separated self, I pour forth love.” Hold inmind:a. Your immediate family circle.b. Your fellow disciples and group brothers.c. The New Group of World Servers.d. Humanity.5. Close with the Benediction.My blessing rests upon you, my brother, and may the peace which passesunderstanding reward all your efforts.~MY BROTHER: June 1936Focus the will upon the immediate duty and be not lost in the mazes ofpossibility. Of your own free will, you undertook to work in my group ofdisciples and to cooperate with the [578] workers who are endeavouring to carryforward the tasks assigned to them. You pledged yourself in two moments ofdevotion and of real understanding to cooperate with the task of the New Groupof World Servers. Let not the beauty of that which might be done, lead you toforget that which has been begun; otherwise you may land yourself in the worldof illusion and consequent futility. You have much to give, so give of yourrichness of understanding. When group work is successful, it is because theequipment of the group is enhanced by that which each individual has to give.The energy of the unit is absorbed by the entire group and the group output inservice is thereby increased. The group is then enabled to shift to a higherplane of service and of consciousness. Ponder on this.~MY BROTHER AND CHOSEN FRIEND: January 1937I have watched you with care and understanding during the past year. I know whatyou have undergone and the measure of your difficulties and problems. These youfaced, as usual, with courage. The past lies behind you and though I looked atyou with anxiety till a few weeks ago, I no longer do so. You can and willbecome an integrating force in this group.A great process of transmutation of the lower energies has been going on in you,carried forward, as always, via the solar plexus centre—that great clearinghouse of the personality. This has been for you a culminating crisis in yourlife, esoterically speaking, though its effects may produce exoteric happenings.These latter are (are they not?) of small moment compared to the innerhappenings.There were moments when the situation was critical. At three such moments,during the past year, I definitely intervened and interposed my help, thoughyou, of course, knew it not. Can I, at this point, convey to you a lesson whichall accepted disciples have to learn? Such intervention by a watching Teacher orMaster is something which should seldom happen and something which all consciousdisciples seek to avoid; something which they never expect and which they neverdemand. [579] Conscious discipleship is only now opening before you as a resultof this experience and during the unconscious stage we do occasionally help.This I did.I would ask you to regard the process of such a definite re-orientation andtransmutation as now closed—probably for this entire life. You have come throughto a measure of release and are freed for service in a sense that was before notpossible. Now I ask you to take several months of complete quiet, giving thesolar plexus time to relax, and your brain and mind time to adjust themselves tothe newer rhythms. Make no plans but follow the lines of service as they open upand as needs come to your attention. I need not ask you to stand by my work andby the things which I am attempting to do in the world, for this I know you willdo. Your soul demands it of your personality and will find you ever ready.Below are six seed thoughts which I have chosen for your consideration. Will yougive them fifteen minutes of quiet thought each day?1st month—I am a bird of song. Those in the high air can hear my song. My fellowpilgrims feel my joy.2nd month—I am the lotus of the heart. The perfume of the heart must fill theair around me and rest my fellowmen.3rd month—I am a pool of quiet. Naught must destroy that peace, for all aroundme need that peace and quiet that the restful waters give.4th month—I am a steadfast hill whereon the breeze of God blows free. The wearypilgrims on the Way find cool strength and tonic life upon that hill.5th month—I am a voice that calls and carries cheer because I see the vision.6th month—All that I am and all I have belongs to others, not myself.The work that you are now planning and about which you have spoken to me willsuffice for your work for the next few months.~[580] BROTHER OF MINE: July 1937Let us have a talk today upon the difficulties of the Way and thus seek todiscover what are the hindrances and the problems which you have to face. Agreat deal of the difficulty, incident upon the intense fluidity of your mind,is based on the fact that you are transferring off the sixth ray on to thesecond; thus, in this egoic shift, there is a transference of energy. You arepassing through an interim period. One or two of my other disciples are alsooccupied with the same task but they have nearly completed that task. The effectupon some of them is largely physical and also upon the heart centre. With you,the effect has been felt in the mental body and in the throat centre. Thephysical condition which troubles you has not originated in connection with thisshift.One interesting fact emerges and I would like to call your attention to it. Youraffiliation with this group of disciples and, therefore, with myself has beendue to the urge of your soul for contact with a powerful second ray vibration,so as to enable you to make the needed change with greater rapidity and ease. Itis of a major usefulness to you to bring about this necessary stabilisationwithin a second ray centre. Will you ponder upon the implications of thisstatement and will you endeavour to realise the need and call of your soul forsuch a stabilisation and the urgent demand of your personality for the quietwhich streams forth from a second ray group. For you, there is no realachievement in this life unless you learn this mental quiet and that peacefulactivity which comes from loving truly as a soul, from a complete refrainingfrom all tortuous questions, from stabilising yourself for future work,communion and expression within your own group centre and from an eradication ofall criticism such as your over-active mind presents with constancy.This mental unrest (if I may call it so, my brother, without unduly hurting you)is frequently intensified by the fact that your mental body , like yourpersonality, is upon the first ray. The implications, attendant upon this fact,will be immediately apparent to you. Let us look at your problem as it is:First, there must be recognised a crisis in the soul life when the energy isshifting out of a minor ray focus into that of a major ray [581] centre. Yourpersonality being on the first ray, is normally and dynamically one-pointed andautomatically self-centred; this condition is not eased by the fact that theintegrated personality force flows through a first ray mental body. Thisinevitably produces the accompanying characteristics of an intensecentralisation (I did not say a selfish one, my brother) and an activeassurance, a full fledged ambition (often of an entirely right nature, butoccasionally not so right) and a power to analyse and oft to criticise others,their personalities and their tasks. The new vibration to which your soul isleading you (that of expansion and inclusiveness, plus the power to synthesiseand to understand) is, in some of its phases, over-powerful for you and itsreactions are as yet unorganised by you. It leads you to a definite (and oftenalmost uncontrollable) tendency to identify yourself with every imaginable pointof view, to see all around a question though seldom to the heart of it, and totouch momentarily this, that and the other attitude of thought and emotion.These reactions do not stay long enough to enable you to understand truly. Youcontact people on the periphery of their consciousness, but not often at theirheart or their life.Will you accept this diagnosis, my brother and my friend? You know my keendesire to see you stabilised for the remainder of this life, thus losing no timeand definitely achieving constructive results within your group and within thecentre to which your soul has directed you. These constructive results willreach fruition if you focus your forces within a second ray vibratory centre,for this will aid the shift of energies with which your soul is at presentengaged. This second ray vibratory centre may be my group of disciples, withwhich you are at present related; it may be any other group, organisation orschool of thought; it may be objective to you now or simply subjective andunrealised. If your soul is to make the needed shift in this life, it isessential that you focus yourself and remain relatively static within yourchosen centre for a long time. Otherwise your soul will be forced to postponethe needed shift until the next life. It is interesting, is it not, to see thereason for the happenings within the periphery of one’s consciousness, torealise the clear light which is sometimes thrown in this way upon mistakes andknow what it is that one has to do.[582] Your mind is ever a questioning mind. It is my duty always to throw youback upon your own questions and see to it that you reply to them yourself. Iwould ask you to realise the wide scope which your fertile, over-active mindbrings to every question, and the wide range of incidental and related questionswhich it asks. I would not bring this matter to your notice if I did not realisethat such an inclusive mind, developed to the point which yours has reached, isa valuable asset, making you both sensitive and inclusive—in the highest senseof those words. Such a mind is a basic requirement for all disciples and for allcandidates for the Path of Discipleship. But such a mind needs most definitelycontrolling, wisely correlating with a stable centre and confining withinlimits.My brother, let simplicity be your guide and one-pointed love your majorobjective. Choose a field of service which has its defined limits—for alldisciples are limited and cannot cover a planetary range in their thoughts. Thenwork—mentally and physically—within these limits. The completion of someself-appointed task within the field of karmic limitations and of environmentwhere your destiny has cast you is all that is required of you. What are youaccomplishing at this time? There is just a certain span of years ahead of youat the age which you have now reached, and you have a frail body. Let yourservice lie within the field of contact where you find yourself and reach notout over the entire planet. Is there any greater or more important matter thanto fulfil your task and carry it to completion before you pass over to the otherside and to do it in the place where you are and with your chosen comrades?Believe me when I assure you that I am not seeking to evade any questions whichyou may ask but, if I can awaken you to the realisation of the necessity for“spiritual limitation” (as it is esoterically called when defining the career ofa disciple within the limits of his task), and bring to your attention the needfor achieving the goal you set yourself when you started to work with me, Ishall have aided you much. I feel sure that you will grasp the wisdom of theseremarks.Your astral body is upon the sixth ray and here again lies for you a problem.Upon it I need not enlarge, beyond reminding you that a sixth ray astral body(where a disciple is concerned) predicates intense adherence to a line ofthought, [583] to an idea, a group, a person or an attitude or to a preconceivednotion. These may be right or wrong but the tendency to adherence is powerfullypresent and can be a great asset or a major hindrance. In any case—again for adisciple—any idée fixe (beyond that of a right spiritual orientation) can be adeterrent to progress, if fanatically motivated.Your physical body is upon the seventh ray and this makes for integration andfor efficiency. Your rays can, therefore, be stated to be:1. The soul ray—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.2. The personality ray—the first Ray of Power.3. The ray of the mind—the first Ray of Power.4. The ray of the astral body—the sixth Ray of Devotion.5. The ray of the physical body—the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Order.You know so much that you will easily see how this forms a very rich combinationof energies and aggregation of forces, presenting a definite opportunity andalso certain very definite problems.For you the group meditation is essential; it will serve to aid your soul in itslife task and to integrate you into the second ray sphere of influence, whichwill be of real use. My brother, we travel not alone. For you, again, grouplove, group understanding, group happiness and group work are essential toprogress, real happiness and good physical health. In group work and contactcomes relief from inner tension, through the sharing of force. You have a frailbody and carry much force. Disperse it among your brothers.I would beg you to apply yourself to the five days of the Full Moon Contact,making the weeks between each full moon simply preparatory to the work to bedone on those five days. Will you also take the Rules of the Road (which youwill find attached to this instruction) and study them. They have helped manypeople.THE RULES OF THE ROAD1. The Road is trodden in the full light of day, thrown upon the Path by ThoseWho know and lead. Naught [584] can then be hidden, and at each turn upon thatRoad a man must face himself.2. Upon the Road the hidden stands revealed. Each sees and knows the villainy ofeach. And yet there is, with that great revelation, no turning back, no spurningof each other, no shakiness upon the Road. The Road goes forward into day.3. Upon that Road one wanders not alone. There is no rush, no hurry. And yetthere is no time to lose. Each pilgrim, knowing this, presses his footstepsforward, and finds himself surrounded by his fellowmen. Some move ahead; hefollows after. Some move behind; he sets the pace. He travels not alone.4. Three things the Pilgrim must avoid. The wearing of a hood, a veil whichhides his face from others; the carrying of a water pot which only holds enoughfor his own wants; the shouldering of a staff without a crook to hold.5. Each Pilgrim on the Road must carry with him what he needs: a pot of fire, towarm his fellowmen; a lamp, to cast its rays upon his heart and show hisfellowmen the nature of his hidden life; a purse of gold, which he scatters notupon the Road, but shares with others; a sealed vase, wherein he carries all hisaspiration to cast before the feet of Him Who waits to greet him at the gate—asealed vase.6. The Pilgrim, as he walks upon the Road, must have the open ear, the givinghand, the silent tongue, the chastened heart, the golden voice, the rapid foot,and the open eye which sees the light. He knows he travels not alone.~MY BROTHER: January 1938If you can hold steadily to the point which you have reached during the past fewmonths, if you can begin to utilise the second ray soul force which you have atlast succeeded in contacting and if you can stabilise the work accomplishedwithin yourself, you will find yourself entering upon a period of fruitfulservice.[585] I would call to your attention some words out of an instruction I earliergave you wherein I pointed out the necessity for you to seek stabilisationwithin a second ray centre. How does this stabilisation come? Through steadyidentification with the desired vibration. One of the main uses of group work isthe effect of group vibration upon the individual’s vibration. It tones it downwhen necessary, stimulates it and facilitates its emergence in cases such asyours. Where the soul ray is on a particular line, it is peculiarly valuable forthe personality to subject itself to group vibration and contact wherein thepressure exerted and the vibration contacted will be the same as the hidden oremerging soul ray.That is an aspect of group activity which is little apprehended. You need mostdefinitely the vibration of a second ray group at this time. It matters not whatgroup you choose but it does matter that in some second ray group you aidyourself by forcing the emergence of your second ray characteristics. This isnot suggested because you, as an individual, are of such importance or thatsecond ray groups exist in order to help people like you. They do not . But thework of the Builders is being called for on every side today and second rayaspirants are needed to direct this work and to strengthen the hands of theBuilders. Ponder on this.What is it that, up to date, has prevented your sincere desire to serve fromcoming to fruition? My brother, you have as yet done no service that will carryover into the future because it has been done at the sacrifice of yourself, thathas involved the sacrifice of your time, your personal interests, and yourpersonal desires, based upon your personal qualities. You have looked on at theservice of others and wondered why and how they chose to serve in the variousways they did; you have suggested service to others and have at times made itpossible for them to serve; you have talked to groups on service and yet with noresults, adequate to the force expended. Why has this been so? Because all thetime you were not giving of yourself in love, but only of that which wasexterior to yourself. And why, my brother (to continue with the questions) hasthis been so? Wherein lies your difficulty—a difficulty you can now face becauseyou have established a soul rapport and the light and love of the soul arepouring in on you.[586] The difficulty lies in the fact that you have a first ray personality anda first ray mental body and the two are so closely associated that you are thevictim (or have been, shall we say, for all this can now be altered) of thiscombination of two first ray responsive aspects. It might be of interest if youstudied with me for a moment how these first ray vehicles affect yourdemonstration in the world. Let us study them together . Your first ray mind hastended to bring about in you the following conditions:1. A sense (sometimes unrealised) of separativeness. Where you have beennon-separative, it has been because you have forced yourself to cooperate, andyet you were, all the time, conscious of it. Cooperation and human contacts areeasy for you in theory, but difficult in fact, and would have been hithertoimpossible had it not been for your sixth ray emotional body and the steady beatof your loving soul—now emerging into control.2. A tendency to criticise. Need I enlarge upon this? I think not, for I realisethat it is dawning upon your consciousness that you have wasted quite a numberof years in criticising your co-disciples and your earnest fellow-workers, andthis you are now pledged to end. Twice in the last few months, I have noted yourearnest efforts at the elimination of criticism.3. A great facility for over-activity. You have a mind body which is in aconstant state of fever, with (symbolically speaking, of course) periods ofviolent activity, amounting almost to delirium. As I have earlier pointed out toyou, you are so over-active and your mind ranges so widely here, there andeverywhere, that you fail in understanding and in true perception. There hasbeen no time for you to comprehend anything before you are off again in a widelydifferent direction.This must end, my brother. Out of the many possible lines of activity which lieopen before you, will you choose two and adhere to them even when the noveltypalls and you hanker to traverse new fields? Forget not that the Hierarchystands . So stand also and give your time to two fields of service in which youchoose to cooperate. Let one of them be a second ray group [587] with which youchoose to cast your lot and let the other be in the outer world where somehumanitarian effort claims your attention. Give, if you can, sixty per cent ofyour time to the group effort, for that is where you belong; waste not time indeciding which group it shall be. I refer here—when mentioning thesepercentages—to the time, strength and interest which you make available. I refernot to the time that is taken up by your home interests, obligations and duties.Give, then, the remaining forty per cent of your time to the outer activity inthe world.Your first ray personality does two things to you: It isolates you in your ownmind from your associates and you need to learn the necessity for identificationwith those who are your co-workers. That means not only identification with thegroup objective or identification with the major principles of the group but itmeans also identification with the successes, the failures, the difficulties andthe problems. This is not, therefore, the cooperation of the outsider who comesin to help, but the cooperation of one who is so closely associated with theproblems and with those who are handling them that there is no sense of beingapart, no critical reaction and no superior observation.Your first ray personality, plus your first ray mind, evokes in you a love ofpower and a desire for that pleasurable sensation which comes from speech whichevokes acquiescence. This serves to place you “in the seat of the superiorperson,” as the Chinese call it. You will usually find, my brother, that it iseasy to gather around you many little people, of relatively futileaccomplishment (from the angle of world service) but that the finer minds haveno time for such acquiescence; they proceed upon their way, leaving you tofollow after and to catch up with them eventually. This tendency is, however,rapidly ending in you and in joyful association (coloured by your love,glorified by the group successes and learning from mistakes) you will walk inthe future with your brothers in the Way.I would like to point out two things also: First, your sixth ray astralbody—sensitive, finely organised and motivated by high aspiration—is swept intodramatic, over-emphasised action very frequently because it reacts to theviolent impact of your first ray personality and mind. Let this end. Train youremotions [588] to respond to your second ray soul and for a period at leasteliminate the mind from astral control. Can you do this? If you can, you willbalance and round out your nature, for the dominating factors will then be:1. The soul, working through the astral body and controlling your heart light.2. The personality, working through the mind and controlling all grouprelations, making them intelligent and presenting to the soul and heart theservice of a mind and brain, attuned to the loving, intelligent impulses of thegroup life.The second thing I would like to say to you is that it is not my intention torefer again to your personality problems and to your character difficulties.With a disciple, as intelligently motivated as you are, and with a love natureas deep and sane and sweet as yours, further comment is unnecessary. I am hopingthat in my coming communications with you, I shall be able to confine myself tothe development in you of those qualities which will make you a real healer andable to work in a group of healers. My blessing rests upon you, my brother, in anew way and I am approaching you with joy in my heart.As regards the work I would have you do, my suggestion is that you concentrateupon the work of the Full Moon Approaches. For you, the time of each full moonis one of real importance; if you prepare yourself for it as you should and asyou can, you will produce in yourself certain definite results of which you willbecome gradually aware.~BROTHER OF MINE: September 1938I am neither suspending you nor asking for your resignation from my group. I maydo so later. I have two simple questions to ask you: Why are you working in thisgroup? Why do you retain your membership in it? The reasons which prompt me toask you these two questions are as follows:For several years and more, you have consistently taken the position that one ofmy disciples has failed to measure up to his opportunities and that my entiregroup of disciples has not [589] given the service which was demanded of it. Youhave so stated to a number of people and have also asserted that my work—asindicated by me in my various pamphlets and books—has not been properly doneeither by the group or by those who have pledged themselves to do it. You havecriticised openly all that has been attempted and have steadily belittled andopenly under-rated the work that has been done. You have misunderstood theattitude of my entire group. You have not helped in any way constructively. Youhave interjected a spirit of criticism everywhere.Why is this? There are two reasons, my brother, and I care enough about yourunfoldment to tell you with frankness what they are. One is that your fluid,uncontrolled, lower mind reverts with facility to criticism, to the formulatingof group plans which are impossible of accomplishment, changing such plans atfrequent intervals and using speech as a means of spreading distrust andcriticism. Secondly, you are mentally and spiritually ambitious and yet you donot have the personal magnetism or the executive ability which would enable youto form your own group. It is easier to undermine another group.I would like, therefore, to put to you one or two questions in the effort toenable you to clarify your own mind, and upon your reaction to what I shall sayand upon your replies to the questions which I shall put to you—I will takewhatever action may seem desirable. You can reply to those questions either byword of mouth (and I shall hear) or in writing. If you do not feel able to doso, I shall have to take it as an indication that you do not feel that youbelong to my group of disciples and that you desire no part in the groupactivity. For this I shall be sorry but I cannot hold up the work of this groupany longer because of you. The questions which I seek to put to you are thefollowing:1 and 2. The two previous questions in the first paragraph of thiscommunication.3. If you feel that the work which is now being carried forward is not in linewith my will and is not of real usefulness (being of the old age and not in tunewith the new intent) why do you not start your own group and demonstrate how agroup should be run?[590] You are full of plans and of ideas which you lay before many people but,my brother, nothing happens. The disciples in my group are facing greatdifficulties owing to the world condition and are rendering faithful service. Iam not dissatisfied. Your choice is clear and well defined. You can eithercooperate happily with this group in the work which is now being attempted andgive all the help of which you are capable or you can gather together your owngroup and thus demonstrate your own idea.4. Do you really desire to organise a group and feel that you can do so? Do youclearly understand what should be done?5. Can you train yourself to overcome a critical spirit? I would remind you thathabit is potent and that you are facing your life task and your major problem.You are adequate to the task, but only if you become truly convinced of theneed.6. Can you begin to concern yourself with constructive work which will meet thepresent need around you? You have talked much. Can you now begin to work?Of your sincerity and of your good intentions, there is no question. But work isdone by action and not by talking. It is done by helping the people in yourimmediate horizon and meeting their immediate need. It is not done by the layingof vast plans which fail of accomplishment because they are based on no soundfoundation. I would ask you to become constructively useful and to ceasefunctioning so destructively and negatively.Until I know what you decide is right for you and until I have your attitude inrelation to the above questions, I shall not again communicate with you. Thiswill leave your mind free to think with quietude. The question of where yourwork lies is a matter for your own decision.~BROTHER OF MINE: December 1938I have not the time to write to you as fully as I had intended. I have tried fordays to spare some time but found I had none to spare. We who work on the otherside of the veil [591] have always to take into consideration the fact thatthose with whom we are associated are limited by the time equation and, in ourrelations with them, have to work from this angle of limitation. I have,however, a few minutes to spare this morning and I will speak to you briefly.Your replies to the questions have been scanned by me and as I read between thelines (more than from what you say) I sense in you a definite change of heartwhich is leading rapidly to a different mental attitude—a more stabilised, amore serene and yet a more focussed service of the mind. Forget not that themind, in your case, can be a major directing factor of the emotional life and ofyour physical plane activities. Of your soul purpose there has never been anydoubt nor of your devotion to me, your teacher and your friend. But you haveworked always in that area or that layer of mental substance wherein thetendency to criticism and to the belief (sometimes unrealised) that yourpersonality views were right and of importance, can so easily cause illusion.From this you are rapidly freeing yourself. It is right that you should receivethis encouragement from me.I welcome you back, therefore, into the service of the Plan, into that immediateservice which will call for that concentrated effort and enterprise which willtake all the time, interest, strength and purpose of that group of discipleswhich is working under my direct supervision.The details of the Plan have in them the seeds of world salvage and can—ifrightly and wisely furthered—produce lasting world effects; these details mustbe worked out; they can and must vary as they meet the need of different nationsand circumstances but the forming of a central world party and the organising ofthe men and women of goodwill calls for a supreme effort.~MY BROTHER AND MY FRIEND: March 1939This is one of several instructions which I have written you within the space ofthis year. That in itself should indicate not only potentiality (for which allof us connected with the Hierarchy invariably look) but it indicates alsoachievement; [592] we have no time to waste with those who are making noprogress or who are not determined to face the Angel of the Presence or to copewith the illumination and revelation which then takes place—an illumination ofthe life of the soul and a revelation of the need and the limitations of thepersonality.Your problem is relatively simple and your service twofold. You need asimplicity of speech and of outlook—free from the tendency to criticise and tojudge, plus a willingness to serve wherever the need is greatest. That is yourproblem. You have already set in to solve it and you have grasped itsimplications subjectively. You are now beginning to work out the solutionobjectively. Those who have erred in any spiritual direction are always potentwhen changed. Your service basically is as follows: to stand by me and the workI am attempting to do in the world (and fortunately for you this too is yourheart’s desire), and to express this by definite work. This work falls into twocategories: First of all, the giving of unchanging cooperation with those whoare working in my group and under my direction and, secondly, to express yourown soul in carrying revelation to small groups. This will entail lessindividual work and more work with small groups of people. Find these smallgroups and raise their vibration by brief and potent contacts, making each hourspent with them to count and to be of value, and leaving them with a wideroutlook and a more sure horizon. Then pass on.Cooperation, movement, dynamic effort and then withdrawing—such is your futuretask under my plan. This you must do in collaboration with others, with the newgroups which have the new psychological outlook and a right technique ofmeditation. It is group work that the world needs at this time and an increasingfusion of souls and of the units in the various groups which are coloured by theattitude that will distinguish the coming civilisation. I think you comprehendwell what I mean and what I am asking; you have already made a beginning alongthis somewhat peculiar line. The duty of a hierarchical Observer (such asmyself) is only to indicate—after the fact, thus not infringing the freewill ofthe person—that the action taken is in line with soul intent. This is ever inline with hierarchical intent. This, I therefore, do.~[593] MY FRIEND AND MY BROTHER: April 1940I would have a word with you today, after a silence lasting many months. In thistime you have adjusted yourself to the life of the soul and you have dedicatedyourself anew to world service and to me. This has been registered by me and Ihave not been unmindful. Your inner contact with your soul and with me has beenstrengthened and the light enhanced.A disciple, at your stage of development, has two major lessons to learn.Particularly is this so when he has the combination of rays which is yours. Hehas to learn, first of all, to stand completely alone (though only apparently soand only for a temporary space of time), detached from contact with the Master.Sometimes even his own soul seems silent. But this is all illusion.Circumstances are staged to bring this condition about and if they are not sostaged by the disciple’s own soul, then the Master acts to bring thecircumstance about. The disciple must be thrown upon his own resources. Thisstage of stabilisation now lies behind you and in time to come you mustdemonstrate that steady calm for this life, that “poised position at the centre”which is the gift of your immediate past experience.The second thing which you have to learn is the control of the fluid map-making,plan-formulating mind. This one thing nearly brought disaster to you. The dangeris now, however, past. You are aware of this and will cautiously guard againstit. When a disciple first comes into a Master’s group (as you came into mine)the inflow of energy is so great that the mind is frequently aroused to such anintense activity that it gets temporarily out of calm control. Too much is seenat once; too much is sensed and grasped; possibilities and plans, modes andmethods of teaching and of service, and potentialities (hitherto unrealised)pour unhindered and simultaneously into the disciple’s consciousness. When thistakes place, there follows a period of serious instability, of fluidity ofthought and undertaking, of violent experimentation and of what I might term aspiritual riot. This must eventually come to an end before the disciple canenter into his real service. This resumed stability took place with you becauseyou are fundamentally [594] stable and sound and because—at such periods—aMaster’s group supports and protects the one who is passing through theexperience of over-stimulation. The protective work done in the Ashram of aMaster is something little realised by the average disciple. Whilst this type ofexperience is going on, the outer group of a Master’s disciples proves of littleservice; it simply stimulates the mind, providing outlets for the blind riotingconsciousness. Hence your withdrawal was right and sound but need no longer becontinued.Of one thing I am sure, brother of old, and that is that you will understandwhereof I speak. The period of strain and stress now lies behind you. Your placein my inner group is assured. Your work in the outer group is opening up andwhat I have here told you is only the corroboration of your own inner intuition.Two things lie ahead of you: Learning to work upon the outer plane in groupassociation with your co-disciples and with those whom they will gather aroundthem in coming years, and, also the strengthening of the inner rhythm of thesoul as it conditions the outer life into a calm and increasing service andcooperation with my determined plans. These, all of you who are my chosendisciples, can work out together.It is this together which so oft proves difficult to our workers. It is groupwork which we desire and not the domination of a person in a group or thecontrol of two or three people. This means slower work but a more widespreadinfluence. It is safer and more fruitful in the long run. The group work entailsmany things and many developments within the group consciousness. One of theseis the finding of the level of service, so that what is done is a group effort.It will then prove successful, for it will be based on group conviction and ongroup understanding. Another is that the disciples, working under one Master,become an extension of His Ashram upon the outer plane.Another thing which it is important you should grasp is your special field ofservice and the conditions under which you should carry on your work. Yourphysical vehicle must be guarded and any intensity must be avoided. That is adefinite injunction from me. Esoterically speaking, your contribution [595] ismeditation, and aiding in the meditative life of the group; exotericallyspeaking, it lies in conference (with any of my disciples whom you may happen toknow) about the new cycle of work which is unfolding, about the group purposes,objectives, principles and policies. This is group service and must be carriedforward together.I am writing thus fully to you because a life, rich in service and fulfilment,can open up for you, provided that you establish and hold happy human relationswith your chosen fellow workers, a deep and constant humility and an urgentfaith. This, I know is your soul’s desire and it is also mine for you.I understand and trust you, disciple of mine. I have little time, in these daysof world agony, to give to the particular training of any of you. I only offeropportunity.NOTE: It will be apparent from the above instruction that the disciple wastemporarily suspended from active work in the group until certain lessons hadbeen learned. Re-instatement followed.~TO L. T. S-K.January 1932BROTHER OF MINE:There is no hurry attached to the work done by the members of a Master’s group.The earnest desire to progress can hinder as well as help. The intuition is agrowth, primarily, in sensitivity and in an inner response to the soul. Thismust be cultivated with care, and no attention should be paid to the factor oftime.I have three things to say to you, brother of old, and two things to suggest;your response to these will guarantee your success.First: You are in this group for two reasons. You have a strong karmic link withme, which you have ever recognised and which you unduly emphasise. Second: Youare at a most critical point on the Path of Probation, for you can, if soinclined, take those steps which will land you on the Path of [596]Discipleship. Third: You need to have in mind the fact that your life—up tothree years ago—has been an exemplification of excessive duality. In this duallife, your emphasis has been laid on “making good” on the physical plane in theworld of business; paralleling this, but divorced from it, has been an intenseinner life of aspiration and devotion to the Great Ones, and later to myself, aworking chela of the Great White Lodge.You have managed curiously to keep these two lines of activity free from contactwith each other. Your devotion served not to prevent mistakes or the misuse ofthe worldly opportunities, nor did your active worldly life seem to affect inany way your fiery devotion and persistence towards the goal.This dual activity must be brought to an end and your aim must be to bring aboutin yourself the at-one-ment, or the unification of the aims and purposes whichhave hitherto been divergent. Mistake me not, my brother: The ultimate objectiveof the physical plane life has been to lay the gains in business at the disposalof the Great Ones, but this objective has not coloured your technique. You willknow today how just this criticism is. Four years ago, I could not have thusaddressed you, for you would not have recognised the justice of my remarks.Your problem has been complicated (as is the problem of all disciples who standon the verge of acceptance) by the force of your ray impulses, and by thedifficulty of the era in which you live and the stage whereon you deliberatelyhave chosen to play your part. You have three years in which to make the effortby means of which you can become an accepted disciple, when you return again tothis earth. By this I do not mean that you are to pass over at the age offifty-six. I am speaking of the establishing of a rhythm which will be strongenough and vital enough to produce the needed fusion of soul and personality. Wewho teach, watch and guide the esoteric development of man, know that unless acertain measure of fusion is established by the time fifty-six years of age isattained, it is seldom established later. After that age, a man may hold to thepoint achieved and foster his aspiration but [597] the dynamic submergence ofthe personality in the will and life of the soul is rare after that time. Whenreached prior to the age of fifty-six, then subsequent growth and unfoldment onthe Path of Discipleship is surely possible.The two suggestions which I seek to make and on which I ask you to work for thenext twelve months are as follows:First: Forget your karmic relationship with me and give no time in your thoughtsto the Tibetan. This will be hard for you to do, but remember that I am only onewho stands by and who offers opportunity, seeking for those who will losethemselves in service. Your sixth ray devotion has turned your effort towardsastral recognition more than to unity and at-one-ment in the great work.Second: Work steadily at the problem of entering into the pure white light ofyour own soul. How shall this be done? Let us be practical and outline certainthings to be accomplished during the rest of this year.1. Refrain from reading the books for which I am responsible. You have steepedyourself in the teaching they contain for years. Now practise the truths learntthereby. Instead, study with close attention The Bhagavad Gita, and use that asyour textbook of guidance.2. Instead of studying my writings, will you serve your fellow disciples bymaking (on their behalf) a close study of the psychology of the intuition?Ascertain the best that man has to say about it and prepare for your brothers acompilation on the subject and a summation of the significance of the intuitionand its mode of unfoldment. Seek the definitions of the intuition and collectthem together for use and, likewise, make a useful bibliography of theliterature on the subject. Each group of my disciples has somewhat tocontribute, and the group to which you belong should ascertain much upon thesubject of the intuition.3. Follow the breathing exercises with attention, bearing ever in mind thethought that they aid in the unification of soul and body and in thepurification of the sheaths.4. In your meditation each morning, eliminate again all forms which turn theattention to the Great Ones or to [598] myself, your Tibetan brother. For ayear, centre your consciousness on the light of your own soul, and keep yourmeditation very simple.That you may learn to walk in the light that pours forth from your own soul isthe earnest wish of your fellow worker, the Tibetan.~MY BROTHER: July 1933The way of the aspirant climaxes at times, and might be described as a series ofsteady growth cycles, accentuated at intervals by definite periods of forceddevelopment wherein one limitation after another is forcibly removed, by youyourself. All limitations and hindrances have to go. You have for years beenlike a man standing in a room with his back to the window—a window that so sadlyneeded cleaning that the light in the room was dim and only partially diffused.You are today like a man who has turned around and walked over to the window,and then has cleaned a small circle through which you look. You can see thatwhich is around much more clearly. The room is better lighted, and you are nowmore clearly aware of what you need to do for yourself and the room. This ismuch, my brother, for you have done it all within the last twelve months. Beforethat time your accomplishment seemed doubtful, not from bad intent but becauseyou had become accustomed to your position and attitude and to the room in whichyou lived. Your knowledge of what lay outside was theoretical but not of apractical nature.A brief period of time remains in which to finish cleaning the window andillumining the room, thereby associating yourself with the life outside thewindow. I believe you can do it if you desire nothing for the separated self; ifyou train yourself to see things and, above all, people as they are and in atrue perspective. People are not what you want them to be and they live also inrooms with darkened windows. When you look through the window there is nothingto be seen as it really is. All is distorted. Your problem is the problem ofunderstanding the glamour and illusion in which you perforce have to live, andso to work through the glamour that you can see life truly.[599] Be not in any way discouraged, brother of old, if you find the upward waystiff and hard to climb. You are in good company and are not alone. Out of thepresent situation, true wisdom is born. Before the full light of the sun canshine at the time of dawn, there has to be the dissipation of the mist—a mistwhich distorts and hides. This is done not by any function of the mist itself,but by the growth in power of the rays of the rising sun. Therefore, for youthere must be the steady growth of the light of your own soul, fostered bymeditation, expressed in selfless service, and increasing in radiance throughthe intensification of your soul’s life. Live, therefore, as a soul and forgetthe personality. Give not so much time to the consideration of the faults andmistakes of the past. Self-depreciation is not necessarily a sign of spiritualgrowth. It is often the first result of a soul contact and means the revelationof personality limitations covering many years. That has a temporary value,provided you again turn your eyes to the soul. Forgetting the things that liebehind let the light of your soul lead you where it will. Be, as I have toldanother of my disciples in the group, the sannyasin—living in the world of men,yet having your interests in the world where the Great Ones work. You are notalone. You have found your own company of souls. You are not walking in thedark, for there is a light upon your way. Stay within the radius of that lightand wander not down the accustomed by-ways. These words may sound to those whoread them platitudes, applicable to anyone. You yourself know, however, howintensely applicable they are to you.You can resume the study of my instructions and writings but must preserve abalanced attitude. There are other things to be done than simply to be a devoteeof the Tibetan brother. Follow the meditation I here give you. . . .~MY BROTHER: March 1934For you I have this time no instructions. I must know first that you havecleaned another window pane. That also which you earlier cleansed and to which Ireferred in my last communication is again befogged, not so much from theaccumulation [600] of grime, but by the cold within, which producescondensation. Think this out. Seek out your motives, for they are at the root ofall your trouble, and glamour not yourself with the belief that you are animatedby principle or are fighting for principle and thus occupied with truth.You say that you report these facts and impressions to me and to the group,confident that you can safely turn to the teacher for confirmation or correctionon any point. If in any respect you are proceeding along wrong lines, you wantto know it and to modify your life in conformity with my wishes.How you do love authority, my brother, and how you would like me to save you alot of trouble and direct your way, and give you information as to what is rightand wrong! But should I accede to your request and tell you what you want toknow, what would be the result? You have been told what the situation was, andknow clearly the grounds on which the communications were repudiated and yourefused to accept it. What is the difference, when I tell you the same? If whatis written or said coincides with your own ideas, how gladly would you catchhold of my words. But if they failed to do so, how easily you would argue thatthey were the words of someone else and deem that they had been brought throughin error or coloured by personality reactions. Or you would accept themabsolutely because I said them and thus bow to authority and leave yourintuition still inactive. But I have no authority, my brother, nor have I everclaimed to have it.In one case, you fail to grow in ability to stand alone and to make wisedecisions based on intuitive recognition of reality; and in the other, the pointof separativeness grows in strength.What your teacher in the past, myself, may think is of small moment. What anyoneelse may think and say is of very small moment. What is of importance to youtoday is to see clearly, to speak truth to yourself and to walk in the light—athing you never yet have done for any length of time. You report growth inabstract consciousness. You need not that growth. You need growth in clear cutthinking and in clear cut action. You are faced with the problem of yourself,and you will solve it only when you have freed yourself from personalityimpulses and from the glamour in which you habitually walk. Note, my [601]brother, the decision and clarity with which I thus address you. Note my style,for it is the same style as before, but I am carefully wording thiscommunication so that you can clearly grasp my words. If you like the adjectivalphrases of the communicator who has engrossed your attention lately, I wouldcall you (in his style) a brother of dedicated emotions but poor intuitivementality and a befogged aspirant. In all love, I say this to you and in aneffort to arouse your attention.As I said to all my disciples so I say to you: If you seek to work with me andwill conform to group requirements, then I, on my side, will do what I can toaid you in your group work. All the work I assign to individuals in the grouphas but one aim in view—to enable them to work as a group for the good of thegroup. This, you have not done and the group work as a whole has been set backby you, for the group moves forward as a group; though the individuals may havegrown, the group has not moved forward but has been held back the past sixmonths by the situation for which you were largely responsible.I refer not in this instruction to the problem of communications. Disciples arefree to interest themselves in any number of groups and communicators. I referto the problem of this particular situation which is simply that of identity .Forget this not, and confuse not the issue. It is not one of authority. It isone of identity. You are at liberty naturally as a disciple to receivecommunications from any source. But be sure not to confuse identities.This situation in the group has caused me serious consideration. The good of thegroup is of prime importance. I am engaged in an experiment in this group work.It is not an easy one either for myself or for the group members. Shall Isacrifice the group to the glamour of one person? For, in the last analysis,others would not have been so influenced had you seen truly and had cooperatedin preserving group balance and had not interjected the problem of identitiesinto this group work. I cannot continue to give you these instructions if youthus bring personality and separateness into the work. You are not asked toaccept blindly all that you receive. But whilst in the group , you are asked tolive up to group requirements and to work with the group unit, and to refrainfrom bringing your [602] personality problems of any kind into the group work.When you no longer care for the teaching and do not do that which is asked, itis your privilege to withdraw from the group work and so preserve the groupunity. It is group unity for which I am working, and not your individual growthand stimulation. I speak thus with apparent harshness in an effort to bring toan end your years of personality fog and deep seated ambition. The two areallied.Forget not either my earlier injunction to you that “There are other things tobe done than to be a devotee of the Tibetan brother” or of the Tibetan and aspurious astral double.Your key words are self-knowledge, lucidity and truth, and they must all becalled into play at this time. Remember that your decision, if based on a choicebetween two Tibetans, will be a false one. Your problem is that of choosingbetween the teacher which we call the Personality and the teacher which we callthe higher Self. Settle this problem in the light of the soul, and not throughimpulsive personality reactions.~MY BROTHER: July 1934When I think of you, it is with a sense of enquiry, of loving kindness and alsowith a sense of urgency. The years slip by; those who look on at the lives ofaspirants have oft a sense of this urgency—an urgency that the aspirant seldomfeels himself. Life has offered you much of opportunity for progress, but youentered life and built a body that has in it much crystallised material and amental body of such rigidity that your problem (this incarnation) was—if I coulduse so inadequate a form of words—to smash what you yourself had constructed andused. You had to break your old thoughtforms of intrigue, of ambition and ofpower before you could be liberated for real service. Half a century has gone.The thoughtform of ambition has been broken and crippled but a sense of futilitymust not take its place. The thoughtform of power is weakening. The thoughtformof intrigue received a bad blow during the episode of glamour in the earlyspring. But the forms still persist. You stand before them bewildered, anxiousto do the right thing, [603] blinded by the power of your own creations whichshine with their own light, and blinded also by the blaze of light emanatingfrom your own soul and from the group soul. But blinded and, seemingly,helpless.No one can help you, my brother. You yourself must let all things go, and become“the little child,” spoken of in the Bible. It is not for me or any teacher totell you what to do. For one thing, you would do it, and in doing it learnnaught. From within yourself must come the incentive, and from yourself mustemanate the clear wisdom, and the clean cut action which will eventually bringyour release. What, therefore, can any of us do? Gather not from the above thatI or others feel that for you there is no release this life. Naught can arrestat this stage the work of your own soul. Only the urgency of the times incitesany of us to desire that that release should be accomplished as rapidly as maybe in order to set you free to serve.Perhaps the way in which I can best help you is to give you a meditation whichwill enable you to clarify the field of motives . Your life motive to tread thePath is sound, but e’en that motive is tainted by the ancient rhythms. Yourother motives are oft beautiful, but spoilt by the underlying distortions of theconcrete mind which incites to ambition, to love of power and to deviousness inapproach to any action of any kind.Therefore, for you, simplicity and clarity as to the causes of all that you doare essential and needed. At sunrise, at noon, at sunset and at night—four timesa day—follow the procedure outlined below:1. Sound the Sacred Word three times, breathing it out as a soul through thethree bodies.2. Say then, as you stand in the light of the soul.“I stand before the judgment seat of my own soul.I stand in the light that comes from that divine source.I seek to walk in truth, sincerity and love.”3. Then ask yourself the following three questions:a. That which I have accomplished during the past few hours, has it been clearlyunderstood by me?b. Have I acted simply and sanely and with wise direction? [604]c. Why did I act and speak and write in this particular connection? Whatprompted the specific deed?4. Having thus analysed the activities of the past few hours, then dedicate themto the service of the Master. The doing of this will eliminate much thought andwork of a personal intent.This sounds simple and almost elementary but if you carry this meditationforward for the next three months, doing no other, you will find that the wholeproblem of motive will clarify for you. That is what you want, is it not, mybrother? Well I know it. Your basic life intent causes me no concern. It is yourlife technique that lies at the root of all the difficulty. It is governed sooft by expediency. Give not so much time to intricate and devious thought. Seekto live mentally much more simply. Ask and look for nothing for the separatedself and eliminate all thought along the lines of lower self endeavour. Thegroup stands by you in loving helpfulness and readiness to aid. So do I. This isno idle word but a statement of fact that is one upon which you can depend.~MY BROTHER: January 1935You have done much sound thinking the past six months and the fruit of yourmeditation is being garnered. The meditation that I gave you last July can nowbe stopped, but the three questions which were incorporated in the third pointmust be used by you each evening as a form of review. You still need a periodfor the quiet consideration of the impelling motives for daily action. Rightmotive and a clear vision of the sources of action are still imperative needs ofyours. They will lead to right activity, truthful thought and right speech. Butyou have made progress, my brother, and have no cause for depression or to wastetime in regret over the past. The only regret that is justifiable is based onfailure to learn the lessons of failure. You, however, are learning.There are, as well you know, still certain mental activities belonging to yourold state of mind which seethe beneath the surface of your life. These, too,must be transmuted and it is for you to discover the method. I can but indicateneed [605] and opportunity. As for the method you should follow in meditation, Iwould suggest the procedure outlined below:1. Achieve alignment and then raise the consciousness as high as possible.Assume then the attitude of the soul.2. Sound the Sacred Word, breathing it out throughout the entire personality.3. Ponder next upon the Lord’s Prayer as part of your group work.4. Seek by the power of your thought and through the outpouring of love tocontact your co-disciples and group brothers. This is for you important, for itnot only aids in group integration but it serves to decentralise you from thecentre of your own stage.5. Then endeavour to contemplate or to realise yourself as the soul, as divine,as the Christ within. This will take the highest concentration of which you arecapable.6. Then say the following with thought behind the words:“I stand before the judgment seat of my own soul. I am that soul. All love andlight am I. I serve the world and lose myself in service. This is my life andthis is the way that I will tread until the Day-be-with-us.”7. Sound the Word slowly, sending it forth in love to your group brothers.~MY BROTHER AND MY FRIEND: August 1935You are still walking in a fog. Glamour still surrounds you. You are stillself-deceived and I cannot reach you at this time.~MY BROTHER: February 1936When last I wrote I feared that it might be the last communication I should beable to make to you. But during the past six months some of the glamour withwhich you were surrounded has disappeared. Much still remains. However, yoursuccessful attempt to see with greater clarity encourages [606] me to write toyou as usual and again to supervise your work. This I have not done for sixmonths. Forget not, that when an older and, therefore, more powerful discipleturns his attention to you, the resulting stimulation will work two ways. One ofthem will be the intensification of the glamour, so bear this in mind for sevenweeks after receiving this communication.The way for you is not yet the “lighted Way.” You have surrounded yourself withso much fog and with such a dense cloud of self-generated and self-motivatedthoughtforms that the light only pierces through in places. As yet, there is nosteady stream or lighted Way. Therefore, for the present the most appropriatename for that part of the Path of Discipleship that you are treading is the Wayof Sacrifice —the sacrifice of your own thoughts, of your own wishes, aims anddreams. It means for you the treading of the rocky way of duty, of dharma and ofclear decision. Therefore, for the next six months, will you take the followingwords into your meditation?1st month—Duty.2nd month—Dharma, or responsible obligation.3rd month—Discrimination.4th month—Dispassion.5th month—Decision.6th month—Destiny.You will note how each word has the same initial letter and hence will give youfacility in remembrance. Ponder deeply on these words and, later, write anarticle in which you will link these words synthetically and sequentially, andso provide an article on Discipleship which could be of service to others. Youhave ability to write; therefore, at present serve through writing.Keep your eyes on the light ahead. Speak not of yourself. Forego all planning atpresent, but perform action with detachment and with skill. Disperse the cloudsaround you by the dynamic light of your own soul, and in order to do this, seekgreater and more rapid alignment. One hint I will give you. When tempted todescend into the clouds of your own thoughtforms and into the weaving of yourown material plans, send out your thought to me.~[607] MY BROTHER: August 1936In my last instruction I gave you certain suggestions. Perhaps the way I canbest help you at this time is to list them for you clearly and concisely, andask you—in the silence of your heart and the light of your soul—to answer them.I told you:1. To sacrifice your own thoughts, wishes, aims and dreams. Have you done this?2. To follow the rocky way of duty, of dharma, and clear decision. Have you donethis?3. To keep your eyes on the Light ahead or in the distance. Have you done this?4. To preserve silence as regards yourself. Have you done this?5. To forego all plans. Have you done this?6. To disperse the clouds of glamour around you by the dynamic light of your ownsoul. Have you done this?7. To send out your thoughts to me. Have you done this?Two of these questions, I will answer for you, but I will not enlarge upon them.First: You have not sent out your thoughts to me. I have not registered onethought. You have sent out devotion, desire, demands, aspiration, longings andwishes—but not one clear thought. Why? Think this out, my brother.You have made plans.Will you re-read my last instruction to you and again take this as my messagefor you? Will you carry on with the same meditation for another six months? Uponthe work done during the coming six months will depend much. Send out yourthoughts to me and I will recognise them. Learn the distinction between thoughtand desire. The two are not clearly defined in your mind.~MY BROTHER AND MY FRIEND: February 1937I told you in my last instruction that upon the work done during the coming sixmonths much would depend. You have done the work aright and your feet are setmore firmly upon the Path, and much of the old glamour has been dissipated. Iwould [608] have you feel encouraged, for I am encouraged over you. Even a yearago I felt that you might have to wait for another life period before you couldfill the niche in this group of my disciples that I seek to see you fill. I knownow that I need not wait so indefinitely. Four times I have registered from youa clear thought—and this has never happened before in your life. The reason hasbeen that you have relinquished your plans and your personality scheming, andthus have dispersed in a measure the miasmas of your tortuous thoughts, based onpersonality ambition and the vagaries of the concrete mind. I can reach you now,my brother—a thing hitherto impossible. Up till now I have had to reach youthrough A.A.B.Let not the recognition of this fact induce a fresh glamorous attitude and mywords thus form the germ of a new field of glamour. I speak this warning, foryou have such an innate tendency to be glamoured.The injunctions which I have given you in my two previous communications remainstill the basis for your personality life. Naught is changed, except in you, andyou must guard against relapse. Not yet are you occultly “established” upon theWay; not yet are you expert in the recognising and the dissipation of glamour.Therefore, proceed with due care.I would have you take the Rules of the Road and study them. Take them as thetheme of your reflection during the coming six months and, at the close, giveyour interpretation of each Rule for the helping of your fellow disciples. Thisis the task which I assign you.~MY BROTHER: September 1937A fresh cycle of work is opening up before you at this time, and this is theresult of the attention which you have paid to my instructions and to theresponse which you have given to the effort of your soul to release yourpersonality from glamour. May I point out to you that very often, after acertain measure of glamour has been overcome (as is the case with you), thatillusion can then step in? I would warn you against two such illusions: [609]a. The illusion that glamour no longer can hold sway over you. Constantwatchfulness will be necessary.b. The illusion of selection and reward. To this, all sixth ray aspirants aremore than usually prone.Will you also forgive my pointing out to you that your entering upon thisparticular field of service and your passing through the door to this cycle ofwork is for you definitely a following of the line of least resistance. You canrender good service if you follow instructions with care, but it is theopportunity to serve which is the result to which I referred in my openingparagraph and not the specific type. Ponder on this, for if you understand thatwhich I seek to impress upon you, your service will be greatly helped and yourusefulness increased.Having made your choice and decision, my problem now is how to help you to makegood in the future which is opening up before you. My two suggestions maysurprise you, for they will not be at all along the line you anticipate.First of all, I would say to you: Take not yourself so seriously. The worldstill proceeds upon its way and the planet continues to revolve whether youserve or not. Lower the intensity of your vibration. You can serve and yourservice is needed. All servers are needed at this time. You have been through adrastic disciplining and should have learnt much; but you will nullify yourusefulness and shorten your period of service through your intense earnestness.Remember, you have to offset constantly your sixth ray personality. Will youcomprehend me if I say that you never evidence any imagination or excitementexcept along the lines of discipleship, and that then you evidence too much? Iwill give you some verses later on in this instruction, upon which I will askyou to ponder and reflect, not in your meditation (for I would have you followonly your group meditation) but during the day. Be balanced, my brother, andremember that work for us embraces many things, e’en hours of relaxation, and itmost certainly necessitates the use of the discrimination in ascertaining theessentials and separating them from the non-essentials.The second thing I would say to you may surprise you more than the above which,perchance, you have at moments yourself [610] suspected. I would say to you withemphasis: Love more your fellowmen. At present you love our work and service andthe ideal more than you love your brothers. This is the reason why you are sucha poor, such a very poor psychologist. You do not love enough . Every humanbeing you meet you consider and approach from the angle of the work, and notbecause they are fellow pilgrims or people you can love and help. Yourself as aserver and the work (as our work) looms large between you and your fellowmen andwill definitely negate your usefulness. It is the “organisation spirit” and the“manipulative faculty” of the third ray executive. Our workers deal with souls,and not with the work. They are occupied in aiding individuals and, throughindividuals, the world. They do not occupy themselves with the form side. That,too, is ever properly regarded and attended to, but it is secondary. You make itprimary.Settle back, my brother. Love and serve; relax and live a normal, useful life.The fires of your own intensity and the heat of your own aspiration willotherwise burn so fiercely that no one can get near you. Take time to knowpeople for themselves , and not for their possible availability in the work. Yetfall not over backwards as you attend to my instructions. Balance is ever, forthe aspirant, a major objective.The two sentences which I give to you for careful consideration are as follows:“The fire that I create must heat, not burn; it must draw into its warmth theman who needs its heat; it must not thrust away, through fierceness, the seekingsoul. It is the fire of love, and not the fire of my own aspiration.”“The service which I render must be to souls and not unto myself upon the Path.Thus shall I meet a need and, in forgetfulness of self and my own word andplace, lead others towards the light.”I have not indicated to you the rays governing your personality vehicles, for Iseek to place your interest, not in yourself but in others.~[611] MY BROTHER AND MY FRIEND: February 1938I would recall to you certain remarks which I made in my last instruction. Withyour usual aptitude to select that which your personality prefers, and whichintrigues your sense of sin (I say this with a smile, brother, but the dramaticglamour of the sixth ray person, working in the Piscean Christian age, lovespublic conviction of wrong doing) and, feeding your sense of drama, enables youto say: “Now I know,” when you do not. You emphasised that which was obvious,and ignored the real things with which I sought to reach you. What were thepoints of real importance in my last communication to you? I will list thembriefly:1. The illusion of selection and reward to which, I warned you (as a sixth rayperson) you were prone.2. The opportunity to service.3. To relax and lead a normal life.You will note that none of these sentences came out of the two paragraphs whichyou felt were so important and which you emphasised in your papers and letters.Such is your present condition of glamour that the essential strikes you not.You see it not. Such is your present glamour, that it is with the greatestdifficulty that I can reach you at this time. I am making the effort but, mybrother, it looks to me that this will constitute my last effort to assist you,for if this instruction avails you not, there is nothing more that I can do.An opportunity to serve and make a new start was offered to you. You were askedto help in some work which I initiated in 1919 (when I first contacted A.A.B.and began my work with her). The plans are made and the work is functioning. Yetyou received not guidance from those who have sought to help you serve, and whoopened the door of opportunity for you. You have endeavoured to initiateactivities yourself, doing hastily and often inadequately the things you wereasked to do. You were determined to find time for the things that your glamouredpersonality felt were important. You have chosen to select the work that youshould do instead of cooperating in the service which you accepted. You haveendeavoured to [612] form connections, unrelated to the work already undertakenand organised prior to your joining that particular group of workers whoextended to you the invitation. You have tried to organise your own activitiesinstead of cooperating in the work already begun and with which you were invitedto cooperate—and with which you accepted affiliation. Your activities wereparamount in your consciousness (in spite of protestations to the contrary) andthe group activities were secondary.I advised you to live normally and to relax your intensity, but you have livedabnormally and with an occult violence which has been damaging to you. You havefunctioned in a glamorous world of your own idea of service and of what shouldbe done, but there has been no true cooperation with what is being done —only aninterest in what your own over-active third ray tendency has sought to producehas engaged your deepest attention. Superficially you cooperate, basically youdo not.You have been glamoured by your own values and not by the group values. You havebeen side-tracked by many non-essential issues and you have not collaborated inmy work or with those who are already integrated into the work that I am seekingto do. I am referring to myself in this communication to you, as yourstatements, and I believe your intent, have ever expressed devotion to me, yourTibetan teacher. You have sought to integrate those into this work who do notbelong to this particular line of endeavour but who are working in other fieldsof hierarchical activity—of equal importance to be sure, but not the work towhich you pledged yourself in years gone by. You do not keep your line ofservice clear. You wander into too many other fields of service which are notyours and where you are not wanted. So great has been your glamour that you haveeven desired to thrust into my group of disciples an aspirant who, in a laterlife, will shift her consciousness on to the mental plane and gradually become aconscious disciple, but who is not yet working on the level where those whocould be, or are, accepted disciples, are working.I am speaking to you with no evasion whatever. Your true friends are deeplydistressed and seek to shield you and to hold you to the straight path ofservice. They are conscious of failure [613] and blame themselves for lack ofright technique. Why should they succeed where I, too, apparently have failed,and when your own soul seems powerless to pierce the glamour into which youcyclically wander?What are the major glamours into which you so easily penetrate and which blotout, whilst they last, all true perception?1. The glamour of planning . You are sensitive to the Plan, but occupied withyour own plans and believe that your plans are part of the Plan. List the plansand the schemes along many lines which you have evolved, my brother, and see howmany you have succeeded in carrying through. Blame none but yourself if theywere founded on astral dreams.2. The glamour of your own spiritual ambition . You desire to be a grouporganiser under the Plan. You long to produce some working scheme yourself,paralleling that already being done but definitely your own, or to organise somegroup, paralleling those already existing but which will be also definitelyyours. But, when asked to fit into the work of a group already existing, you aretoo busy with your own dreams to do so and somewhat despise the task assigned.But, my brother, in our work there is no great or little task, only obedience tothe next duty whatever that may be.3. The glamour of spiritual dominance or control over others . Therefore,continuously, you seek to find those to whom you can stand as a spiritualorganiser. They are ever those of no great account in the scale of spiritualusefulness, and ever aspirants of good intention but you magnify theirusefulness and possibilities in order to establish yourself—in your own eyes, ifyou could but recognise it—as a guide and leader of other disciples on the Way.You did this with two people, both of them good probationary disciples, and onenearing acceptance, but both working on the astral plane where those with whom Iseek—at this particular time—to cooperate, are not working, except as souls,serving from the mental plane and from soul levels.Again and again, my brother, during the past years I have sought to help you.The indication that what I say is true, lies in two basic facts: First, yourdeep unhappiness at this time and your inability to work with others, quietlyand unassumingly [614] and, secondly, that no success along any line has comeyour way. Face up to that and understand the implications. Face these two factswith clarity and with hopefulness. The true disciple has ever to face facts. Letme give you certain facts and then let me beg of you to ponder on them:1. You are nearly sixty. Ahead of you lie a few more years of service, if youwill, or a futile running around, if you will.2. You have been asked to collaborate in my work. This is not a question of yourrendering obedience; in that I am not interested, but because, years ago, yourecognised me and offered to help. You recognised some of my co-workers andoffered your assistance.3. Your “service,” so called, has hitherto been the making of plans after yourinitial service of financing the earlier stage. But, my brother, the giving ofmoney is the least important thing you have to offer. You have been occupiedwith large schemes, none of which have come to fruition because they were notthe thing which you had, as a soul, undertaken to do and, therefore, they lackedthe inflow of the group energy which would have guaranteed their success. Youhave been busy with an attempt to organise a group here and a group there. Butthe plans are already laid; the groups are already formed; the organisation,connected with my work, is already functioning. Then why not, brother of mine,collaborate with what already is?4. You have no ability to work in a big way from the worldly angle and are tooold to learn. But the success of all large undertakings is based on the littlethings, the minor tasks, faithfully fulfilled, of the disciple who is free frompersonal ambition.5. It had been my intention to start some of you on definitely constructive workin connection with the dissipation of world glamour. But this activity you havedelayed. You have hindered the work in the group up to date and this cannot bepermitted much longer. Work along this line can be done successfully only bythose who are mastering their personal glamours. You are yet in the depths ofglamour and subconsciously know that this is true. All who know and love you,know it [615] and are in deep distress, wondering what they can do to help youand aid in your release.6. The door still stands wide open for you . But the opportunity for you to goforward with your group is dependent upon your accepting the above facts and byyour beginning, for the first time in your life, to work as a humble server,relinquishing all plans, all big ideas, and for the rest of this life (which isbut a moment of time in the long cycle of the soul), doing the little thingsbehind the scenes of which no one will know.Have I been hard, my brother? I assure you of my steadfast love and of my deepand lasting desire to help you and to serve you.I shall not attempt further to make clear to you the futility of your presentlife and activities. I stand ready to weld you into the group to which youpledged yourself as a soul and on soul levels. But to do this, you must reachthe point of complete self-surrender and demonstrate your willingness to servewith humility and readiness. I will communicate with you again when you expressthe wish to have me do so and evidence, at the same time, a real understandingof that which I have sought to impress upon you.You have a devotion and a persistence which can and must carry you through intothe light. It has hitherto been a persistence, based on weakness, and yourdevotion has been glamorous. Now get down to facts. Let the future demonstrate apersistence which is based on conviction that you are in the Way of Service andthat you travel not alone, but that a group of brothers stands ready to workwith you when you will work with them. Let your devotion be that of devotion toyour group brothers, to the need of humanity and to the Plan and last, and onlylast, to me.~MY BROTHER: February 1939It is with deep regret that I ask for your resignation from the group. If inlater years you indicate to me a change of heart and a freedom from your presentglamour, I will most gladly take you back into some group—though not into thisone. I [616] believe that you are prepared for this decision of mine. The reasonfor it is that I cannot any longer permit your group brothers to be hindered intheir group work from your constantly recurring tendency to glamour. They havesuffered with patience for many years, in order to give you the time to piercethrough into the light, but the urgency of the times is such that all workersare needed and the group work must go forward.As you leave this group, what shall I say to you?First of all, that your karmic link with me remains unbroken. Secondly, thatyour place will not be filled. . . . I have little else to say to you for I havesaid so much during the past years. Your place lies open. Forget it not. Timemay enable you to show a changed attitude. If you so choose, and if you willtake a suggestion from me, will you ventilate all that is in your mind—a thingwhich is most difficult for you to do? Write with freedom. Express yourselffully and drastically. If the glamour is not dispersed in this life, thenanother life may see a return to old karmic relationships. It lies with you. Youwill learn most now by handling life, by caring for those for whom you areresponsible, and by retaining your relationship to useful service. . . .~MY BROTHER: March 1941I think you know without any emphasis upon my part that the relation between usremains unbroken, though I have not been able for some time to contact yousubjectively. This inability on my part is because the stimulation, which such acontact would inevitably bring, might (as it always has in the past) feed theglamours to which you so easily succumb.The danger is now, I believe, greatly lessened and you can be trusted today witha closer contact with me and with the group on the inner subjective plane. Theinner group remains and is closely linked with me.You have struggled for years to overcome the glamours and illusions whichoverwhelm you with such frequency. Your major gain has been to recognise moreconsciously the danger and a more swift reaction to it when it appears. Latelast summer [617] and early in the autumn, you very nearly succumbed to an oldrhythm. Suspicion of yourself, an uneasy conscience and much outer plane worktended to safeguard you. See to it most carefully that this contact with me andwith your brothers in the inner group does not re-awaken into activitywell-trained tendencies, old forms of wishful thinking, and old desires forpower.For you, the remainder of this life must be given to the steady adherence to theduty of the day and to an intense inner life of meditation. Be consciously thesannyasin. Also, my brother, cooperate in all that proves itself (to yourintuition) to be group activity and to which you can contribute power (gained inmeditation) and understanding help. All else must be ruled out for this life;meditation and group service must, and will, provide adequate expression for allthe powers of your personality and your soul. Find time for that service and benot entirely overwhelmed with the business of the physical plane. Your dailybusiness, your daily service in your environment, your sensitivity to myimpression (which can increasingly be developed) and your relation with theinner group on the mental plane will give you scope for loving, fruitful livingand prepare you for the freer service of the next life.You have had a gruelling and a testing time, my brother. Your improvement hasbeen slow but real. You can be trusted more definitely now than in the past andit is for this reason that I again offer you a more conscious contact withmyself. I here tell you my name—a fact that you already intuitively know. I am,by doing so, telling you of your status upon the Path—that of an AcceptedDisciple. This carries with it, its encouragement, its responsibilities and itsrisks.As you are now on the Path of Discipleship and under the direct influence ofmyself, the Master . . . your major duty is to train yourself in the neededsensitivity of response to my voice and to the impression which I may be seekingto make upon your aspiring consciousness. This you will do by a constantattitude of directed attention, a controlled personality life and theelimination of all feverish effort along any line of endeavour. A clear,focussed mind, a loving heart, and a cultivated simplicity of understanding ofyourself, of life and of [618] others is your great need just now. It will domuch to bring your devious and involved mental attitudes and aspirations intoright order. Make life very simple, brother of mine.~BROTHER OF OLD: June 1942You have been drawn back into a phase of my work which, in the early days, youaided me to start. Opportunity opens up before you; you can be and do much. Thesuccess of this will be dependent upon your ability to walk humbly and torecognise the fact that ancient thoughtforms still exist upon the periphery ofyour consciousness, and that the Dweller on the Threshold stands ready at alltimes to avail himself of the weaknesses to which you have been prone.I say not this in other spirit than that of warning you, and I am happy to seeyou again within the sphere of action of the work. I look to you to aid andhelp. If you will always act in full cooperation with your fellow workers, andif you will cultivate frankness and open-heartedness and clear speech, the endis sure.Spiritual radiation holds the key to your successful service, and the carefulwatching of your lower sixth and third ray tendencies. You must be prepared fortests and difficulties until you have proved yourself; these seldom come theexpected way. One of your major safeguards is ever, as I have already told you,to adhere to and carry forward the next duty and to concentrate upon that whichhas been undertaken. Avoid that which lies outside the periphery of the work,regarding anything else as a sidetrack for you.My blessing rests upon you, and my confidence in your ability to stand steadyand to avoid glamour is always present.~MY BROTHER: December 1942Life has been difficult for you since you have again sought to work inconnection with my plans. Things have not worked out as you anticipated and youare full of inner distress, questioning [619] and bewilderment. This wasinevitable; you entered into this renewed group relationship with the same bigideas which have ever been your downfall in life and this, in spite of the verydefinite warning your true friends gave you, out of affection and knowledge ofyou. You had to find that the picture you had, both of yourself as a worker andof the work to be done, was distorted by “wisps of glamour,” and that yourwishful thinking and idealistic imaginings of yourself had to be revised. Such aprocess is far from easy and I have done nothing to make it easier. I would haveyou note that.The work needs men of consecration and devotion who are pledged to unwaveringservice—the service of the little things—and you could give much; but you cannotgive it until you have completely changed your estimate of yourself. In the pastyou have succumbed to glamours of various kinds: Glamour about me, the Master,and about the Hierarchy and your relation to that Hierarchy; glamour aboutcertain world disciples and your relation to them; glamour about the magnitudeof the work; glamour about a certain sad little aspirant; glamour about yourscientific capacity which held you away from my work for years; glamour aboutmoney; glamour about people.Today your glamour is centred around yourself and is concentrated upon what youthink you are and can accomplish, upon the soundness of your judgment, and theextent of your devotion. That, my brother, is good, for when that is disruptedand dissipated and completely broken up, you will be free to find your place inthe work. This has been duly recognised by your brothers. They have known ofyour karmic relation to the work and have had no wish to change the situation.Nor have I. But you cannot continue to work under the liability of the presentstrain, and under the pressure of a deep spiritual discontent and a sense ofthwarted and frustrated aspiration. There can be no free inflow of spiritualstrength, of wisdom and light, and of material resources when there is such acondition as now exists in your consciousness and which also, inevitably,involves your fellow workers.Dreams and reality must coincide; you are glamoured by a dream of service. Wewho serve the Hierarchy and humanity, [620] especially today, know the intensedifficulty of service in present world conditions, and the disillusionment ofmuch of it; we know that service frequently runs contrary to much that one wouldlike to see accomplished and to much that has been planned by servers; we knowthat service means endless disappointment, ceaseless struggle, hard knocks,apparent unaccountable failure—and all because as yet the spiritual strength ofhumanity is not commensurate to the material pull.Some day a point of balance will be reached, bringing—needless to say—its owndangers but bringing also a steady growth towards beauty, goodness and wisdom;some day the fight of the material aspect against the spiritual will provefutile and the power of the spirit will dominate; but the time is not immediate,even if it is not far off. The battle today is oft a losing one. Think, mybrother, of the ages of hierarchical struggle and the slow, slow growth whichthe Masters have been forced to watch and foster, the failures They have had tonote and the stupidities of some of Their best workers.Withdraw yourself from your pictures and dreams, my brother, and work with noillusions and with no time for consideration of magnificent possibilities. Thisis the most difficult moment in human history and its darkest hour. Be thankfulyou have got a vision but waste not time in pondering it. The reality of thevision is . The work of clearing the way for its materialising is the presenttask of all disciples. In the dust and chaos and wreckage, the vision disappearsfrom sight though the fact of its existence persists. None of you may perhapssee that vision again, but you have seen it. When, however, it is a fact uponthe physical plane, it will be so because you and many others worked down in theinferno of today.NOTE: This brother was, as you will have noted above, asked to resign. For someyears, he was not actively working in the Ashram. His acceptance of thediscipline and his steadfast faith, in spite of continued recurrent glamours,brought about his re-instatement eventually and he is now an active part of thegroup.~TO B. S. W.February 1933[621] BROTHER OF MINE:My word to you is as follows: As a disciple, functioning as you do upon thefirst Ray of Will or Power and working under the Master of that ray, the MasterMorya, I would suggest that you ponder on the fact that the first ray is thefirst sub-ray of the second Ray of Love-Wisdom and that you must, therefore,round out your development with love to all beings. You have succeeded mostsoundly in avoiding the major destructive qualities of the first ray and yourutilisation of energy in the work of service is commendable. Your aim must be toavoid all static conditions. Many first ray people become static orcrystallised, as that is the method whereby the first ray destroyers work—and itis all part of the divine work.To you, my brother, I would say (and you will understand): Strength is yours,because you have steadily trodden the lonely path of the disciple. Wisdom isyours and this you use in the helping of the little ones. Beauty must be now theobject of your attention. In meditation, I would have you meditate upon thetwelve-petalled lotus of the heart, visualising it as a deep rose in colour witha heart of gold. I choose the colour rose, for it will vitalise the astralcounterpart of the heart centre, both in the spine and in its higher aspect inthe head centre. My brother need not infer from this that he loves not, but thepronounced first ray type needs what is occultly called “the rose ofattachment.” They find easily the way of detachment; they create with facility aprotecting shell and they cherish—with high idealism—their isolation. But whenthe lesson of isolation is learnt and detachment is the line of leastresistance, then the Rose of the soul should be nurtured and shine forth.Impersonality is easy for you. You must now learn to be personal with completeimpersonality—a paradoxical acquirement but one of great value.I would suggest also, my brother, that you seek to teach (even if it is only oneor two people), the Way of the Disciple and that you prepare at least two peopleduring the next three years for the Path of Discipleship. They will be sent toyou. [622] One, you already know. Another, you will later recognise. This meansleading them to find the link with their group and their Master, for they willbe people who have already made their soul contact.Your ray is pre-eminently the ray of occultism. Your Master, the Master Morya,is the head of all esoteric organisations in the world. I bring this to yourattention because there is something you can do, and this work will be possiblewhen you have developed the facility to register the psychological troubles ofothers with greater sensitivity. Mentally, you grasp a situation rapidly;mentally and by the use of sound speech, you respond to the need. Your headresponds and your soul. To that head understanding and that soul wisdom (whichyou have) add the heart approach also. Go with your brothers into the valley anddo not help them only from the peaks of wisdom. You have mental power, clearunderstanding, the faculty of wise adjustment in solution; if to all that, youadd the capacity of reaction to the emotional needs of others, you willcoordinate the personality in a new and helpful way and increase your ability toserve. You can work with many groups, if you so wish, and should always work asan energising factor. Your spiritual diary should be kept with care from thisangle and the heart motive, underlying your activities, noted with attention.Your field of service will this way be greatly increased, again through being.This can be enhanced through an increased beauty of the outflow of love andincreased love of beauty.~July 1933I have ever the feeling with you, brother of mine, of your being an ancientcomrade, who knows right well what I would say and, therefore, that I reallyneed not speak. I hear you laugh at times and say: I know it all. Some day I’lllive it all. Some day you assuredly will and you are far nearer to that day thanseemed possible ten years ago.Continue with the meditation last given but use no longer the colour rose but agolden-orange. Blend the rose and orange and keep the meditation entirely in theheart centre, remembering that that centre is in the spine, between the [623]shoulder blades. Preserve ever the attitude of the Onlooker in the head. Thusthe detachment of the soul will grow whilst the attachment of the soul to soulswill grow and increase. The only breathing exercise which I set you is a seriesof long normal breaths, saying mentally as you inhale: “I gather life andstrength.” As you exhale, you will say mentally: “In love I send them forth.”Thus the rhythm of the life of service is indicated and expressed.Your gift to the group is that of illumined knowledge and the providing of afirm basis for action, with the exemplification of skill in action. Later, whenI may call upon the group of disciples to take joint action along someparticular line, your power to know the cause of what is will be of greatusefulness. This group of disciples is a service group and this must always beremembered.Dissipate not your powers. Centralise your activities and work increasingly withindividuals. Thus does the first ray type achieve understanding; thus does hegrow in love.~BROTHER OF OLD: February 1934This past year has been one of testing and of strain for you and of consistent,faithful, inner work. You have ever been sure of your spiritual relationshipsand that is right and well but you are fortunately less sure now of thejudgments of the personality. When the personality is being relegated to itsrightful place as an instrument and the shift of consciousness is away from theexterior life of the form to the interior life of the soul, then true esotericliving becomes possible. In the life of all disciples, there comes the time whenthere is an interlude of difficulty. During that interlude, discovery is madethat the personality will, the personality judgment, and the personalityaspiration is a part of the general glamour—a glamour which can only bedispelled as the soul pours its life and light with steady radiance into theinstrument.The best that I can desire for you, my brother, is that this dispelling lightmay flood your life and evoke that simplicity which is ever the indication ofsoul domination. That one word “simplicity” should embody the theme of yourthought [624] for the next few months and should constitute the keynote of yourmeditation.You are a strong soul and must hew your own way through the jungle of mundaneexistence. What do I mean by the words “a strong soul”? I mean not only thatyour first ray quality of power is expressing itself. That, of course. But Imean primarily that you are experienced and this experience of yours enables youto evidence steadfastness and that poise in isolation which conveys to othersthe feeling that they can depend upon you. This, in the second place, means anincreasing capacity to be magnetic and in that word “magnetic” lies the goal ofyour personality experience. The first ray person is easily strong but not soeasily magnetic, for magnetism is above all else either a heart or a solarplexus emanation.Since your entry into my group of disciples there is a growing evidence of theawakening of the heart centre and this should give you encouragement. Let uswork more definitely at that. I seek not to interfere at this time with yourmeditation but you have recognised that, in the press of work and for the periodof the next few years, your work can be directed by me, if so you will, andthus, for a brief period, you have voluntarily submitted to the suggestions of asecond ray disciple, myself. The pressure of work on the Masters Morya and K.H.is such that some of us are lifting what we can off Their shoulders. In the sameway the Master Hilarion is lifting a good deal of the work of training sixth raydisciples off the shoulders of the Master Jesus. A number of inner adjustmentsare going on in the exigencies of the stress of this cycle. It is one work, mybrother, and all forces are expressions of the energy of love and the potenciesof wisdom.To the wisdom force of the Buddha, you easily respond. To the militancy anddevotion of the Master Jesus and to the vibration of His organism, the Churchmilitant, you vibrate also with facility, for the priesthood had long been yourchosen field of service. An ancient sannyasin are you. To the understanding andthe inclusive love of the Christ aspect, as it expresses itself in the “fire ofdivine compassion,” you only respond in a secondary sense. The awakening of thiscompassion should be one of your objectives in meditation. It will lead [625] toinclusiveness and the power to “see things as others see them.”Your meditation does not now require the practice of visualisation and theregistering of colour. The ancient pomps and ceremonies of a priestly past lieburied in your consciousness and are easily evoked; in the thrill of statelyceremonial and of rhythmic organisation, you find your line of least resistance.The first ray person is conscious of ordered life, the majesty of orderedforces; the glory of the intelligent “arrangement” of the powers which liebehind the manifested world is his rightful field of service. But to this mustbe added the power to intuit the Plan as it exists in the heart of love, foronly love reveals the Plan and the part to be played in it by souls at any giventime and place. I am enlarging thus as I seek to enrich your life by two things:by a recognition of the Plan as it exists on the astral plane at this time,close to materialisation, and, secondly, by the recognition of the freedom ofall souls to work out that Plan in unison with each other, interfering not witheach other’s methods but giving to each other the love and cooperation at thosepoints where duty and obligation bring contact. Ponder on this. . . .~December 1934In my last instruction to you, brother of old, I told you to stand as a tower ofstrength to your brothers. With your usual prompt acceptance of any suggestionswhich seem to you intellectually and intuitionally constructive, you have soughtto do this. But, my brother, there has been too much of the tower in yourattitude and of the highly placed and rather separative Observer in the top ofthe tower. Perhaps my use of the word “tower” was to blame. Maybe my vision ofyou as a strong and steady helper, added to your innate isolation, swept you toofar apart. The first ray disciple loves isolation. It is for him the line ofleast resistance. He is, as you know, normally the one who stands alone. This ishis strength and it is also his weakness. He glories in detachment, e’en as yougloried inwardly over your power to adapt yourself to me, as the teacherassigned to you by your own Master. You liked the [626] facility with which youmade the adjustment, did you not?It is not easy for the first ray disciple to learn attachment (of the right andspiritual description) any more than it is easy for the second ray disciple tolearn detachment. Disciples on both those rays have an extreme lesson to learnin this connection; they have to approach the problem from differing attitudes,for the problem of attachment and of detachment is one. It is the problem ofright values. The first ray type loves himself, his power and his isolation toomuch. The second ray type errs through deep attachment to others and through atoo fluid inclusiveness which is expressed before the disciple understands thetrue nature of inclusiveness. The second ray type errs through fear of not beingunderstood or not adequately loved, and cares too much what others may think ofhim and say of him. The first ray type errs in not giving enough thought to thereaction of others to what he says and does; he prides himself on his detachedattitude and on his immunity from attachment; he likes to have his strength andisolation appreciated. One suffers from fear. The other from pride. You exactfrankness, my brother, and give it in full measure; hence my frankness with you.It is this inner “isolation,” deeply loved by you and fostered by early trainingand present circumstance which militates against your being telepathicallysensitive to other people. Instead of so much “will to love,” why not just lovemore simply? You and F.C.D. are extreme types on your specific rays. In him, theheart dominates, e’en though his wisdom is deep and his understanding rare. Inyou the head dominates, and you sit on the summit of your tower, whilst all thetime the call of the heart sounds throughout your being and in your ears. Yetyou fear to descend and walk among your fellowmen in loving identification withthem. It is only through walking the dusty street of life with our brothers thatwe find ourselves passing eventually through the portal of initiation.And yet, brother of old, I have noted that, in moments of stress and of possiblemisunderstanding, you choose the heart way. Were it not so, I would not thuswrite.I would like to set you the task of writing an article on the use of love as aninterpreter of men. I commend to you that [627] theme for meditation. You havepower in writing and ability in the expression of the deeper truths through themedium of words and your field of service can be increased in this respect.Write, therefore, for the many who will listen to your words, and write withthat understanding heart which is yours in full measure when you descend fromyour tower and give love both time and scope.May I point out to you also that a recognition of those ray problems andliabilities which exist in your own life and in the lives of those around youinvolves no criticism on my part or any on yours. The facts of nature exist; thewise man faces them, knowing them for what they are and he then endeavours totranscend them. . . .May I ask you also to study again the last instruction which I gave you, for itstill embodies much needed work. This new instruction is in the nature of afrank talk with a highly valued brother. And I do value you, my friend.~MY BROTHER OF OLD: June 1935You are halfway down from the altitude of your tower and that is good. In mylast instruction, I spoke to you with frankness and you recognised the justiceof that which I said and started to make the needed re-adjustments. That workmust be continued for another year.Have you any idea, my brother, with what care I watch the work of this group ofdisciples? I watch with patient attention, not because of any personal interestwhere the personalities of the disciples are concerned but because of thepotency latent in such consecrated groups. If the personnel of the group can besufficiently purified and trained and if the disciples who compose it can besufficiently welded together into one functioning unit, then much can beaccomplished. All is yet in the trial stage with many of them and only thecoming few years will show the Masters which of Their groups can stand pressureand yet preserve the soul link which underlies all the differing personalities.The problem of group integration is always a difficult one; it has beenparticularly difficult for you to integrate into [628] my group of disciplesbecause of your much cherished and deeply rooted sense of isolation. This wasdeveloped in your last life as a defense mechanism for a very sensitivepersonality. This attitude you are, however, learning to relinquish. For otherdisciples, the reasons which militate against integration vary. For some, it islargely based upon submergence in personality problems; these hold the disciplefast in prison just as you have been held in your tower of isolation. Forothers, the problem is to be found in the powerful will-to-be at the centre,both in its right and noble sense and in its personality and wrong sense. Thisattitude produces a sense of identity and of selfhood which hinders integration.Other disciples are hindered by the reverse of this attitude and by their secondray power of attachment and of inclusiveness. This has to be negated in the caseof attachment and necessitates a focussing where the tendency to expansion isconstructively possible.With these ideas before you, you can realise the need I felt for rightunderstanding on the part of all in this group of disciples as to the rules forgroup work and a right comprehension as to the place each of you had to play inthe future work. If all my disciples take hold of the present opportunity withfresh endeavour and enthusiasm, they will then discover what it is that thedisciples in a Master’s Ashram can achieve.I have several times told you that your function in this particular group is togive strength and power to your fellow disciples. Can you do this with puredetachment and with deep attachment? Such is your problem. Each of them needswhat you have to give, but needs it in a different manner. I commend this to youas your theme for study for the next few months and propose to you the followingwork. Study those of your fellow disciples whom you know and seek to get intoclose rapport with them. Study what they say and write and try to tune in ontheir souls and to understand their personalities. The result will be partiallycorrect and partially wrong. If they discover what you are doing, you will findthat they are all impersonal enough to permit you to learn some psychology froma study of their characters, their temperaments and their tendencies. It willalso enable me to give you some training as a practical psychologist—never aneasy thing for a first ray ego. . . .~[629] MY BROTHER OF OLD: February 1936It has been a year of interesting inner development for you, has it not? Youhave learned much and, fortunately for your progress, your ivory tower of beautyand of isolation is rocking to its very foundations. Your soul has seriouslyundermined it. It still stands, but you are suspicious of it and have lostinterest in it and that is a great step. Continue the good work and see to itthat this year your ivory tower—erected with care during the past sixincarnations—disappears and that you are down among men, sharing with them allthat concerns humanity. You will not have such a comfortable time but youcan—and will—become yourself a tower of strength to others.Your major spiritual activity must now be turned into work at the time of theFull Moon. Each month spend your periods of inner recollection in getting readyfor the work of the five days of the Full Moon period:1. The two days of preparation and introspection.2. The day of the Full Moon with its opportunity to tune in with your fellowdisciples in my Ashram.3. The two days of attempt to capitalise on that which has been subjectivelygained—making it objective in your consciousness.The gain of this exercise, if successfully carried out, in the development ofyour inner sensitivity would be immeasurable and its usefulness to your fellowdisciples would be greater than you know.The next few months are intended to be (for all disciples in all Ashrams) aperiod of preparation for fuller service. No cost is too great to pay in orderto be of use to the Hierarchy at the time of the Full Moon of May, the WesakFestival; no price is too high in order to gain the spiritual illumination whichcan be possible, particularly at that time.~August 1936It has been a year of change for you, my warrior brother, and the result hasbeen that there is less of the warrior in you [630] and more of the discipleupon the Way of Light. Your ivory tower is still there and stands in beautyreal. Perhaps it will never be destroyed and maybe it will turn into a haven ofrefuge for others. Its doors stand wide open and you are often not to be foundwithin your tower but are busy elsewhere in the service of your fellowmen. Keepthe door open and pass and re-pass with freedom, using your tower as a “Tower ofSilence” for the lower self, as a place of entrance into the “Secret Place ofthe Most High,” and as a “Temple of Refuge” into which the tired, the bewilderedand the lonely may pass—there to be aided and strengthened. You have much wisdomand also the first ray capacity to take a stand upon principle. For decades,these two (wisdom and principle) have expressed themselves as far as yourpersonality will permit. But within you, you have much deep innate love whichmust—under the process of balancing to which all true disciples aresubjected—have more definite expression. Before you speak the words of power andof wisdom (which you speak with such facility and truth from the storehouse of along experience), you must pour out the love of your heart upon those who turnto you for light and strength. Men today have need of love. Had I told you thisfive years ago, you might have believed, but you would not have understood. Nowyou understand.As I have often pointed out to this group of my disciples, the tendering ofconstant personal advice cannot go on forever. There is a limit to what can beassimilated and much remains yet to be worked out in daily unfoldment. I can,however, give to you and your fellow disciples much that is of group import andsignificance and by this means familiarise disciples with the rules of thatgroup activity which must govern unfoldment and service during the coming NewAge. I can give the techniques of the future. I would ask you to brood much uponthe work of the new groups of disciples as they form the seed groups wherein thetechnique of the New Age may be expressed. Endeavour to get the picture of thefuture work clearly in your mind in its threefold aspects. Brood on the mentalpurpose behind all Ashrams, and on my plan for my Ashram. I say “my plan”advisedly, my brother, as I am asking for your understanding of the thing whichI am seeking [631] to do. I am planning for the future and in line with thePlan. I, your friend and teacher, am definitely preparing you and yourco-disciples for certain possible and even imminent expansion of consciousness.Later I will ask you to tune in on the heart life of this particular group in myAshram, upon its desire-aspiration life and this, through the medium of yourdesire-astral body. When the purpose and the desire of the group (as itendeavours to tune in on my plan) begins to mature in your mind, then there willbe inevitably produced, upon the physical plane, certain cooperations andactivities which will appear with clarity to your vision. What these will be,will later emerge, but the time is not yet.~DEAR BROTHER: January 1937Your replies to the questions which I set you entertained me. They were so likeyou—earnest, sincere, mental, logical and with the impersonality of the firstray type. Your answers could have been foreseen. They should prove helpful toall who read them. Was the task helpful to you? Did the answering of thosequestions bring you illumination and those moments of self-revelation which arenot easy for men of your type? When they come, they come on the wings ofblinding light. A study of St. Paul, his revelation and his way of truth, hislogical tenacity (no matter what its disastrous effects on Christianity may havebeen) and his impersonality should give you much—of encouragement, of warning,of truth and of necessity. You could, my brother, with ease have written theEpistle to the Romans. Will you find out why?The work of this group of disciples with whom you are associated is growing andyour balanced judgment and clear vision may be needed in time to come. Give fullmeasure of advice and aid, tempering all with a more vitally disclosed love. A“mental body as hard as nails” will some day have to be destroyed. Why not beginpreserving intact the principle of mind, thus permitting it free function butusing it with the wings of love and on errands of compassion. The ordinary manworks from emotional levels, unaided by the mind and without the illumination ofthe soul. The advanced man and the aspirant [632] work from mental levels,producing the integration of the personality, and, therefore, power . Thedisciple works from soul levels which are the levels of divine love. Hemotivates the mind with love, subduing personality sentiment with universallove, worked out in practice and not preserved in theory. Could I aid you, mybrother, did I not love you that way?Can I ask you to do one piece of work through and in yourself? Will you studythe theory of the transmutation of mental attitudes through the processes oflove—processes which in no way negate the holding of these attitudes but whichmotivate and universalise them. Through these processes, a mental concept canbecome a fact upon the physical plane through the activity of love, rightlyused. You could do much with this thought and teach much to those who read yourwords.I have no special occult exercise for you to do, save that you pay closeattention to your spiritual sensitivity at the time of each Full Moon and dothis from three angles:1. Seek to draw near to me and endeavour to sense my vibration.2. Try to realise at the same time the vibration of my group of disciples.3. Register any phenomena, if present.~MY BROTHER: July 1937There is little need for me to do more than give you the facts; you can and willmake your own adjustments. You have the faculty of regarding facts clearly andthen acting upon what you discover or deduce.Your mental body (and this may surprise you!) is on the fourth Ray of Harmonythrough Conflict and hence the intensity of your mystical interior life. Of thisinterior life, few are aware. It is the sweetening, inclusive aspect in yourlife and your polarisation is largely there and should be so increasingly. It isthe factor in your life which makes you magnetic and loved. You have anon-separative mind.Your astral body is under the influence of the sixth Ray of Devotion and henceyour early interest in things Piscean and [633] your strong Christian tendency.Hence, also, your strong emotional nature which is, however, well controlled,largely because in this life you have a masculine body.As you might well imagine, your physical body is conditioned by the seventh ray.Upon this I need not enlarge. You are, therefore, a composite aggregate offorces, as follows:1. The soul ray—first Ray of Will or Power.2. The personality ray—the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Order.3. The ray of the mind—the fourth Ray of Harmony.4. The ray of the astral body—the sixth Ray of Devotion.5. The ray of the physical body—the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Order.~MY BROTHER: January 1938I wonder if you will be able to grasp my intention or if I shall be able toreach you. With disciples in my group, I work not on the astral plane. I work onmental levels, seeking to aid you all in the building of the bridging linkbetween your personalities and your soul, between each of you as co-disciples,and between the Ashram and the Brotherhood to which I belong and which yoursoul, on its own level, consciously seeks to serve. But—you have been away fromhome for some time now.You are not particularly intuitive, my brother, nor has your contact with the“inner brotherhoods” anything to do with the intuition or with inspiration.There are no brotherhoods on the plane of the intuition. The brotherhoods aregroup forms and are in the nature of being the personality aspects of the egoicgroups. The expression or term, Hierarchy, is only a word applied to thetransfigured personality aspect of all these egoic groups of liberated egos orsouls which function on the higher levels of the mental plane, and from thereseek to aid the sons of men. Your contact with the Hierarchy is, therefore, onmental levels. Your contact with what you call “inner brotherhoods” is astral,with all that this word implies. There is not necessarily anything wrong orundesirable in this contact, provided that you recognise the plane whereon youfunction, with its obvious limitations.[634] Have you ever noticed that I am training you to come out of your tower ofisolation, and yet at the same time I am training C.D.P. to stay up on thesummit of her tower? But yours has been a tower of isolated personality, and shehas had to learn (and is still learning) to create a tower of strength and ofresistance to calls of a lower kind. Her tower has naught to do with thepersonality. Forget not, my brother, that when you have learned to leave yourtower it does not mean that you must range the levels of personality life withno true direction.If you will look back upon the training which I have given you during the pastfew years, you will note that I have had a twofold task:1. To reveal to you that you were a first ray type and needed, therefore, tolearn attachment of the right kind. You had to learn to integrate into my groupof disciples and to love with inclusion and not exclusion.2. To set you free from a tower in which you have secluded yourself. This lasttask has been successfully accomplished. The first task yet remains to becarried out to a satisfactory conclusion.The group of disciples to which you belong, my brother, is upon the mental planeand exists in two parts: There is the group of disciples to whom you belong,assigned to specific work by me; there is also the hierarchical group, myparticular Ashram, to which you are affiliated and into which you must beabsorbed by soul dedication and later, as the years slip away, by initiation.Only one thing prevents your rapid integration into your true place; that isyour ancient love for astral wandering and for psychic phenomena.This tendency to astralism is a heritage from other lives and has its basis inold monastic trends and in the dream world in which you wandered in olden timesto relieve the monotony of life within the four walls of the cell in which youlived, dedicated to the contemplative life. Your consciousness was thenmystical, visionary and imaginative, veering off into realms of astralhallucination. This means that in this life, your astral body easily reverts toancient ways, to ancient thoughts, to control by ancient thoughtforms and isconsequently subject to facile deception.[635] With first ray disciples, I can ever speak with clarity and frankness,knowing that they will take my words in the right spirit. I tell you, therefore,with truth and understanding, that you are wandering into the delusions ofastral phenomena. There is no true reality in what you are now doing. You are asoul and not a seeker of astral phenomena.Three or four of those with whom you work on the astral plane are genuinelydeluded and they are in danger, for you are holding them back from progressingon to mental levels. For the majority of the group with whom you work, there isno reality at all; they are but shells of ancient astral workers, held togetherin form-activity by the few people who are on their way through the astral planeto higher levels. They are also held by those on the physical plane who areenticed by astral phenomena and temporarily sidetracked by the glamour.The astral plane is not for you, my brother. I suggest that you relinquish thisactivity and begin again to function as a soul. The soul in its true nature doesnot identify itself with phenomena; it is the centre of spiritual force throughwhich the plans of God come into being. Your excursions into the world of mayaand illusion have held back the group of disciples with which you are workingand have postponed their united group activity. You have observed none of therules governing my disciples, for months; this means, brother of old, that thegroup integrity has been infringed and that the group is not at this timefunctioning as a unit. Until it is again one functioning whole, our planned workcannot be undertaken. You are in the difficult position of holding yourco-disciples back from a specific task to which they have been assigned.Will you ponder upon these matters and during the coming months free yourselffrom this tendency to phenomenal enterprise? They have sidetracked you withfrequency during the past ten years.~BROTHER OF MINE: March 1939If you can grasp clearly the implications of what I now seek to tell you, youwill make real progress. I shall leave you to find out for yourself what theimplications are. You are at a [636] point in your development where—unless youemerge into a more mental type of realisation—you will crystallise into a highgrade astral magician and arrest your own true development for this life. Threethings I would like to point out to you in this connection:1. You spend the greater part of your subjective life upon the astral plane.2. You endeavour—largely unconsciously—to work as an astral magician works,using words to bring life and form together. You do not use the Word.3. The work you do is done on astral levels and not from soul levels so that theWord of Power which the soul would use is stepped down to the many, many wordsthe astral magician finds necessary. Your emphasis is now upon the form and notupon the spirit aspect.This is due to two things: First, the fact that your personality ray is theseventh and you have likewise a seventh ray brain. Secondly, you brought thistendency over from a previous life; your task has been to transcend it all andfree yourself from all magical work of every kind until you are established insoul consciousness. But at present you love this type of thing and believe thatall you contact is a reality. As long as this is the case, your soul life isblocked at astral levels.Another difficulty, growing out of this, is the fact that because of this astralimpasse, your soul is focussed in the astral body. It can get no further intoexpression, i.e., on the physical plane, on account of the glamour whichsurrounds you. Your personality energy is focussed in the mental body. Thisbrings the influence of the magical seventh ray to bear upon your mind, so thatyou are caught by glamour in two directions. Your brain being also an expressionof seventh ray force facilitates this work of magic.Until, my brother, you are polarised in the soul, you are playing with fire andthe magical work of the astral plane is full of danger for you. Even yourintense interest in Masonry is for this life unwise, for the Masonic Work ismagical work, being a reflection of the processes of initiation whereby thepower of the spirit and the power of substance are brought together through the“magical work of the soul.”[637] I am speaking with frankness because I want to see you released from thiscondition and from the impasse at which you have arrived. I would ask you,therefore, that —whether you accept my conclusion or not is immaterial—you giveten minutes each morning to achieving the attitude and altitude of the soul andfrom that point (or as high a point as you find it possible to attain at anygiven time) to think through the arguments for and against your present lifeattitude and interests. Endeavour to see, as you so do, that soul and brain arebrought en rapport —a thing which seldom happens with you. If you can do someclear thinking along this line, you will rapidly free yourself from glamour.Forget not, your sixth ray astral body intensifies your problem for it leads youto be devoted to the superficial phenomena which you regard as realities. . . .My blessing rest upon you. I would particularly ask you to make the period ofthe Full Moon each month one of true spiritual tension and interest. I would begyou to try to hear and see what I say. I have worded this with definite intent.You will gain much from the effort.NOTE: The Tibetan stated in January 1938 that “only one thing prevents yourrapid integration into your true place and that is your ancient love for astralwandering and for psychic phenomena.” This proved true and this disciple isstill sidetracked and hence is not working in the Tibetan’s Ashram.~TO R. S. W.March 1936MY BROTHER:This is my first instruction to you and my first communication; it is entirelyof a preliminary nature. Until the next instruction becomes due, this group ofserving brothers must wait for a more complete indication of their individualwork—an expression which will only be possible if the group shows greaterintegration and if the response to the Wesak Festival outpouring has beenadequate.You are probably asking yourself why I have put you into the work of this group.Is there something of major value which [638] you can contribute? Two questionsare arising in your mind. What can you bring to the group? What has the group togive you? I have put them in their proper order, for service must ever be thekeynote.You bring to this group an understanding heart. You are a sound and goodpsychologist, not only from academic training but from a full experience inother lives and a natural intuitive grasp of people’s problems. You know peoplebecause you love them and because you are endeavouring to be harmless.What will you receive and why have I put you here? One of the reasons that youare in this group is because you need a larger measure of stabilisation and thisthe group will enable you to gain. Your function in the group will become moreapparent as time goes on. You have an over-active mind and an ability to graspall sides of a question and to do many things fairly well. This is both a dangerand an asset. You need to focus that mind and that understanding heart in onedirection now, which is that of psychological healing; here work will be givento aid you; at this point I can begin to teach you; and here you can begin to dothe life work that is really yours. Have patience, therefore, for a year or so.You are young. Later it will appear more clearly to your perception wherein youbest can serve. I know your field of service, but I will never tell you; eachdisciple must freely come to an understanding of his destined service. When youknow for yourself what it is, then I will help you to express your aspiration.One hint, symbolically, I will give to you. The musical wandering hither andthither of the little stream as it emerges from its source and runs over thestones and rocks, responding to the sunshine and the rain, has to give place tothe calm, deep running of a river, as it pours down to the sea, fertilising thefields through which it runs and making many human activities possible.Now I will give you my specific instructions for this present time. They are inthe nature of preparatory work, of a preliminary re-orientation, and of aclearing of the ground for later activity.The thoughts below, my brother, if rightly used, have in them the seeds of theneeded strength and wisdom which your [639] life in the next year will require.They are simplicity itself and yet of a profundity which will exact its utmostfrom your intelligence.1st month—The Way of Intelligence leads to light.2nd month—The Way of Meditation leads to the gate.3rd month—The Way of the Presence leads to the innermost centre.4th month—The Way of Introspection leads to revelation.5th month—The Way of Service leads to liberation.6th month—The Way of Discipleship leads to the Master.Steadfastness and changeless understanding is your contribution at this time toyour group. Be not swayed by personalities, but take your stand upon your ownindividually acquired wisdom; preserve the group integrity by definite effort.Do the work which I have assigned to you. Work for the preservation of the groupintegrity. I ask this of you.~MY BROTHER: January 1937You will have noted that your major rays are the same as those of P.G.C. Whereinlies the difference between you, for difference there is, is there not? Thisdifference is not entirely due to the fact that you are in a feminine body andhe is in a masculine, or that astrally you differ. It is due primarily to thefact of environment and orientation. Ponder on this. You are at a point in yourevolution and in your daily life (as I think you know) wherein you can make, bythe time you are forty-nine, such rapid progress that your entire life willbecome directed towards your chosen and indicated service. What is the choicewhich you have to make? Formulate it clearly to your self, and know what it isyou seek to do.I am not going to alter your seed thoughts for this next few months. You have byno means exhausted their significance, have you? I would suggest that you goover them again and that this time you write a thesis upon the Six Ways to theCentre of Life . Write one paper each month as fully as you can for the helpingof others. Give of your best in sacrifice in the acceptance of this assignedtask.[640] Now let us briefly consider your rays. Your soul ray and your personalityray you already know.Your mental body is upon the fourth ray, which gives you your love of the artsand sciences; it is, however, for you basically the ray which brings—and whichshould bring—conflict into your life and your relationships. This idea has muchvalue and usefulness to you, for it has been the conflict in your life (andoften, my brother, a battle well fought and successful in its issue) which canmake you a strong hand in the dark to others. Forget this not, but battle on,remembering that you travel not alone.Your astral body is on the second ray, and this fact much facilitates the taskof your soul, and will account for the ability which you will discover inyourself to be a transmitter of light and love to others. It is this alignmentbetween your soul and your astral body which gives you the intuitive insight youcan use, if you remain humble and continue loving.Your physical body is upon the seventh ray, and this will be easily apparent toyou, accounting, as it does, for your interest in music, ritual,psycho-analysis. The goal of all these three methods of expression is to bringtogether and relate harmoniously the soul and the form, which is the major taskof the seventh ray upon the seventh or physical plane. This I know will interestyou. Your rays, therefore, are:1. The soul ray—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.2. The personality—the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Order.3. The ray of the mental body—the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict.4. The ray of the astral body—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.5. The ray of the physical body—the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Order.~BROTHER OF MINE: November 1937The past six months have been disciplining months for you. In them you have madetwo serious mistakes and three real successes in connection with your lifeactivity—exterior and [641] interior. Will you make a study of these,discovering first of all what they are and learning from them? Look life in theface, my brother, and be ready to recognise and admit error; be equally ready,however, to perceive where success has crowned your effort and glorified yourway; learn also to look for your failures where the outside world may see onlysuccess or some kind of achievement.Your sense of values is sound, but needs shifting on to a higher arc of thespiral. Your gifts of understanding and of psychological intuition areexceedingly good, but need further use. The claims of your personality life,that may perhaps bring you personality satisfaction, require re-orienting to thepresent life demand and to the urgency of the present time. You have much togive, my brother, and I would urge you to give it, and in so doing I would alsourge you not to become unduly aware of your efficient giving.There is at this time something in the nature of a stoppage in the flow of lifeand love in your second ray soul. Can you discover what it is, my brother, andduring the next few months, alter and change this condition? Among the membersof this group of disciples there are eight second ray souls. Why is this?Because the healing ray, above all others, is the second ray. There are twomajor healing rays among the seven. They are the second and the seventh. Thesuccess of all healing enterprise, therefore, depends upon the ability of thegroup members to work at will and on demand, under the influence of their souls.It will be apparent to you also why it has taken so long a time to get thisgroup of disciples ready for active healing service. It was necessary for me tohelp all of you to achieve a fuller expression of soul force through the mediumof your personalities. You have given but little difficulty in this connection,for your soul has an easy line of descent (if I may so express it), via yourfourth ray mind and your second ray astral body.If you will study your rays, my brother, you will note that you are eminentlyequipped to heal, for you have two streams of second ray energy flowing throughyou and also two streams of seventh ray energy. This makes for power in healing.[642] It will be found, when we come actively to work, that some of you will bepredisposed to mental healing; that others will function more easily along theline of astral or psychic healing; and still others will bring about physicalhealing. This means that this group should be able to work with the whole personor with groups as a whole. I would ask all of you to ponder upon this statementand see how wide a field of service is opening up. I would ask you to realiseyour potency in healing, and with care to dedicate yourself to this, seeing thatyour group-soul ray is in control and dominating your personality. This willrender you selfless in all that you attempt to do, and will guard you from undueinterest in place, position and success.During the next few months, I will ask you to stabilise yourself at the centreof your being, to achieve easy contact with the soul, and to build with care theantahkarana, from the heart, via the head to the soul. I would ask you to renderall possible psychological aid when demand comes to you, and through thosechannels which are at this time definitely open to you. I would ask you to bringto the Full Moon approach an intensity of purpose which should carry you to ahigh point of group fusion. I have asked several of you to take many days forpreparation before and after the Full Moon period of five days. For you I wouldsuggest a different technique.I want from you tensity, dynamic one-pointedness and focussed attention. Iwould, therefore, suggest that you focus on the Full Moon Approach (owing to thetension and strain which my suggestion may evoke in your vehicles) for only oneday prior to the Full Moon, for the day of the Full Moon itself, and for the daysucceeding the Full Moon. I would ask you to look for and expect certainreactions—phenomenal and psychological. These may be immediate in appearance, orthey may work into your consciousness during the week which succeeds the FullMoon. I refer not here to lower psychic phenomena, but to certain spiritualoccurrences and soul intuitions which can be sometimes noted when the point oftension is adequate. Watch for these experiences—intuitive, telepathic andspiritual—and note them in your spiritual diary, attempting rightly to interpretthem.[643] I give you no special work except that which I am asking of all the groupmembers. I ask from you a task of intensification, and this will permit agreater usefulness in the group.~BROTHER OF OLD: August 1938There is little that I have to say to you or to any of the group at this time.The last group instructions given were long and full and will warrant freshstudy and consideration. Please give attention to that which I last wrote. Thenew group work will also suffice to occupy you fully. There is much in what Isay which will provide full time study; there is a new meditation to be grasped,mastered and practised; there is definite healing work to be done. You are,likewise, meditating changes in your life. These changes are of an academicnature and not definitely personal and your motive is sound. To them I wouldlike briefly to refer. As I do so, I would ask you, at the same time, to bear inmind that I but make suggestions.You are naturally a good psychologist and have an intuitive understanding ofpeople. Please bear this in mind without over-estimating yourself, rememberingthat the academic intellectual approach to humanity which is called modernpsychology, should not blunt the edge of that serene understanding, thatautomatic, unreasoning comprehension which is yours today. Bear this in mindalways, because I somewhat fear the academic teaching for you. In many ways, youdo not need it. Remember also that, sensitive as you are (and this is your maincontribution to the work which we are seeking to do), you may react unduly tothe group impact in which you will find yourself as you take academic teaching.If this happens, the true group to which you belong—the group of the newpsychologists upon the inner side—may recede into the background of yourconsciousness. Then you will be of no use in the real and true sense of theword. Mistake me not, my brother. I seek not to deter you from your search foracademic knowledge. A measure of that is wise and needed. You are, however, apt[644] to forget that much can be gained by judicious reading and by theinstruction of certain carefully chosen psychologists whose knowledge and whosegrasp of human essentials is ahead of the rank and file of their collaborators.One thing I would ask of you: Use as the basis of all your work that which Ihave written upon the seven rays and accept this teaching as a provenhypothesis; be not deterred from this acceptance by any academic word-phrasing.You belong to the new school which is entrusted with the task of producing thenew, esoteric psychology, based upon the five rays which are manifesting throughevery human being—the soul ray, the personality ray, and the rays of the threebodies of the personality. It is all energy and force and this the modernpsychologist does not remember. If you accept and determine this occulthypothesis as your basic premise and apply all you may learn to the touchstoneof the occult and spiritual teaching, you may achieve much. But, my brother, lettwo things take first place: The study of the rays and, secondly, theirapplication to human life. Then will follow the practice and active work withindividuals. You will learn much more through personal contacts and service thanyou will from lectures and books, though these, in reason, have their place.Your work for the rest of your life must be based upon right perspective (freefrom false values) and an organised active service. Discipline for yourself (andthis you like not) and service for your fellowmen, will release in you theknowledge which you gained in earlier lives and there is, consequently, muchthat you can do. The only teaching which you need from the orthodox, academicpsychologist is an understanding of the nature of the different schools (each ofwhich emphasises some one truth), in their basic premises and their modes ofapproach.May I ask you to bear in mind that you do not need to identify yourself with anyparticular school. Each of them embodies the attempt of the human mind tounderstand, subjectively and objectively, the nature and purpose of man’sevolution. All of them are partially right in their conclusions and largelywrong; all of them are only preparatory to the new [645] and coming school ofpsychology which will be the distinguishing attitude of the New Age. You can domuch, if you will, to reveal this new school to others.My blessing rests upon you.NOTE: This disciple is still working in the Ashram.~TO E. E. S.March 1938MY BROTHER:You have been asked to join this group, composed of certain of my chosenstudents. You have been asked to join for three reasons and, knowing yourenquiring and reasonable mind, I felt that my best approach to you would be tostate what these three reasons are:1. There is a vacancy in the ranks of my disciples. This vacancy must be filled(in order to save time) by one whose interest in healing has been established,and who has had some experience in healing work. It must also be one who hasbeen trained for some years in right methods of work.2. You have a definite karmic relation to two members in my group and, needlessto say, you have a link with me, your Tibetan teacher and friend.3. You are free from two faults which have strongly coloured the personnel ofsome of my groups; a tendency to criticise and to discuss each other andlikewise a strong liking for close personality contacts. Neither of theseattitudes interests you and you can therefore be of real usefulness in the groupas a stabilising force.In view of these facts upon which I would ask you to ponder and in view of therelationship, I welcome you into this group for special training with the viewof special service.It is no easy matter to interject one’s vibration into a group, or to start workin a group which has been functioning for several years and which hasestablished its own rhythm. This [646] group is a difficult one. Some groupshave work which automatically confines their attention to mental levels. Othergroups are chosen because of their ability to work on astral levels. The task ofthis particular group is to work with power on physical levels; hence thedefinite personality tendencies and the desire for outer contact which severalof the group members have so strongly demonstrated. I would have you bear thisin mind and maintain watchfulness over yourself and helpfulness towards others.I would ask you, therefore, if you would do so, to take this summer for carefuland serious study of all the instructions that the group have received sothat—by a self-applied forcing process—you can start on an equal basis.I am giving you no set meditation work until my next communication. Thisinstruction will provide you with more than adequate meditation material, and Iwould ask you to do no more than read and ponder on it and assimilate as much asyou can.To bring you up to date with the other group members, I would like also toindicate to you not only your personality and soul rays (for this I always dowith any new disciple) but also to indicate the rays of your personalityvehicles.Your soul ray is the seventh, which would enable you to work with facility inthe new world which is emerging into manifestation with such rapidity. It willaid you also in producing order and rhythm in your environment; in these days ofturmoil and difficulty, every rhythmic centre is of value to us.Your personality ray is the sixth. This gives you power upon the astral planeand, in consequence, it gives you a powerful and sensitive astral body with allthe implications of success and failure which go with that situation.The close juxtaposition of your soul and personality rays is an asset, not ahindrance. This leads to quick results on the physical plane when both types ofenergy are simultaneously applied. Ponder on this.Your mental body is definitely on the fourth ray and it is through this fourthRay of Harmony through Conflict that you can establish a rapid rapport with yourbrothers. It makes for understanding, intelligently applied, and for theemergence of beauty through that established rapport. It is [647] the quality inyou which gives you an ordered sense of colour, proportion and of harmony inyour planned environment. It also evokes in you at times a violent reaction tothat which seems incorrect, inharmonious and out of tune or line.Your astral body is upon the sixth ray so that it will be obvious to you thatthrough that vehicle your personality will find the least resistance; there alsolies the need for watchful supervision. This I think you know and there is noneed for me to elaborate this theme.You have a first ray physical body . This is the only vehicle or energy ofexpression in your equipment which is on one of the major rays. Curiouslyenough, this fact indicates to those of us who watch on the inner side that yourmonadic ray is the first and that later, in your next life, it will be necessaryfor you to shift the centre of your egoic or soul attention on to the secondray. The shift of emphasis has in it the main objective of this presentincarnation and hence your possession of a sixth ray personality and astralbody. This devoted, idealistic one-pointedness is an aid to you in your soul’senterprise. I know that this will give you much food for thought and instigateyou to renewed purpose in your life endeavour.1. The soul ray—seventh Ray of Ceremonial Order.2. The ray of the personality—sixth Ray of Devotion.3. The ray of the mental body—fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict.4. The ray of the astral body—sixth Ray of Devotion.5. The ray of the physical body—first Ray of Will or Power.The qualities which you should cultivate are persistence, expansion, andstrength, applied with love.~BROTHER OF MINE: March 1939This instruction is necessarily brief; you have had two from me during the pasttwelve months and these two, with this brief word of encouragement and cheer,must be studied and assimilated. They will thus form part of your mind’sknowledge and of your soul’s expression.[648] I would say to you that the guarding of your physical health for anothereighteen months, is most desirable; the tension, incident upon your innercontacts and your spiritual work, takes ever its toll of the physical body andtime must be allowed for adaptation and assimilation. This I think youdefinitely understand and accept.Proceed with the work which we discussed and which I assigned andsanctioned—both the group work and that which I sanctioned individually.Experiment with that which has been suggested and to which I make no newindicative reference because the matter lies between yourself and me. Giveexpression to the thoughts which I gave in my first instruction to you.And that is all, my brother.~BROTHER OF MINE: January 1940The coming three years will be those in which you will have to fight glamourwith care, preparatory to clearing your aura for increased service. You mustseek to walk with accuracy in the light, for the path of the mediator cannot betrodden until the glamour of the mystic vision has been dissipated and thevision itself has been lost to sight in accomplishment and identification. Youwill note how frequently I am using the word identification in my variousinstructions. The reason is that it connotes the goal held before all discipleswho are being trained for certain major expansions of consciousness. I seek tohave your help and this you know. Clarity of definition releases the vision andclarity in word and language is a symbol of this release (from vision) intoidentification. Ponder on this. It is this clarity, resulting in occultcertainty and not in mystical belief, that I seek for you and hence my referenceto the glamour of the vision. It (the vision) evokes its own aura and its ownatmosphere, and the disciple must penetrate through this to reality. I havehere, in the above carefully phrased paragraph, given you enough to engage yourattention until May.I would tell you also that the stimulation of the solar plexus and of the heartcentre (which will be the inevitable result of the meditation I have assigned)will give you an ability to tune [649] in on “things as they are” in the worldtoday—the undesirable aspects and tragedies, via the solar plexus, and the humanreactions and the good purposes through the medium of the heart. Be ready forthis through the activity of an illumined mind, an intelligent appreciation oftrue values and a deep and true love of your fellowmen which will enable you tosacrifice for the good of the whole. Seek to see humanity liberated, free andable to live their daily lives in the light of love and do your share inbringing this about on all the planes whereon you can consciously function.As you meditate during the coming months, much knowledge and many readjustmentsmay come to you. In the group stimulation, you must look for a fusion and anexpansion leading to a growing identification; this will change you from asecurely placed server and worker into one who is willing to take risks for thecause of humanity and through love of his fellowmen. Love each other. Think withclarity, free from the effects of prejudice and propaganda. Serve with all thatis in you these days of world agony, and remember that if you are not sufferingwith your brothers throughout the world who are in the midst of the strife andturmoil (I mean a participating suffering and not a struggle to understand andto be sympathetic, such as the world is at present rendering to Finland), youare missing one of the greatest revealing agencies of all time.My blessing rests upon you as always and for all time.NOTE: This disciple had a peculiarly close place to the Tibetan and some verydefinite work had been planned for him, but temporary considerations and theinfluence of another person usurped his attention and at present he is notworking in the Ashram.~TO R. R. R.January 1936MY BROTHER OF OLD:You have handled life with courage, with inspiration and with temper. Is thisnot so? If you will endeavour, in the [650] future, to leave the last namedquality out, your life of service will flow with greater freedom, and with lessimpediments and hindrances, and consequently lost time. I realise that therehave been times when the temper has been a great relief. You have now reachedthe stage of the pledged worker and of the sannyasin, and you have proved yourmettle in the fire of difficulty. Much dross has been burned out. Your couragehas carried you through and the inspiration of your soul (which you can withsuch facility touch) has held you steady and sweetened your personality. See toit, for the sake of the service which you can render, that you add to these twofine capacities, the sense and power of Rest , for that is what you need.Study the keynotes of your life. They should and can be your outstandingcharacteristics, and that for which you can be known before your term of serviceends.There is so little that I can say to you that you do not already know, wherecharacter building is concerned. There is so little that is new and fresh that Ican indicate to one who is so experienced upon the Path. Theoretically, you knowso much. It remains to render theory into more adequate practice, and at thisyou are already working. What therefore can I say or do, but stand beside you,occasionally speak a word, oft times smile with you and be busy with my manyduties when the flare of temper comes! That I wish not to see, and so willsymbolically turn my back. Is not this what you wish, my brother?Your contribution to the work of my disciples is reflective thought and thewriting of that which will be constructively helpful, for this you can so welldo. Have patience as you watch this group work unfold, for as yet you see notthe real purpose or the coming integration or group relation.There are two people, my brother, whose influence upon your life is destructiveand who oft have hurt you much. (I refer not to your feeling.) Until your innerrelation to them is one of complete yet loving detachment, they will be apt tohinder your unfoldment. I say no more, save that it hurts you e’en if yourealise it not, but you are hurt because there is no love in your thought lifewhere they are concerned. Loving detachment is the method which should governyour [651] approach to the majority of people you will contact. You evoke as yettoo violent a response from others. This is due to your mishandling of the forcewhich flows through you. Get this matter adjusted and your present sphere ofservice will provide a fine training ground in the matter. Then your power tohelp will be greatly increased. I and your group brothers on the inner side arelooking for your help in world service. May I say, for your encouragement, thatyou have made a good beginning.I would like to suggest that you add to your usual diary notations, aregistering of Ideas . You will find it fruitful and constructive. Every sixmonths, list those ideas so that they can be shared by your group brothers. Addto them any thoughts as to their enriching and their materialising. This is oneway wherein the new ideas will be disseminated and spread. Some one must thinkthem and some one speak them and some one must respond to them.Follow the meditation outline here suggested until April or until furthernotice:1. After a short breathing exercise, achieve alignment and self-forgetfulness.2. Sound the O.M. audibly.3. Say the following invocation:“May the Holy Ones Whose pupils we aspire to become so strengthen us that we maygive ourselves without reserve, seeking nothing, asking nothing, hoping nothingfor the separated self; may we be content to be in the light or in the dark, tobe active or passive, to work or to wait, to speak or to be silent, to takepraise or reproach, to feel sorrow or joy—our only wish to be what They need asinstruments for Their mighty work, and to fill whatever post is vacant in Theirhousehold.”4. Then meditate for 15 minutes upon the following seed thoughts:1st month—Restfulness —“The Place of Rest is on the mountain top whereon I standdetached. Flooded I am by the life and love of God. That love I send to all myfellowmen.” [652]2nd month—“Rest has its centre in activity.”3rd month—Refinement —“The fires of God, electric and dynamic, burn out alloy.They leave the pure gold untouched.”4th month—“The burning fire blazes forth in all three worlds and all threebodies pass into the flame. Divinity remains.”5th month—Radiance —“The Rest of God underlies all life. The fires of God blazeforth. Men warm themselves before my fire. The radiance divine shines forththrough me.”6th month—“May I be lost to sight, and only the radiance and the rest reachforth to men.”5. Hold the mind then steady in the light and carry your plans and service intothe Presence.~BROTHER OF MINE: April 1937You stand today at a critical moment in your inner life and on the threshold ofgreat opportunity. Upon the progress made during the next two years will dependwhether you enter into a life of widely expressed usefulness, or whether yousimply continue into the future as you are now, leaving to another life thelesson which you need and which you can learn now.You are in a place of wide possibility for service. Your opportunity to make areal impact upon the consciousness of those around you is far above the average.The need of the world today has never been so great, nor the responsibilityresting upon those who are treading the Path of Discipleship so deep, real andurgent. We need all who are working upon this Path and who are aspiring towardsrelease. We need those who are seeking close contact with their souls and withUs Who are seeking to guide the race today. We need cooperators of dedicationand selflessness as never before in the history of the race. Situated as you arenow in a key position and meeting people [653] of every nation, your opportunityto fire other lives, to hand the torch of living love to others, and to sendpeople forth as agents of the light to their own countries and spheres ofinfluence can be great. Its extent depends upon your willingness to make certainchanges and adjustments within yourself and to re-orient yourself. These changesare simple, but are of so wide-reaching a nature and are so drastic in theirscope that I ask myself if you are sufficiently aware of the world need tosacrifice your potent personality—in all sincerity and loving willingness—tothat need. Are you?These are days when the unit either counts for very little and simply has anormal collective value in the presence of the pressure in the world and thecurrent turmoil, or else he can count for a very great deal.At present you count for very little when measured up against the world need,but you could count for much. You make very little impact upon the publicconsciousness in spite of your opportunities, and your natural equipment. Butyou could be one of the most useful of the world disciples in your particulargrade and sphere of service, if you so chose.Everything in you is however short circuited and your light and radiance,therefore, is of the personality and not of the soul; your power to stir othersand to move them forward is futile. Its truth is apparent to me all the time,and if you will consider the implications of my words, you will also see theirjustice. It is yourself as the worker, yourself as the one who is handlingsituations and dealing with people, yourself as the dramatic centre of all thathappens around you, yourself as the one who talks and teaches and writes,yourself as the one who yearns and struggles and is tortured and misunderstoodand faced with constant crisis (of no moment whatsoever in the larger picture)which is the pre-occupation of your mind. You are the one who is being happy andunhappy, who is anxious or not anxious, who is acting wisely or learningfrightfully drastic lessons—everything short circuited and arrested by yourselfand, therefore, no clear radiant light, unimpaired by the clouds of self, thelittle self, and unimpeded by the reflections of the personality.Do I sound harsh, my brother? I am not feeling so. What [654] I am endeavouringto do is based on a knowledge of you as a Soul , and an appreciation of whatyou—as a soul—could do. You are gifted, wise and powerful, but all this isrelatively negated because you cannot step out of the centre of your own pictureand off your own stage, and be simply a self-forgetting channel of love andlight. This, however, you are not. You are struggling furiously to be such achannel, but you are so pre-occupied with your struggle and are so aware thatyou are struggling that the reality for which you thus struggle is oftforgotten. It is lost to sight in the dramatic picture you have of yourself as atortured disciple, with phenomenal difficulties in your life.But your difficulties and problems are not phenomenal, my brother. There isnothing dramatic about your experience and it is far less trying and difficultthan is the experience of many. This is the message which I have for you. Yourlife is cleared for service, for you are free to serve, and the opportunity soto serve is given to you. You have gifts of mind, and brain and heart above theaverage—bound up in your personality, to be sure, but there for release and foruse. They can be employed to give you much influence and the power to liftothers. Your physical liabilities are of no importance, because they have noreal physical basis; they are related to the emotional nature, and areexpressive of the inner storms in which you so constantly live. Once you havedecided to decentralise yourself and cease poisoning your body with the astralactivity which sweeps you so constantly, your physical difficulties willgradually disappear.You have a gift for words in speech and writing, which is rare and valuable, andyou have a sincerity of purpose that evokes my admiration, and upon which I amdepending at this time. It is, however, largely used in portraying yourself tothe people around you. You are the theme of all you say. Had you realised this,my brother? I think not.We need you in our work. You are, as I have already pointed out, in a positionof responsibility. The place where you find yourself is, for you, the place ofrevelation and illumination. It is also the place where your best service can atpresent be rendered. Your problem is not at all subtle or [655] obscure. Thismakes it easier, therefore, to grasp, to solve and to handle. It is simply theproblem of self-forgetfulness. When you have forced yourself out of yourpicture, and have learnt to be silent as to yourself and what you think, andfeel and do, my brother, the richness of the contribution you will have to givewill be so great that your field of service and your power to cooperate with theHierarchy will be greatly expanded. You are needed. You are needed where youare. Will you make the necessary adjustments in cooperation with me in what Iseek to do to bring about your release?This problem must be handled through meditation and through constant dailyobservation. It must be dealt with through right thought; the first thing to bedone is for you to discover yourself, and realise the impression you make onpeople. You must find out and decide for yourself whether my analysis isjustified, and whether truth lies behind what I have written. Thus you can behelped to enter upon a voyage of discovery about yourself which (if you handleit with humour, detachment and sincerity) will end by enabling you to enter upona closer relationship with the Hierarchy and pass into a higher state upon thePath of Discipleship. I do not mention this as in any way constituting a reward,but as indicating a possibility which will greatly enrich your service.Your meditation can, for the next three months, follow the lines indicatedbelow. During these months, you can follow this suggestion and then resume yourmeditation as last outlined by me for the remaining three months.MEDITATION OUTLINE1. Achieve comfort, alignment and control. These I need not elaborate to you.You know.2. Sound the O.M. as the soul, breathing it out in benediction upon thepersonality.3. Sound the O.M. as the personality, responding to the soul.4. Sound the O.M. as the synthesis of personality and soul.5. Then, relaxing, deal each day of the week with the following seven questions:[656]Sunday . . . Did I work as a soul in my service yesterday, or as a personality?Was my interest in myself, as a server? Or was I engrossed with the need ofthose I served?Monday . . . In helping others, or in speaking with anybody, did I speak(yesterday as I served) about myself at all?Tuesday . . . What was the general tenor of my thoughts during the day—the workI had to do, other people or myself?Wednesday . . . What was the centre of my life yesterday—the soul whose natureis impersonal love, or the personality whose nature (at my point in evolution)is that of the “one at the centre,” the dramatic self, expressing consistentlythe lower nature?Thursday . . . How often did I refer to myself yesterday, either in pity, or asan illustration, or to evoke interest?Friday . . . What was my major pre-occupation yesterday? Was I happy? Why? Was Iunhappy? Why? Was I dramatic? Why?Saturday . . . What effect did I have on people? Why did I have it? Did I speakof myself to them?6. Then, humbly, gratefully and happily, make the following affirmations:a. I press forward towards the goal of fuller service; I am the soul, whosenature is light and love and selflessness.b. I orient my mind towards the light, and in that light, I see the soul. I amthe Plan, and am at-one with all that breathes.c. I purify my astral life and know myself to be nothing but a channel for thelove of God. And, in this potent body of the lower self, naught can exist whichblocks the outgoing love of God to all I meet.d. I stand erect through love and strength divine. I manifest the nature of aSon of God. Thus can I [657] salvage those who suffer on the way of life, andlift the little ones.Can you adjust yourself to this indicated need, my brother? Is your love of thework and of your group brothers adequate to enable you to face your problem? Ibelieve that it is, and you know and must realise that, in love, I stand by, andwill not fail you if you need me, and if you call. More than this I cannot say.~October 1937I wonder, brother of mine, if you have ever really grasped the truth that thesense of being at the centre of the stage in your life is a first raycharacteristic? In your case, it is dominantly a personality trait, for secondray people are not prone to this dramatic ego-centric attitude. When, therefore,your second ray soul really dominates, that sense which now controls (the senseof being always at the centre, the focal point of interest) will begindefinitely to fade out.The above statement will indicate to you what you have to do, for—at the presenttime—your life, your thoughts, your work and service, and your relations toothers are all built around yourself. Never, my brother, for a single second doyou really disappear from the picture, even in what you regard as your highestspiritual moments. You are still a personality working, and not a soul working,for your theory outstrips your performance. Hence your really profoundunhappiness and disappointment.What shall be done? How can you change all this? Of what use is it for me topoint out to you a condition unless I, at the same time, point out the remedy orthe way of release? And, at the same time, can I tell you anything you do notknow? Is there any aspect of the truth in connection with yourself of which youremain as yet unaware?All that I can say is that, for you, release must come through the substitutionof the Plan for your plans, of human need for your need, and of the Work foryour task. Ponder on that word Substitution. At present, it is your plans, andnot the Plan; it is your needs—financial and physical, emotional and mental—andnot the needs of the New Group of World Servers; it is your [658] work and whatyou have to do and not the expectant daily meeting of the needs of others. Thosewho come to you, you see in the light of your own personality, and in terms oftheir reactions to you . You see them not as souls or as our agents.This, my brother, must change and can change, if you so desire. A study of yourpersonality rays may serve to throw light upon your problem. You are needed inthe work and have much to give. You have strength and can strengthen others whenyour own strength is deflected away from yourself and your dramatic sense ofself-pity. You have great wisdom and can use it, once you lose sight of yourselfas a teacher. You do not suffer from an inferiority complex, as that muchmisused word is oft employed, nor are you the victim of a defeatist complex. Tobelieve so at times and to comfort yourself with the idea is only a form ofself-illusion and a way of escape from the responsibility of bringing aboutright interior attitudes. Your physical condition, your likes and dislikes andyour emotional reactions and your own ideas loom so large that your wise,loving, intelligent soul has a hard task to make its presence felt. There isalmost a chance that your sense of drama and of self-pity will cause you to losethe significance of the lesson I am seeking to give you. Is this not so?When you can realise that in these days of human crisis (when the call has goneout to all disciples and aspirants to rally to the helping of mankind) that noneof these personality things matter and that a lot of them will fade out whenyour pre-occupations are of a higher standard of values, then your work willtake on fresh life, and your service will become a dynamic, magnetic, focalpoint of spiritual force which at present I know you realise it is not.Your mental body is on the fourth ray of Harmony through Conflict, and not onthe first ray as you have sometimes believed. Had it been on the first ray, itwould have dominated your astral body and your personality would have been of avery different calibre. But it is of the fourth ray type. This means thatharmony appeals to you and the bringing together of opposites into anintelligent unity. But it is a harmony interpreted in terms of emotion; to thisfact I would call your attention. You must ponder on harmony as the mindunderstands it, and remember that only those succeed in resolving discord [659]into harmony who themselves work from a stable centre of adjustment.Your astral body is definitely sixth ray and hence predisposes you to Pisceanattitudes, emotional idées fixes , violent astral storms, great devotions whichcall your emotional reactions into play on matters and subjects which, in thisday of world suffering and crisis, do not warrant attention and constitute aneasy tuning-in on glamour and illusion.Your physical body is first ray in type and this gives your first raypersonality an easy line of least resistance, for the predominating colour ofyour brain cells at this time (if I may speak symbolically) is first ray. Thinkthis out carefully.You should, however, feel encouraged as you study your ray combinations, becausesecond ray energy definitely predominates, 2.4.6, and though the first raycharacteristics are strong and powerful, they are not complicated by any of thesubsidiary attributes, such as 3.5.7. It is not so difficult for you, therefore,to tune in on the Love-Wisdom line of energy in manifestation. It is your lineof least resistance. Your problem is the linking up of this triangle of force(2.4.6) so that there is free interplay and circulation of energy. Thus willyour soul assume control. I have stated in the above few words both your problemand its solution. I would remind you, nevertheless, that it is a soul problemand not a personality problem. If you approach this problem from the angle ofthe personality, you will not succeed in solving it for your personality willbecome the centre of the triangle, whereas there should be no centre, but youshould be living in the experience of humanity as a whole at all times.I am going to ask you to study for six months the words “a trained indifference”and each morning to do the Review on Indifference, prior to assuming the dutiesof the day. For you, indifference holds the key to release—release frompersonality control and reactions, release from self-pity, release from physicaland emotional limitations. Your problem is not to get rid of difficulties butsimply to be indifferent as to whether they exist or not.Have I given you a “hard saying,” brother of mine? If I have, the reaction tohardness is on your side and not mine. I only seek to help you and to releaseyou to fuller and more [660] joyful service, to a self-forgetfulness whicheventuates in the power to identify yourself with others, and, therefore, to alife of loving service which will obliterate the strenuous ways of the past.~MY BROTHER: May 1938Changes are coming your way but only as preparation for fuller service. Before,however, that fuller service becomes possible there must be an interlude ofstock-taking (is not that the right business word?) and a period of review andof renewed consecration. A physical readjustment is also needed but it may notbe as serious as you anticipate (in spite of brave words, my brother). Many ofyour difficulties are psychological and caused by an inner tension and tautnesswhich is really quite unnecessary. To offset that, I would ask you to ponder onone of the keywords I gave you when you entered this group of disciples intraining—the word restfulness .Do not work so hard, strenuously and furiously at the spiritual life. It is astate of being and not so much a state of achievement. It is a condition ofcorrect orientation and direction and not so much a painful and oft dramaticeffort to measure up to a standard which you think your soul sets you, or I forinstance set you, or which your group brothers are expecting you to achieve andwhich you have accepted. Yet it seems to elude you and you do not feel that youhave made the grade. Yet you have not failed as badly as you are apt to think inmoments of depression.Why think so much about yourself at all, my brother? Have you never had quotedto you the lines “Rule out the good self as well as the bad self and let onlyChrist be seen and heard”? You hear so much coming to you all the time from thestruggling personality. It speaks to you so clamorously that the quiet andgentle voice of the soul, bringing radiance and rest, fails to make an impactupon your life.So rest, my brother, and cease this violent struggle. Fall not into the snare ofmany words when again you resume old contacts. Enter into a period of happysilence and inner recuperation. [661] But be as far as possible aself-forgetting person, bringing joy and inspiration to others and ignoring yourreactions with a divine indifference.~BROTHER OF MINE: May 1939You may here rightly ask me: In what way do I hinder? I am not ambitious. I donot make trouble of a group kind; I only make trouble for myself. I try to beloving and kind. I work as hard as I think I should. I love the truth and Iendeavour to meet requirements.All of this may be true, my brother, but these statements do not constitute analibi for what is wrong. The thing that can wreck the building work, which yourgroup is intended to do, is the violence of your reactions and vibrations whenyou are emotionally upset (and this is of frequent occurrence) and the furiousself-assertion whereby you endeavour to justify such violence, and your dramaticself-pity. Unless you can learn to decentralise yourself, and cease thisconstant self-thought and self-commiseration under all circumstances, and stopvisualising yourself at all times as in the centre—yourself as the worker,yourself as the group member, yourself as the sufferer from others’misunderstandings and mistakes, yourself as of importance—and learn to seeyourself as you truly are, you can and do hinder the work and imperil the futureconstructive work of the group. This you know.You love no one truly but yourself. If you loved truly and impersonally, youwould not cause the pain you do to those who love and believe in your capacity;you would be more magnetic and this on a wider scale, for, as yet, you are onlymagnetic to those who recognise your personality and love your personality. Itis from this lack that your work suffers. Yet it could so easily all be changed,if you learnt that divine indifference which you need—indifference to yourselfand to your personality interests, likes and dislikes, indifference to yourcares, anxieties and successes. You would then be in a position, really, tosense the importance of the work, the uniqueness of your opportunities at thistime, and your really strategic position. But you are too full of fear and ofself-interest and so fail to [662] make the needed impact upon those who needyour help. They get the impact of your cares and fears and your demand to beliked. Can you change this? I am telling you nothing new. Among the chelas in myAshram, you are in the position of the naughty, wilful child, for your errorsand faults are those of a child and are not adult faults at all. You dream in achild’s dream world.You must grow up, my brother, for the world needs adult workers at this time andyou can meet the need; you can do great and good work; you can make a soulimpact upon those around you; you can cease from being a destructive agent andbecome a constructive worker. But this will only be possible if your likes anddislikes, your personality determinations and affections, your feeling and yourphysical ailments fade out of the picture and only the world’s need remains andthe longing to meet it—as you can . As, I repeat, you can. I and the group needyou.I offer you neither suspension nor the opportunity to resign. I ask you to facethe issue and make good. Fight this matter out and fight it out alone. Learn tokeep the things which concern yourself to yourself—a thing you have never yetlearnt. Do not let your group brothers down by resigning or by a violentexplosion—the repercussions of which must hurt and damage. Face life steadily,like an adult who has learnt in the school of wisdom, that the trend of allthings is good. Handle life with love as a member of the New Group of WorldServers.NOTE: This disciple is still fighting out the battle but no indication has yetcome from the Tibetan that the victory is sufficiently gained to warrant moreactive work in the Ashram. R.R.R. is still outwardly inactive in relation to thegroup.~TO J. S. P.September 1937BROTHER OF MINE:I have deferred giving you your personal instructions until this time as thequiet process of your integration in my group has been going forward withsuccess. I felt it wise to wait. You [663] have had the difficult task of beingadmitted into a group which has been functioning as a unit for some time, andthe amount of reading matter which you have had to master and the rhythm towhich you have to adjust yourself has made your task a most difficult one. Yourexperience in group work, your open-minded attitude to other people, and thefact that (subjectively) you have belonged to this group ever since itsinception has greatly helped. You have stepped into a position which has beenyours subjectively for a long time. I am mentioning this persistent innerrelation to me and to your group brothers so that you may realise that you haveonly to establish the outer links. The inner are already forged.The life of the disciple moves forward through moments of crisis. These crisesproduce two results:1. The intensification of aspiration, if the disciple is still upon theProbationary Path, or the intensification of illumination if the disciple isnearing the Path of Accepted Discipleship, or is upon the Path itself.2. The achievement of a more stabilised attitude of detachment, based uponconscious personality renunciation, upon a right orientation of the personalityto the soul (who is the one Master, the Light of Life) and to the Hierarchy ofServers. They will, therefore, produce an increasing power of control by thesoul—the One Who knows no attachment and Who stands at-one with all souls in allforms.Such moments of crisis and of intensification, added to renunciation, have beenyour lot for years, have they not, my brother? They have swept your wholepersonality into an attitude of withdrawing from the things of the senses and toan earnest approach to the world of reality. In your life, since you came intoincarnation this time, there have been four such moments, in the majorsense—each of them preceded by a period of one-pointed aspiration, of painfuland oft agonising detachment from all that the personality held dear. Each ofthem produced a subsequent reaction wherein it seemed that all was dark, andthat aridity and stern struggle were the curious and undesirable result ofsacrifice and of a recognised high point of illumination.[664] For you, as for so many disciples in this particular life cycle, thelesson has been to learn to move forward in spite of the activity of the pairsof opposites, paying no attention to the reactions of the senses and standingfree and unafraid whether the experience being undergone is one of high importand of spiritual satisfaction, or is one of the “dead-level” happenings, wherenothing brings joy and where only pain, fear and suspense are to be found. Youmust learn to move forward steadily between the pairs of opposites, saying toyourself: I am not this; I am not that; eternally, I am the Self .These lessons you are learning (and learning with rapidity). You have nowreached a point where you can learn them in a group—a group of fellow discipleswho are undergoing the same experiences, who are oriented in the same direction,who are occupied with the same problems, and who are motivated by the samedesire to serve. This means that you travel not alone, but are supported andsustained and strengthened by your group brothers. Those working in these groupswill tell you that in spite of the difficulties and oft the increased problemsof the spiritual life—the results of a renewed consecration and a more clearlydefined service—the “comradeship of the Path” and the inspiration and love ofthe group do most certainly constitute a powerful help and bring a sense of lifeand love which negatives the ancient loneliness, and offsets the old solitarysuffering.Carefully follow the work of the Full Moon Approach, for it will bring you muchand you should enter, through its means, into closer contact with the innerspiritual Sun, the soul, and with all of us who, in our varying grades ofdiscipleship, seek to serve our fellowmen. This Full Moon work involves the useof the creative imagination, the cultivation of the power to visualise, theintensification of the magnetic vibration of the ajna centre, and consequentlyof the pituitary body. This establishes a magnetic field for the interplay ofthe currents and energies which are brought into action by the activity of thehead centre and of the pineal gland. These higher forces are brought in andutilised in the meditation processes followed by all the group.I have nothing to say in connection with your life of service and activity. Thatwill go on naturally, and as ever in the case [665] with all true aspirants,must be rendered with no thought of self but in an effort to meet the need ofthose within your environment who look to you for help—physical, emotional andmental—but always with a spiritual intent.I will make some suggestions as to your personality problem, and I will outlinefor you some meditation work. I use the word “suggestions” advisedly, for Iwould have you realise from the very beginning of your work that I never givemore than a hint or a clear suggestion, or point out a possible line of action.I suggest a mode of training and of meditation and then leave each of you freeto accept the suggestion and to conform to the outlined ideas as may seem bestto you.I seek to give you a hint as to your ray influences, so that certain attitudesof mind and expressions of feeling-perception may be clarified for you. The fiveray potencies which constitute your problem (and, with the soul, constitute alsothe mechanism of service through which the monad manifests), provide your fieldof opportunity and your main avenue of knowledge in the world of humanexpression.Your soul ray is the second ray.Your personality ray is the sixth ray, as you may have often suspected. Thiswill link you closely by similarity of vibration with your brothers, D.H.B. andD.I.J.Your mental body is governed by the fourth ray, producing that love of art andliterature which distinguishes you, and providing also that field of conflictwhich characterises your entire life. Harmony through conflict is the keynote ofyour life, with the soul ever aware of the basic harmony, but with thepersonality registering the conflict more definitely and more aware of thestrife and the difficulties. Ever the mind has sought to control; ever the soulhas endeavoured to carry increasing illumination, through the mind; ever thepersonal lower self has resisted that illumination and control. Is this not so,my brother?Your astral body is closely linked with your soul and governed by the secondray, thus making for you the line of least resistance in this life. For you, theline of feeling-intuition, of astral-buddhic approach has been the way. It isright here that the fourth ray problem of your mind has its major difficulty[666] and this for the following reason: In this life your major vibration runsalong the line of 2-4-6, producing the intensification of your second rayqualities and indicating the need for some balancing factor. The difficulty ishelped, however, and the problem aided towards solution by the fact that yourphysical body is on the seventh ray, which brings in the vibration of the firstray line of energy, 1-5-7. This is of great assistance to you. Upon the physicalplane, therefore, you have the task of balancing this preponderance of secondray attributes, qualities and rhythm.Your rays, therefore, are:1. The ray of the soul—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.2. The ray of the personality—the sixth Ray of Devotion.3. The ray of the mental body—the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict.4. The ray of the astral body—the second Ray of Love-Wisdom.5. The ray of the physical body—the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Order.You will find this of deep interest and, if rightly appreciated, it will producefruitful development in your life.I suggest that you do the following meditation for a period of three months andthen take up the group meditation. I have made your personal meditation verybrief so that when you take up the group meditation it can constitute apreliminary exercise.1. Continue with the simple breathing exercise you are now doing. It is of valueto you in producing inner alignment and the harmonising of your bodies.2. Then, by an act of the will, withdraw the consciousness into the head andthere visualise the inner radiant sun, formed by the merging of the lesser lifeof the personality with the radiant light in your soul. At the very centre ofthis life see the Self, the inner Christ or Buddha. Then focus your thought,without effort or strength, in this centre.3. Next sound the O.M., breathing it out through the personality and carrying:[667]a. Light to the mind.b. Peace to the astral body.c. Strength to the physical body.4. Finally, as the soul and the personality together , sound the O.M. again,once audibly and once inaudibly, thinking as you do so of the need of the worldand the power of the soul to meet that need, through the medium of aspirationand discrimination.5. Continue then with any meditation such as you may feel the need of doing.Have in the background of your consciousness the three words: joy, stability andthe Plan.~MY BROTHER AND MY COMRADE: March 1938I have not much to say to you at this time for I gave you full and longinstructions and several suggestions in the last communication. I would ask youto continue to study them and to go on pondering on their significance and theirimplications. There is much in them which you have not had the time toassimilate, for I gave you much, knowing that you could stand the pressure of mysuggestion.You have made good progress in linking up with your group brothers. It is not aneasy task to work in a group which has been functioning for some time and hasalready achieved a measure of subjective integration, but your group brothersare close to you and the consciousness of this fact is steadily growing in yourmind.It may be of assistance to you and complete the information given in your firstpersonal instructions, if I were to indicate the points of contact through whichyour soul and your personality primarily work:1. In this incarnation, your ego or soul is seeking expression through yourastral body. There lies for you the line of least resistance. This establishedcontact will rapidly transmute sixth ray devotion into universal andnon-critical love. It will give you what I might call horizontal inclusivenessas well as vertical one-pointedness. Ponder on this. [668]2. Your personality force is focussed in your seventh ray brain. This gives youthe power to plan, to organise, and also the power to give form to ideas. Ponderalso on this.I would call your attention anew to the three key words, Joy, Stability, and thePlan; during the past year there have been many occasions when the Way of Joyhas been for you a hard way to go. Yet it is one of the needed characteristicsof discipleship, leading—as it does—to soul strength; it is an essential qualityfor all those second ray people who are oriented particularly to treading, atsome future date and after initiation, the difficult way of all world saviours.It is valuable for you to distinguish between a World Saviour and the worldsaviours. I have given you here a deeply esoteric hint.Stability or steadfastness, which is the power to stand unmoving in the centreof your environment and in the midst of changing circumstance, will be testedout in you this year. To stand this test, your soul is challenging you. When,therefore, the need for quiet and poised strength arises and there come thosemoments when powerful action seems desirable or violent protest or words aredeemed advisable, stand in steadfastness and recollect the need for poise, forpatience and the desirability to await right indication of the way to go and theneed for speech or for silence. This waiting will often change the direction ofyour intent and no action will then be taken but only that steady vision whichsees the inner side and not the outer happening.Go in peace, my brother, and learn anew the comradeship of the Path.~MY BROTHER: February 1939The tension of fear is great in the world today. People everywhere are livingunder great strain. Forget not that it is the few in every land (and when I say“in every land” I make no exception) who bring about world evil. But I wouldhave you remember also that the will of the masses of the people unless misled,is towards good and understanding. I am talking here in connection with worldaffairs. Stand steady, therefore, and permit no thoughts of hatred and fear tofind lodging in [669] your mind. Stand firmly for good, looking for it in allpeoples and races and thus seek to swell the rising tide of those who aspire toright human relations, knowing that the potency of love rightly expressed isgreat and is—at this time—the only factor that can offset hate.In connection with this point, I would call your attention to the instructionsgiven to D.I.J., for in them I refer to the similarity of your problems withhers and with those of D.H.B. You can, through this similarity (which is inducedthrough the similarity of your rays), reinforce and strengthen each other andproduce a triple unit of energy which will be of service to your group brothers.You three can from certain aspects meditate together each day.I would ask you that you take as your special work that subject which is todayof such interest to you—the idea of death and proving the fact of immortality.Survival, my brother, has been proved. This has been the great task and the realachievement of the spiritualistic movement throughout the world. Immortality,however, has not been proved.When you have further steeped yourself in the subject, approaching it inhappiness and in the spirit of service, I will give you later some ideas uponwhich you might work. I will not do so now as I want you to read and thinkthrough into a greater clarity of vision and a clearer perception of what it isyou are seeking to undertake. One reason why you can do this work is that allyour rays are along the line of building and of religion. You can, therefore,approach the scene in a far more detached manner than if your rays were purelymental or along the line of the first ray which is the ray that always bringswithdrawal and abstraction and is the ray of the destroyer or of death itself.Ponder on this. There is a connection with the first ray aspect which is will,and that of death. Death is now the result of the will of the soul. Eventuallyit has to be the result of the united will of the soul and the personality andwhen that happens there will be no fear of death. Ponder also on this.One of your problems in connection with all spiritual and meditational work isto avoid becoming too abstract; spiritual achievement for you in this life willcome through the blending [670] of the highest possible point of spiritualrecognition with your enlightened mind and your physical brain consciousness.The keynote of this is, of course, alignment. Have this thought of alignment inyour consciousness as you proceed with the following meditation:1. Sound the Sacred Word audibly, regarding yourself as the physical man andholding the thought of physical coordination.Interlude wherein you take six long slow breaths, thinking as you do so aboutcoordination.2. Sound the Sacred Word then inaudibly, regarding yourself as theastral-emotional man, holding whilst you do it the thought of the purificationand the transmutation of desire.Interlude wherein you seek definitely to raise your consciousness higher and,whilst you are doing this, taking seven long slow breaths.3. Sound the Sacred Word inaudibly again, pondering this time upon the mind asthe reflector of the light of the soul and endeavouring to hold the mind steadyin that light.Interlude wherein you aspire to soul consciousness whilst taking ten long slowbreaths, raising your consciousness as high as you can.4. Sound the Sacred Word this time as the soul, realising that the attention ofthe soul is definitely turned to the personality and that it seeks to controland dominate the personality.When doing the slow breathing, endeavour to sit erect without tension, and seeto it that at no time, when inhaling, you inflate the abdomen, but that theabdomen is held drawn in towards the spine below the diaphragm.My blessing rests upon you, my brother. In these hard days remember with joythat the Hierarchy of spiritual forces stands .NOTE: This disciple is still presumably active in the Tibetan’s Ashram and closeto Him, but has disappeared in the chaos of the European war."},{"pageContent":"SECTION THREE — THE SIX STAGES OF DISCIPLESHIPINTRODUCTORY NOTES[673] 1. The stage wherein a disciple is contacted by the Master through anotherchela on the physical plane. This is the stage of “Little Chelaship.”2. The stage wherein a higher disciple directs the chela from the egoic level.This is the stage called a “Chela in the Light.”3. The stage wherein, according to necessity, the Master contacts the chelathrough:a. A vivid dream experience.b. A symbolic teaching.c. A using of a thoughtform of the Master.d. A contact in meditation.e. A definite remembered interview in the Master’s Ashram.This is definitely the stage of Accepted Disciple.4. The stage wherein, having shown his wisdom in work, and his appreciation ofthe Master’s problem, the chela is taught how (in emergencies) to attract theMaster’s attention and thus draw on His strength, knowledge and advice. This isan instantaneous happening, and practically takes none of the Master’s time.This stage has the peculiar name of a “Chela on the Thread” or sutratma.5. The stage wherein the chela is permitted to know the method whereby he mayset up a vibration and call which will entitle him to an interview with theMaster. This is only permitted to those trusted chelas who can be depended uponnot to use the knowledge for anything except the need of the work; nopersonality reason or distress would prompt them to use it. At this stage thechela is called “one within the aura.”6. The stage wherein the chela can get his Master’s ear at any time. He is inclose touch always. This is the stage wherein a chela is being definitelyprepared for an immediate initiation or, having taken initiation, is being givenspecialised [674] work to do in collaboration with his Master. The chela at thisstage is described as “one within his Master’s heart.”There is a later stage of still closer identification, where there is a blendingof the Lights, but there is no adequate paraphrase of the terms used to coverthe name. The six stages above mentioned have been paraphrased for occidentalunderstanding and must in no way be considered as translations of the ancientterms.SIX WORDS FOR DISCIPLES1. Recollection, resulting in concentration.2. Response, resulting in an interaction between higher and lower.3. Radiation, resulting in a sounding forth.4. Respiration, resulting in creative work.5. Re-union, resulting in the at-one-ment.6. Re-orientation, resulting in a clear vision of the Plan.THE SUBLIMATION OF THE FIVE HUMAN STAGESStage I.The life has climbed the stairway long through daily use of form. Through thelesser three, with progress slow, the long path has been travelled. Another doorstands open now. The words sound forth: “Enter upon the way of real desire.”The life, that only knows itself as form, enshrouds itself in vivid red, the redof known desire, and through the red all longed-for forms approach, are graspedand held, used and discarded, until the red changes to rose and rose to palestpink, and pink to white. Forth flowers then the pure white rose of life.The tiny rose of living life is seen in bud; not yet the full blown flower.Stage II.The picture changes form. Another voice, coming from close at hand uttersanother phrase. The life continues on its way. “Enter the field where childrenplay and join their game.” Awakened to the game of life, the soul passes thegate.[675] The field is green and on its broad expanse the many forms of the onemoving Life disport themselves; they weave the dance of life, the many patternedforms God takes. The soul enters “the playground of the Lord” and plays thereonuntil he sees the star with five bright points, and says: “My Star.”Stage III.The way of red desire fails. It loses its allure. The playground of the sons ofGod no longer holds appeal. The voice which has twice sounded from out the worldof form sounds now within the heart. The challenge comes: “Prove thine ownworth. Take to thyself the orange ball of thy one-pointed purpose.” Responsiveto the sounded word, the living soul, immersed in form, emerges from the manyforms and hews its onward way. The way of the destroyer comes, the builder andagain the tearer down of forms. The broken forms hold not the power to satisfy.The soul’s own form is now the great desire, and thus there comes the enteringof the playground of the mind.But in these dreams and fantasies, at times a vision comes—a vision of a foldedlotus flower, close petalled, tightly sealed, lacking aroma yet, but bathed incold blue light.Orange and blue in some more distant time will blended be, but far off yet thedate. Their blending bathes the bud in light and causes future opening. Let thelight shine.Stage IV.Into the dark the life proceeds. A different voice seems to sound forth. “Enterthe cave and find your own; walk in the dark and on your head carry a lightedlamp.” The cave is dark and lonely; cold is it and a place of many sounds andvoices. The voices of the many sons of God, left playing on the playground ofthe Lord, make their appeal for light. The cave is long and narrow. The air isfull of fog. The sound of running water meets the rushing sound of wind, andfrequent roll of thunder.Far off, dim and most vaguely seen, appears an oval opening, its colour blue.Stretched athwart this space of blue, a rosy cross is seen, and at the centre ofthe cross, where four [676] arms meet, a rose. Upon the upper limb, a vibrantdiamond shines, within a star five-pointed.The living soul drives forward towards the cross which bars his way to life,revealed and known.Not yet the cross is mounted and, therefore, left behind. But onward goes theliving soul, eyes fixed upon the cross, ears open to the wailing cries of allhis brother souls.Stage V.Out into radiant life and light! The cave is left behind; the cross isoverturned; the way stands clear. The word sounds clear within the head and notwithin the heart. “Enter again the playground of the Lord and this time lead thegames.” The way upon the second tier of stairs stands barred, this by the soul’sown act. No longer red desire governs all the life, but now the clear blue flameburns strong. Upon the bottom step of the barred way he turns back and passesdown the stairs on to the playground, meeting dead shells built in an earlierstage, stepping upon forms discarded and destroyed, and holding forth the handsof helpfulness. Upon his shoulder sits the bird of peace; upon his feet thesandals of the messenger.Not yet the utter glory of the radiant life! Not yet the entering intoeverlasting peace! But still the work, and still the lifting of the little ones.DISCIPLESHIP AND PAIN“The sons of God, who know and see and hear (and knowing, know they know) sufferthe pain of conscious limitation. Deep in the inmost depths of conscious being,their lost estate of liberty eats like a canker. Pain, sickness, poverty andloss are seen as such, and from them every son of God revolts. He knows that inhimself, as once he was before he entered prisoner into form, he knew not pain.Sickness and death, corruption and disease, they touched him not. The riches ofthe universe were his, and naught he knew of loss.“The lives that enter into form along with lives self-conscious, the deva liveswhich build the forms indwelt by all the sons of God, they know not pain or lossor poverty. [677] The form decays, the other forms retire, and that which isrequired to nourish and keep strong the outer, lacks. But lacking also will andplanned intent, they feel no aggravation and know not clear revolt.”A word about pain might be in place here, though I have naught of an abstrusenature to communicate anent the evolution of the human hierarchy through themedium of pain. The devas do not suffer pain as does mankind. Their rate ofrhythm is steadier although in line with the Law. They learn through applicationto the work of building and through incorporation into the form of that which isbuilt. They grow through appreciation of and joy in the forms built and the workaccomplished. The devas build and humanity breaks and through the shattering ofthe forms man learns through discontent. Thus is acquiescence in the work of thegreater Builders achieved. Pain is that upward struggle through matter whichlands a man at the Feet of the Logos; pain is the following of the line of thegreatest resistance and thereby reaching the summit of the mountain; pain is thesmashing of the form and the reaching of the inner fire; pain is the cold ofisolation which leads to the warmth of the central Sun; pain is the burning inthe furnace in order finally to know the coolness of the water of life; pain isthe journeying into the far country, resulting in the welcome to the Father’sHome; pain is the illusion of the Father’s disowning, which drives the prodigalstraight to the Father’s heart; pain is the cross of utter loss, that rendersback the riches of the eternal bounty; pain is the whip that drives thestruggling builder to carry to utter perfection the building of the Temple.The uses of pain are many, and they lead the human soul out of darkness intolight, out of bondage into liberation, out of agony into peace. That peace, thatlight and that liberation, within the ordered harmony of the cosmos are for allthe sons of men.FROM THE OLD COMMENTARY“The assuaging waters cool. They slowly bring relief, abstracting form from allthat can be touched. The quivering [678] fever heat of long repressed desireyields to the cooling draught. Water and pain negate each other. Long is theprocess of the cooling draught.“The burning fire releases all that blocks the way of life. Bliss comes andfollows after fire, as fire upon the waters. Water and fire together blend andcause the great Illusion. Fog is the product of mist and steam and noise,veiling the Light, hiding the Truth and shutting out the Sun.“The fire burns fiercely. Pain and the waters disappear. Cold, heat, the lightof day, the radiance of the rising sun and perfect knowledge of the Truthappear.“This is the path for all who seek the Light. First form, and all its longing.Then pain. Then the assuaging waters and the appearance of a little fire. Thefire grows, and heat is then active within the tiny sphere and does its fierywork. Moisture likewise is seen; dense fog, and to the pain is added sadbewilderment, for they who use the fire of mind during the early stage are lostwithin a light illusory.“Fierce grows the heat; next comes the loss of power to suffer. When this stagehas been outgrown, there comes the shining of the unobstructed Sun and the clearbright light of Truth. This is the path back to the hidden centre.“Use pain. Call for the fire, O Pilgrim, in a strange and foreign land. Thewaters wash away the mud and slime of nature’s growth. The fires burn thehindering forms which seek to hold the pilgrim back and so bring release. Theliving waters, as a river, sweep the pilgrim to the Father’s Heart. The firesdestroy the veil, hiding the Father’s Face.”DISCIPLESHIP AND ITS ENDThere is a curious and ancient Atlantean chant which is no longer used but inthose far off times was chanted by the initiate who took the thirdinitiation—the consummating initiation of that period. It goes as follows. Thetranslation of the symbols in which it was written necessitates the loss ofrhythm and potency.“I stand between the Heavens and Earth! I vision God; I see the forms God took.I hate them both. Naught do [679] they mean to me, for one I cannot reach, andfor the lower of the two I have no longer any love.“Torn I am. Space and its Life I cannot know, and so I want it not. Time and itsmyriad forms, I know too well. Pendant I hang betwixt the two, desiring neither.“God from high Heaven speaks. There is a change. I hear with ear attentive, and,listening, turn my head. That which I visioned, yet visioning could not reach,is nearer to my heart. Old longings come again, yet die. Old chains of glamoursnap. Forward I rush.“Myriads of voices speak and halt me in my tracks. The thunder of the sounds ofearth shuts out the voice of God. I turn me on my forward path, and vision onceagain the long held joys of earth, and flesh and kin. I lose the vision ofeternal things. The voice of God dies out.“Torn again am I, but only for a little time. Backward and forward shifts mylittle self, e’en as a bird soars into heaven and settles back again upon thetree. Yet God, in His high place, outlasts the little bird. Thus do I know thatGod will victor be and later hold my mind and me in thrall.“Hark to the joyous paean that I chant; the work is done. My ear is deaf to allthe calls of earth, except to that small voice of all the hidden souls withinthe outer forms, for they are as myself; with them I am at-one.“God’s voice rings clear, and in its tones and overtones the little voices ofthe little forms dim and fade out. I dwell within a world of unity. I know allsouls are one.“Swept am I by the universal Life and as I sweep upon my onward way—the way ofGod—I see all lesser energies die out. I am the One; I, God. I am the form inwhich all forms are merged. I am the soul in which all souls are fused. I am theLife, and in that Life, all little lives remain.”These words, chanted in the ancient formulas on peculiar and selected notes,were most potent and brought definite results in certain ancient ceremonies thathave long since died out. [680]PART IThe world today is going through a preparation period and an interlude ofadjustment to the new world and the new order which is coming into being. Thisnew world is verily a new creation and with its activities the Masters are todayengaged, working as always through the medium of Their disciples. In thispreparatory period, the Masters are today occupied, among other things, withpreparing disciples for constructive work for service and eventually forinitiation. They are consequently occupied with forming new groups of discipleswho can gradually be integrated into existent groups and be available for worldservice. It is planned to do this on a large scale because of world need and thewillingness of the world aspirants to take the personal risks, incident to thispreparatory work.There are certain very simple rules to which I would refer and which form afoundation of truths which you already accept as necessary to all spiritualadvancement. These are the accepted requirements and are recognised as presentin all whom the Masters take in hand and weld into Their groups for service.They are:1. The recognised need to tune in, as far as the individual aspirant can, onworld need as it is gradually emerging. It must be borne in mind that therequirements for those who will work at this bringing into being the new worldwill be of a different nature in many ways from the past. This must be carefullyborne in mind. The world need must be approached mentally and spiritually andnot emotionally. So many aspirants and would-be disciples are emotional; theyshrink from the facing of existent facts and approach problems from their ownpreconceived ideas of service and their own established idealisms.2. The achievement of a finer sense of values. Rest, amusement, idleness,argument and criticism have no real place in a disciple’s life for the next fewyears. A sane handling of the physical mechanism will be required, plus a divineindifference to personal feeling and health reactions. Complete dedication tothe meeting of human need; [681] utter consecration to the Plan; intelligentcooperation with all whom you recognise to be senior disciples; adequate care totake right action in circumstances so that your efficiency is not impaired; theconservation of energy through silence and through that constant radiation whichis based on self-forgetfulness—that is what is asked of the disciple in theworld today, this is what the Hierarchy expects and this is what will eventuallyopen the door of initiation. That door has to be opened more widely at this timeby the accepted disciples of the world so that more and more of the human racemay more easily enter. Self-interest will not open it.3. The development of a fluidity of mind and attitude which will recognise thefact that—though the Plan stands—techniques, presentations, idealisms andmethods must necessarily change. This is not an easy thing to do. The Plan, as Ihave outlined it to you in the past, was but a skeleton outline and simply anunderlying basic structure. It was the steel scaffolding of the new world-to-beas regards that part of it which you could aid in materialising.It is not easy for the average person to be fluid and to change details andmethods in relation to that which has been taught in the past and about which hehas evolved definite and distinct ideas. Are you, therefore, prepared to throwthese overboard and work in the way which will meet the new world need under thenew incoming influences?The disciple upon whom the Master can most confidently depend is the one whocan—in periods of change—preserve that which is good and fundamental whilebreaking from the past and add to it that which is of immediate service in thepresent. An attitude of spiritual compromise is right, needed and very rare tofind. Most of the things about which there may be argument and contention amongdisciples concern methods and relative non-essentials; they deal with points oforganisation. They are not so important as the inner unity of vision and theability to concede where no wrong is involved and where a fellow worker fails tosee the point. Disciples need to see to it that they do not hinder by any formof self-assertion, [682] or by the imposition of their own ideas or by anyauthoritarianism, based on past procedure. Ponder on this. The disciple who issure that he is always right and who is confident that his interpretation ofwhat is needed is infallibly correct and that others must be moulded intocooperation with his planned procedures can greatly hinder the good work. Thetask of the modern disciple is to sense need and then to meet it and this,again, is part of the new emerging technique of invocation and evocation.The life of a disciple is a gradual but steady moving in towards the centre, andaccepted disciples are definitely a part of the Hierarchy. The Hierarchy is aplace of fusion of all souls upon the higher levels of the mental plane. Just inso far as a person comes under soul impression, then soul control and finalidentification with the soul, just so far does he move towards the centre offusion. As your love for humanity increases and your interest in yourselfdecreases, so will you move towards that centre of light and love where theMasters stand in spiritual being.Later, we will consider the various stages of discipleship but in the meantimeit is of value for you to focus your attention upon the relation of theHierarchy to all accepted disciples. It is just because you are beginners thatthe whole subject evokes your deep interest. The beginner is full of questionsupon all sorts of subjects. The trained disciple is so pre-occupied with thePlan, so infused with love for his fellowmen that his entire orientation istowards the service of the Plan and not towards his own individual progress ortowards the Master. The closer he gets to the centre and towards the Master, theless attention the Master pays him and the less he is occupied with thinkingabout the Master. In the early stages, he perhaps necessarily thinks much abouthis relation to the Hierarchy, to the Master and to his own soul. In theintermediate stage, he is occupied with the achieving of a sense of proportionand a right inner adjustment so that “he faces two ways and each way sees thesame vision.” In the final stages when he is the disciple who is also theMaster, his consciousness is absorbed into the will of the Creator; his attitudeis one of unchanging love and his work is that of radiation—[683] a radiationwhich evokes activity in others, initiates a response from his fellowmen andcarries the Plan the next step forward in meeting the immediate need ofhumanity.In this creative work to which I have referred above and to which all disciplescan contribute, the work and the task of the Masters is to project into theworld those thoughts and those formulated divine ideas, those concepts andsignificances which embody—at any one time—the immediate Plan for humanity. AMaster, therefore, searches for those minds which are sensitive to this Plan. Heis not primarily occupied in looking for people who are good—so-called.Self-forgetfulness and straight kindness means ever harmlessness and thatconnotes the utmost good. He seeks for those types of people who can respond inunison to that aspect of the Plan for which the Master is responsible and forthose who can be taught to subordinate their personalities to its requirements.They have no selfish purposes and desire nothing but only to aid the Master andthose senior disciples who may be working under His supervision at some aspectof the Plan. This involves, as I have pointed out, their training in adaptation,in the recognition of true values, in fluidity of ideas, and selfless work fortheir fellowmen.A Master’s group is not a place wherein disciples are taught to make theirpersonality adjustment and soul contact. It is not a place where characterdiscipline is imposed and right relations established between the personnel of agroup of junior or senior disciples. The rules for instituting soul control areancient and well-known. They have to be practised for long periods before thestage of accepted discipleship is reached. The contest with the lower nature andthe building in of the needed qualities which are essential to the world workerare the normal theme of life experience and, therefore, humanity in itsintelligent brackets is constantly and steadily undergoing this training. Thecapacity to work in collaboration with others at some directed piece of work isa part of the evolutionary process itself and is inevitable. I want to makeentirely clear to you that the practices of a purificatory nature and thecultivated right habits of thought which are the major undertaking of anaspirant’s life are not the major undertaking of the disciple. [684] They areregarded as incidental and foundational; they concern the handling of thepersonal self and are the task of the individual soul and are carried forwardunder soul supervision and not under the supervision of a Master. What,therefore, is the contribution and work of the disciple?The group of every Master is distinguished by its thought content, contributedby the disciples and used by the Master in His work for humanity. Therefore, thethought life of every disciple must be conditioned by three factors:1. By its power. This is dependent upon right spiritual instinct, rightunderstanding and interpretation of ideas and correct formulation of theseideas.2. By its purity. This grows naturally out of a growing capacity for unlimited,non-separative love, clear vision and the unimpeded flow of soul force.3. By its correct precipitation. This precipitation of thought is due to clearlydirected intent, to comprehension of the purpose for which a group of disciplesexists, and an increasingly intelligent participation in the Master’s creativeactivity.The group of a Master is a focus of power, built up by the Master in three ways:1. By the potency of His Own thought life, evoked by His response to the unitedhierarchical purpose and a growing ability to respond to Shamballa.2. By His ability to integrate the centre of power (His group for which He hasmade Himself responsible) into the immediate activity of the Hierarchy.3. By His wisdom in His choice of collaborators. His group of disciples will beeffective in world service and useful to His Superiors just in so far as Heemploys judgment in gathering together the men and women whom He is preparingfor initiation.I use the word “initiation” here because I want all disciples who read my wordsto realise that initiation is not something which they undergo as a result ofany training which they may receive from a Master or because they have reached acertain [685] stage of advanced evolution. It is a process of continuingintegration into centres of force, i.e., into a Master’s group, into theHierarchy as a whole and consciously, and—as disciples attain adeptship—intoShamballa. You can see, therefore, that a Master can be greatly hindered oraided in His work for humanity by His choice of disciples. They should ponder onthis fact because in so doing the process of decentralisation will proceed morerapidly and their love and service will consequently increase with a parallelingcertainty and surety.I would have all disciples grasp this clearly and so get into theirconsciousness the idea of contribution , watching their thought life with care,so that there may be in it that which will increase the potency and purity ofthe ideal which at any time is dominating the group and which will be of such aquality that it will precipitate that “pool of thought” with which all disciplescan be in rapport and entitled to use.I would have you also remember that a Master’s group is a centre of energy intowhich the disciple is precipitated and that its effect upon him, as apersonality, is eliminative and evocative. Those two words cover the life ofevery disciple. They are singularly descriptive of what is happening tohumanity, as the process (so long foretold) of externalising the Hierarchy andrestoring the Mysteries upon the outer plane, is slowly proceeding. TheHierarchy is essentially the group of the Lord of the World; it is His Ashram.In this statement lies the enunciation of a relatively new truth as far as humanknowledge is concerned. Before the Hierarchy can work more openly and withfuller recognition by mankind, there must be the elimination of all hate and allsense of separateness and the evocation of good will and right human relationsas the result of the activities of all disciples. The widespread recognition ofthe evil of the present war and of errors in every national policy make itpossible eventually to produce a general attitude which will clear the way forthe needed right adjustments. It is the same process of awakening and ofconsequent strife which disciples experience in their individual lives and whichprepare them for the stage of accepted disciple.The vortex of force into which the disciple is plunged (by right of his owneffort and the decision of his Master) gives him [686] a needed training in thehandling of those energies which are the substance of all creation, thusenabling him to contribute to the creation of the new world. There is always anew world in process of forming ; the keynote of the work of every disciple canbe summed up in the familiar words: “Behold, I make all things new.”PART IITwo questions always arise the moment the stage of discipleship is discussed:the problem of occult obedience and the nature of the vision. I would like todeal with these right at the beginning of any help which I may be able to giveyou. What is this occult obedience which a Master is supposed to exact? Today,the Masters are dealing with the highly mental type of disciple who believes inthe freedom of the human will and consciousness and who resents the impositionof any so-called authority. The intellectual man will not accept anyinfringement of his freedom, and in this he is basically right. He objects tohaving to obey. This is today axiomatic. Out of this fundamental question,lesser ones arise which I would like to cite. Has the disciple to obey theslightest hint which the Master may give? Must every request and suggestion beaccepted? Must all that a Master says be accepted as true and infalliblycorrect? Is the disciple wrong when he refuses (if he does) to recognise theMaster’s point of view and the statements He may make? Will the fact of AcceptedDiscipleship limit his freedom of opinion or choice, coerce his judgment andmake him simply a replica in thought of the Master’s thought? These arequestions of importance.The obedience required is obedience to the Plan. It is not obedience to theMaster, no matter what many old-style occult schools may say. The obediencewhich is asked of you is based on your growing recognition of the Plan forhumanity, as it emerges in your consciousness through the processes ofmeditation and through definite service, based upon a growing love of yourfellowmen.The obedience demanded is that of the personality to the soul as soul knowledge,soul light and soul control become [687] increasingly potent in the mind andbrain reactions of the disciple. This whole problem of occult obedience wouldnot arise at all if the rapport between soul and personality or between thedisciple and the Master was complete and soundly established. The entirequestion is based upon the blindness and lack of knowledge of the disciple. Asthe rapport becomes more firmly established, no fundamental divergences ofopinion can appear; the aims of the soul and the personality blend and fuse; theobjectives before the disciple and the Master become identical, and the grouplife conditions the service rendered by both of them. It is, therefore, thelimitations of the disciple which prompt the question and his fear that too muchmay be asked of him by the Master and his soul. Is this not true, my brother? Itis the holding on to your personality interpretations, wishes and ideas whichleads you to draw back from the word obedience. It is your liking for yourselfand for your own point of view which—literally and factually—makes you afraid ofa too prompt acquiescence in the known suggestions of the Masters. I would haveyou remember that suggestion is all that a Master ever makes to a disciple, eventhough He may make positive statements about human affairs. These statements maybe entirely correct; the neophyte, however, is usually too blind or prejudicedby his own individual point of view to accept them. Obedience can only berendered when there is a developed understanding and an inclusive vision; ifthat is lacking, the passing of time will adjust the matter.This brings up the question of the vision, its nature and extension. Is thisvision, which must exist before the disciple seeks admittance into a Master’sgroup, a gradually unfolding process or an unconscious remembering of somethingonce sensed and seen? Here lies the crux of the problem. Let me explain. Thevision is a symbolic way of experiencing revelation . The gradual unfoldment ofeach of the five senses brought a steady emerging revelation of God’s world anda constantly extending vision. The development of sight brought a syntheticaptitude to focus the results of all lesser visions brought to the point ofrevelation by the other four senses. Then comes a vision, revealed by the“common sense” of the mind. This [688] demonstrates in its most developed stageas world perception where human affairs are concerned, and frequently works outin the vast personality plans of the world leaders in the various fields ofhuman living. But the vision with which you should be concerned is to becomeaware of what the soul knows and what the soul sees, through the use of the keyto soul vision—the intuition . That key can only be used intelligently andconsciously when personality affairs are dropping below the threshold ofconsciousness.I would ask you: How much of your present so-called vision is dependent uponwhat others have seen and how much you discovered for yourself by climbingarduously and earnestly the Mount of Vision and (from that eminence which youhave arrived at alone) looking out over the horizon towards the next peak ofattainment for humanity? A disciple becomes an Accepted Disciple when he startsclimbing towards the vision, towards the mountain top; he can also registerconsciously what he has seen and then begins to do something constructivetowards materialising it. This, many throughout the world are beginning to do. Aman becomes a World Disciple in the technical sense when the vision is to him animportant and determining fact in his consciousness and one to which all hisdaily efforts are subordinated. He needs no one to reveal the Plan to him. Heknows. His sense of proportion is adjusted to the revelation and his life isdedicated to bringing the vision into factual existence—in collaboration withhis group.It is, therefore, a gradually unfolding process up to a certain stage. Afterthat stage has been reached, it is no longer the vision which is the dominantfactor but the field of experience, of service and of achievement. Ponder onthis. Some day you will understand. There is both an unconscious deflectiontowards the vision and a conscious orientation towards it. There is one aspectof the vision which is oft forgotten by many disciples. That is thenecessity—inherent in the right appreciation of the vision itself—for each whorecords it to become “bestowers of the vision.” The moment that that takesplace, the whole situation changes. Through the thoughts of all beginners runsthe note of striving after the vision, of searching for it, of ability orinability to contact it and, frequently, [689] the distortion of the vision bydefining it in terms of already imparted truths. The attitude of the neophyteis, therefore, based upon the need for vision, upon individual, personal need.But (upon the path of Accepted Discipleship) the disciple must get away fromthis because it is the path of spontaneous unconscious self-forgetfulness. Thevision, once seen, becomes so important, that how you feel about it and youradherence to it seemingly fades out. You become absorbed in the vision and thisabsorption takes place upon the physical plane. Both mind and brain arepre-occupied with what the soul knows and that is ever vision for thepersonality.I referred above to the existence of disciples and of world disciples. A worlddisciple is a man or woman who has made real progress in the adjustment betweenthe particular and the universal, between the specific and the general andbetween his own sphere of environal conditions and the outer world of needysouls. The problem with which such disciples are occupied is not the adjustmentof relations between the inner spiritual man, the soul and its instrument, thepersonal lower self. Their major interest is how to fulfil the immediatepersonality obligation and, at the same time, produce an effect upon theenvironing world of men because of a strong inner compulsion and the need theyfeel to shoulder the service and the responsibility of their Master and Hisgroup. These men and women are always accepted disciples in the academic senseof the term and are able to render themselves receptive to spiritual impression;they do this, if they choose, at will. They are integrated people from thepersonality angle and susceptible at all times to soul contact. They are not yetperfect, for they are not yet Masters; the fourth initiation still lies aheadfor them but their own imperfections are not their major point of soul attack ortheir major preoccupation; world need and world demand for spiritual and psychicaid rank paramount in their consciousness. They are clear-visioned as to peoplebut they are basically non-critical; the recognition of imperfection isautomatic with them but in no way negates loving understanding and readiness toassist on any level where the need appears to be of importance.[690] World disciples think in terms of groups with a steadily developingmeasure of inclusiveness. Their own group, their own circle of co-workers andtheir own field of service are seen by them in right proportion because they arenot divorced from the environing All . They are active focal points for theForces of Light in the three worlds of human endeavour and are to be found inevery field and school of thought.I am not going to define for you active discipleship as ordinarily understood.Every esoteric student knows its significance, its implications and itsresponsibilities. I seek to develop in you that sense of world need and thatcapable usefulness which will make each of you who read and understand my wordsa disciple in truth and in deed. The primary task of the Masters is to developin Their disciples a world sense which will enable them to see the immediatesituation against the background of the past, illumined by the light ofknowledge of the Plan which always concerns the future—except for those rarespirits who think ever in terms of the whole. The blueprints for the immediateplan are in the hands of the world disciples; the working out of these plansunder the inspiration and help of the world disciples is in the hands of allaccepted disciples everywhere. Neither world disciples or accepted disciples aremystical visionaries or vague idealists but men and women who are intelligentlyand practically seeking to make the ideal plan a factual experiment and successon earth. Such is the task in which all of you have the opportunity to help.Your ability to become world disciples eventually is dependent upon yourcapacity to decentralise yourselves and to forget your personalities. Thisforgetting involves not only your own personalities but also the personalitiesof your fellow disciples and co-workers and of all you meet. It means, also,that in the future you go forward into a greater measure of service, impelledthereto by the fire of love in your hearts for your fellowmen.One factor that should be touched upon here is that frequently discipleshandicap themselves because, not having learnt to forget their personalities,they have an attitude of deep concern over demonstrated past failures and aconsciousness of very real inadequacy. They become over pre-occupied [691] withthe personnel of the group and not with the group soul. You, as disciples, aretoo pre-occupied with the inter-personality relationship and are notsufficiently focussed upon the group-soul and upon the Master, the centre andthe focal point of energy of the group. If you would reject all criticism, ifyou cultivate the joy of relationship and seek ever to participate together inwhatever spiritual blessing may be outpoured for the helping of the world, ifyou seek to contact the Master as a group, if you are in a position to know yourgroup, and if you tune out all anxiety as to success or non-success in theapportioned service, you would greatly aid in the task with which the Master ofany group is confronted. The needed fusion can always take place among discipleswhen they meet on the level of the soul and when the service to be rendered isthe dominant factor and not so much the how of rendering it; for this eachdisciple is independently responsible.The Master does not train a group of men and women to be good and obedientdisciples, carrying out His wishes and working out His purposes. He is trainingthem eventually to take initiation and become Masters themselves and He neverloses sight of this objective. You, as disciples, have, therefore, to learn tohandle force and to draw energies into the destined area of service and this isa fact you must constantly have in mind. Disciples are chosen by the Masterbecause, in spite of any or all personality limitations, they respond in theirindividual measure to the immediate vision of the united Hierarchy and to themethods which They propose to employ in materialising this vision. Thehierarchical vision (as far as you can understand it) is the response of theMasters to the higher impression to which They are subjected and to which Theyaccord Their assent according to ray and not according to point of development.The Master recognises those who recognise the Plan and are trying (with full orwith qualified dedication) to help bring it about. He then stimulates them as agroup, because they have identity of vision and dedication; this enables them,under that stimulation and inspiration, to become more effective in the chosen(self-chosen) line of service. I would have you, therefore, ponder carefullyupon the following recognitions: [692]1. The recognition of the vision.2. The recognition of the Plan, for vision and Plan are not the same.3. The recognition which the Master accords to a group of dedicated aspirantswhen He accepts them as His disciples.4. Your recognition of the Master’s ideas as goals to future endeavour.5. Your recognition of each other as souls and servers.When these recognitions are properly understood, there will then be eventualrecognition, by the Hierarchy, of a group of disciples who can be used as achannel through which spiritual energy, light and love can be poured into aneedy and agonising world. The group will then be endowed with power to servebut it will not be power given to it by the Master. It will be a potency whichit has engendered itself. This power which disciples wield comes as a responseto a life rightly lived and love fully given. There is a great law which can beembodied in the words “to those who give all, all is given.” This is true of theindividual disciple and of a Master’s group. Most aspirants to discipleshiptoday do not know or realise this law; they do not give freely and fully eitherto the work of the Hierarchy or to those who need. Until they do, they limittheir effectiveness and shut the door on supply, not only for themselves but forthe group with which they are affiliated in service. Herein lies responsibility.The clue to supply is personality harmlessness and the dedication of allindividual resources to the service of the Great Ones, without restraint andspontaneously. When you, as a disciple, try to live harmlessly—in thought andword and deed—and when nothing is held back materially, emotionally or from theangle of time, when physical strength is so given and the gift of all resourcesis accompanied with happiness, then the disciple will have all that is needed tocarry on his work and the same is true of all working groups of servers. Such isthe law. Perfection is not yet possible, it is needless for me to say, butgreater effort on your part to give and serve is possible.The time will, therefore, surely come when you will, as individuals and as partof a Master’s group, subordinate your [693] personal lives to the need ofhumanity and to the intention of the Master. You will be and not struggle sohard to be; you will give and not fight constantly the tendency not to give; youwill forget your physical bodies and not give so much attention to them (and theresult will be better health); you will think and not live so deeply in theworld of feeling; you will sanely and wisely and as a normal procedure put thework of the Master and of service first.What is that work? To provide a working intelligent and consecrated group ofservers through whom hierarchical plans can be carried forward and todemonstrate, upon the physical plane, a focal point of spiritual energy. Thiscan then be employed by the Hierarchy to help humanity everywhere, particularlyin this time of crisis. The plans of the Hierarchy, as they embody the will ofShamballa, can be and are carried out; the process, however, is either aconscious one or an unconscious mass response to impression. Among the disciplesof the world, the response and subsequent activity is a conscious one and leadsto intelligent undertakings.The task of the Master is to evoke from His disciples such a depth ofconsecrated love and such a realisation of today’s opportunity that thepersonality aspects of their lives will fade out in their consciousness andtheir main pre-occupation will be: What must be my service at this time? Whatare the non-essential things in my life to which I should pay no attention? Whatis the task to be done? Who are the people I can help? Which aspects of theMaster’s work should I endeavour to give the most help at this time? Thesequestions must all meet with a balanced, intelligent and non-fanatical responseand answer.PART IIIIn considering this whole subject of discipleship there are certain things ofwhich I would like to remind you. If you will reflect upon them you will findthey may change somewhat your idea of what constitutes discipleship but theywill also enrich your general concept anent this subject.The first point which I would like to bring out is that accepted disciples arein training for initiation. If, when they [694] approach the Path ofDiscipleship they fail to grasp this fact and to give the fullest cooperation,they postpone the time of that initiation. Their grasp of the fact will bedemonstrated in the intensity of their proffered service. Planned service is oneof the modes of the training. Disciples in the early stages of their work areapt to be primarily interested in themselves and in their own reactions andattitudes to the Master. The fact that they are working in a Master’s groupseems to them the fact of paramount importance.The second thing which I would like to point out is that there is a greatdifference between a Master’s group and His Ashram. This is seldom realised.Many people can be found in a Master’s group but the personnel of His Ashram ispicked out of that of the group. In a group, the Master is in touch with andaware of the aspiring disciple and he has had a definite contact with Him, butthis has involved a personality as well as a soul relation. But in an Ashramonly that is to be found within the sphere of influence of an Ashram which is ofthe soul. Nothing of the personality is allowed to enter in—personalityreactions, disabilities, limitations, personality thoughts and all that ismaterial and connected with the lower nature, never reaches the Ashram at all.In the early stages, therefore, of a disciple’s work, it is possible that thereis little or nothing that the disciple will be able to contribute of any kindfor a long time. Only those positively sensed intuitions and those definite soulimpressions and impulses which the disciple may succeed in evoking (throughmeditation and growing purity of intention) can contribute anything to the lifeof the Ashram. There is consequently a law which protects the Ashram from yourlimitations. I have been using the word “Ashram” quite definitely in my effortto lead you to discriminate between a group and an Ashram. An Ashram isbasically formed of those who through their knowledge, devotion and service haveworked their way out of a group into an inner centre where the Master’s energy,wisdom and effort is more easily available. In order to work their way from thegroup into the Ashram, disciples will need most carefully to discriminatebetween their high grade personality inclinations, their [695] responses totruth and ideals and their true soul reactions, spiritual wisdom and intuitiveperception.The third point which I would like to bring out is that disciples when they formpart of an Ashram are subjecting themselves to a greatly increased pressure andare in a position to participate in much wider distribution of energy thanheretofore. Today, as the Coming One nears the earth and draws closer tohumanity, and as the inflow of spiritual energy from Shamballa into thehierarchical Centre becomes greater, there is a great keying up of humanreceptivity and a greatly augmented stimulation is taking place with varyingeffects. This involves an intensified aspiration and spiritual determination. Italso signifies an opportunity of an unprecedented nature.You have been told that when the Buddha came and worked on earth, many aspirantsentered the ranks of accepted disciples and many disciples took one or other ofthe major initiations. There was, therefore, a definite shift of the personnelof the Hierarchy and a great expansion towards Shamballa and, at the same time,towards humanity. When the Christ made His appearance on earth, there was asimilar and still greater climaxing effort which culminated in the inclusion ofdisciples in the Masters’ inner Ashrams. Hitherto, these Ashrams had been keptfor those who had taken the first initiation. Before the time of Christ onlythose who had taken the first initiation and were initiate formed the Ashram.Owing, however, to the growing sensitivity of humanity, it was then decided thatdisciples could be admitted into the Ashrams and so be mentally and astrally enrapport with the inner group and begin to form part of the Master’s sphere ofdirected influence.This is the opportunity which is held out today before the aspirants andprobationary disciples. This effort might be termed an externalisation of theAshram. You have been told that it is the intention of the Hierarchy to restorethe Mysteries on earth. This is the first step towards that objective. If thisembryonic externalisation succeeds in functioning and if those participating inthis new effort manage to work with unity, love and understanding, and if thisproves so strong as to withstand all disintegrating forces, then it may bepossible later to increase the membership, power and size of any Ashram. [696]This lies entirely in the hands of the group. Every new person who is put intouch with the Ashram becomes a definite responsibility. The work of integrationand of absorption lies with the Ashram and not with the individual. This is noteasily apparent until disciples are accepted and integral parts of the Ashram.Such disciples constitute a definite problem.The question now arises: How does a Master form and organise His Ashram or innergroup of which the personnel is provided from the outer group of aspirants? Itmust surely be apparent to you that a Master, in forming His Ashram, proceeds asautomatically as does the Creator. He meditates; He visualises; He speaks andthat which He seeks to create and to materialise (in line with the hierarchicalPlan) begins to take form. By the power of His focussed and directed thought, Heattracts to Him those whose type of mind synchronises with His, because of ray,karmic relationships, point in evolution and love for humanity. In the wordsfocus and direction lie the key to any technique or method of contributing towhat I might here call the reservoir of thought which is an Ashram. It is asustained focus, plus a dynamic direction which makes this reservoir of thoughtcontributory to world service and creatively effective. The important thing foran accepted disciple to grasp is what the Master is seeking to accomplishthrough the medium of His group. This entails, finally, the enquiry, in the mindof the disciple, as to whether he thinks, focusses and works along lines similarto that of the Master. How close is the disciple to the Master’s thoughts? TheMaster is prevented by occult law from using any pressure or power in the effortto swing the minds of those whom He is influencing into unison with His. He maynot impose His will upon the disciple; His desires, aspirations and wishes mustnot be the enforced directing agency in the lives of those with whom He is intouch. He may impress their minds with what He feels is needed in periods ofworld crisis. He can express to them what He feels should be done. But itremains for the disciple to decide and prove. Disciples are in a Master’s groupbecause of similarity of ideas, even though they sense and express those ideasfar less clearly than He does and see the vision as through a glass darkly. Buttheir innate convictions are [697] basically the same and their task is todiscover the points of contact, the analogous idealism for the group effort andthen to submerge their entire individual lives and activities in the recognisedeffort. Behind this effort stands the Master—an initiating and distributingcentre of power.Every Ashram or inner group is essentially a reservoir of thought and thatreservoir has for its spring or source, the ideas, dreams, vision and aspirationof the Master. This is impulsed by His monadic potency, influenced by the OneWho is His Master and developed and fed by His experience, unfolded as Hiswisdom grew and His capacity to further the hierarchical Plan had beendedicated, used and increased. Then it becomes a clear pool of thought,augmented and fed from the spring of many lives, from the pure vision andconsecrated dreams of many disciples.To this reservoir of pure thought, every pledged disciple is asked to make hiscontribution and, if he can do so, it will enable the Ashram to meet the needand help every aspirant to pass off the Probationary Path on to the Path ofAccepted Discipleship. Every centre or focus of power has a definite sphere ofinfluence and a true, active Ashram is a positive force within the centre whichwe call humanity.The disciple now naturally and rightly questions how thought power and spiritualinstinct are related, how they can work constructively and how theirinterdependence demonstrates. I wonder how I can make the idea clear to you? Letme first call your attention to the fact that it is instinct which leads adisciple to respond to a Master’s call or note, to His vibration and to Hisgroup. Instinct, in its early stages, is the name given to the response of thematerial mechanism to its environing material world—the three worlds of humanevolution. Later, upon the evolutionary ladder, the mind appears as aninterpreting agency and the nature of the mechanism and of the environment isslowly understood. The relationships become clarified. Spiritual instinct is thecapacity of the soul to register contact with the Hierarchy of which the soul isinherently a part, just as in the body a man’s mechanical, instinctualresponses, reactions and reflexes are an integral part of the materialmechanism. In the case of the spiritual instincts, [698] it is the intuitionwhich interprets and illumines the mind. The power of thought as employed in thework of the Ashram is dependent upon the power of the disciple to focus andraise the conscious mind, to contact the soul and evoke the intuition. When thathas been successfully done, then comes the unison of the three factors: mentalillumination, soul impulse and intuitive perception. This triple combinationwill produce that type of thought which will be effective in activity,productive of the Plan, conducive to selflessness and motivated by love.According to the ability of the group, as a whole, to function under the impetusof the spiritual instinct will be the success of the Master to carry out Hisplans through the medium of the group. Under divine law, He may not work alone;He cannot work alone. He can inspire, teach, ask for cooperation and giveguidance as to the needed work. Beyond that, no Master may go. In this worldcycle, the work of the Hierarchy is conditioned by the disciples, and they canwell understand, therefore, why the last fetter cast off by a Master isirritation! No initiate can form a true Ashram until all capacity tomisunderstand, to express irritation and to criticise has vanished. The power ofthought of a Master, if misused, could be a potent destructive force. He must beable to trust Himself before His Ashram can run on right lines and with safety.In this work of assembling the necessary thought power for constructive work,the etheric web is definitely involved. It leads then to a re-organisation ofthe web. Academic explanations do not help the student to understand this. Whenthe mind (the instrument of thought) is the vehicle of soul life, soul light andsoul love, and the etheric web is responsive to the inflow of energy from themind, then the re-organisation of the individual etheric web takes place. Theindividual etheric body is only a part, an aspect, of the etheric web ofhumanity; the steady reorganisation of the many parts leads to a transformationof the whole, when enough time has elapsed.The medium through which this takes place is the Mind . The mind creates orformulates those thoughtforms (or embodied energies) which express, upon themental plane, the measure of the disciple’s understanding of the Plan, and his[699] ability to convey the embodied mental energy to the etheric body—unimpededby the emotional nature or by any lower upsurging desire.The etheric body is a web of light energy, impulsed or motivated by the type orthe quality of the energies to which it responds, from the angle of evolutionarydevelopment. It might be stated that:1. Unevolved or savage man responds simply to prana or physical energy,vitalising the appetites of the lower nature, developing the instincts and thuslaying the foundation of a physical vehicle as the outer garment of the soul. Atthis stage, intellect is embryonic; the physical appetites and the five sensesare dominating factors. All this is due to the activity of prana as it poursthrough the etheric or vital body.2. Average man is impulsed by desire which is an energy, emanating from worlddesire and which—developing or organising the astral body—generatesdesire-energy. It pours into the vital body and galvanises physical man intothose activities which will lead to the satisfaction of desire. This is aparallel process to the work of prana, impelling the animal instinctive natureinto activity. These necessarily parallel and produce conflict—the first clash(within the man) of the pair of opposites. Gradually, the pranic energy becomesautomatic in its activity; the shift of the consciousness is into the astral ordesire body and the functioning of the instinctual nature drops below thethreshold of the consciousness. Man then focusses his life in the astral vehicleand his etheric body becomes animated by the potent inflow of desire-energy.3. The developed man, with an integrated personality, gradually brings theetheric body under the control of mental energy and his physical plane activityis not then so much implemented by instinct or desire as by thought energy,dedicated to and expressing the nature of the man’s plan. This plan indicatesincreasingly his intelligent desire—selfish in the early stages, complex anddualistic in the intermediate stages but slowly responding to the world plan andto the divine intent for humanity. [700]4. Finally, when the power of the Triangles (the spiritual name given in TheSecret Doctrine to the soul) is being imposed upon the personality, then theirenergy supersedes the other energies and the personality—focussed now in themind and responsive to soul impression—expresses upon the physical plane,through the medium of the physical brain and the body, the intent, potency andnature of the all-inclusive soul.The individual etheric web galvanises the automatic physical body into activity.The energies, controlling the physical body through the medium of the ethericweb, are the four mentioned above. The conflict in the brain consciousness ofthe evolving human unit begins to assume importance when the man starts torecognise these controlling energies, their source and their effects.It is immediately obvious that the work of the disciple is, therefore, almostentirely within the realm of energy and forces. The study of occultism is thestudy of forces and of their origin and effects. An Ashram is a place whereinthis study enters the laboratory or experimental stage. The disciple is supposedto be in process of becoming aware of the forces and energies which conditionhim as an individual; these originate within himself and produce changes andspecific effects in his life-expression upon the physical plane. When he knowshimself to be the “Life and the lives” (as The Secret Doctrine puts it), a sumtotal of forces and a controlling energy, then he can be a world disciple andwork significantly in an Ashram.It will be apparent to you, therefore, that when a disciple enters into anAshram and works in closer relation with his Master than heretofore, he beginsto collaborate as far as is in him with his fellow disciples; then you have (interms of occultism) a repetition of the relation between the “Life” of the group(in this case, the Master) and “the lives” (in this case, the disciples), of thecentral energy and the responding forces. From the Master’s angle of the groupproblem, duality enters into the group expression. He, the central energy, mustwork through the forces. From the angle of the disciple, a force (which ishimself) is brought into relation with other forces; [701] it must, at the sametime, become responsive to an energy, that of the Master. This response comesthrough the recognition of identity of purpose, of origin and of nature, but notidentity in the field of expression. You can see, therefore, that an Ashram is,indeed, a very vortex of forces, set in motion by the many types of energywithin the ring-pass-not of the Ashram itself. The basic principles of dualismmake themselves felt as the energy of spirit makes its impact upon soul forceand personality force. Forget not that a Master expresses monadic energy, whilstdisciples in His group are seeking to express soul energy and are doing so, insome measure, through their love and service. To this soul energy, they addpersonality force which arises from their being, as yet, focussed in thepersonality life, even whilst aspiring to soul consciousness. Herein lies theirusefulness from the Master’s point of view and herein lies their difficultyand—at times—their failure.Disciples within the Master’s group or the Master’s Ashram have a potent effectupon each other, for everything in their nature is accentuated. The Master hasto watch carefully to see that He does not unduly stimulate the disciples’vehicles through the very fact of His relation to them.The individual disciple has, therefore, to watch the effect of three groups ofenergies which all make an impact upon him:1. Those within his own nature (physical, emotional and mental) and those whichcome to him from his own soul.2. Those which make an impact upon him as they come to him from other members ofthe Ashram or group. This effect will be dependent upon his being detached wherehe himself is concerned and thus responsive to what comes from them. The occultlaw is that the more you love the more you can respond to and include the pointof view, the nature and the force of your fellowmen. This is vitally true alsoof a group of disciples. What protects most disciples from too great asensitivity is their pre-occupation with themselves and with their owndevelopment. [702]3. Those transmuted forces which come to the disciple from the Master or aredefinitely transmitted to him by the Master.The goal for all work done by disciples, either in group formation or in theAshram, is the expression, within the group, of the causal creative process.This is summed up in the words which I have already quoted to you “the Life andthe lives.” You have the analogous idea and its sequence of effects in therealisation that the Master (spirit or Monad) reflects Himself in or inspiresthe disciple (soul) and the latter is thus enabled to demonstrate soul activityupon the physical plane.I would like to consider in greater detail the nature of a Master’s group,sometimes called an Ashram . It might be valuable if I endeavoured to define anAshram to you and so leave you with a clear idea of the difference between aMaster’s particular group, and the many outer groups which, though working underHis inspiration and upon the Plan, are not definitely and technically HisAshram.An Ashram is a subjective fusion of individuals and not of personalities,gathered together for service purposes. It is a blending of individual activityinto one whole—a whole which is united on objective and vision but which may(and frequently does) have differing methods and techniques. The work of theAshram is essentially the presentation to the world of those service purposeswhich are carried forward as seems best to the individual disciple, under the“impression of the Master” and with the cooperation of His group. A group ofdisciples is not pledged to do the same type of work in the same way and at thesame time. They are pledged to work under the inspiration of their soul, astheir souls may direct and dictate, strengthened by contact with the Master andwith each other. They are related to each other through identity of vision andof vibration, plus mutual respect and complete freedom—particularly the latter.As you ponder on this, I would ask you to realise that an Ashram is not a groupof people, working under the tutelage of some Master. This is an important pointto remember. It is—as said earlier—a magnetic point of tension, a fusion of[703] energies, directed towards a common centre and involving two magneticfactors:1. A united urge towards group formation upon the mental plane. This is thehigher correspondence to the herd instinct of the animal world and of the worldof men, but is of a spiritual nature and quite differently motivated. The lowerherd instinct is motivated largely by the instinct of self-preservation; thehigher by the recognition of the immortal nature of the soul, and by theinstinct to serve even with the sacrifice of oneself. The law of “death untolife” controls. When the magnetic pull of the group is adequately strong, thencomes the death of the personality life. Until, therefore, the group ofdisciples in all its parts expresses this outgoing sacrificial urge, it is notan Ashram.2. The magnetic pull of the positive centre at the very heart of the group ;that means the magnetic pull of the Master. As you well know, theoretically atleast, at the centre of the Ashram stands ever the Master, or else an initiateor a world disciple. His task is to blend and fuse the energies, tendered andproffered by the group (under the urge to serve) and to indicate the field ofservice. The mode of this instinctual activity is called occult obedience andthis is voluntarily rendered and unitedly followed. When any group—working inthis way under a Master—is moved by one spiritual impulse and functions throughone firm organisation (like electrons around the positive nucleus in an atom),the potency of the group will become immediately effective and not before.I would at this point indicate to you that the so-called inner Ashram is to theouter group what the soul and its vision is to the individual disciple, workingin his personality vehicles. It is the place of interior resort. Disciples can,therefore, grasp their growth towards fusion as an Ashram (in process ofphysical exteriorisation) by the development of their spiritual recognition ofthe inner group potency and their facility to contact the Master—both asindividuals or in group formation.One of the things which a Master has to do is to teach His disciples to studyand register truthfully their usual point of [704] daily focus. This constitutesthe true introspective training, and when followed sanely and wisely leads tothe realisation of the true, persistent, inner level of consciousness; itfosters also a recognition of the need to overcome limitation (frequently notthe limitations usually registered) and the necessity for breaking the barriersimposed by the personality. This whole process might be summed up in thefollowing words: The purpose of the Ashram and the training which it gives is toenable the disciple to live truly on every plane which he has succeeded inopening up to his consciousness. It is important to remember that no one isintegrated into an Ashram until he has pierced beyond the confines of the purelypersonal levels of awareness; until he is sensitive to the ray and quality ofthe Master of the Ashram, and until he is normally soul conscious. Theachievement of this involves great responsibility, and it is the shouldering ofthis responsibility which brings about the first indications of what I mightcall “ashramic consciousness”—a consciousness devoid of self-interest and alwayspre-occupied with the essentials of spiritual living.The primary pre-occupation of chelas at the beginning of their technicaltraining is of a very varied nature and the Ashram life is usually merely aninteresting background for daily experience and not the factor of importancewhich it should be, and not the main interest in the foreground of theconsciousness. The necessities of daily living, the many and diverse familycontacts, the resentments against life and its impacts, a dislike of criticismand of being misunderstood, the many problems of character, the pressures ofpsychic unfoldment and the pettinesses of circumstance frequently loom so largethat awareness of the Ashram and its life is only an occasional inspirationinstead of a fixed habit of life. The ability to make comparisons to thedetriment of others (particularly of one’s own fellow disciples or of one’s owncircumstances), the fear to let go and throw all one is and has into the life ofthe Ashram, foreboding as to the future and a host of mental thoughtforms, plusundue attention to the cyclic life of the physical body, present the Master withan appalling picture of the liabilities with which He is confronted. The factorof the attitude of the Master is one which disciples are very [705] apt toforget because they are so basically interested in themselves and in theirreactions and problems.It might here be noted that disciples in an Ashram are primarily occupied withworld affairs. As a group they are pledged to world work; as individuals, theyare learning so to work. Would-be disciples need to distinguish between theeffect (magnetic and dynamic) of the group and the conscious effort which thegroup may make, under united desire and the direction of the Master, to reachthe minds of those directing world affairs and world happenings. The outerhappenings are, to a certain point, predictable; they are the precipitatedeffects of hidden causes which lie deep in the subconsciousness of humanity.These can be noted and (up to a certain point) offset or stimulated by the grouppotency. This is one of the major tasks of the Hierarchy. The Masters work inthe light and in the realm of causes. Disciples are as yet necessarily involvedin the world of effects and, therefore, of illusion. To work dominantly with thefocal points of spiritual energy upon the outer plane immediately involvescertain factors:1. A deep unerring love which “sees” in the light. Love is truly the revealer.2. The power to withdraw completely, as individuals and as a group, from theworld of physical reactions, emotional biases, and to work purely on mentallevels. There the disciple is focussed in his lower mind, but consciouslyoriented towards the soul and is becoming increasingly sensitive to theintuition and towards the vision and the Plan, as well as towards the group souland to the Master—all in this order of response.3. Next follows the power, as a group, to formulate the desired thought-effectin such a manner that it will reach the mind or the soul of those you seek tocontact, to project the thoughtform, built in such a way that it will be of thetype and quality needed to evoke response, and so meet the need of those thedisciple is seeking to help and strengthen. The projected thoughtform willembody the light and love, as well as the idea of the group in conformity withgroup vision.[706] For how many is this kind of work possible? Not many, as yet. Disciplesare usually more pre-occupied with their desire to help than with the scientifictechniques of helping. They need to take the desire for granted and then forgetabout it. I would ask all disciples at this time to make it their major effortto see the vision clear; to recognise, and know for what they are, those who arein high position, guiding humanity and whose responsibility it is to leadhumanity out of slavery into freedom. Aid them with love because they are wherethey are through their individual destiny and the guidance of their souls. Lifemust be seen truly and faced as it is—not realistically from the worldstandpoint but realistically from the standpoint of the soul, whose vision islong and inclusive and who sees life as it is.The acceptance of facts is one of the first duties of a disciple. In the task ofaiding humanity, as a part of the Master’s group or Ashram, the fact that thereare men and women placed in positions of power to carry out the divine plan isone of the first to be faced. This must be done uncritically, avoiding constantrecognition of their limitations, with an understanding of their problem, withrealisation of the call of their souls to yours and the pouring upon them of aconstant stream of “loving understanding.” They are more advanced disciples thanyou are—little as this may be realised. They are—consciously orunconsciously—under the “impression” of the Masters; there is little that theaverage disciple can do for them in moulding their thought or in shaping theirdecisions. I refer of course to the leaders of the Forces of Light upon theouter physical plane. But disciples and aspirants can surround them with aguarding wall of light and love; they can refrain from handicapping them withthoughts of criticism which can swell the tide of criticism which the worldlyminded pour out upon them. As to attempting to reach and influence the leadersof the forces of materialism, I would ask you to refrain. It can more easily bedone because the personality of the disciple will provide an open door ofapproach. But they are far stronger than the average disciple and the taskwould, therefore, be one of extreme danger.[707] In the Aquarian Age (which is now so near, relatively speaking), therewill be an externalisation of the inner Ashram upon the outer plane. Disciples,initiates and world disciples will meet for the first time in human history asdisciples , recognising each other and recognising the Master of their group.The inner Ashram is a focus of souls, free and unlimited; the outer Ashram—underthe future Aquarian experiment—will be composed of a focus of personalities andsouls. Limitation will, therefore, exist; responsibility will require consciousrecognition and there will be a necessary slowing down of both action andperception in the outer space-time world.The true Ashram (of which the coming outer Ashrams will be but reflections) isnot for lower concrete mind discussion. It is a focal point of receptivity; itembraces the effort to establish mutual contact through an united recognition ofthe vision, of the esoteric basis of life and the laws governing action. It isnot a place, however, for long and silent meditation processes, for it is apoint of tension where, together, the Ageless Wisdom in its more esotericaspects is discussed, where the nature of soul relationship is recognised andwhere the fusion of auras and the inter-blending of the “Triangles” goes forwardconsciously . An Ashram is the state of mind of a spiritual group. It is a pointof united thought; it is a centre for the clarification of the vision and not ofphysical plane methods of work. As disciples learn to integrate themselves intoa Master’s Ashram, they discover that the first thing they have to do is toestablish a basic harmony between themselves and their fellow disciples and toreinforce the contact between their own souls, the ashramic group and theMaster. Then they learn to comprehend—through discussion and experiment—thenature of the energies which are seeking world expression, and the nature of theforces which must be reduced to powerlessness, if these new incoming energiesare to prove effective in bringing about the desired changes under the Plan.They learn also that there is no weakness and no strength in themselves, asindividuals, which may not be submitted to the group “gaze”; thus they arrive atthe stripping away of all the “veils” which prevent the clear light of the soulfrom shining [708] forth. The goal of all work done in the Ashram of any of theMasters is Truth —on all levels and at all times. As disciples learn thus towork from the point or centre of light, understanding and truth into which theyare being steadily integrated, their exoteric usefulness and effective servicewill be greatly increased; they will—as a group—know what has to be done andfind eventually that it is done.The major task of the Master in the early stages of training His disciple is tobring to an end the period of the disciple’s intense pre-occupation withhimself, with his service, with his reaction to the Master or the promise offuture contact with the Master, with his own ideas anent discipleship and hispersonal interpretations of truth. The Master takes a group of people with fixedideas (which they are entirely sure are correct, being the best and highest theyhave been able to grasp to date) and with the conviction that they have reacheda point where they have registered certain spiritual values and concepts, wherethey have evolved their own formulations of truth and where they are eagerlydemanding the next step. The first thing, therefore, which He has to do is(using a strong and perhaps a strange phrase) to blast them wide open, give thema deep sense of insecurity as to the formulas and symbols of the lower concretemind and so prepare them for the reception of newer and higher approaches totruth. This is frequently brought about by forcing them to question all theconclusions of the past.We have all—disciples and initiates of all degrees—to enter the secret place ofinitiation with a sense of blindness (or loss of direction) and with a feelingof complete destitution. The disciple needs to bear in mind that he has tobecome “a moving point and hence a line”; he ascends towards the Hierarchy andassumes the correct spiritual attitude but, at the same time, he descends intowhat he erroneously regards as the depth of human difficulty and iniquity (ifnecessary), preserving always his spiritual integrity but learning threeimportant lessons:1. The recognition that he shares all human tendencies, good and bad, and henceis able to serve.2. The discovery that the thing which he most despises and fears is the thingwhich exists most strongly in him, but [709] which is as yet unrecognised. Hediscovers also that he has to explore and know these despised and feared areasof consciousness so that they become eventually an asset, instead of somethingto be avoided. He learns to fear nothing; he is all things; he is a human beingbut he is also a mystic, an occultist, a psychic and a disciple. And—because ofall these acquired states of consciousness—he becomes eventually a Master. Hehas “mastered” all stages and states of awareness.3. The uselessness of past attitudes and dogmatic ways of looking at life andpeople (based usually on tradition and circumstance) when they separate him fromhis fellowmen.When he has really learnt these three things, he is initiate.PART IVAs we study the various stages in discipleship through which all must pass, weshall discover that one of the things which happens is the irradiation of thedaily life. This irradiation emanates from the world of meaning in which thedisciple is learning to live consciously and always. One of the problems withwhich the Master is engaged in relation to His group of disciples is to teachthem the deep significance of the familiar and also the importance of the truthswhich underlie all platitudes. This is perhaps the most difficult task of allbecause of the habitual reaction to the familiar and the need to do two things:Prove that the familiar veils an important reality and that by penetrating tothe “world of meaning,” the disciple discovers that he can enter into the firststage of the period of preparation for accepted discipleship.The first stage which we must study is that of “Little Chelaship.” In dealingwith this stage, as with them all, I would remind you that I am approaching thesubject from the angle of what the Master has to do, and not from the angle ofthe disciple’s work. There has been so much written on that subject from theangle of the disciple and so many books put out on the subject that familiaritywith the theme militates against true apprehension. The effort to understand hasbeen focussed upon the disciple and his problems of character and personality.[710] It will not be possible for me to indicate the work in detail. I intendonly to show you as far as is possible how a Master prepares the probationer tostep from off the Probationary Path on to the Path of Discipleship. At thispoint, I would like to point out that I shall be dealing with a period coveringthe stages of discipleship from the first stage to that of adept. At the fourthstage, the disciple emerges out of his Master’s group and becomes what isesoterically called “a fixed aspect of the Hierarchy.” This is a phrase which isnecessarily quite meaningless to you. He comes then under the influence ofShamballa and the mode of preparing people for association with that first majorcentre is very different to that of preparing them for participation in the workof the centre which we call the Hierarchy. The one involves the development oflove and of group consciousness; the other involves the unfoldment of the willand the attainment of the stage to which Patanjali gives the name of “isolatedunity.” This is a phrase which is quite meaningless to any one below the degreeof the third initiation. In this discussion, I shall not be dealing withpreparation for the various initiations and their specific differences. I shallbe dealing with the growth of what is called “ashramic intimacy,” with theapproach of the disciple to the world of souls and to the unfoldment of hisconsciousness in relation to the Hierarchy. I shall be concerned with his growthin sensitivity and his subsequent and consequent growth in creativity—not thecreativity of form as much as the creativity of vibration, its impact upon theworld of men and the consequent later appearance of responsive organisms , incontra-distinction to created forms. I would ask you to reflect upon thisthought.This growth in sensitivity is difficult to understand. The members of a Master’sgroup and of His Ashram have to become increasingly sensitive—sensitive to theMaster and to His pledged workers. You cannot be made sensitive or be renderedsensitive by some type of process or ordered training. Men and women aresensitive, only they do not know it, being so pre-occupied with outer matters,with form life and objective things. Let me put it this way: What you say toyourself and to others—through your spoken words or your life—is so noisy thatit is not easy to be what you are and to be recognised as a [711] spiritualbeing. The Master is guided by what He knows of you in your quiet moments ofaspiration, by what you have demonstrated for years to be your fixed lifetendency and by the manner in which you react at moments of crisis or tension.The task of the Master is to stimulate the disciple to be at all times what Heknows him to be at his highest times. That is a simple and almost childish wayof putting it but it serves to express the general idea. A Master does thisbecause the need of the world for decentralised, forward-looking, loving andintelligent workers is so great, particularly at this time. Many have reachedthe point where they may become sensitive if the loud assertions of personalityare dimmed and the light of the soul is permitted to pour through. Then theMaster can be known and contacted. When you can get away from yourselves andyour personal reactions, your own interpretations, and your personal demands,you will discover for yourselves how and in what manner the Master is seeking toimpress you and the group with which you may be affiliated. You will becomesensitive to that impression. You can then facilitate (as it is called) theactivity of the Master by a profound and deep interest in the esoteric life tothe exclusion of your own and also of the Master’s individuality. There are manyways which can then be revealed which will aid the interplay between you, thedisciple, and the Master.As all the rays are the subrays of the second ray, we shall be primarilyconcerned with the second ray modes of working with disciples; they form thebasis of all the other techniques. The differences which may appear lie in theapplication of processes according to ray type and the utilisation of emphasisupon certain centres. Again, I would ask you to ponder on this phrase because itcontains much information for those who can bring the light of the intuition tobear upon it. I shall be dealing with the relation of a Master and His group tothe individual disciple and not so much with the attitudes and procedures of thedisciple. This, you will note is a somewhat new slant.Basically and essentially, the disciple’s attitude is not really of muchimportance in comparison with the effect of the Hierarchy and its techniquesupon him. The results are [712] inevitable, because they are dependent upon twoimportant factors:1. The first factor is that directed, hierarchical impression is not imposeduntil the man has fitted himself through self-discipline to respond to it andis, therefore, nearing the end of the Path.2. The second is the factor of group response. This means response in twodirections:a. To sensed human need, leading consequently to a pledged life of service.b. To soul impression, leading to spiritual sensitivity.When these two factors are established—even if unknown to the disciple in hiswaking consciousness—the grip of the soul upon the personality becomesirrevocable. Then, and only then, the Master can begin to work and the responsewill be effective, real and lasting.Now let me enumerate for you again the stages with which we shall be dealing:1. The stage wherein the disciple is contacted by the Master through some chelaupon the physical plane. This is the stage of Little Chelaship.2. The stage wherein a higher disciple directs the chela from egoic or soullevels. This is the stage called a Chela in the Light .3. The stage wherein, according to necessity, the Master contacts the chelathrough:a. A vivid dream experience.b. A symbolic teaching.c. The using of a thoughtform of some Master.d. A contact with the Master in meditation.e. A definite, remembered interview with the Master in His Ashram.This is definitely the stage of Accepted Discipleship .4. The stage wherein, having shown his wisdom in work and his appreciation ofthe Master’s problem, the disciple is taught how (in an emergency) to attractthe Master’s attention and thus draw upon His strength and knowledge and advice.This is an instantaneous happening [713] and practically takes none of theMaster’s time. This has the peculiar name of the Chela on the Thread , orSutratma.5. The stage wherein the disciple is permitted to know the method whereby he mayset up a vibration or a call which will entitle him to an interview with theMaster. This is only permitted to those trusted chelas who can be depended uponnot to use their knowledge for anything except the need of the work. Nopersonality reason or distress would prompt them to use it. At this stage, thedisciple is called a Chela within the aura .6. The stage wherein the disciple can get his Master’s ear at any time. He is inclose touch always. This is the stage wherein a chela is being definitely andconsciously prepared for immediate initiation, or—having taken initiation—isbeing given specialised work to do in collaboration with his.... At this stage,he is described as the Chela within the Master’s heart.7. There is a later stage of still closer identification, where there is acomplete blending of the Lights, but there is no adequate paraphrase of theterms used to convey this name.I would have you note that the six stages above mentioned have been translatedand paraphrased for occidental understanding and must in no way be considered astranslations of the ancient terms.Stage I. Little Chelaship .This stage is so definitely exoteric that many people have left it far behind.The first indication that a man has reached that stage (from the angle of theMaster) comes when the “light flashes out” in some one life; thereby theattention of the Master is attracted to the person. It might be said that thepreface to the Master’s interest falls into four parts and it is only when allfour are found present together and simultaneously that this happens:1. The aspirational intent of the man upon the physical plane suddenly succeedsin enabling him to make a soul [714] contact. The moment that that takes placethe light in the head is momentarily intensified.2. The karmic agitation of the man’s life becomes greatly increased and—apartfrom his own individual karma—he, for the first time, consciously takes part inand shoulders a part of the karma of his group. This dual karmic undertakingsets up a veritable vortex of force in the group aura. This attractshierarchical attention.3. The next point is not so easy to explain or grasp. You have been told thatthe soul is in deep meditation for the greater part of the cycle of lives of anyone individual, and that it is only when a fair measure of personalityintegration is set up that the soul’s attention is drawn away from its owninterior considerations and egoic affairs to those of its shadow. When thishappens, the egoic group is definitely affected and the Master (upon the sameray as that of the soul concerned) becomes aware of what is esoterically called“a downward gazing soul.” On the Path of Discipleship, the ego is all the timeconsciously aware of the striving personality and there comes a stage when(towards the end of the Path of Evolution) the soul recapitulates theevolutionary processes of involution and evolution. Soul energy descends andpersonality force ascends and this takes place through a process of consciousdescents and ascents. I refer here to the process which is undertaken by thesoul under hierarchical impulse, and not to that in which the personalityinvokes the soul under the desperate need brought about in the lowerconsciousness by the gradual cessation of desire.4. Gradually the antahkarana is built and in this way the “greater Light and thelesser light” are consciously related. A path of light and energy is establishedor created between these two divine aspects. As time goes on, there appears inthe egoic group what is technically known as the “linking light” or the“bridging radiance.” This is the Path referred to in The Old Testament as “thepath of the just is as a shining light which shineth more and more until the daybe with us.” In the esoteric [715] books it is referred to in the followingterms: “Before a man can tread the path, he must become that path himself.”These four stages have been described in The Old Commentary in the followingterms:“The point of light shines forth. It waxes and it wanes. The point becomes aline through the starting of a vortex and from the centre of the whirling force,there comes a voice—invocative and clear.The One Who sits in silent work, alone and unafraid (because the part is notalone and the group is unafraid) looks down, catches the light, reflects thewhirling force and hears the voice.Then from the silent point of power, a Word goes forth: Be still. Be silent.Know that I am God. The needed work will now begin.Between the Great One and the little striving one, communion is established; theinterplay begins; the mind assumes its rightful place. The Path is surely laid.”When the four aspects of inter-related activity are present, then what might becalled “spiritual habits” begin to form and are steadily established. Theirunited effect serves eventually to attract the attention of the Master. Thecontact is still too feeble and the grip of the soul upon the personality isstill too weak to warrant the Master Himself doing anything directly with theaspirant. The stage is one of pure mysticism and of selfish spiritual purpose.The recognition of group relationship is missing; the knowledge of groupinclination is not present; there is no true, unselfish desire to serve. Thereis only a vague desire for personal liberation, for personal integrity and forpersonal lasting happiness. This has to be changed into group emancipation,group cohesion and group joy.The first stage, therefore, in the training of such an aspirant is to relate himto a more advanced disciple who will lead him gradually onward and give him thehelp he needs. The reason for this is that the disciple is closer to theaspirant, far from perfection himself and is also learning to serve. This stageof development covers the period of occult enquiry and esoteric [716]investigation and usually is spread over several lives. The aspirant at thisstage runs from one teacher to another, according to inclination, opportunityand necessity. He is an example of instability but is carefully watched by thedisciple who has transcended this particular stage of volatility; his task is tosee that the aspirant escapes from this “network of futility,” as it issometimes called, and that he gradually settles down to the later stage ofinterior investigation.During all this period, the Master pays no attention whatsoever to the aspirant.It will be a long time before the aspirant will be admitted into His presenceand make a personal contact. The chela who is supervising this interim stagereports to the Master at rare and widely separated intervals; it is only whenthe aspirant has reached the point where he “can enter into the light of theAngel,” that the Master begins to take over his training. The disciple is now,irrevocably and finally, ready. This takes place at the third stage, that ofAccepted Discipleship.These stages are all of them related to one or other of the initiations. Thisone, called Little Chelaship, is related to the first initiation. Thisinitiation is connected with the physical plane and, for a very large number ofpeople (as I have several times pointed out) lies far behind. All true aspirantshave taken the first initiation. This fact is indicated by their intensivestruggle to grow into the spiritual life, to follow the way of determinedorientation to the things of the spirit and to live by the light of that spirit.I believe that many who read my words will recognise these determinations as thebasic motivation of their lives. This stage is a correspondence to the processof individualisation in Lemurian times and the stage of Little Chelaship issometimes referred to as the “period of the Lemurian consciousness” leading,through the Atlantean stage of a Chela in the Light, to the Aryan stage ofAccepted Discipleship. At this stage, the third and real preparation forinitiation is consciously undertaken, because by then integration has beenstabilised and the man is full grown and mature in his consciousness and isready to subject himself to hierarchical impression without reservation.There is no need further to enlarge upon this preliminary phase, upon the weary,though inspiring path of discipleship. [717] Much has been given out to theworld anent this matter with almost undue emphasis upon purification, serviceand devotion. The reason that I say this is that they should be assumed toconstitute part of the exoteric life expression of all true aspirants. They arenot esoteric causes but exoteric effects of inner attitudes.As we continue our studies on the Stages of Discipleship, I would point out anewthat for the majority of the aspirants in the world and for highly advancedpeople with a humanitarian consciousness, the first stage lies far behind. Manypeople today are “accepted disciples” and that is, as you well know, the thirdstage, and behind them, therefore, lie three experiences:1. The stage of “Little Chelaship”—elementary, testing and disturbing. It issometimes spoken of as the “stage wherein the roots of the man-plant are shaken;the stage in which they (up till now embedded) are loosened and air and lightdisturb the peace of ages. This is the peace of death, the age of stone, thetomb of life.”2. The stage of “Chela in the Light.” About this stage I am now going to speak.3. The first initiation. This initiation ever precedes the stage of accepteddiscipleship. No Master accepts a disciple and takes him into His ashram in whomthe birth of the Christ has not taken place. Saul must become Paul, as theChristian phraseology puts it. The babe within the womb of time emerges into theworld of men and, from the standpoint of complete identification with matter(the mother), he becomes himself and seeks consciously to tread the ways of lifeand to become what he is. This is an esoteric repetition of the physical processof becoming a separate individual. Between the stages of “isolatedindividuality” and “isolated unity” lies one to which the name of “isolatedidentity” is given. It is with this stage we are concerned and its esotericimplications. Isolated unity describes the stage which the Master has reached;isolated individuality is that of the disciple; isolated identity (with thesoul) is that of the disciple up to and including the third initiation.a. Isolated unity is the consummation of the Aryan [718] consciousness. Isolatedidentity is related to the Atlantean consciousness, from the angle of the highercorrespondence.b. Isolated unity is connected with the mental plane, is governed by the fifthRay of Concrete Knowledge or Science, and is a reflection of the will-to-know.Isolated identity is connected with the astral plane, is governed by the sixthRay of Devotion or Idealistic Sensitivity and is a reflection—distorted andunstable—of the will-to-love. Isolated individuality is connected withexpression upon the physical plane, is governed by the third Ray of ActiveIntelligence, and is a reflection—again distorted and unsure—of the will-to-be.On the buddhic plane, the plane of the divine intuition, these lower threeexpressions and their higher prototypes are harmonised and the expansive work ofthe three initiations (second, third and fourth) produces an absorption, afusion and a blending process between the disciple and the soul (and eventuallybetween humanity and the Hierarchy) which prepares for a major contact betweenman and the Monad. When this takes place, the soul, creator of reflection andshadow, is discarded because that point of consciousness has served its purpose.The shattering of the causal body takes place and nought is then left but fullyconscious form and spirit. Until, however, man has taken the higher initiations,he cannot comprehend the significance of the above comments.In connection with this, I would remind you that though I am seeking to trainmany at this time for further expansions of consciousness, I am writingprimarily for the future and for those disciples who, in years to come, willread my words and find their way into the Ashrams of the Masters. The Hierarchybuilds for the future; it is not occupied with the present. All that it does isdone with the intent to open the way into a wider and more expansive world.Humanity is pre-occupied with the things of the present; the Hierarchy isworking and laying plans for the future; Shamballa is engrossed with the EternalNow and with the dynamic life which has created the past, which controls thepresent (the centre of illusion) and [719] with the future. You may perhaps gainsome idea or picture of the conditioning life of Shamballa if you will study thepresent era of human living. In it, people with the Lemurian consciousness,focussed on the past and concerned with the physical plane, are present; peoplewith the Atlantean consciousness, emotional in content and focussed on thepresent, are everywhere to be found; and people who are definitely Aryan intheir state of awareness, mentally focussed and occupied with the future, arelikewise found. The three constitute one race of men and embody the whole ofmankind.PART VStage II. The Chela in the Light.This stage is definitely one in which the consciousness of the probationer isoccupied with the overcoming of glamour and the curing of the distorted, myopicvision of the man who has been immersed in the life of matter or form. He is nowattempting to see the new vision, to control the world of emotional reactionsand to work in a new medium, that of Light.The Masters do not work upon the astral plane. Certain schools of occultismteach that They do, but such is not the case. For Them (having overcome glamourand illusion) the astral plane is non-existent; it is but an illusory concept ofthe kama-manasic type of mind—the mind of the average aspirant. The chela is,therefore, at this stage guarded and guided by someone who is still subject toglamour, but is, at the same time, aware of the ephemeral nature of the astralplane.This stage involves so many aspirants in the world today that (before I proceedwith other matters) I would like to touch upon the nature of the work which theMasters are seeking to do with Their groups of disciples in this hour of worldcrisis. This is a matter of paramount importance to the world from the angle ofthe Masters Themselves. Never forget that in all our discussions and in all youreffort to understand, I am endeavouring to decentralise you by giving you, asfar as I can, the point of view of the Hierarchy, stepping it down until it cancome within the range of comprehension of the average aspirant.[720] As far as these aspirants are concerned, the one thing which the Mastersare endeavouring to bring about is the stimulation of the flame of the spirit inthem so that they may set the world on fire. The fires of judgment and ofsubstance, of karma and its vehicle, matter, are raging in the world at thistime. Fire must be countered by fire, as well you know, and to stop the raginginferno of fire which is today devastating the world, the fire of spirit must beopposed, distributed and effectively used by the disciples of the Masters. Thetask of Shamballa, in relation to the Hierarchy, is similar in nature butexpresses itself upon a higher level. They dispense the ultimate fire of theWill . The fire which must, in the final analysis, be used by the disciples inthe world is the fire of the will-to-love.This fire is not what you think it is. The will-to-love means the love of thegreater Whole and the ability to do that which is needed for the good of thegroup in the right way and with the needed skill in action. It involves capacityfor firm action where need arises, because the disciple has a long range visionand is not misled by the immediate perspective. He works and prepares for thefuture. It is, in other words, the loving intention to fire the entire worldwith the new idea of the “spirit of relationship,” beginning with the disciple’sown self, his family and immediate group. This is the will-to-fire. It would bewell to reflect deeply on these ideas. To bring about and render effective thisfiery stimulation, the disciple must apply the fire to himself and in theensuing blaze see himself as he truly is. The fire of the material aspect (thefire of the personality) is still too prevalent and too powerful in the lives ofaspirants. It renders them harmful. I would remind you that the fire of themental plane (that is, of the mind) is the reflection (and the distortedreflection) of the fire of spirit. Some disciples use only the fire of the mind;in their highest and best moments, they attempt to use the fire of love tooffset the fires of the critical mind but at the best it is no spontaneous flowbut a laborious effort to be nice, to refrain (through drastic disciplining ofthemselves) from uttering the things which their critical minds say or to actupon the opinions they may have formed through the use of the fire of mind. Thisfire is always directed at a brother and the effort to refrain from [721] theuse of this fire inevitably creates a gap or barrier. Among the majority ofaspirants, there is no true love in action but only much personality effort tobe non-critical. Their concentration is upon the recognised and basic need to benon-critical because it is right so to be, and there is a reward for those whoachieve it, but the concentration is not based upon the effects upon others whenthe fire of the mind is let loose with its destroying, burning and damagingeffects.The Masters are, therefore, anxious to “burn up the disciple in the fire of thewill-to-love so that he is set free and the barriers to the inflow of theavataric force may be dissolved.” Why is this? Because it is the disciples inthe world and not the mass of men who today hinder the Coming of the Avatar andrender useless His intention. He dare not come until the disciples and aspirantsin the world bring about the needed changes in themselves, for the reason thatthere would not be “enough of the will-to-love with the fiery essence.” Wherethat will is present two things can take place:1. There can be the needed stepping-down of the inflowing energy which theAvatar would bring with Him so that it can be rendered effective in humanity.2. The Avatar and Those Who are working with Him and under His influence can beprovided with a group which can:a. Respond intelligently to that influence, recognising it and absorbing it.b. Distribute the inflowing energy.c. Interpret to humanity the new impelling forces which are occupied with theprecipitation of the new vision, the new world order and the New Age ideals.There will then be very many chelas in the Light and on the other graded stepsof discipleship.The vision which many have of the influence and work of the Avatar is that of aGreat Appearance which will end all strife, inaugurate the new era of peace andgoodwill, soothe the hearts of the people and lead mankind into realms of beautyand of happiness. He will be the consummation of the [722] wishful thinking ofcountless minds down the ages. He will be the solace of distressed humanity. Hewill sweetly love and quietly deal with His Own people and will sweep the evildoer out of the Earth and prevent him from again molesting the peace of theworld.I tell you that such a picture does not enter into the vision of reality at all.It is based on theological interpretations and human selfishness; it is foundedon the misery of mankind and on the failure of disciples and aspirantseverywhere to grasp the true nature of love and the real vision of thehierarchical Plan.It is the Fire of Love which He will bring; it is the message of thepurificatory fire which He will sound; He will not teach anent the waters ofpurification, as has hitherto been the symbolic imparted truth; He will impartthe fire which burns and destroys all barriers in man’s nature, all separatingwalls between individuals, between groups and between nations. Are you preparedas individuals, as disciples and aspirants to submit yourselves to this fire?When a man becomes a chela in the Light, certain developments take place whichenable him to see the vision more clearly and to know what he must do, for theLight ever reveals. These are:1. The aspirant makes a transition in consciousness from the astral plane to themental and, in effecting this, the senior helping chela gives definite aid andguidance.2. The aspirant learns to distinguish, eventually infallibly, between the pairsof opposites.3. The aspirant becomes aware of glamour as something from which he musteventually free himself and aid in freeing the world.These three stages have been dealt with in a Book of Rules for disciples on theprobationary path. The rule can be roughly translated into modern English asfollows:“The one upon the Way leaps forward, leaving the world of fluid life. He makesthe great transition and leaves the watery way behind. He walks upon the waterand is [723] not submerged therein. A chela with a light leads him by the handfrom light into a greater Light.“This is a Transition upon the lesser way, preparing for a higher.“The one upon the Way becomes aware of this and that. The poles appear. The twoattract his daily life, first one and then the other; betwixt the two he moves.A transformation must be wrought; the two become as one. A step towards unitytakes place. Between the two he forward steps. A chela in the Light throws lighton either side and thus the little one can walk.“This is a Transformation upon the dual way, leading into the Way.“The one upon the Way gazes around and sees life as through a haze. The fogs andmists of glamour rest upon the valleys and the hills of life and these he mustdispel. He must transmute them through the burning rays of radiant light. Achela in the light directs the burning, fiery light which dissipates theenervating fog.“This is the Transmutation. These fires release the hidden light and blend itwith the greater.”It is, therefore, under the guidance of a chela who is far more advanced thanthe chela in the Light (though not yet adept) that the first lessons in thesethree processes are learned. Whilst this is going on, the aspirant remainsunaware of the Master’s interest in him. The Master is receiving regular reports(based on certain charts) from the senior disciple who has the neophyte incharge. It is in this way that many hierarchical relationships are established.When they are once established—through work in the Ashram of a Master and notfocussed upon the physical plane—they are persistent and constitute one of thefactors which produce:1. Hierarchical integrity.2. Eventual close relationship between humanity and the Hierarchy.At this time, there is a great increase in the number of people who are beingthus related and the senior disciples of all the Masters Who take chelas areexceedingly busy with the training [724] of aspirants, as well as with the workentailed by the gravity of the world crisis. The aspirants thus trained are inreality the nucleus of the future world servers, and are consequently of realimportance. The task of those thus engaged falls into three categories; as thesenior disciples and initiates are thus occupied, they are themselves learningmuch. These three categories of work are:1. The establishing of magnetic influence.2. The setting-up of telepathic rapport.3. The making of basic karmic readjustments.The first task which confronts disciples is to arrive at an understanding of thenature of the aspirants for whom they have made themselves responsible and alsoto establish a zone or path of influence, so that they can be definitely usefuland able to communicate with the aspirant. It might be pointed out that, in thepast, such relationships were between soul and soul, and consequently required along period of “bringing through” to adequate recognition in the mind and brainof the aspirant. Today, this method still persists in the majority of cases butmany of these helping disciples are experimenting (under direction of theirMaster) in working directly with the aspirant upon the physical plane, thusinvolving personality as well as soul relation. This constitutes a far moredifficult relationship but is a part of the new process of externalising thehierarchical effort of which all outer Ashrams (which are now slowly forming)are a part. By means of this, the chela in the Light is trained to recognisemembers of the Hierarchy by first becoming aware of disciples more advanced thanhimself and by learning to give due weight to their words and suggestions. Youcan see, therefore, how a great effort is being made to bring the twocentres—Humanity and the Hierarchy—into a much closer rapport and relationship,both objectively and subjectively.All who have, in this life, transitted from the stage of chela in the Light tothat of accepted disciple have established two recognitions:1. A recognition of the senior disciple whom they have discovered “in theLight.” [725]2. A recognition of the Master. This whole question of recognising the Masterwill be dealt with by me later.The consequent developing process of telepathic interplay is one which should bemost carefully studied. All groups of disciples, working in or out of an Ashram,should be in close telepathic rapport and thus provide a training ground for thedevelopment of this type of sensitivity. The first thing that has to beestablished in a group of disciples is love and trust, for without that therecan be no true transference of thought. Where love and trust do not exist, theymust be definitely and consciously developed.A second rule governs this telepathic relationship and this is that all “crisesof criticism” must be most carefully avoided by all disciples if they want tobring about the needed rhythm. In any group of disciples, there are those who donot put “first things first”; they put many things and people before their dutyand spiritual responsibilities; this necessarily gives their fellow disciplesjust grounds (apparently just) for criticism. There are times when criticism isunquestionably a recognition of fact. This means that a criticising disciple hasreached the point where his judgment is so based on love that it produces nopersonality effect in his own life or that of his fellow disciple. It is simplya loving recognition of limitation and only becomes wrong when these undoubtedfacts are used to arouse criticism in the unqualified and provide points fordiscussion. The disciple or aspirant who has glaring faults and who fails tomake the required changes himself creates a barrier which he must in timedestroy by removing all causes for criticism. These barriers prevent freetelepathic communication.An interesting question can he asked at this point and one which shouldunquestionably arise: Is the group of working disciples to be keyed to the noteof the more advanced disciples in the group or is it to be stepped down to agenerally lower average to suit the least advanced? Let us put it in anotherform: Are the least evolved in a group of disciples and aspirants to pull downto their level of work and understanding the more developed? Will they make asupreme effort to measure up to the higher vision and attain to the attitudesand points of view of the more advanced? These questions prove a fundamental[726] problem in all Ashrams and only the chelas themselves can provide theanswer.In the mastering of the task of karmic adjustment, the guiding disciple isgoverned by certain requirements. He must ascertain just what karma must beworked out by the aspirant in his charge, during this incarnation. He must theninduce him to add to this established karma, what I might call “freeing karma.”This is a part of the forcing process to which those who choose the moredifficult way of initiation must subject themselves, voluntarily and by freechoice. The disciple seeks to do certain things in this connection, referringhere to the chela in the Light:1. He works off unavoidable karma as intelligently and consciously as possible.2. He takes on some karma which ordinarily would be precipitated in some laterlife.3. He begins to shoulder some of the general karma of humanity, thus increasinghis own load of karma.4. He begins to work with and to comprehend something of planetary karma, thoughas yet he undertakes no responsibility in this connection. Only after the thirdinitiation does he consciously and as an individual cooperate with the karmicresponsibility of the planetary Logos.I would here like to point out that I am referring to good karma as well as bad.It is the task of the helping disciple to guide the chela in the Light so thathe does adjust his karma. This the senior disciple does by thought impression.All karma, when consciously faced, is precipitated by the power of thought; thisis perhaps the major lesson which the senior disciple has to teach the neophyte.In this way the latter is aided to see “in the light” which falls upon his way,and the disciple who is preparing him for the stage of accepted discipleship isin constant touch with the Master. Thus a triangular relationship is set upwhich is of occult value.If the chela in the Light is truly in earnest and is consciously developing thehigher sensitivity, this stage can be relatively short. Two lives sometimes aresufficient to cover [727] this period. The chela in the Light is one who treadsthe way of what is called “the lesser revelation”—lesser because it is concernedwith the revelation of that which must be done in the personality life; it isnot the way of the higher revelation of divinity and its nature. It is therevelation of that which is already manifested and not of what must bemanifested. Ponder on this. The searchlight of the soul reveals faults incharacter, limitations in expression and inadequacies in conduct. These must beintelligently corrected. In the symbolic charts which the guiding disciplepresents to the Master twice a year, the effort made along these lines isindicated, not the results; it is effort which counts. The results will beinevitable and commensurate with the effort. When these charts (three in number)are geometrically related and superimposed one upon the other, they indicate adefinite ray pattern. Then the Master can gauge the rate and type of developmentand can determine the time for authorising the senior disciple to recommend thestage of accepted discipleship. When the demand of the aspirant, the guidingdisciple’s recommendation, the karmic condition and the note which the Masterregisters coincide in time, then the third stage is reached.I would here again remind you that all these stages are related to work in theAshram and to the life and vitality of the inner group. This group is composed,as you know, of old and experienced disciples and initiates and also ofneophytes in various stages of development and also of disciples, passingthrough the many different stages of the Path. It is these widely differenttypes of active disciples which bring about the inter-relation between the outerand the inner Ashrams, between the objective group upon the outer plane and thevery much larger inner group. This brings me to a question which may quitenormally arise in the minds of those working in the outer group and looselyrelated to the inner group: Is the level of the consciousness of the outerAshram determined by the personnel of that group or by its relation to the wholeAshram of which it forms a relatively small part? When this question is positedby a member of an Ashram, it indicates a definite pre-occupation with thepersonnel of the group and not with the group as an aspect of some Master’sAshram. Disciples need [728] to remember that an Ashram is not confined to a fewwho may know each other and who may even meet together as Ashram members. AnAshram is an international group; it is composed of souls in incarnation and outof incarnation; it is a synthesis of initiates of various degrees and ofaccepted disciples. The Masters do not regard those who have taken the firstinitiation as initiates. This is a point which needs re-emphasis.Disciples who have taken the second initiation are regarded as “probationaryinitiates,” and only when they have taken the third initiation are they trulyinitiate from the standpoint of the Hierarchy. The first initiation is sometimesspoken of as the “Lemurian Initiation” and the second as the “AtlanteanInitiation,” but the third initiation—that of our Aryan race—is technicallyregarded by Them as the first initiation. This is a new angle upon which I wouldask you to think. The term, therefore, of Accepted Disciple covers the stages ofthe first and second initiations; when a disciple has taken the thirdinitiation, he is no longer technically an accepted disciple, even though hestill remains in a Master’s group until he has taken the fourth initiation. I ampointing out these technicalities so that there may be clarity and proportion inyour thinking.An Ashram is, therefore, representative of all stages of unfoldment, from themost advanced to beginners, such as those who read these instructions. The pointof importance to each disciple in an Ashram is whether he can step up hisconsciousness and his conscious response to the ashramic vibration so that hedoes not hinder the planned activities of the Ashram. Must the senior and themore advanced initiate-disciples halt, or wait and step down their activities soas to give the less advanced the time and opportunity to measure up to them ?The question therefore is: Do the senior disciples wait or do the juniordisciples hinder?I would assure you that the standard of measurement is not a dead level and Iwould assure beginners that they cannot hinder the advanced members of anAshram, but that they can throw themselves out of the sphere of activity, thoughnot out of the group. It is the unready and the untrained who do the waiting,not the ready and the truly dedicated.[729] The task of the Master is to stimulate as many as possible in His group towork consistently on levels of spiritual activity, wherein the fire of thewill-to-love may animate and dominate. Frequently, a part of the Ashram is stillstruggling with the first stages in the task of understanding the fires of themind; these must be first comprehended and their fiery essence quenched beforethe fire of the will-to-love can flow through the disciple.The point to be grasped is that the work of the Ashram goes on and disciples andinitiates (whose hearts are aflame) continue to work unimpeded. This covers theindividual reaction to the Ashram personnel. But where all the group are aflamewith love and are living as souls, then the Ashram becomes a vital centre orvortex of force and dynamically effective. The effort of the Masters Who workthrough the method of forming Ashrams is to bring about as rapidly as possiblethis unity of love and intention (will). It is only the beginner who ispre-occupied with his individual effect in an Ashram. The trained, releaseddisciples are more concerned with the task to be carried on and with the work tobe done. An individual disciple may suffer in his personality as a result of thefailure of his group brothers to understand or to arrest the fire of theirminds, but he goes on steadily with the work and his personal effectiveness, asa serving unit, remains unaffected. He knows that some day they will beliberated from themselves. In the meantime, he labours to offset their influenceand to this extent his task is harder, but he knows that they are on the way tounderstanding; he knows too that at present they cannot help but see in him andeven in their Master the very qualities which are dominating them. For, mybrother, we see in others what is in us, even when it is not there at all or tothe same extent. Disciples need to learn the distinction between true analyticalinsight and so-called criticism. A Master does not criticise the members of HisAshram. He seeks to analyse for them the points wherein they may hinder theusefulness of the service of the Ashram. There is a basic distinction betweenthis constructive aid and the criticism which is based on a sense of personalsuperiority and a love of fault finding.[730] Each Master has reached the point where the vision is clear to Him; thisis part of the reward accorded to the initiate. He identifies Himself with it,colouring it necessarily, richly and helpfully with His ray “apprehension,” andinterpreting it in terms of His contribution to the whole. Therein lies thesecret of the inevitable and the unhinderable (is there such a word, brother ofmine?) success of the vision as it is materialised through the combined effortsof the Hierarchy, conditioned in time and space by some Master or group ofMasters, working on some one ray or rays. In the early days of the present cycleof hierarchical effort (between 1925 and 1936), the ray at work upon humanitywas the first ray. The activity of this ray culminated in the declaration of warby Great Britain in 1939, when the destructive force of that ray—misapplied andmisdirected—led Germany to invade Poland. In 1932, the influence of the secondray began to assert itself and will continue to do so until 1945 when theseventh ray will swing slowly into activity. You will then have three raysproducing simultaneous effects upon mankind:1. The first Ray of Will or Power, expending its force.2. The second Ray of Love-wisdom, reaching its meridian and holding the centreof the stage until 1957.3. The seventh Ray of Ceremonial Order, coming into activity in combination withthe other two—the will-to-love and the will-to-order—producing beauty out of thepresent chaos.The disciples, therefore, of the Master Morya, of the Master Koot Hoomi and ofthe Master Rakoczi are reaching out towards a period of the intensest activity.The destiny of the world lies in the hands of Their three groups of initiateddisciples; with Them, the accepted disciples of the three groups are asked tocooperate and this offers opportunity to many everywhere. As they seek to visionthe Plan, to cooperate with the three Masters and Their initiate groups, theiropportunity will emerge. This triangle of energy is held responsible by thegreat Leaders in Shamballa for the regularising of world affairs. More than thisit is not necessary for humanity to know.Forget not, an Ashram is a vortex of force and a centre of energy—a centrethrough which both force and energy flow in [731] order that the vision may bematerialised. This force and energy is, in the last analysis, directed by aMaster, by a group of three senior initiates and by another group of lesserinitiates, thus representing (in each Ashram) a miniature of the planetarygovernment. These step down the inflowing energy so that accepted disciples canhandle it safely and act as distributing agents. The energy with which theMasters work comes from Shamballa; the forces with which They work are providedfrom within the Hierarchy itself, and just in so far as the accepted disciplesreact to the combined forces will it be possible for them to be used in service.In other words: the initiated disciples in a Master’s group focus the inflowingenergies; the accepted disciples, through the medium of their souls, focus theforce which the Master directs outward into the world of men in conformity withthe Plan of the Hierarchy, working in accordance with the revelation, comingfrom Shamballa.Initiated disciples have no interest in anything but the vision, the Plan andits direction and materialising upon earth. Accepted disciples are learning thisand in the meantime have to react to the vision in what I might call a secondhand manner; they are occupied with the Plan and with the distribution of theforces which will materialise it. Thus the entire activity of the Ashram iscoordinated. Newly accepted disciples (who are only learning to cooperate) arevaluable as “agents for experiment.” According to their reaction to the impartedtruths and Plan, according to their ability to sense the need and to bring theneed and the medium of release into relation and according to their capacity towork with the world disciples (who are definitely responsible to the Master ofthe Ashram for some aspect of the Plan) will be the success of the effort in theouter world.Thus again the concept of the “Hierarchy of Relationship” is brought to yourattention. In these days of world strife, it is this bringing about of rightrelations which presents the key to the immediate aspect of the vision whichmust be precipitated upon our planet. Therefore, an Ashram is a centre whereinrelationship is tried out.One simple question arises here: How can right relations he established uponearth if the accepted disciples in a Master’s [732] group are themselves unableto react to the idea and to preserve, among themselves, right relations,correctly, unanimously and unerringly? What hope is there for the outer world ifthe inner circle of workers (pledged disciples) are unable to establish and holdamong themselves these right relations. At this time, the problem is threefold.These right relations must be fostered between:1. Accepted disciples, initiate disciples and the Master.2. Between the members of an Ashram and other Ashrams.3. Between these Ashrams and the outer world.The Master of an Ashram and the senior initiates in His group are responsiblefor the relation between Shamballa and the Hierarchy. Accepted disciples and thelesser initiates are responsible for the relation between the Hierarchy andHumanity. Thus the great chain of the Hierarchy of Being is preserved inviolate.PART VIStage III. Accepted Discipleship.It is not my intention in this short series of Instructions to deal with theStage of Accepted Discipleship. Much has been written about this stage. I havecovered every practical angle in my many books and there is nothing to be gainedby duplication. The books on discipleship put out by the Theosophical Societyadequately cover the Probationary Path; I have dealt in detail with the Path ofDiscipleship.The angle of the contacts which become possible upon the Path of AcceptedDiscipleship are well known but cannot be described in too much detail. Theyvary according to person, and ray. I would only ask you to have these modes ofapproach in mind, remembering that they do occur and occur in varying degrees ofclarity and at various stages upon the Path. They are as you know:1. A dream experience.2. A symbolic teaching.3. The thoughtform of a Master.4. A direct contact with the Master in meditation.5. An interview in a Master’s Ashram.[733] The first three are more usually the experience of the probationarydisciple. The last two are undergone by the accepted disciple. They have theirastral or lower psychic counterparts. They are, in this case, not all glamourand illusion and are not basically reprehensible, for they are—in reality—theseed or guarantee of future inevitable experiences upon the Way. People do seethoughtforms of the Masters, for those thoughtforms exist; they do receivesymbolic teachings upon the astral plane or in the dream states. Beginners andthe inexperienced are then apt to do one of two things: over-estimate theexperience and believe it to indicate a high spiritual development; they beginto lean upon the experience and to substitute this astral happening for thefuture reality or they dismiss it as undesirable lower psychism, forgetting thatso-called lower psychism is only so when the interpretation and the use of theexperience is at fault. It is the task of the accepted disciple to aid in theinterpreting, to indicate direction and to point out the significance of theexperience to the neophyte. Workers in the spiritual field should bear thiscarefully in mind and remember that—as a result of the war, of tension and ofaspiration towards the New Age—these dreams and visions, these episodes ofsymbolic teaching, these contacts with thoughtforms will steadily increase andare indicative of growth and of expansion. Undirected, unexplained andmisinterpreted or laughed down and ridiculed, they can greatly hinder and can beforced to descend into the category of true lower psychism; rightly interpretedand explained, they can constitute a series of graded revelations upon the Wayto light; they exist then as guarantees of future knowledge and as signposts ofa relative achievement. But they are not the reality when astrally focussed.Disciples need to bear in mind always that they grow by the answering of theirown questions; the task of the Master is not to answer questions which, given alittle time or thought, the disciple could answer himself, but to suggest orthrow into the disciple’s mind the type of question which warrants his thoughtand then to stimulate his abstract mind so that he can successfully find theanswer.You can see, therefore, how important this entire problem of questions can beand how, in a Master’s Ashram or group, [734] the responsiveness of themembership to the questions, registered either by the individual disciple or bythe group as a whole, and the answering of these questions has a conditioningeffect upon the group. It is here the Master’s particular work comes in—thearousing of the Ashram to the asking of those questions which will lead torevelation. A Master has always two things to bear in mind: the group conditionwhich is dependent upon the aggregated vibration or note of all the members ofthe Ashram, insofar as they work together, and, secondly, the period in whichthe group is functioning. To this must be added the total responsiveness of theentire Ashram. One of the difficulties confronting all ashrams (viewing them aswholes) is to absorb new members and disciples, either singly or in groups. Onequestion that necessarily arises is: How can a group within an Ashram(constituted of relatively new disciples and beginners on the Path of AcceptedDiscipleship) become increasingly sensitive to the vibration of the Ashram as awhole and to the Master of the Ashram?This question in reality embodies the major problem existent between thepersonality and the soul, between the Master and the disciple and betweenhumanity and the Hierarchy. It is basically a question of registering essentialunity and the cessation of separativeness. Disciples in their consciousness haveto learn to avoid differentiating between aspects of the Ashram, inner andouter, and between the few Ashram members whom they may know and recognise, andthe vast number who remain unknown to them. An Ashram is one group or band ofdisciples, initiates of various degrees, world disciples and neophytes at thevery beginning of the Way of discipleship. Disciples must not think in terms ofdifferent Ashrams but in terms of the Ashram as a whole.The key to this realisation, little as you may think it, is Intensity .Intensity, or working from a point of tension, brings in the flood-tide ofrevelation, and it is then possible for a disciple to learn in one short daywhat might otherwise take months and even years to learn. Tension, when focussedrightly, is the great releasing power . So many disciples focus tension wronglyand release energy in the wrong direction and (if I might so inadequatelyexpress it) from the wrong location. [735] Right tension is brought about firstby correct orientation; this necessitates a true sense of values and freedomfrom those minor pre-occupations which produce extension instead of tension. Ifyou are (to give a very usual illustration) pre-occupied with your physicalcondition, you will not experience the tension which will make you a magneticcentre of power and love; if you are pre-occupied with the failures of otherpeople or with their ideas about you, you will again fail to experience thetension which releases. You would find it of value to discover where your“extensions” are and then retreat inward to the point of tension from which youcan consciously and effectively direct soul energy.This is the true esoteric work. The majority of disciples are not even 60 percent effective because their points of tension are scattered all over thepersonality and are not focussed where the point of individual tension shouldbe. Each has to discover that point of spiritual tension for himself. The reasonthat disciples are not sensitive to the Master, to the life of the Ashram and toeach other is that they are extended and not tense; they are working and livingon the periphery of consciousness and not at the centre. Their service,therefore, is partial; their consecration is weak and they are overwhelmed byinertia, by lack of interest in others and by many pre-occupations with the formside of life.One more question might here be considered, dealing with a phrase which I havedeliberately used several times in these talks: What is the distinction betweenlove and the will to-love? It is one which constantly is asked in the earlystages of the path of discipleship. It is a most revealing question and is basedon a sense of individual need and also on group need. It indicates also apenetrating analysis which has carried the questioner to the point where heknows the difference between theory, plus effort, and a spontaneousdemonstration of that which is .The will-to-love involves the recognition of limitation, of desire, of theforcing of an issue and of the intense aspiration really to love. It does notindicate the inflow of Shamballa energy through the medium of the soul whoseintrinsic nature is spontaneous love. Where there is a determination to be [736]loving, certain attitudes—either natural and belonging to a developedpersonality or forced through attention to soul behest—emerge. The discipleknows that he lacks love, because he is constantly finding himself isolated fromand not identified with others; he is irritated by others: he is critical of hisbrothers, either feeling superior to them or looking at them and saying: “Herethey are wrong and I am right; here they do not understand and I do; I know thembut they don’t know me; I must be patient with them,” etc., etc. Throughout thisphase, the attitude is definitely that of the will-to-love, coupled to a deeprealisation of the handicaps to the expression of love presented by those othersand presented also by one’s own habits of thought. This is all a form ofself-centredness. The true way to love is to reflect and meditate deeply andconstantly upon the significance and the meaning of love, its origin, itsexpression through the soul, its qualities, goals and objectives. Most of thereflection carried on by the aspirant is based upon his innate realisation thathe does not really love in the spontaneous, free way of the spirit. The discipleis, therefore, thrown back on a self-centred position in which he feels: “Now Iam loving; now I am not loving; now I must try and love.” Yet all the time noneof these attitudes is really true love nor is their result a loving expressionbecause the disciple is identified with himself and focussed in the personality.Love is never worked up, if I might put it so, in the lower nature; it is a freeunimpeded inflow from the higher.Love is spontaneous and carries ever the free spirit of Christ. I would suggestthat there has never been a better description of the nature of love than thatgiven by the initiate Paul, even though the translation of his words is faultyat times. Study those passages in the New Testament in which he defines love.Give up emphasising the will-to-love and emphasise in your own consciousness theneed of others for understanding, compassion, interest and help. The usualloneliness of all disciples is frequently incidental to the fact of theself-centredness of all those whom they contact and the intense pre-occupationof the neophyte with his own growth. The cry of the neophyte is: “Tell me. Tellme. Then I will change. I will accept anything that is said but tell me.” Thecry of the disciple is: “Aid [737] the work. Forget yourself. The world needsyou.” So many disciples are still shut up within themselves, hidden behind thewall of the personal self and little true out-going love is present. Until theybreak through and truly love, their usefulness is impaired.We have considered briefly the stage of Little Chelaship and that of Chela inthe Light . These stages lie behind quite a large number of human beings today.It is necessary, however, to revive the effect of these two experiences and theneed to do so lies behind much of the work being done by disciples and teachersat this time. Many other people are today passing through the stage of AcceptedDiscipleship . The keynote of that stage is, as you know, the establishing ofcontact with the Master; it is primarily and technically the task of the Masterto evoke the direct response and the conscious reaction of the disciple. Alongwith these reactions, the Master looks for an effort on the part of the discipleto be impersonal in his dealings, both with Him and with his co-disciples;impersonality is the first step upon the road to spiritual love andunderstanding. The effort of most sincere disciples is usually concentrated uponloving each other and in this (to use an old simile) they put the “cart beforethe horse.” Their effort should be to achieve, first of all, impersonality intheir dealings for, when that has been achieved, criticism dies out and love canpour in.The Master also looks for an effort upon the part of His disciples to work on alarger and more generous scale in connection with His work in the world of men;He leaves them free to work as they may choose but He most certainly looks forthe effort to take place along the lines of the specific activities whichconstitute His intention. To achieve this vital and strenuous effort, there mustbe the ability to focus upon the work and its needs and to develop the power tocooperate with those also engaged in similar work. This, again, involvesimpersonality and right focus. The Master is today looking for dedication to theneeds of humanity in these days of human agony; this involves a sensitivity toworld pain as it demonstrates from day to day in world affairs; it requires alsoa “divine indifference” to outer events in the life of the little self and asense of proportion which enables the disciple to see his little personal [738]affairs—physical, emotional and mental—in terms of the whole. So again we arriveat impersonality —this time impersonality to a man’s own reactions.The Master has, therefore, necessarily to ask Himself whether the expenditure oftime and energy which He gives to the members of His group or Ashram is rightlywarranted and whether, as a result, the group has “quickened” for increasedservice, and is more closely knit together in the bonds of the ashramicfellowship and is decentralised and less a group of dedicated personalities andmore a group of living souls.Impersonality has also to be developed in connection with the Master Himself. Heis not occupied with making His group of disciples satisfied with themselves,their status or their service. He frequently lays the emphasis (in His few andrare contacts with His disciples) upon their failures and limitations. He doesnot only give them a steady flow of teaching and increased opportunity to serve.His work is primarily to help them detach themselves from the form aspect oflife and fit them to undergo certain great expansions of consciousness. Heassumes the factual nature of their dedication and desire to serve. This he hasshown by receiving them into His group of disciples. When He did that, Heassumed also the responsibility of preparing them for initiation. It is no partof the Master’s duties to pat disciples upon the back or to congratulate themupon work done and progress made. He has instead the task of watching closelytheir note or vibration and of indicating where changes must be made in attitudeand expression, where intensification of the spiritual life is in order andwhere personality adjustments could lead to greater freedom and, therefore, tomore effective service. If this process, when applied by Him evokes resentmentand disappointment upon their part, then the indication is that they are stillsteeped in personal reactions.Another thing which disciples are apt to forget is that the Master has toprotect the larger Ashram as a whole from the reaction of those who are learningto work in smaller supervised groups and in cooperation with their moreexperienced brothers. Sometimes disciples become discouraged—from a naturalmorbidness, self-centredness, lethargy and sometimes [739] good intentions—andendeavour to resign from the Ashram or group. This they can only doexoterically, for the esoteric link always persists, though it may betemporarily negated in the need of the larger group to protect itself from someunit in its midst. The members of an Ashram and accepted disciples are alwaysengaged in world work and effectively so. Newcomers and beginners have to betrained to participate in that work and ample scope is always provided to thisend.Certain periods come when disciples have to be faced with clear and definitequestions, in the answering of which they discover themselves and the scope andfruitfulness of their demanded service. Some of these questions might beexpressed as follows:How effective is my work in relation to my sphere of activity?How effective is my thinking and planning in relation to what may lie ahead inthe immediate future? We have an instance of this today, in connection with theplans for a post-war world and the need for intelligent and spiritualreconstruction activity.What results can I recognise as the fruit of my work?Do I feel that my work has been satisfactory from the standpoint of my soul and,incidentally, of my Master?Have I worked with impersonality in relation to my fellow disciples andco-workers, no matter what their status?Have I preserved the needed spirit of loving cooperation?Do I recognise truthfully my own and my co-disciples’ limitations and do I thenmove forward with those who are serving alongside of me without criticism andwith silence?Do I realise exactly where I stand? Whom I can help? And to whom I must look forexample, aid and understanding?One of the first lessons a disciple has to learn is to recognise what isoccultly called “hierarchical progression.” This enables the disciple to placehimself consciously at the point to which evolution and spiritual unfoldmenthave brought him and, therefore, recognise those whom he can assist from thestandpoint [740] of his greater experience and those to whom he must look forlike aid.This is a hard first lesson. The neophyte is always more consciously conceitedthan is the experienced disciple. It was the need for the understanding of thisfact of hierarchical progression which prompted me to choose the six stages ofdiscipleship as our study theme. To be a disciple does not mean that all withinthe Ashram are upon the same rung of the ladder of evolution. It is not so. AnAshram is composed of all degrees, ranging from that of a disciple who is takinghis first steps upon the arduous path of training, up to that of a disciple whois a Master of the Wisdom. This hierarchical progression is something warrantingcareful consideration. I would remind you of the Law which states that “we growthrough the medium of our recognitions.” A recognition, when it is seen as anaspect or fractional part of a greater whole, is the seed of a major expansionof consciousness. A stabilised expansion of consciousness connotes initiation.This is an occult statement of major importance.It is essential that disciples cultivate the attitude of spiritual recognitionand they will find their lives greatly enriched when they do so. Contact withdisciples, initiates and Masters is ever evocative in the result. The power theynormally and unconsciously wield has a dual effect. It draws out the best andevokes the worst whilst presenting situations with which the disciple must deal.Every disciple is a focal point of power to some degree. The more advanced thedisciple, the greater the force or energy which will radiate from him; thisnecessarily presents situations which the lesser disciple has to handle. Thetrue disciple never does this with intention. The theory (so prevalent amongoccult groups) that the leader or some senior working disciple must stagesituations in order to develop the pupil is contrary to occult law. The moment,however, you step into the range of the radiation of a Master or of any disciplesenior to you, then things are bound to happen in your life. The radiation iseffective when rightly received, registered and consciously used to bring aboutthe sensed and needed changes. Eventually when the disciple’s vibration isconstant and responsive to the higher one, the two can then be synchronised.[741] It is this synchronisation which characterises all grades of initiates andwhich indicates to an initiate of a higher degree that an initiate or discipleof a lower grade can be admitted into the higher ranks. Synchronisation is thekey to initiation.PART VIIStage IV. The Chela on the Thread.With these preliminary remarks, let us pass on to another of the Stages on thePath of Discipleship. The fourth stage is described as follows:“The stage wherein the disciple is taught how (in emergencies) to attract theMaster’s attention. This has the peculiar name of the Chela on the Thread.”The whole question of psychic sensitivity of the higher kind is involved at thisstage. I have taught in my writings most clearly and definitely theundesirability of the lower psychic experiences. This has been done as the needto warn aspirants anent this matter is great. The difficulty is enhanced by thefact that lower psychics are not easily reached and warned as they are everdetermined that their clairvoyant and clairaudient powers are indicative of theadvanced type of high spiritual unfoldment. Their minds are closed to allwarnings and they function often behind a barrier of smug self-satisfaction.They forget that the aboriginal races and animals are all psychic and registerthat which the more mental types fail to record. The rank and file of the peopleare inherently astral in their activities, their interpretations of phenomenaand their attitudes and focus. It is necessary, then, to enforce the warningsand awaken the average psychic to the undesirability of his astral life.Disciples, however, put no aspect of the divine manifestation outside theirrange of experience. They know that psychism in its lowest phases is a part ofthe divine expression and is of an essentially higher nature than the purelyphysical processes of living in the body. A disciple cannot say that now becausehe is a disciple, he will not be subject to this, that or the other experience.He has to be prepared for all experiences [742] and to face the fact thateventually all disciples have to become psychics, both higher and lower, as wasthe Christ. The only safeguard for which he works is to prevent the lower powersdemonstrating until the higher psychic faculties are functioning; then the lowerare controlled and operated (if I might so express it) from the level of thehigher consciousness. There is, to the mind of the disciple, only life and formand he is learning to handle the life processes through the medium of the formso as to produce a divine manifestation.The world today is entering a phase of extreme sensitivity. Disciples must trainthemselves to help. The shift of the consciousness of ordinary and mediocreindividuals will be on to levels of conscious astralism and the veil between theseen and the unseen will rapidly disappear. How can disciples be of service inthat difficult period if they have no experience in the distinction andinterpretation which must exist between aspects of phenomena? How can theyrescue and safeguard others if they fear to enter into realms of life where thelower psychism rules? I am not asking you to cultivate psychic powers, but I doask you to hold yourselves in guarded readiness to see and hear on all levels ofservice, and to know what you see and hear, interpreting it correctly, unblindedby prejudice and fear. The Path of Discipleship is not an easy one but itscompensations are adequate. Psychic sensitivity is involved in the understandingof this phase of discipleship.In your thoughts as you endeavour very briefly to study this stage, there mustexist a correlation between the chela, the Ashram in which he is working and theMaster. This correlation and the growth of this triangular relationship isalways brought about through a realisation of tension. There has been much givento students upon the theme of the thread, the sutratma and the antahkarana. Thisthread leads from the Hierarchy and a point of tension in that Hierarchy (suchas the Master at the centre of any Ashram) to distant places, to many planes andinto many hearts. This thread enables the disciple (if he has been permitted tolearn how to use it) to return instantaneously to his centre of work and toreach at any desired moment the “Master of his life.” This triangular relationmight be depicted thus: [743][Image00006.jpg]An extension of this idea lies behind much that I have taught anent the WesakFestival and should be in your minds when you prepare to participate in it.[Image00007.jpg]The entire subject of the chela on the thread and the techniques involved inthis state of consciousness are all related to the capacity of the human being,under soul control, to be magnetic and to “emit the vibratory call which canpenetrate to the ear of the One Who holds the thread.” This is quoted from avery ancient manuscript in the Archives of the Hierarchy, dealing with thisstage of discipleship. I am for the first time making this information availablein a brief and necessarily veiled and inadequate form to the disciples,assembling this cycle at the call of the Hierarchy. Only those who are at thisstage of discipleship will really comprehend what I say and profit by the hints.This fourth stage is only possible to a disciple who has been an accepteddisciple for more than one life and who has demonstrated his ability to workwith selflessness and pertinacity. The requirements can be stated as follows:1. The disciple has succeeded in decentralising himself and is no longer thepoint of dramatic interest on his own little stage. He is no longer pre-occupiedwith his feeling [744] nature and the excessive self-interest, evidenced by somany, no longer controls his thoughts and aspiration.2. The disciple can now work with impersonality, no matter how his own personalnature may be reacting. This means that his own feelings, thoughts, likes,dislikes and desires are no longer the controlling factors; he is conditioned inhis daily activities and relationships only by those intentions and activitieswhich are for the good of the group. He will not sacrifice any individual to thegroup good until after due effort to help that individual understand anddemonstrate right relationship; but he will not hesitate to take firm action asneed and opportunity arise.3. The disciple has developed a sense of proportion as to the work and therelative value of his contribution to the Master’s work and the Ashram life. Heis engrossed in the task and the opportunity and not with the Master and withhis individual position in the Master’s thoughts. Most disciples in the earlystages of their novitiate never forget that they are disciples. This is what theMaster Morya has called the “smug recollection of the self-engrossed mind.” Itis a form of veiled pride which beginners find it difficult to avoid. Never fora minute do they forget the fact of their discipleship and the fact of theMaster, no matter how active their service; yet—if they were truly working froma point of tension—they would forget His very existence in the work to be donefor their fellowmen.4. The chela on the thread has reached a point where the higher correspondenceto the so-called “split personality” is to be found, or (to word it otherwise)where that state of consciousness, of which the split personality is the shadowand the distortion, makes its appearance. The disciple is conscioussimultaneously of two states of awareness or two points of concentratedactivity:a. The point of spiritual tension wherein he is focussed and which he endeavoursto preserve inviolate and constant. [745]b. The focussed sphere of activity in the three worlds, through the medium ofwhich he carries out his work and service as a disciple.These two related points are not in reality two separated activities, except asthey emerge in the consciousness of the disciple upon the physical plane andexpress his objective and his subjective life. They are incident to his havingto work in time and space and through the medium of a physical brain. The secondpoint of focus should be in reality an externalisation of the inner point oftension. In these words, you have the key to the true science of discipleship,to the developing relation of the human centre and the hierarchical. It concernsalso the work of the Buddha and the Christ, as They represent the point oftension at Shamballa and in the Hierarchy.Most disciples are not working from a point of spiritual tension, but from apoint of personality focus—a step forward indeed from that of the averageunthinking person but one to which they cling unduly long. As long as a man isfocussed in his personality, the point of spiritual tension will evade him. Hewill be driven by personality aspiration and not by ashramic force and thisfocus in form will lead to trouble both to the individual aspirant and to hisgroup. Spiritual tension, as a result of complete dedication of the personalityto the service of humanity, stimulates and empowers but does not evoke the lowerlife of the personal self.These are the requirements which the disciple must meet before he is taught toreach the Master at will and when an emergency arises.I would like here to call your attention to the attitude of the Master at thisstage of His chela’s progress. As the name implies, the disciple at this pointis permitted to call the attention of the Master; this is permissible only whenthe chela can be trusted to use the privilege solely for purposes of groupservice and never for himself or his own benefiting. This signifies that thedisciple is capable of handling his life and problems himself and is not likely,therefore, to intrude his personal crises into the life of the Ashram. Itimplies also a chela of such devotion and essential basic selflessness that theAshram needs no protection from his vibratory activity; he [746] never exactsfrom the Master any of the potency which rebuffs, as it is esoterically called.The Master knows that if a call comes from the chela on the thread, it will notbe a waste of His time to respond, because the call will always be launched onbehalf of group need and for the establishing of group purpose.No matter what the Master is doing or what His pre-occupation, He must respondto that call, for it is the endowed right of the trusted disciple to send it outwhen emergency demands it. You might ask how the chela knows that he can “getthrough” to the Master, using here a colloquialism. I can assure you that acomplete inhibition rests upon him when the call may not be sounded—aninhibition, arising on his side of the relationship and not imposed by theMaster—and he neither wants nor attempts to sound the call when there is aquestion in his mind. It is a matter of clear intuitive perception, therecognition of an unimpeded channel and an act of spiritual will. It is inreality a process of invocation and evocation. This whole concept of the chelaon the thread lies behind the distorted teaching about the prerogatives andprivileges of the priesthood and the relation of the Pope, for instance, to Godor of the “elect” to the Deity. This latent and unfulfilled ideal is that of thechela on the thread and the Master and His Ashram, interpreted by theecclesiastical consciousness as the Church. When the coming world religion isbuilt around the work and the activity of the world disciples and knowers, thenwe shall see these symbols, called the “rights and prerogatives of thepriesthood,” correctly interpreted and truly expressed. The same symbolicinferences are also to be seen in the Brahmin caste in India.This responsive relationship and interplay is only attained after a long cycleof the outer relation of the accepted disciple upon the periphery and finallywithin the Ashram. It does not come about as the result of any effort to fitoneself for this position of power and of influence in service. It is simply thesilent and almost unconsciously achieved result of that self-effacement andself-forgetfulness which distinguishes the accepted disciple; he isdecentralised and engrossed in the fulfilment of the divine Plan to the best ofhis ability. It is the reward, if I might so express it, of the worker who knowswhat [747] he has come into incarnation to do and who is endeavouring withdedication to do it. The driving urge of his life is the need of humanity andhis expanding awareness of the immediate next step that man must take.The major tasks of the Master when a disciple first enters His Ashram is to makehim think along the lines of decentralisation. This involves the shift of thedisciple’s consciousness from himself to the work to be done and, incidentally,the answering of the questions:1. Do you, in reality, know what your life task is?2. Have you tried to carry this out in your current life processes?3. Is your main objective the building of character and the development ofpurity? If this is so, do you not think that you should be on the Path ofProbation and not deluding yourself with the idea that you are on the Path ofDiscipleship?4. Are you pre-occupied with human need or are you engrossed with your ownposition as a disciple, with your own spiritual problems, and with the delusionof the terrific difficulties in your personal life?As long as you believe that your life is one of all engrossing interest and alsoone of exceeding hard places, you are only in the very early stages of accepteddiscipleship and have not yet cast off ancient habits of thought. Thesequestions have eventually to be answered before the student has what I mightcall “the full freedom of the Ashram.”The Ashram, you must remember, is externalised only in so far as it provides apoint of spiritual tension. From that Ashram, disciples go out to work in theworld. The outer group, working in the world, or the exoteric Ashram, isexternalised by reflecting the radiance of the inner Ashram and by establishinga magnetic field of spiritual power. This is done just in so far as the membersof the Ashram who are found on its outer periphery relate themselves to theinner Ashram and therefore react to the note and quality of the inner group,gathered around the Master.An Ashram is not a group of people seeking spiritual realisation. It is a centreof group activity, swept by energies which [748] (when given full and propersway) enable the group to carry out the Master’s plan and meet human need. Youmay wonder perhaps why I so constantly emphasise this need. I do it because thatneed is the main and urgent principle of invocation; it can and will evokehierarchical response and thus put two centres—that of Humanity and theHierarchy—en rapport. This is a group correspondence to the invocation of thesoul by the personality and its subsequent evocation upon the plane of every dayliving, thus leading to a consequent fusion. An Ashram or Master’s group is,therefore, a centre of invocation and when the individual disciple becomes achela on the thread, it is as the reward of selfless service—carried forward atany personal cost. Then the Ashram can be a centre of unique world potency.Chelas on the thread employ a peculiar technique, according to their ray; theywork always through the head centre. By means of this centre, they sound out thecall (an inaudible call, from the physical plane angle) which (vibrating alongthe thread) reaches the Master. These techniques are, however, taught directlyto the disciple by the Master when He recognises His chela’s right to theprivilege. I cannot give these techniques direct to you. When you are “on thethread,” you will inevitably have the information given to you.This thread is not the antahkarana but a linking thread of living light. Thisthe Master projects as the disciple’s service evokes a response from Him. Thisevocation, however, increases its potency as the disciple builds the antahkaranabetween the personality and the Spiritual Triad. The chela on the threadeventually has the life thread (one aspect of the antahkarana) connected withthis ashramic thread and hence the establishment of monadic control of theindividual which (in its group form) signifies the control of the Hierarchy byShamballa. The lesser and the greater relationship must ever be borne in mind.To the average aspirant, the implications of this stage of discipleship arevaluable from the angle of emphasising what has not been achieved. Theimplications are, therefore, negative. This is frequently desirable whereaccepted disciples are concerned whose attitude should be positive andintelligent. [749] The Law of Positive and Negative Relationships underlies allthese stages. That which is higher is, at first, always negative to that whichis lower; then interim changes take place which make the higher positive to thelower and lead, therefore, to the steady ascending of the Way of Life and theLadder of Spiritual Ascent.PART VIIIStage V. The Chela within the Aura.The definition, as given earlier by me, runs as follows:“The stage wherein he is permitted to know the method whereby he may set up ...a call which will entitle him to an interview with the Master. At this stage,the disciple is called a chela within the aura.”It is a stage of discipleship which is far in advance of that attained by mostdisciples, because it connotes almost complete at-one-ment between the discipleand the Master’s group. He has already been accorded the privilege of invokingthe attention of the Master in times of emergency and is sure of His response.He has advanced from the point when he was being trained to become an integratedand useful unit in the Ashram to where he is a trusted agent. His orientation isnow fixed and though he is subjected to many tests and difficulties, these areincreasingly concerned with the group life and condition and not with himself. Irefer not here to the difficulties of any ashramic group or to those connectedwith any group affiliation the disciple may rightly hold upon the physicalplane, but to his responsiveness to the group need of humanity. Where thisresponsiveness exists, it means that the whole is of greater importance to himthan the part. This in no way negates his ability to work with individuals or togive understanding love and compassion to those in his path of life who need it.But he has arrived at a sense of right proportion and of correct organisation ofhis life processes, trends and activities in time and space. He can then bedepended upon always to substitute the good of the whole for individual good, asthe personality might see it.[750] The Master knows that in the chela who has reached this stage He has adependable instrument and one who can be regarded as no longer a drag on thelife of the group. I have pointed out to you before this how difficult is theprocess of absorbing a new disciple into an Ashram; he has to be taught toadvance gradually from the periphery of the group consciousness towards thecentre. Each step forward necessitates care on the part of the Master in orderto see that the Ashram is preserved from all disruptive activity. It is onlywhen the chela has achieved “occult serenity” that he can be permitted to focushimself permanently within the group aura. This happens when he becomesconscious of the peculiar and specific vibration of the Master’s aura. Hence, asyou can well see, the need for serenity.I would point out that serenity and peace are not identical. Peace must ever betemporary and refers to the world of feeling and to conditions susceptible ofdisturbance. It is essential to progress and an inevitable happening that everystep forward is marked by disturbances, by points of crisis and chaos, replacedlater (when successfully handled) by periods of peace. But this peace is notserenity and a chela is only permitted to dwell within the Master’s aura whenserenity has been substituted for peace. Serenity signifies that deep calm,devoid of emotional disturbance which distinguishes the disciple who is focussedin a “mind held steady in the light.” The surface of his life may be (from theworldly angle) in a state of violent flux. All that he cherishes and holds dearin the three worlds may be crashing around him. But in spite of all, he standsfirm, poised in soul consciousness and the depths of his life remainundisturbed. This is not insensitivity or a forced auto-suggestion, neither isit a capacity to exteriorise the consciousness in such a manner that individualevents and happenings are ignored. It is intensity of feeling transmuted intofocussed understanding. When this has been attained, the chela has the right tolive within the aura of the Master. There is nothing now in him which willrequire the Master to sidetrack His attention from vital efforts to theunimportant task of helping a disciple.[751] An accepted disciple, therefore, advances—if I may so express it—throughthe medium of three vibratory realisations:1. He reacts to the vibration, the note or the quality of an Ashram, accordingto his ray type. The periphery of a Master’s sphere of group control iscontacted by him and he becomes an accepted disciple in full wakingconsciousness. The Master is aware of his presence upon the outer fringe of Hisconsciousness; his fellow disciples are also aware of another point of lightwithin the Ashram, largely because of the effort they have to make to offset thenew chela’s personality reactions to the new mode of life, to the effectswrought into his consciousness by his penetration into the world of meaning andto the out-surging of his devotion to the Master. It becomes the task of moreadvanced chelas to protect the Master from the violent reactions of the newchela and to stand between Him and the neophyte. Some initiate-chela takes himin hand and acts as intermediary. The chela (as I have earlier pointed out) isin touch with the Master when, and only when, the Master so desires and it wouldbe good and helpful to the entire group.2. He realises increasingly the nature and note of his Ashram and advances fromthe periphery into the sphere of influence of the Master and His group; he thenbegins to participate more and more in the group life and is less and lessinterested in himself. He becomes, consequently, a more valuable asset in theAshram and is entrusted with specific duties and tasks for which he isindividually responsible to the initiate-chela in charge of him. The Masterbegins to contact him with greater frequency and—because he is becomingdecentralised and his own growth and development are of less and less importanceto him than service for others—he is permitted to attract the Master’s attentionwhen help is needed for the group, and thus becomes a chela on the thread. Theantahkarana is being rapidly built and the inflow of life from the SpiritualTriad increases slowly and regularly. He has reached a point where, upon theouter plane, he is gathering around him a sphere of influence as a result of hissoul radiation, via the personality. It might be stated that no disciple becomesa chela on the thread until he has many people in the outer world who (on alower turn of the spiral) are to him what he is to the Master—chelas [752] onthe thread. In a distorted and frequently unsatisfactory fashion, he is engagedin forming his own group and today this is very often the case. The world isfull of struggling disciples, intensely pre-occupied with forming organisations,with gathering around them those whom they can help, thus striking a particularnote and learning the rudiments (the rudiments , I repeat, my brother) of groupwork as the Hierarchy seeks to see it carried out.3. He responds powerfully and (from his point of view) quite unexpectedly to therealised vibration of the Master as He functions at the very centre of Hisgroup. He has known the Master’s vibratory call; he has become aware of thequality of the Ashram which is evoked by the Master. Now he is admitted to thesecret place to be found at the very heart of the Ashram and becomes a chelawithin the aura.The aura of any form of life can be defined as the quality of a sphere ofradiatory activity. Very little is as yet known about auras, and a great deal ofnonsense has been written anent the matter. The aura is usually spoken of interms of colour and of light, due to the nature of the vision of the one whosees and the apparatus of response which is in use. Two words only describe anaura from the point of view of occult knowledge and they are “quality” and“sphere of influence.” What the clairvoyant really contacts is an impressionwhich the mind rapidly translates into the symbology of colour, whereas there isno colour present. Seeing an aura, as it is called, is in reality a state ofawareness. That the seer may in all sincerity believe that he has registered acolour, a series of colours, or light, is entirely true in many cases, but whathe has really recorded is the quality of a sphere of radiatory activity; this hedoes when his own individual sphere of radiatory activity is of the same natureand quality as that contacted. Most seers register the astral range ofvibrations of a person or a group and this through the medium of their ownastral body. The impact of a truth or of a mental concept and its recognition isan expression of a similar contact, carried forward this time into the realm ofthe mind.This explains the truth lying behind all so-called “expansions of consciousness”to which the mind of man can respond; [753] he registers a constant successionof vibratory impacts, emanating from spheres of activity; these range all theway from the early stage of increasing awareness through the development of thefive senses and the three vehicles of contact in the three worlds of humanexperience to those recognitions which lead a man into the sphere of influenceof a Master and later enable him to take what is termed one of the majorinitiations.These spheres of radiatory activity are ever present even when unregistered andunrecognised. The evolutionary process is one of developing a response apparatuswith which to register them; having done so, the next step is to reactintelligently to such contacts, thus producing an ever increasing range ofawareness which finally constitutes the sum total of consciousness.I cannot here enlarge upon this theme as it proceeds under the impelling forceof evolution. I am only here concerned with the fact of a Master’s sphere ofradiatory activity and its peculiar quality and ray colouring (occultlyunderstood).The factor lying behind and thus making possible each of the six stages ofdiscipleship is the existence in the disciple of qualities, radiatory activitiesand emanatory impulses which correspond to those emanating from some particularAshram. These, when they have evoked a response and drawn the disciple to theperiphery of the sphere of activity of such an Ashram, gradually intensify theirmagnetic, attractive quality; they awaken to still greater potency the samequalities in the disciple, occultly pulling him closer to the central point,which is the focus of all the trained ability and the high-powered spirituallife of the Master at the very heart of the Ashram.It is at this point that the disciple awakens to the realisation that his threebodies or vehicles—etheric, astral and mental—are only the reflections of thethree aspects of the Spiritual Triad and that they can give him the key to hisown being and also the capacity to respond to the threefold vibration of theMaster, as expressed through His aura.The teaching that the personality must be destroyed is a distortion of thetruth; his focus of consciousness has to be shifted from the threefold lowernature into that of the Triad and this with the aid of the threefold soulnature. The mode of this progressive shifting is response to an ever higher rateof [754] vibratory activity. Just as soon as there exists, in the consciousnessof the disciple, the ability to respond to the quality and the radiation,emanating from an Ashram, he moves forward into that sphere of influence. Thatin his own aura which is akin to the quality of the Master’s aura is trained,intensified and purified. His own radiatory activity is enhanced as the ashramiclife plays upon his vehicles until in time he becomes the chela within the aura.In a faint way, his vibration and that of the Master tend to synchronise.I would point out that in this way, the disciple begins to make a significantcontribution to the life of the Ashram. Each disciple who penetrates into theaura of the Master through similarity of quality and vibratory activity enrichesand intensifies the group with which he is thus affiliated. As time elapses, theAshram of a Master becomes increasingly potent, magnetic and radiant. Withinthat aura the initiate-disciple carries forward his work, standing at theradiant centre of the group life and working from thence outwards in service. Heis ever careful to protect that centre from any quality of his own aura which isnot in harmony with the quality of the Master and to keep (as far as may be)outside his own consciousness any thoughts or desires which might disturb thegroup aura. When he is admitted to this stage of discipleship that is hisresponsibility, and such a privilege is never accorded to him unless he is ableso to guard himself and the sphere of influence of which he is now a part.You can see, therefore, that the Hierarchy itself is only a great Ashram with atriangle at the centre, composed of the Christ, the Mahachohan and the Manu.Symbolically speaking, this triangle constitutes one radiant centre, for theradiatory activity of each of these Great Lords is such that They are swept intoeach other’s auras in such a way that there is a complete blending and fusing.Every Ashram radiates some one major quality according to the ray of the Masterat the centre; in the same way the Hierarchy radiates the quality of the seconddivine aspect, just as the all-inclusive Ashram (to which we give the nameShamballa) has the outstanding characteristic of the first aspect, life itself.This is not a quality, but that of which quality is an emanation.[755] The Master’s aura (which determines the aura of the entire Ashram) hasthree outstanding radiations as far as the responsiveness of the disciple isconcerned:1. The radiation which comes from the higher levels of the mental plane, or fromthe lowest aspect of the Spiritual Triad. The potency of this radiation and theextent of the sphere of influence will be determined by the extent to which theMaster is spiritually in touch with the Mind of God. I do not use the word“consciously” in this connection and when dealing with conditions above egoiclevels. It is this particular radiation which evokes a response from theembryonic abstract mind of the disciple when the antahkarana is being built andis the first kind of contact to which the neophyte responds in the later stagesof the Probationary Path. A direct line of influential approach is made betweenthe Master and the awakening disciple as follows:a. The manasic permanent atom of the disciple.b. The knowledge petals of the egoic lotus.c. The lower concrete mind “held steady in the light.”d. The throat centre.e. The brain of the disciple upon the physical plane.This is all of it necessarily relative but the moment that the disciple hasestablished this line of approach to the Spiritual Triad (even in a smallmeasure) he makes his first response to the aura of the Master. The distinctionbetween the aura of the Master and the aura of the Ashram is that the Master’saura is dynamic and the group aura is influential, yet the two togetherconstitute the group aura. When this initial response is made it resultseventually in the disciple becoming the chela within the aura.2. The radiation which comes from the plane of buddhi or of the spiritualintuition. This is an expression of the love nature of the Master and is thatwhich enables Him to be in touch with the Heart of God. It might be noted herethat these three radiations emanating from a Master and enhanced by the similar,though much less powerful, radiations of the inner members of the Ashram are the[756] factors which put the Master and the Ashram in contact with that which isoccultly spoken of as the physical Sun, the heart of the Sun and the CentralSpiritual Sun.The line along which this vibratory activity of the Master reaches the discipleand draws him finally within the aura is:a. The buddhic permanent atom, or the intuitional vehicle of the advanceddisciple.b. The love petals of the egoic lotus.c. The astral body in its highest aspect.d. The heart centre.3. The radiation which comes from the atmic level or the will aspect of theSpiritual Triad. This is the emanatory expression of the capacity of the Masterto enter into the Council at Shamballa, to register the purpose of God and towork with the Plan, which is the expression, in any given cycle, of the workingout of the divine Will. This aspect of the Master’s radiatory activity is of sohigh a nature that only the advanced initiate-chela can register it. It istransmitted into the physical consciousness of the disciple along the followinglines:a. The atmic permanent atom or the focus of the spiritual will, the first aspectof the Spiritual Triad.b. The sacrifice petals of the egoic lotus.c. The etheric vehicle in its highest aspects.d. The head centre.e. The centre at the base of the spine, which is aroused into activity inresponse to the vibratory radiation of the other four points of transmission.You will note from a study of the above how abstruse and difficult it is to putinto words the nature of the vibratory activity of the Master. All I can do—indefault of your intuitive understanding—is to put into technical and academicterms (thereby crystallising the truth and somewhat distorting it) that whichcannot be expressed.This threefold radiation of the Master, as it expresses His planned activity andsphere of “influential emanation” is that which draws the disciple into Hisaura—not in this instance [757] the aura of the Ashram but of that which makesthe ashramic aura possible—the Life of the Master.One interesting fact might here be given. The moment when an initiate-chela hasintensified his vibration so that it is identical with that of the Master andcan hold that rate of vibration as his normal radiatory quality, then he himselfbecomes a Master. In every Ashram, there is always at a given moment some onedisciple who is being trained to take the Master’s place eventually, therebyreleasing Him for higher and more important work. As you know, I was the seniordisciple of the Master K.H. and when I became a Master, I released Him forhigher work and my place in His group was taken by another disciple on thesecond ray; two disciples are needed to bring about the complete liberation of aMaster from all ashramic work and I was the first of the two chosen to do this.The other has not yet made the grade. When this process of identification takesplace, a moving forward of every member in the entire Ashram becomes possible,e’en though it seldom happens. Symbolically speaking, it might be described as apotent expanding impulse which widens the circle of the Ashram so that higherlevels can be touched and lower spheres of influence can be included.Some day, it will be all “realised Hierarchy” for the Hierarchy is but a stateof consciousness with the life aspect, Shamballa, at the centre, and the circleof humanity constituting the emanating factor, the radiatory influence or theaura, whereby the other kingdoms in nature are evoked into responsive activity.This is a broad and general picture of this stage of discipleship as I haveattempted to convey its individual implications and its more esoteric groupresults. More I may not say, nor can I enlarge upon the process whereby a chelawithin the aura can at will and for the meeting of some urgent need confer withthe Master in the Ashram. One thing only can I tell you. The Master always hasthree disciples who are His closest cooperators and intermediaries. They haveemerged “into His consciousness,” as it is called, in response to the radiatoryactivity of His threefold spiritual nature. They work very closely with Him andwatch over the other disciples in the group [758] according to their need, theirray and their point of development. You will remember in this connection howeven the Christ had three disciples who were closer to Him than the other nine.This is ever true. In the Biblical story anent the Christ, you have—among otherthings—conveyed a picture of an Ashram as technically constituted and of theHierarchy as it essentially exists. There were the three disciples, beloved andclose; then the nine, who completed the inner Ashram. Next came the seventy whowere symbolic of the Ashram as a whole and, finally, the five hundred whotypified those upon the Probationary Path who were under supervision by theMaster, but not by the three, the nine and the seventy until the time comes toadmit them to the Path of Accepted Discipleship. In the greatest Ashram of all,Sanat Kumara has the same sequence of relationships among the great Beings Whoform His group of active workers. Bear in mind, however, that these figures aresymbolic and not factual. The number of disciples in an Ashram variesconstantly, but always there are the three who are responsible to the Master forall ashramic activity, who are in His closest councils and who carry out Hisplans. The chain of Hierarchy is great and immutable and the sequencesunalterable.In considering the theme of the chela within the Master’s aura, we have seenthat the true pledged disciple who has reached the stage of being an accepteddisciple passes from point to point within the circumference of a Master’ssphere of influence until he reaches a period wherein he consciously “knows” hisMaster’s aura. Now that, my brothers, is a perfectly meaningless phrase, but itis technically and esoterically correct. I will paraphrase its significance foryou in an endeavour to give you some of the vital implications.1. He is aware not only of the Master, but of what is in the Master’s mind. Thatmeans that he is telepathically en rapport with his Master.2. He is consciously past all inward discussion of what the Master wants him todo. He knows the part which he has to play.3. He responds sensitively to the Master’s aura not only upon the inner planesof life and in the Ashram proper, [759] but also with his physical brain. Hemoves within the aura in his daily physical plane life. This process necessarilyfalls into five stages:a. He is telepathically en rapport. His mind and his brain respond to theMaster’s mind.b. He is, therefore, mentally aware of the content of the Master’s mind. Thisaffects his life and service and his mind constantly formulates the telepathicimpressions into organised formulas which are then available for directiveprocesses.c. Being, at this stage, relatively free from glamour, he is able to respondfrom the angle of sensitivity and feeling and consequently able to bring throughthe Master’s plans (his share of them) on to the astral plane.d. Etherically, he can begin to work with and use the ashramic force which hisMaster and his soul can make available to him to use upon the physical plane. Hebecomes what is called a “projector of force” and can then produce results uponthe physical plane.e. His brain becomes consciously aware of the simultaneity of the above fourprocesses so that he passes into a new phase of conscious discipleship. Throughhis own soul and the Master’s sphere of influence the Plan lies open before him.I would point out that this is not only a higher stage of discipleship butpresupposes initiate understanding.The neophyte knows that the goal of the occultist is to work with forces. Hefails, however, to recognise that this may not be consciously done until—1. He has for a long time been simply a channel. I would have you reflect onthat thought. The attainment of the capacity to be a pure channel and anunimpeded distributor is the first goal and it takes a long time. The forceusually dispensed by a disciple, until the channel stage is automatic andestablished, is normally coloured by personality distinctiveness (even if a highgrade personality). [760] The time has to come when the disciple can, at will,distribute the ashramic and group-soul energy in their pure state.2. He has, therefore, to distribute energy and not force. There is muchconfusion in the minds of many disciples upon this matter. Until a man is aninitiate of high degree, he seldom dispenses energy. He works with forces andthey concern the three worlds. It has been said (esoterically) that “when thedisciple can distribute the four forces and make their seven notes heard, eachnote of the seven having a fourfold expression, he is not able to work withenergy. When he works with energy, he works with seven and not withtwenty-eight.” Reflect upon this. I would add that the twenty-eight belong tothe seven and when the disciple works with seven, he normally and automaticallyreleases the twenty-eight, working under the impression of the seven rayqualities.3. He has to learn the uses of distinction and of synthesis. Herein lies apotent occult hint of special use to workers.4. He is aware of the dangers incident to the untrained neophyte endeavouring todistribute forces, to direct so-called energies in a specific and particulardirection. He realises his goal is to be a channel for a long time throughpurity of life, correct orientation, and non-criticism. This correct orientationinvolves a paradox with which all disciples must wrestle, i.e., to be orientedto the soul, and, consequently, to the Ashram and to be oriented at the sametime to humanity. Only disciples close to the Master’s heart (technicallyunderstood) and, therefore, consciously aware of His aura have the right—I hadalmost said privilege—to direct force in specific directions. When their statusis not that, their task is to act as channels for the distribution of energy ina general and universal but not in a specific manner.A Master and, to a far higher extent, the Christ, suffers far more from those inHis Own household than from those in the outer world; His work is more impededby the advanced aspirants than by the intelligent thinkers. Bear this in mind atthis time. It was not the cruelty of the outer world of men which [761] causedthe depths of sorrow to the Christ when on earth; it was His Own disciples, plusthe massed sorrow—spread over the entire cycle of life, past, present andfuture—of humanity.Disciples gravitate into world groups and many of them are doing far moreefficient work than those gathered together into esoteric groups. The advancedaccepted disciple has always his own group which he gathers around him foractive and creative work. I would remind you of this. The gauge of a disciple’scapacity lies in his influence—through pen, word of mouth, and personalinfluence—upon other people.Under the Law of Correspondence, there is ever a numerical relation withestablished numerical entities. The six stages of discipleship are naturallyrelated to the six schools of Indian philosophy which were in reality the six“seed schools” for all philosophical surmise and work. There are not six typesof Ashrams corresponding to the six stages of discipleship because there areseven Ashrams (one for each ray type) and all the six stages of discipleship arerelated to all the Ashrams and all the seven ray types express (at some stage oftheir unfoldment upon the Path of Discipleship) these six steps towards thecentre.The centres, as used by the disciple in his unfolding progress, are dependentupon the ray type to a great extent but it is not my intention to take up thissubject of the centres in this series of instructions. I shall be dealing withthe subject at some length in the final part of A Treatise on the Seven Rays.I would like, however, to make clear at this point that the Master never uses adisciple’s centres as distributing agencies for force. In the last analysis, thecentres are (when functioning correctly) reservoirs of force and distributors ofenergy, coloured by specific quality and of a certain note, vibration, andstrength. On the final stages of the Path of Discipleship, they are entirelycontrolled by the soul, via the head centre, but it should be borne in mind thatafter the fourth initiation and the disappearance of the causal body, there isno form aspect or vehicle which can hold the disciple a prisoner or any waylimited. After the third initiation, the lower centres have no controlwhatsoever over the outer mechanism of response; from [762] the standpoint ofthe highest occult training and when the disciple is in the Ashram itself, thecentres are viewed as simply channels for energy. Until the time of the thirdinitiation, they assume temporary importance in the training process because itis through them that the disciple learns the nature of energy, its distinctionfrom force and the methods of distribution—the latter being one of the laststages in the training process.The constitution of the ego, or Soul, is the factor of paramount importance tothe Master in the task of training the disciple for hierarchical work. Thisnecessarily involves the three higher centres (head, heart and throat). It iswith the so-called egoic lotus that He is concerned and this is a point whichthe disciple is very apt to forget. The soul is pre-occupied with its own life;the details of the personality life (its inadequate expression or shadow in thethree worlds) simply make no impact whatsoever upon the soul consciousness. Asthe violence of the personality life grows, the soul which has been increasinglythe recipient of the best the aspiring personality has to offer and which hasbeen slowly turning its attention towards the mind of the personality, becomesalso aware of an opposing factor to true soul expression upon the outerperiphery of life. Then the battle of the higher pairs of opposites begins—thebattle between soul and personality, consciously waged on both sides. That isthe point to have in mind. This conflict culminates, prior to each of the firstthree initiations, in the confronting of the two opponents; the Dweller on theThreshold (of initiation, my brother) and the Angel of the Presence stand faceto face. But with that battle, we are not here concerned. We are occupied withthe theme of the response to hierarchical energy as embodied in the Master’saura and from thence transmitted to the disciple. The channel or channels ofdirection (there are three of them) might be expressed thus:I. The Hierarchy.1. The Master.2. The Ashram.3. The soul of the disciple.II. Humanity.1. The disciple. [763]2. The antahkarana.3. The three higher centres.This is the broad and general process, reaching from the universal (as far asthe individual disciple is concerned), to the particular, i.e., the disciple ina physical body.The detail of the descent of energy or of the process of spiritual inspiration(both these phrases pictorially present the concept of response to the Master’saura) might be put as follows:1. The Master’s aura.2. The egoic lotus or soul body.3. The inflow of ashramic energy, viaa. The sacrifice petals or the will aspect.b. The love petals or the love-wisdom aspect.c. The knowledge petals or the mind aspect.This process will be affected by the ray type of the disciple.4. The response from the disciple upon the physical plane and the receptivity ofhis centres to the activity engendered by the soul, under impression by theMaster would be as follows:a. The sacrifice petals would transmit energy to the head centre, via thesacrifice petals (three of them) to be found in the ring of petals immediatelyaround the “Jewel in the Lotus”; from thence to the sacrifice petal in the threelove petals and in the three knowledge petals. You, therefore, have fivetransmitting points of will-energy.b. The love petals similarly transmit love-energy to the heart centre, via thelove petals, again five in all.c. The knowledge petals transmit energy, the energy of intelligent activity, tothe throat centre, again in the same manner, via the five knowledge petals.This process going on in the egoic vehicle and registered by the disciple uponthe physical plane, produces eventually what could be called a “potent centre ofinvocation.” This [764] invoking centre evokes response from the Spiritual Triadso that eventually you have:I. The Spiritual Triad, the custodian of monadic energy.The atmic permanent atom.The sacrifice petals.The antahkarana.The physical permanent atom within the egoic lotus.The head centre.II. The Spiritual Triad.The buddhic permanent atom.The love petals.The antahkarana.The astral permanent atom within the egoic lotus.The heart centre.III. The Spiritual Triad.The manasic permanent atom.The knowledge petals.The antahkarana.The mental unit.The throat centre.These details, brother of mine, are of technical interest, are purely academicand constitute simply word symbols of an inevitable evolutionary process. Theydescribe the divine inspiration to which all human beings are subjected as anintegral part of the life of God Himself and one which is consciously registeredwhen a man reaches the stages of discipleship and initiation. They demonstrate,when rightly understood, the nature of the Science of the Breath. That Breath isall and in the method of invocation and evocation which underlies the entireprocess, you have a hint as to the structure and activity of the Heart of theSun, the organ of this second ray solar system, and the diastole and systolesystem of evolution which is found in the universal life process.PART IXEach time we consider the various stages of discipleship, it becomes moredifficult to give the neophyte a true picture of the state of consciousness andthe inner situation and relationships. [765] This is also due to the fact that Iam attempting to deal (in these more advanced stages) with awarenesses whichhave no parallel or correspondence in the experience of even the advancedaspirant. When we are considering the last three stages, we are definitelydealing with that which might be called the initiate-consciousness at a highstage of expansion and with knowledge for which we have no terminology.Is it not apparent to you that the initiate of high degree lives in a world ofreactions and of subtle phenomena which are totally unimaginable to the averagedisciple? He is, therefore, when functioning on the physical plane or in thethree worlds, only bringing the lowest aspect of his consciousness into play andaction. I have for years taught you, and your interest has been profound. Manyof the technicalities of the occult sciences are yours and you know muchtheoretically. This is evidenced by the interest shown and in the questionssubmitted. These dealt with the permanent atoms, their functioning andvitalisation.From the standpoint of the initiate such questions are of no moment; to beinterested in the permanent atoms is on a par with being interested in thenature of the gastric juices which make the process of living on the physicalplane a continuous rebuilding. The analogy is closer than you think. Occultlyspeaking, a constant consideration of the digestive system or of any other ofthe bodily functions leads to difficulty. Chronic invalids are frequently so(though not in every case) because of their physical pre-occupation with theform nature on the outer plane over a long period of years. It is possible (andI say this with deliberation) to have serious physical disability and yet to beso full of vitality and so uninterested in the physical mechanism that chronicinvalidism (as usually understood) is not possible. This is not the same thingas the triumph of mind over matter or the theory of perfect health; it is aquestion of a surmounting energy-emphasis which negates the imposition of forceeffects upon the consciousness. Ponder on this last sentence because it holdsthe key to the right handling of the health problem in the future.In the same way, a constant consideration of the permanent atoms and of thespirillae would lead to an intensification of [766] the form life and to thetyranny of force as it flows through them. There are undoubtedly analogies andcorrespondences that could be worked out in connection with the spirillae in themicrocosmic life and the planes and subplanes of the macrocosm with a possiblesubsequent relation of both to the seven centres, microcosmically understood,and the seven planetary schemes, macrocosmically understood. But the goal forthe majority of aspirants is not to limit their consciousness by a concentrationupon the minutiae, such as the permanent atoms and the details connected withthe individual form nature. The objective of each aspirant is to expand hisconsciousness to include that which lies beyond himself, to attain to the moreelevated states of consciousness in the life of the group and of humanity, andto integrate himself consciously into the Hierarchy, eventually into Shamballa,and occultly to “know” God in His many phases of all-inclusive extension andperfection.A close concentration upon and study of the spirillae and atoms would bescientifically and technically interesting and possible, but would not lead toincreased spiritual development but to personality emphasis and, therefore, toincreased difficulty in the treading of the Path. The more advanced a disciple,the more dangerous such emphasis and pre-occupation would be, whereas thescientist or the aspirant upon the Probationary Path could study such matterswith relative impunity because he would not bring in the energy which couldgalvanise these “points of force” into dangerous activity.For this reason I am not dealing with the permanent atoms as there is no needfor you to give time and consideration to them. If you are living as desired andif you are seeking to profit by my instructions, the training of the lowernature and the development of the forces which function as form “divinelyconsecrated,” will proceed normally and safely. I mentioned the permanent atomsto show the lines of energy distribution but not in order to indicate any needfor a mental interest in these aspects of form life.Stage VI. The Chela within the Master’s Heart.We arrive now at a consideration of the last of the six stages of discipleship.This was described by me in the following terms: [767]“The stage where the disciple is in close touch always; he is being definitelyprepared for immediate initiation or having taken initiation—is givenspecialised work. At this stage he is described as a Chela within his Master’sHeart.”One thing I would here emphasise as I seek to give some light upon this subject.Being within the Master’s Heart in no way indicates a love-relationship betweenMaster and disciple. The normal reaction is that at last the disciple hasmerited the right to be truly loved and, therefore, to be truly close to theMaster. His life or lives of service have brought him at last the reward; he hasnow free access to the Master in the closest possible and mutual relationship ofloving understanding. This stage of discipleship has absolutely no reference tothis at all.For another thing, brother of mine, when the disciple reaches this stage he isno longer what you understand by an accepted disciple. He is an initiate of highstanding and of elevated degree and has passed out of the supervision and thesafeguarding of a Master into a direct relation with the Master of all theMasters, the Christ, who is the central point in the Hierarchy, just as theMaster is the central point in an ashram. The Master is the heart of His groupand the Christ is the heart of the Hierarchy. The closer one gets torealisation, the clearer becomes the concept that the point at the centre andthe periphery are one.The significance of the word “heart” is the significance of life itself, as itbeats eternally at the very heart of the universe. Within that life, theinitiate now consciously stands, realising himself not so much as being arecipient of life, but as a distributor of life. This is a very different thingand holds the key to this stage of discipleship.The “Master’s Heart” is a technical term, indicating the sources of life andmany analogous interpretations. There is at this stage and after a certain majorinitiation, a direct line of energy or of life—sensed, recognised, active andutilised—between the conscious disciple and1. The disciple’s heart centre.2. The heart centre in the head. [768]3. The egoic lotus, which (until the fourth initiation) is the heart centre ofthe monadic life.4. The Master at the centre of His group.5. The Christ, the heart centre of the Hierarchy.6. The life of the Monad which begins to make itself felt at the thirdinitiation.7. The Lord of Life Himself, the heart centre of Shamballa.The line of relationship then extends from these onward and outward, and upward(spherically considered) to the Life at the very centre of our Earth’s “alterego,” the planet Venus, to Jupiter and thence to the solar Lord Himself and onto a point in the Sun, Sirius. You can see, therefore, how different this stageis from what might be imagined. It is one which marks a new departure orbeginning and a great transition. It is a stage which one enters through theopen door of Nirvana, the beginning of the Path of the Higher Evolution. It is astage which marks a specific location (if such an inappropriate word can beused) of the disciple upon that upward Way which is revealed by the lighted Way;it is the attainment of the innermost point of realisation, called esoterically“within the heart.”I spoke to you elsewhere about world disciples being “close to the Master’sheart.” This is not the same thing as being “within the Master’s heart.” Onerefers to the Master upon the disciple’s ray; the other refers to the Christ,the Synthesis within the Hierarchy of all the rays. The world today offersopportunity to all disciples to become world disciples, close to the Master’sheart, and to pass rapidly through the earlier stages of discipleship. It offersopportunity to world disciples to begin their approach to the Heart of theHierarchy, to Christ. It is with this first possibility that you should beconcerned, for—as you come closer to your group—you can begin to get thattraining which will develop in you world usefulness. Are the majority of you tooold to achieve this? That is for you to say. The soul knows no age and can useits instrument if it makes itself into a suitable and available instrument. Areyou too set and too pre-occupied with yourselves to achieve the detachmentneeded for world service? That is for you to find out and to prove toyourselves. This group has had much opportunity [769] offered to it and muchteaching. The output in devotion and service, demonstrated by this group, shouldbe quite unusual and it should be a group demonstration. I would ask if this isso? Are you too depressed (which is a synonym for selfishness) and too sensitiveto render service to humanity in a larger way than hitherto? That can beovercome if you care enough. Is your awareness a constant group-awareness? Or isit a constant self-awareness which comes consistently between you and yourfellowmen? That is for you to discover. Have you the deep humility—based on arealisation of the Plan and the glory of the goal—and not a sense ofself-depreciation over which you gloat and regard as an indication of spiritualhumility? You need to re-interpret this theme of humility, as well as all yourterms, in the light of the esoteric and spiritual values. Can you do this?Earlier, I used a phrase in which I referred to “disciples assembling, in thiscycle, at the call of the Hierarchy.” This has a definite relation at this timeto our theme of discipleship and its various stages. “The call of the Hierarchy”goes out to humanity as a whole; it is sent out through the medium of the groupsand Ashrams which are presided over by many of the Masters. It is caught andheard by many different types of people and in their response much distortion ofthat call creeps in; only the advanced disciple either brings it throughcorrectly or responds adequately. The others respond to partial aspects of thecall and their consequent activity is spasmodic, based upon erroneousinterpretations, coloured by personality faults, delayed by inertia and oftenselfishly based. By the response of the disciples in His group or Ashram, theMaster gauges the place and status of the disciple, though there are, of course,many other indicatory evidences.Let us look at some of the types of people who respond to the call. Most of themdo so unconsciously but react sympathetically, because something in themsynchronises with the call, or because they are sensitive to certain vibratoryinfluences.1. There are the true lovers of humanity, who, though they may have absolutelyno knowledge of esotericism, yet care enough to do what they can to help.Unconsciously, they can be used by the Hierarchy to do good and efficiently[770] selfless work. They are frequently more constructive than pledged oraccepted disciples, because they are unconscious of status, of anyresponsibility in an Ashram and of their individual importance.2. Psychics everywhere throughout the world and of all kinds. They respond tothose upon the astral plane who are catching the higher impression or whotelepathically get some aspect of the projected idea. In such cases there isalways glamour, distortion and misrepresentation. This causes much trouble butis a force with which the leaders and teachers of humanity must reckon. Itaffects the least intelligent of the masses of men and does give them somegeneral, even if distorted, idea of the Plan, but is apt to revolt theintellectual, and complicate the work of the trained disciple.3. Probationary disciples who receive and respond to the impression morepromptly and clearly than the above group. They usually receive it through thevision and teaching of a senior disciple. Their service to the Plan isfrequently spoiled by their ignorance, their self-centredness and theirmisrepresentation of the imparted teaching. Their approach both to the truth andto the teacher is too personal.4. Accepted disciples who get the Master’s idea and plans in far greatercompleteness, but fail often to work them out as they should be in the world ofdaily living and of service because they are so pre-occupied with their ownproblems as disciples, with their own character training, and with their statusin a Master’s Ashram and His interest in them. If they would forget themselves,their difficulties and their individual interpretations of truth, and just lovetheir fellowmen and each other, and if they would simply obey to the point ofcrucifixion the “order of Service,” they would pass more rapidly through thevarious stages of discipleship.5. Disciples close to the Master’s heart, world disciples and those who areconsciously in His aura, know His plan, which is the Plan of the Hierarchy as awhole, though emphasising some appropriate aspect. They usually play [771] theirpart successfully, and their success is largely due to their constant groupawareness and to a deep humility and, naturally, to a well-developed intellectand controlled astral body.There is little more that I can say to you all at this time anent the group workand relationships. There is an esoteric loyalty which is different to theordinary world loyalty which I seek to see developed in the group. Some of you,particularly those who take quick refuge in self-defense, need to learn thissilent loyalty which serves to integrate the group, as one. It is easy inself-defense to sacrifice one’s brothers and one’s fellow workers. It is noteasy to heal the subjective rift thus made.Clear thinking is needed along many lines as this group begins to cohere andwork together. An acute discrimination is also required. These are days when thelines of demarcation between the Forces of Materialism and the Forces of Lightmust be clearly defined. When the contrast between the way of love and goodwilland the way of cruelty and hate is being clearly defined on earth, disciplesmust exercise an unprejudiced attitude. To this group comes the difficult taskof standing firmly on the physical plane against that which is destructive andhateful (in the true sense of the word), doing all that can be done to bring thedestructive agencies to an end and to final powerlessness and, at the same time,preserving an inner attitude of complete harmlessness and loving understanding.For, my brothers, there are principles and ideals in the world at this timeworth struggling for, but whilst the struggle is on it is necessary consciouslyto preserve and create that field of living, loving energy which will eventuallybridge the gap between the two opposing factions and groups and so enable latercontact to be made. Some of you are not thinking with sufficient clarity aboutthe issues involved, being unduly engrossed with the outer signs of the struggleand so losing the long range picture. The dual life of active worldparticipation in opposing that which is seeking to hold back and to destroyhumanity and its highest ideals and—at the same time—to preserve a steadyattitude of love, is not an easy one, particularly for some of you. Such ishuman integration today that it is not possible for any person or groups ofpeople to isolate themselves away from [772] human activities and human welfare.Nor is a negative attitude adequate to the solution of the present world crisis.Those who refuse to share in the world karma and pain will find their entireprogress inevitably slowed down, for they will have put themselves outside thegreat tide of spiritual force now sweeping in regenerating streams throughoutthe world of men. The present world conflict is analogous to the stern conflictwhich is going on within the hearts and lives of all the world aspirants anddisciples and is inevitably a sign that they are setting their feet upon thePath of Conscious Discipleship. The higher Self and the personality meet face toface for the determination of that decision for which the soul (the Self) uponits own plane is waiting. This is what is also happening with the worldaspirant, Humanity, at this time. Ponder with care upon this idea. It is notpossible for members of the New Group of World Servers to divorce themselvesfrom the acute situation now to be seen and felt. They cannot and must notescape into a cul-de-sac of personal training and individual interests. If thatis your attitude, then there is little that I can do for you, for this wouldindicate to me an inability to differentiate in values, a desire to retreat inthought from the unhappy and the unpleasant and to shift responsibility on tothe shoulders of others, plus a failure to identify yourselves with humanity.The call to world salvage has gone out and today disciples are assembling allover the world. It is not an assembling upon the physical plane but a profoundsubjective happening. Each of the Masters is sending out the call and manyprobationary disciples, even though placed upon the furthest point in theperiphery of the Master’s influence, are responding with eagerness; theirmotives are normally mixed and their response is frequently galvanised by adesire for personality progress and aggrandisement. They are, at this particulartime, greatly complicating the call to service but their distortions arebringing about the fulfilment of the New Testament prophecy that (at the time ofthe end) there will be much distortion of the truth concerning the spread of theChrist consciousness and the return of the Christ, or the “Second Coming.”And so, from stage to stage the disciple passes, going from light to light, fromperception to perception, from force to [773] energy, from personality focus tosoul integration and, then, from soul to spirit, from form to life. He hasexplored all the avenues of knowledge; he has descended into the depths, intohell and into the valleys; he has climbed the mountain top of initiation andfrom there has swung out beyond space and time; he has lost all self-interestand is a focussed point of thought in the mind of God. Can I say more than this?I think not, my brothers. And so I bring to an end this series of instructionsand my responsibility in this connection is ended. Yours now begins.THE TIBETAN."},{"pageContent":"SECTION FOUR — SUMMARY OF THE TIBETAN’S WORK (1919-1943)[777] In 1919, during the month of November, I made a contact with Alice A.Bailey and asked her to do some writing for me and also to undertake thepublishing of certain books which— under the sequential giving out of truth—weredue to appear. She refused immediately, having no sympathy with the flood ofso-called occult literature being passed out to the public by the various occultgroups, having no experience in writing for the public, and having also aprofound dislike of every form of psychic writing and of psychic work. Later,she changed her mind when I explained to her that telepathic rapport was aproven thing and a matter of scientific interest, that she was neitherclairaudient or clairvoyant and never would be and that (above all) the test oftruth was the truth itself. I told her that if she would write for a period of amonth, the material transcribed would prove to her whether it contained truth,whether it evoked intuitive understanding and recognition and whether it had init that which might be of value in the new spiritual era which was impending.She, therefore, overcame her disgust of this type of work and of the many occultpresentations of truth which were prevalent; she only stipulated that thewriting should go out with no claims whatsoever and that the teachings shouldstand or fall on their own merits.The first book published was Initiation, Human and Solar . This was the resultof her first effort to do this kind of work; it laid the foundation of all thesucceeding books. Since then she has written for me for nearly twenty-fiveyears. The books have gone out in line with a deep, underlying purpose which itmay interest you to know about and they have received a worldwide recognition.Initiation, Human and Solar was intended to bring the fact of the Hierarchy topublic attention. This had been done by H.P.B. by inference and statement butnot in any sequential form. The Theosophical Society had taught the fact of the[778] Masters, though H.P. Blavatsky (in a communication to the EsotericSection) stated that she bitterly regretted so doing. This teaching wasmisinterpreted by later theosophical leaders and they made certain basicmistakes. The Masters Whom they portrayed were characterised by an impossibleinfallibility, because the Masters are Themselves evolving; the teaching givenendorsed an engrossing interest in self-development and an intense focussingupon personal unfoldment and liberation; the people who were indicated asinitiates and senior disciples were entirely mediocre with no influence outsidethe Theosophical Society itself; complete devotion to the Masters was alsoemphasised—devotion to Their personalities. These Masters were also shown asinterfering with the organisation life of the various occult groups whichclaimed to be working under Their direction. They were made responsible for themistakes of the leaders of the groups who took refuge under such statements as:The Master has instructed me to say, etc., the Master wants the following workto be done, or the Master wants the membership to do thus and so. Those whoobeyed were regarded as good members; those who refused to be interested andobedient were looked upon as renegades. The freedom of the individual wasconstantly infringed and the weaknesses and ambitions of the leaders wereprovided with an alibi. Knowing all this well, A.A.B. refused to be a party toany such constantly recurring activity, for such is the history of practicallyall the known occult groups which attract the attention of the public. Even hadI wanted to work in such a way (which no one affiliated with the Hierarchy everdoes), I would have found no collaboration from her.Letters on Occult Meditation followed next. These indicated a somewhat newapproach to meditation, based not on devotion to the Masters but on arecognition of the soul in each person. This was succeeded by A Treatise onCosmic Fire. This book was an expansion of the teaching given in The SecretDoctrine on the three fires—electric fire, solar fire and fire by friction—andit was an awaited sequence; it also presented the psychological key to TheSecret Doctrine and is intended to offer study to disciples and initiates at theclose of this century and the beginning of the next century, up until 2025 A.D.[779] Later A.A.B. felt that it would be of value to me and to the work if shedemonstrated that she could write books (useful to students) apart fromtranscribing my writings and taking down my notes, rendering them into thethought-provoking English which together we have developed as a medium fortransmission of the ideas which it is my dharma to make public. The averagepsychic and medium is not usually of a high-grade intelligence and A.A.B.desired to prove (for the aiding of the work of the future) that one could dodefinitely psychic work and be of a real intelligence. She has, therefore,written four books which are entirely her own production:The Consciousness of the Atom.The Soul and Its Mechanism.From Intellect to Intuition.From Bethlehem to Calvary.She has also written one book in collaboration with me, entitled The Light ofthe Soul ; in it I give the translation of the Sanskrit Sutras of Patanjali andshe contributes the commentary, referring to me occasionally for reassurance asto meaning.Then followed A Treatise on White Magic . This was written years ago. As it waswritten it went out, chapter by chapter, to the senior students of the ArcaneSchool as reading matter only. It is the first book ever given out upon thetraining and control of the astral or emotional body. Many occult books havebeen written upon the subject of the physical body and its purification and uponthe etheric or vital body; most of them have been compilations of other books,both ancient or modern. This book of mine, however, is intended to train themodern aspirant in the control of his astral body, by the aid of the mind asthat mind is, in its turn, illumined by the soul.The next book undertaken was A Treatise on the Seven Rays. It is a long book,not yet completed. It is taking shape in four volumes, two of which are alreadypublished, one is ready for publication and the final volume is in process ofwriting. Volumes one and two deal with the seven rays and their sevenpsychological types and thus lay the foundation for the new psychology for whichmodern psychology, materialistic as it may be, has laid a sound basis. Volumethree is entirely given over to the subject of esoteric astrology and forms aunit [780] in itself. It is intended to launch the new astrology which isfounded on the soul and not on the personality. Orthodox astrology sets up achart which gives the fate and destiny of the personality, and when thatpersonality is little evolved or is only of an average development, it can beand often is amazingly correct. It is not so correct, however, in the case ofhighly developed people, aspirants, disciples and initiates who are beginning tocontrol their stars and consequently their actions; the events and thehappenings in their lives then become unpredictable. The new and futureastrology endeavours to give the key to the horoscope of the soul, as it isconditioned by the soul ray and not by the personality ray; enough has beengiven by me to enable astrologers, who are interested and of the newinclination, to work out the future from the angle of this new approach.Astrology is a fundamental and most necessary science. A.A.B. is not well versedin astrology; she cannot set up a chart nor could she tell you the names of theplanets with the houses which they rule. I am, therefore, entirely responsiblefor all that appears in this and all my books, except, as before explained, theone book, The Light of the Soul.The fourth volume deals with the subject of healing, and with the bridging, bythe antahkarana, of the gap which exists between the Monad and the personality;it also gives the Fourteen Rules which those in training for initiation have tomaster. Again, I would call your attention to this last theme, reminding youthat the true initiate has never made the slightest claim, either privately orpublicly, to be an initiate. It is against the occult law and too many people ofno particular spiritual focus or intellectual capacity make these claims andconsequent harm has ensued, thus lowering the idea of the Hierarchy and thenature of adeptship in the eyes of the watching public. I am, therefore,entirely responsible for the Fourteen Rules and their elucidation andapplication. A.A.B. has never claimed to be more than a working disciple,occupied with world work (which no one can deny) and has re-iterated again andagain that the word “disciple” is the legitimate and non-controversial word (aswell as the truthful word) to be used for all grades of workers in the Hierarchyfrom the probationary disciple, [781] loosely affiliated with certain disciplesin that Hierarchy, up to and including the Christ Himself, the Master of all theMasters and the Teacher alike of Angels and of men. She has steadily setherself, with my full approval, against the unwholesome curiosity as to statusand title which is a blight on so many occult groups, leading to the full tideof competition, jealousy, criticism and claim-making which distinguishes themajority of the occult groups, which renders futile so many of theirpublications and which hinders the general public from receiving the teaching inits purity and simplicity. Status and title, place and position count fornothing. It is the teaching that counts —its truth and its intuitive appeal.This you must constantly bear in mind. The accepted disciples of a Master whoarrive at recognition of Him from within themselves—a recognition which can thenbe corroborated by their fellow disciples and used by the Master Himself as afactual condition—know their Master, accept teaching from Him and amongthemselves speak of Him as He is to them but not to the outside world. Thepapers lately printed in The Beacon and inadequately censored were given by me,as a Master, to the members of a group within my Ashram. This group haspreserved my anonymity for more than a decade, which was their correct andobvious duty.The books, therefore, have been going out steadily for years. When A Treatise onthe Seven Rays is completed, a short book on glamour ready for the press andthis book on DISCIPLESHIP IN THE NEW AGE is in the hands of the public, then thework of A.A.B. for me will be over, she can resume her work in the Ashram of herown Master—the work of His disciple.The next phase of the work which I sought to see accomplished is now in workingorder. It was my wish (as it is the wish of many associated with the Hierarchy)to see an esoteric school started which would leave the membership free, whichwould bind them by no pledges or oaths and which would—whilst assigningmeditation, study and giving esoteric teaching—leave people to make their ownadjustments, to interpret the truth as best they could, to present to them themany points of view and at the same time communicate to them the deepestesoteric truths which they could recognise if there was that in [782] them whichwas awakened to the mysteries and which, even when read or heard, could do themno harm if they lacked the perception to recognise the truth for what it was.Such a school was started in 1923 by Alice A. Bailey with the aid of FosterBailey and certain students of vision and spiritual understanding. She made it acondition that I should have nothing to do with the Arcane School, and that Ishould have no control over its policies and curriculum. Even my books were notused as textbooks and only during the past three years has one of them, ATreatise on White Magic, been adopted as a course of study and that at the veryearnest request of many students. Also, some of the teaching upon theantahkarana (which will appear in the fifth volume of the Treatise on the SevenRays ) has been used for two years in one section of the fourth degree, entitledWeavers in the Light . The teaching on glamour has been given as some of thereading matter for another section.No obedience is expected in the Arcane School, no emphasis is laid on “obeyingthe Master,” for no Master is running the school. Emphasis is laid upon the oneMaster in the heart, the soul, the true spiritual man within each human being;no theology is taught; the student is under no compulsion to accept anyinterpretation or presentation of truth; he can accept or reject the fact of theMasters, of the Hierarchy, of reincarnation, or of the soul and still remain amember of the school in good standing. No loyalty is expected or asked, eitherto the school or to A.A.B. Students can work in any of the occult, esoteric,metaphysical or orthodox groups and churches and still be members of the school.They are asked to look upon such activities as fields of service wherein theycan express any spiritual help they may have gained through their work in theschool. Leaders and senior workers in many occult groups are working in theArcane School, but they feel perfectly free to give their time, loyalty andservice to their own groups.This school has been in existence for twenty years and is now entering into anew cycle of growth and usefulness—along with the whole of humanity—and for thisdue preparation is being made. The keynote of the school is service , based onlove of humanity. The meditation work is balanced and paralleled by study and bythe effort to teach the students to serve.[783] Another phase of my work came into existence about ten years ago when Istarted to write certain pamphlets for the general public, calling attention tothe world situation and to the New Group of World Servers. I thus endeavoured toanchor on earth (if I may use such a phrase) an externalisation or a symbol ofthe work of the Hierarchy. It was an effort to band together subjectively and(where possible) objectively all those people of spiritual purpose and deep loveof humanity who were actively working in many countries, either in organisationsor alone. Their name is legion. Some few are known to the workers in the school.Thousands are known to me but not to them; all are working under the inspirationof the Hierarchy and are, either consciously or unconsciously, fulfilling theduties of agents of the Masters. Together they form a band, closely knit on theinner side by spiritual intention and love. Some are occultists, working in thevarious occult groups; some are mystics, working with vision and love; othersbelong to the orthodox religions and some recognise no spiritual affiliations,so-called, at all. All are, however, animated by a sense of responsibility forhuman welfare and have interiorly pledged themselves to help their fellowmen.This great group constitutes the World Saviour at this time and will salvage theworld and inaugurate the new era after the war. The pamphlets which I wrote (thefirst of which was called The Next Three Years ) indicated their plans andpurposes, and made suggestions as to modes and methods of cooperation with thisgroup of World Servers, already in existence and active in many fields.Those whom the New Group of World Servers influence and with whom they seek towork and who can act as their agents, we call the men and women of goodwill. Imade an effort to reach these people in 1936 when there was a faint possibilitythat the war even at that late hour might be averted. Many will remember thatcampaign and its relative success. Millions were reached by means of the spokenand written word and by the radio but there were not enough people, spirituallyinterested, to take the needed steps to stem the tide of hate, evil andaggression which threatened to engulf the world. The war broke out in 1939 inspite of all the efforts of the Hierarchy [784] and Their workers, and thegoodwill work fell naturally into abeyance. That part of the work in whichmembers of the Arcane School had sought to serve and which had resulted in theforming of nineteen centres for service in as many countries had temporarily tobe dropped—but only temporarily, my brothers, for goodwill is the “saving force”and an expression of the will-to-good which animates the New Group of WorldServers.I would emphasise that this work of anchoring the New Group of World Servers andorganising the goodwill work has nothing whatsoever to do with the school exceptin so far that members in the school were given the opportunity to help in themovement. They were left entirely free to do so or not as they chose; a verylarge percentage ignored the effort altogether, thus demonstrating the freedomwhich they felt and had been taught.When the war broke and the entire world was hurled into the consequent chaos,horror, disaster, death and agony, many spiritually minded people were anxiousto stay aloof from the struggle. They were not the majority but a powerful andnoisy minority. They regarded any attitude of partisanship as an infringement ofthe law of brotherhood and were willing to sacrifice the good of the whole ofhumanity to a sentimental urge to love all men in a manner which necessitatedtheir taking no action or decision of any kind. Instead of “my country right orwrong,” it was “humanity, right or wrong.” When I wrote the pamphlet called ThePresent World Crisis and the succeeding papers on the world situation, I statedthat the Hierarchy endorsed the attitude and aims of the United Nations,fighting for the freedom of the whole of humanity and for the release of thesuffering people. This necessarily placed the Hierarchy in the position of notendorsing the Axis position in any way. Many in the goodwill work and some fewin the school interpreted this as political in import, presumably believing thata position of complete neutrality, where both good and evil are concerned, wasdemanded of spiritually inclined people. Such people fail to think clearly andconfuse an unwillingness to take sides with brotherly love, forgetting the wordsof the Christ that “he who is not with me is against me.” [785] Let me repeatwhat I have oft said before. The Hierarchy and all its members, includingmyself, love humanity but they will not endorse evil, aggression, cruelty andthe imprisoning of the human soul. They stand for liberty, for opportunity forall to move forward along the way of light, for human welfare withoutdiscrimination, for kindness and the right of every man to think for himself, tospeak and to work. Necessarily they cannot, therefore, endorse the nations orthe people in any nation who are against human freedom and happiness. In Theirlove and Their grasp of circumstance, They know that in a later life or livesthe majority of those who are now the enemies of human freedom will themselvesbe free and tread the Lighted Way. In the meantime, the entire force of theHierarchy is thrown on the side of the nations struggling to free humanity, andon the side of those in any nation who thus work. If being on the side ofgoodness and freedom is deemed detrimental to the spiritual issues, then theHierarchy will work to change the attitude of people as to what is spiritual.I have, therefore, been interested in three phases of the work: the books, theArcane School, and the New Group of World Servers. The impact made upon theworld by these three aspects of the work has been definitely effective anduseful. The sum total of the useful work accomplished is what counts and not thecriticisms and the misunderstanding of those who, basically, belong to the oldorder, and to the Piscean Age. They are, therefore, unable to see the emergenceof the new ways of life and the new approaches to truth.I have stood all this time behind the scenes. The books and pamphlets have beenmy responsibility and carry the authority of truth—if truth is there —and notthe authority of my name or of any status which I might claim, or which might beclaimed for me by the curious, the inquisitive and the devotee. I have dictatednone of the policies of the school or interfered in its curriculum; for themA.A.B. is responsible. My books and pamphlets have been made available to schoolstudents along with the rest of the general public.I have sought to aid the goodwill work (for which Foster Bailey is responsible)by suggestion and by indicating what is the work that the New Group of WorldServers are seeking to [786] do, but no authoritative requests have been made inmy name, nor will they ever be made. The sum total of all these activities hasbeen good; the misunderstandings have been few and have been inherent in thepersonal equipment and attitude of the critical. Criticism is wholesome so longas it is not permitted to become destructive.Paralleling these major activities, I have, since the year 1931, been training agroup of men and women, scattered all over the world, in the techniques ofaccepted discipleship, academically understood. Out of the many possibleneophytes, I indicated a group of approximately 45 people—some known personallyto A.A.B. and some quite unknown—who had demonstrated a willingness to betrained and who could be tried out for fitness for the group work of the newdiscipleship. These people received direct personal instructions from me andcertain general instructions which embodied the newer approach to the Hierarchyand to the spiritual life, though based, of course, on the ancient rules. Someof these instructions are made available to the general public in this book, butno indication is given of the persons thus trained and no information will bemade available; names, dates and locations are changed, though the instructionsremain as given.Necessarily these people have, from their contact with me, ascertained myidentity. They have known for years who I am. But they have preserved myanonymity with great care and under real difficulty, owing to the fact thathundreds of people in nearly every country in the world have speculated upon myidentity and many of them have guessed it accurately. Therefore, today, in spiteof all that A.A.B. and my disciples have been able to do, it is generallyconceded that I am a Master and a name has been given to me. To my own group ofspecially picked aspirants I have acknowledged my name when they themselves hadinteriorly arrived at it . It was both foolish and false to do otherwise; incommunicating with them or in writing instructions on the new discipleship, Inecessarily took my rightful position and name. Some of these instructions havebeen deemed by me as useful and appropriate for more general use and wereembodied in the series of papers upon the Stages of Discipleship issued under myname in The Beacon. They [787] were carefully edited, prior to publication,except in one paper when, some months ago under the pressure of very heavy work,A.A.B. omitted to delete one paragraph in which I do speak as a Master. Thisparagraph, much to her distress, appeared in the July 1943 Beacon . After manyyears of protecting my identity, she made this slip and it has, therefore, beenpublicly stated that I am a Master.In this connection, there are three points to which I would like to call yourattention.Earlier—many years earlier—I stated in A Treatise on White Magic that I was aninitiate of a certain standing but that my anonymity would be preserved. Yearslater, owing to this mistake, I am apparently in the position of contradictingor reversing myself, and so changing my policy. Actually I am not doing so. Thespread of the teaching alters circumstances and the need of humanity demands attimes a changed approach. There is nothing static in the evolution of truth. Ithas long been my intention to do all that was necessary to bring the fact of theHierarchy and its membership more definitely before the public and in a morearresting way.Years ago, I definitely told A.A.B. (as did her own Master) that her major dutyas a disciple was to familiarise the public with the true nature of the Mastersof the Wisdom, and thus offset the erroneous impression which the public hadreceived. This she has done to a certain degree but not to the full extent thatwas intended. She has shrunk from the task, owing to the disrepute into whichthe whole subject has fallen because of the false presentations given out by thevarious teachers and occult groups, plus the ridiculous claims put out by theignorant about us. H.P.B., her predecessor, stated in certain instructions sentout to the Esoteric Section of the Theosophical Society that she bitterlyregretted ever mentioning the Masters, Their names and functions. A.A.B. hasbeen of the same opinion. The Masters, as portrayed in the Theosophical Societyfaintly resemble the reality; much good has been done by this testimony to Theirexistence, and much harm by the foolish detail at times imparted. They are notas pictured; They do not issue orders to Their followers (or rather devotees) todo thus and so, to form this or that organization, nor do They indicate [788]certain individuals as being of supreme importance and hierarchical status; Theyknow full well that disciples, initiates and Masters are known by their works,their deeds and their words; they have to prove their status by the work theyaccomplish.The Masters work through Their disciples in many organisations; They do notexact, through these disciples, the implicit obedience of the organisationmembers, nor do They exclude from the teaching those who disagree with theorganisational policies or the interpretations of the leaders. They are notseparative and antagonistic to the groups working under various disciples orother Masters, and any organisation in which the Masters are interested would beinclusive and not exclusive. They do not fight over personalities, endorsingthis one or rejecting that one simply because the policies of an organisationalleader are, or are not, upheld. They are not the spectacular and ill-bred peopleportrayed by the mediocre leaders of many groups, nor do They choose (for Theirpledged disciples and prominent workers) men and women who, even from a worldlypoint of view, are of a pronounced inferiority or who deal in claim-making andin the art of attracting attention to themselves. To be a probationary disciple,one can be a devotee; the emphasis can then be laid on purification and theacquiring of an intelligent understanding of brotherhood and human need; to bean accepted disciple, working directly under the Masters and active in worldwork (with a growing influence) requires a mental polarisation, a heartdevelopment and a sense of real values.Knowing all the above, and having watched the ill effects of the usual teachinggiven anent the Masters, A.A.B. has gone to extremes in order to present thetrue nature of the Hierarchy, its goals and personnel; she has sought to lay theemphasis—as does the Hierarchy itself—on humanity and on world service, and noton a group of Teachers who, even if They have transcended the usual personalityproblems and experience in the three worlds, are still in process of trainingand are preparing Themselves (under the tuition of the Christ) to tread “the Wayof the Higher Evolution,” as it is called. The name given to us by somedisciples in Tibet gives the clue to our point of attainment. They call theHierarchy the “society of organised [789] and illumined Minds” —illumined bylove and understanding, by deep compassion and inclusiveness, illumined by aknowledge of the plan and aiming to comprehend the purpose, sacrificing Theirown immediate progress in order to help humanity. That is a Master.The second point I would make is in the form of a question. What harm does it doif some one points the finger towards a Master and recognises Him as such,provided His record substantiates the statement and His influence is worldwide?If by this inadvertent slip, A.A.B. has thus indicated me as a Master, has anyharm been done? My books, the carriers of my influence, have gone to the farcorners of the earth and convey aid and help; the goodwill work which Isuggested, and which F.B. is carrying out voluntarily, has reached literallymillions of people by pamphlet and radio, by the use of the great Invocations,by the work of the Triangles and by the words and example of the men and womenof goodwill.The third point I would bring to your attention is that in the new cycle whichwill come at the close of the war, the fact of the Hierarchy and the work of theMasters—through Their disciples —must and will be brought to public attention.Disciples everywhere will present increasingly the hierarchical plan ofbrotherhood, spiritual living and inclusiveness to the world; this will be donenot in terms (so prevalent among the foolish) of “The Master has chosen me,” or“the Master stands behind my effort” or “I am the representative of theHierarchy” but by a life of service, by indicating that the Masters exist andare known to many men everywhere; that the plan is one of evolutionarydevelopment and educational progress towards an intelligent spiritual goal; thathumanity is not alone but that the Hierarchy stands, that Christ is with Hispeople, that the world is full of disciples unrecognised because silentlyworking; that the New Group of World Servers exists; that the men and women ofgoodwill are everywhere; that the Masters are not the least interested inpersonalities but will use men and women of all attitudes, faiths, andnationalities, provided that love motivates them, that they are intelligent andhave trained minds and that they have also magnetic and radiant influences whichwill attract people to truth and goodness but not to the individual—[790] be hea Master or a disciple. They care nothing for personal loyalties but arededicated solely to the relief of distress and the promotion of the evolution ofhumanity and the indication of spiritual goals. They look not for recognition ofTheir work or the praise of Their contemporaries but only for the growth of thelight within the world and the unfoldment of the human consciousness.THE TIBETAN* * *The sons of men are one, and I am one with them.I seek to love, not hate;I seek to serve and not exact due service;I seek to heal, not hurt.~Let pain bring due reward of light and love.Let the soul control the outer form,And life, and all events,And bring to light the LoveThat underlies the happenings of the time.~Let vision come and insight.Let the future stand revealed.Let inner union demonstrate and outer cleavages be gone.Let love prevail.Let all men love."},{"pageContent":"THE ARCANE SCHOOLTraining for new age discipleshipis provided by the Arcane School.The principles of the Ageless Wisdomare presented through esoteric meditation,study and service as a way of life.Contact the publishers for information.www.lucistrust.org/arcaneschool [http://www.lucistrust.org/arcaneschool]"},{"pageContent":"INDEXAAbstract levels—ecstasy, 326, 327utilisation, 328Abstraction—means of alignment, 253occult in healing, 347, 349right definition, 314Accuracy, need for, 326-328Action—clear-cut, growth in, 600, 603fruits in services, 144seasons for in developing powers, 50Activity—excessive, Ray influence, 586objective, necessity for, glamour, 135two lines, simultaneous pursuit, 230Age—56, importance, 596, 597ignoring by soul, 768Aid to disciples, registering, training in, 123Air, more, need for, 141Ajna centre—awakened, symbol, 468awakening, 116consciousness in, 547energy to in meditation, 212-213functions, 213, 495linking with heart centre, 267, 268magnetic vibration, intensification, 664right control, 111-112, 114stimulation, 294used by groups, 41Aligning qualities, demonstration, 257Alignment—breathing for, 253cultivated, effects, 59development; need, 126effect upon love of soul, 294effectiveness, guarantee, 533factor in healing, 190focussed, 568for holding mind steady, 298for illumination, 606function in receipt of messages, 68in meditation.
