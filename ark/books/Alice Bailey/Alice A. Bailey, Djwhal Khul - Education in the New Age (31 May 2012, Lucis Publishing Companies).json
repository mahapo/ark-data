I live in a physical body like other men, on theborders of Tibet, and at times (from the exoteric standpoint) preside over alarge group of Tibetan lamas, when my other duties permit. It is this fact thathas caused it to be reported that I am an abbot of this particular lamasery.Those associated with me in the work of the Hierarchy (and all true disciplesare associated in this work) know me by still another name and office. A.A.B.knows who I am and recognises me by two of my names.I am a brother of yours, who has travelled a little longer upon the Path thanhas the average student, and has therefore incurred greater responsibilities. Iam one who has wrestled and fought his way into a greater measure of light thanhas the aspirant who will read this article, and I must therefore act as atransmitter of the light, no matter what the cost. I am not an old man, as agecounts among the teachers, yet I am not young or inexperienced. My work is toteach and spread the knowledge of the Ageless Wisdom wherever I can find aresponse, and I have been doing this for many years. I seek also to help theMaster M. and the Master K.H. whenever opportunity offers, for I have been longconnected with Them and with Their work. In all the above, I have told you much;yet at the same time I have told you nothing which would lead you to offer methat blind obedience and the foolish devotion which the emotional aspirantoffers to the Guru and Master Whom he is as yet unable to contact. Nor will hemake that desired contact until he has transmuted emotional devotion intounselfish service to humanity-not to the Master.The books that I have written are sent out with no claim for their acceptance.They may, or may not, be correct, true and useful. It is for you to ascertaintheir truth by right practice and by the exercise of the intuition. Neither Inor A.A.B. is the least interested in having them acclaimed as inspiredwritings, or in having anyone speak of them (with bated breath) as being thework of one of the Masters. If they present truth in such a way that it followssequentially upon that already offered in the world teachings, if theinformation given raises the aspiration and the will-to-serve from the plane ofthe emotions to that of the mind (the plane whereon the Masters can be found)then they will have served their purpose. If the teaching conveyed calls forth aresponse from the illumined mind of the worker in the world, and brings aflashing forth of his intuition, then let that teaching be accepted. But nototherwise. If the statements meet with eventual corroboration, or are deemedtrue under the test of the Law of Correspondences, then that is well and good.But should this not be so, let not the student accept what is said.August 1934"},{"pageContent":"THE GREAT INVOCATIONFrom the point of Light within the Mind of GodLet light stream forth into the minds of men.Let Light descend on Earth.From the point of Love within the Heart of GodLet love stream forth into the hearts of men.May Christ return to Earth.From the centre where the Will of God is knownLet purpose guide the little wills of men—The purpose which the Masters know and serve.From the centre which we call the race of menLet the Plan of Love and Light work out.And may it seal the door where evil dwells.Let Light and Love and Power restore the Plan on Earth.“The above Invocation or Prayer does not belong to any person or group but toall Humanity.

BAILEY"},{"pageContent":"PREFACE - EDUCATIONAL TRENDS IN A WORLD CRISIS[v] This book on educational philosophy comes at a time of crisis, for the themethat runs through critical thinking in the field of educational theory today ischaracterized by deep concern over both the preservation and the enrichment ofhuman values. Can we maintain our democratic individualism in the face of thestandardizing forces of the Western machine civilization which may also engulfthe Eastern world? Can we offset the totalitarianisms which deify thematerialism of an increasingly industrial culture?In May of this year (1953) I attended a two-day seminar in Chicago, sponsored byThe Center for the Study of Liberal Education for Adults, a subdivision of theFord Foundation, created to express the growing concern of our times for thespiritual basis of our civilization. In the statement of the problem which ourgroup was to study, Education in a Democratic Society, we were informed asfollows:\"Education must meet the needs of the human spirit. It must assist persons todevelop a satisfactory personal philosophy and sense of values, to cultivatetastes for literature, music and the arts; to grow in ability to analyzeproblems and arrive at thoughtful conclusions.\"This statement demands a re-examination of our educational theory and practice.A survey of current developments proves that, at long last, the professionaleducators are clarifying a common philosophy and are consciously striving todelineate a theory of education adequate to the new world that is emerging. Insuch a philosophy three fundamental needs must be met: (l) a psychologicaltheory of the human person to be \"educated\"; (2) a social theory of the kind of[vi] society one is trying to create or preserve as a suitable home for thecultural ideals promulgated; and (3) a world view or cosmology, a theory ofman's place in the universe in which man is spectator and actor.Our problem is to attain the kind of overall synthesis that Marxism andneo-Scholasticism provide for their followers, but to get this by the freelychosen cooperative methods that Dewey advocated. In the broadest terms such aworld-view will make possible a planetary civilization by integrating whatevertrans-temporal and trans-spatial truths about man and the universe we canextract from all regional cultures in their local times and places. Theseuniversal principles will then provide the norms for Education in the New Age,as the Tibetan terms it.The world today suffers from a cultural provincialism based on the dualism of anoutward-looking, objective attitude of the Western world, and an inwardness orsubjectivity of Oriental societies. Each of these civilizations, in its extremeform, is over-balanced in its own direction. In harmonious living, man mustintegrate both ideals to achieve wholeness for himself and his world. This, itseems to me, is one important theme of the present work.For the future, the remedy for the social schisms and psychological fissionsthat have handicapped and obstructed our modern efforts to overcome thedivisions of humanity, lies in a restoration of unity of principles upon whichan integration of human values and achievements can be attempted. Theeducational implications of this development are clear. As the Tibetanindicates, on subjective levels we must provide for the resynthesis of humanpersonality and for the overcoming of the double consciousness that has resultedfrom the cultural fission which made the \"self-negation\" of the peacefulcivilization of the Orient the overpowering concept of its culture, and theaggressive \"individualism\" of the Occident the ideal of Western man.Accordingly, we need not only the political synthesis of a [vii] WorldFederation in which the Eastern and Western hemispheres function like the rightand left lobes of man's brain, with the seat of the World Brain serving as thepoint of decussation of the planetary nerves, but we need also a planetary wayof life, a planetary ethics, and a planetary way of feeling to supply thepowerful drive we shall require for the great tasks that lie ahead of us.The time to resynthesize the objective and subjective, the extrovert and theintrovert civilizations and to achieve a great orchestration of culture is now.Japan was not aggressive until the country learned the trick from the West.Before her doors were forced, her arts and philosophy were in tune with orientaltradition. When she adopted Western technology, she threw overboard her ancientculture. What happened in Japan can happen in the rest of the Orient, butwhereas Japan was a relatively small country, China, India and their neighborsare vast and populous. Heaven help us if they re-enact the history of Japan. Ouractivity in the resynthesizing of the world must include, through our ownefforts to understand and appreciate, an appeal to the Orient to preserve anddevelop the fundamental values in its regional cultures. While the West isseeking the principles upon which peaceful and fruitful living can be founded,the East may provide us with the counter-balance to our aggressive materialism.If this new synthesis is to restore cultural and spiritual unity in mankind, theOccidental world will have to acquire humility when it turns to the Orient. TheOriental world will not, because of its inherent nature, generate the physicalenergy to go to the West. We Westerners went into the East in search ofmarkets—outlets for the products of our mechanical power—and we must return toour own world, magnetized by the subjective energies of the East and consciousof it. Our aggressive commercial penetration of Oriental lands and peoples hashad the end result of bringing the literature, the philosophy and the arts ofthe East into the [viii] West as uncalculated dividends. We can, if we choose,make use of the vast heritage of Oriental culture available to us, even in ourneighborhood libraries.Our main hope of survival in this highly polarized world lies in a prodigiouseffort at synthesis of the two cultures while there is still time. Should theOrient deny us that time and decide to meet us merely on our own grounds, thenthis might write finis to the story for all of us, East and West.During our industrial and expansionist age there have been increasing evidencesof the permeating power of Oriental thought in the fields of science, philosophyand the arts of the West. Psychosomatic medicine, parapsychology, Jung'sanalytical psychology are only a few indications of contemporaryinwardly-oriented researches. The re-entry of the spiritual factor in life andeducation is something more than a recrudescence of some earlier forms ofChristian ideology.In this education for the New Age, the type of East-West philosophy presented bythe Tibetan will find its proper setting. Here we have the elements of acomplete theory, as follows:(a) Subjective Planning; a theory of the creative self-development of theindividual.(b) Objective Planning; a theory of the good society for human persons to livein.The psychological and social implications of the education for the New Age mustbe stated as explicitly as possible. The next step is to test the validity ofthe principles in concrete applications. The testing must be done in terms ofoperational techniques relevant to the Hindu psychology, rather than by Westernpositivistic procedures. Until this program has been given a fair trial, it is awaste of time to attempt to prejudge the issue. Yet it is not necessary toconsider the ancient East and the modern West approaches [ix] as two mutuallyexclusive alternatives. In some instances the approaches are merely two\"languages\" for stating universal truths about human nature and we are not facedwith an either-or antithesis. Intertranslation may reduce the strangeness ofterminology. For example, the Tibetan's view that \"meditation is thinking thingsthrough\" is good Dewey doctrine. As the elements of unfamiliarity diminish,understanding is facilitated.That the research project so briefly sketched is not some vague philosophicalphantasy but an urgent and immediate need is indicated by a document drawn up bythe Department for Cultural Activities of UNESCO which formulated the theme fordiscussion in these terms: \"The Concept of Man and the Philosophy of Educationin East and West.\" Here it is stated:\"Unesco could not remain indifferent to this problem (of East and West); it wasbound to face it squarely in the present circumstances of the world, broughtabout by the increasingly rapid process of unification, the reduction ofdistances, the growing importance of technology, the gradual attainment by allpeoples of political independence and international responsibility and, aboveall, the disquiet and perplexity prevailing among the two great civilizations ofyesterday, ready to give birth to the one civilization of tomorrow but coweringunder the threat of a world crisis far beyond their capacity to control.\"In an article on Our Goal Is Unity in The Free World of October, 1944, Dr.Albert Einstein regretfully took note of \"an odious materialistic attitudetoward life which leads to the predominance of an unrestrained selfishness.\" Buthow shall this materialism and selfishness of our culture be corrected? Bygeodesies in the space-time manifold of relativity theory? This would be coldcomfort from a warm heart and Einstein does not offer this way out. Indeed,Einstein offers no clear solution. The simple truth is that the onlycounterweight to \"materialism\" is \"idealism\" and this must come out [x] of thevery heart of science, as an evolutionary development. Researchers who know thedata of science must take our knowledge about nature and synthesize it into abody of integrated principles to establish the Pythagorean-Platonic-Brunocosmology, a world picture similar to the pantheism of Eastern thought, whereinman can reverence nature because nature is worthy of awe and reverence. Ahumanism that is exclusively anthropocentric is over-balanced and is in need ofa world philosophy in which the infinite and eternal cosmos yields the otherpivot for the axis around which the new synthesis can move and grow.There is a remedy for \"the sickness of modern man\" and many of its constituentsare found in this book on the education of the future. The implementation of theprinciples involved is the work of humanity itself. That its theories are notbeyond the need and grasp of contemporary educationists is borne out by the factthat steps are already taken in several places for the setting up of experimentsin education which are to express the need for synthesis. As an example of thisdevelopment there is the \"self-survey\" project financed by the Ford Foundationout of which has come a proposal for a Department of Integrating Studies in theUniversity of Pittsburgh. Part of the statement presenting this experiment readsas follows:\"It has been proposed that a new department, outside the present threedistribution fields of the Humanities, the Social Sciences and the NaturalSciences, and different from the departments within existing distributionfields, be established at the University of Pittsburgh. This new departmentshall be termed the Department of Unified Studies. It shall be concerned withseeking the interrelationships between various subject matter disciplinesalready available in the offerings of the University. The main objective is tocultivate the habit of reflective synthesis and find or create a body of wisdomfor human evolution and personal self-development. [xi]\"Since unified interpretation and understanding is not a science in its ownright but a synoptic comprehension of antecedent bodies of concepts andprinciples, this department shall not offer degrees in its own area or 'field.'The Department of Unified Studies is primarily a service department to thestudents and faculty members carrying on their primary (but not more important)activities in the more specialized areas of study.\"Until contemporary times, there has been little need for such an adjunct to ourinstitutions of higher learning. But with the increase in size of ourspecialized bodies of knowledge —to the point where we are burying ourselvesunder the mountains of information and data—the time has come to take seriouslythe problem of finding out what all this knowledge means. If the Universitycannot synthesize the overall implications of modern learning it will abdicateits historic role of providing universal principles for enlightened individualsseeking the benefits of the good life. This urgent need here requires explicitstatement and recognition, if we are consciously to design a solution to theproblem.\"The broad purpose of the Advancement of Learning (to use Bacon's phrase) is tothrow light on four basic questions of human existence:(1) What is man?(2) What kind of physical universe (cosmos) is it that man inhabits?(3) By what processes of evolution did the human species emerge from the matrixof nature so that man could become the self-conscious and creative individual henow is?(4) Knowing something about the cosmos and about human nature, what is the bestkind of society for man's progressive self-evolution?\"In seeking answers to these questions and providing students with the stimuliand data necessary to the formulation [xii] of their own answers, theinstructors in the Department of Unified Studies will not pose as experts inintegration. Along with interested students, the faculty members will be seekersafter synthesis. To illustrate the type of courses contemplated, the followingpossibilities are suggested:1. The Sociology of Knowledge.2. The Interrelationships of Religion, Philosophy, Science and Art.3. Information Theory, Cybernetics and Semantics.4. The History and Philosophy of Science.5. The History and Presuppositions of the Democratic Theory of Government(Ideology).6. Contributions of Biology, Sociology and Psychiatry to Human Welfare andProgress.7. The Unity of Knowledge.8. The Evolution of Value Systems from Primitive Culture to Modern IndustrialCivilization.\"The first prerequisites of all such courses is that they shall interrelate notless than three so-called departments of study. Thus the students and facultywill be encouraged to search for vision—'seeing life steadily and as a whole.'The Tibetan's seed-principles will find prepared soil in such experimentalfields.OLIVER L. REISERDepartment of PhilosophyUniversity of PittsburghPittsburgh, PennsylvaniaU.S.A."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER I - THE OBJECTIVE OF THE NEW EDUCATIONINTRODUCTORY STATEMENTS[1] This presentation might be regarded as concerning itself with threedifferent aspects of one general theme, which is that of the new and comingeducational methods and ideas. The objective is to elucidate the culturalunfoldment of the race and to consider the next step to be taken in the mentaldevelopment of humanity. Teaching, if true, must be in line with the past andmust provide scope for endeavour in the present and must also hold out furtherenlightenment for those who have succeeded or are succeeding in attaining theindicated goals. There must be a spiritual future indicated. It is that which isrequired now.The word \"spiritual\" does not refer to religious matters, so-called. Allactivity which drives the human being forward towards some form ofdevelopment—physical, emotional, mental, intuitional, social—if it is in advanceof his present state is essentially spiritual in nature and is indicative of thelivingness of the inner divine entity. The spirit of man is undying; it foreverendures, progressing from point to point and stage to stage upon the Path ofEvolution, unfolding steadily and sequentially the divine attributes andaspects.[2] The three points of our general theme are:1. The Technique of the Education of the Future.2. The Science of the Antahkarana. This deals with the mode of bridging the gapwhich exists in man's consciousness between the world of ordinary humanexperience, the threefold world of physical-emotional-mental functioning, andthe higher levels of so-called spiritual development which is the world ofideas, of intuitive perception, of spiritual insight and understanding.3. Methods of Building the Antahkarana. This leads to the overcoming of thelimitations—physical and psychological—which restrict man's free expression ofhis innate divinity. Here we can only prepare the ground for this third pointbecause the subject involves advanced meditation practices which must beapproached gradually. I have dealt with meditation in my other books.The question might here be asked, why it is of value to consider giving time tothat which lies as yet in the future. I would reply by reminding you that \"As aman thinketh, so is he.\" This is a truism and a platitude of occultism.Therefore, what is true of the individual is also true of the group and as agroup thinks, so does it eventually react. As the group thought-waves penetrateinto the mental atmosphere of humanity, men become impressed and theinaugurating of the new ways of living and of developing proceeds with increasedfacility. Here I seek only to give you some brief and general ideas which willserve to indicate to you the trend of my thought and the purpose which I have inmind. Perhaps the easiest way for me to do this is to formulate certainpropositions which are of interest and which can carry illumination.I. Education, up to the present time, has been occupied with the art ofsynthesising past history, past achievement [3] in all departments of humanthought and with the attainments to date of human knowledge. It has dealt withthose forms of science which the past has evolved. It is primarilybackward-looking and not forward-looking. I would remind you that I am heregeneralising, and that there are many and notable small exceptions to thisattitude.II. Education has concerned itself primarily with the organising of the lowermind, and a child's calibre has been largely gauged by its reaction toaccumulated information (where education is concerned), collated and collecteddata, sequentially handed out, digested and arranged so as to equip the child tocompete with the information which other people possess.III. Education to date has been largely memory training, though there is nowemerging the recognition that this attitude must end. The child has toassimilate the facts that the race believes to be true, has tested in the pastand found adequate. But each age has a differing standard of adequacy. ThePiscean Age dealt with the detail of the endeavour to measure up to a sensedideal. Hence we have a history which covers the method whereby tribes acquirednational status through aggression, war and conquest. That has been indicativeof racial achievement.Geography has been based on a similar reaction to an idea of expansion, andthrough it the child learns how men, driven by economic and other necessities,have conquered territory and absorbed lands. This too has been regarded, andrightly so, as a racial achievement. The various branches of science are alsoregarded as constituting the conquest of areas of territory, and this again isacclaimed as racial achievement. The conquests of science, the conquests ofnations, and the conquests of territory are all indicative of the Pisceanmethod, with its idealism, its militancy, and its separativeness in allfields—religious, political and economic. But the age of synthesis, ofinclusiveness and of understanding is upon us, and the new education of the [4]Aquarian Age must begin very gently to penetrate the human aura.IV. Education is more than memory training and more than informing a child orstudent as to the past and its achievements. Those factors have their place, andthe past must be understood and studied, for out of it must grow that which isnew, its flower and its fruit. Education involves more than the investigation ofa subject and the forming of subsequent conclusions leading to hypotheses which,in their own turn, lead to still more investigation and conclusions. Educationis more than a sincere effort to fit a child or adult to be a good citizen, anintelligent parent and no charge upon the state. It has a far wider applicationthan producing a human being who will be a commercial asset and not a commercialliability. Education has other objectives than rendering life enjoyable and soenabling men and women to achieve a culture which will permit them toparticipate with interest in all that transpires in the three worlds of humanaffairs. It is all the above, but should also be much more.V. Education has three major objectives, from the angle of human development:First, as has been grasped by many, it must make a man an intelligent citizen, awise parent, and a controlled personality; it must enable him to play his partin the work of the world and fit him for living peaceably and helpfully and inharmony with his neighbours.Second, it must enable him to bridge the gap between the various aspects of hisown mental nature, and herein lies the major emphasis of the instructions whichI am now purposing to give you.In the esoteric philosophy we are taught, as well you know, that on the mentalplane there are three aspects of the mind, or of that mental creature we call aman. These three aspects constitute the most important part of his nature: [5]1. His lower concrete mind, the reasoning principle. It is with this aspect ofthe man that our educational processes profess to deal.2. That Son of Mind, which we call the Ego or Soul. This is the intelligenceprinciple, and is called by many names in the esoteric literature, such as theSolar Angel, the Agnishvattas, the Christ principle, etc. With this, religion inthe past has professed to deal.3. The higher abstract mind, the custodian of ideas, and that which is theconveyor of illumination to the lower mind, once that lower mind is en rapportwith the soul. With this world of ideas philosophy has professed to deal.We might call these three aspects:The receptive mind, the mind as dealt with by the psychologists.The individualised mind, the Son of Mind.The illuminating mind, the higher mind.Third, the gap between the lower mind and the soul has to be bridged, andcuriously enough humanity has always realised this and has talked therefore interms of \"achieving unity\" or \"making the at-one-ment\" or \"attaining alignment.\"These are all attempts to express this intuitively realised truth.VI. Education also should concern itself during the new age with the bridging ofthis gap between the three aspects of the mind nature: between the soul and thelower mind, thus producing at-one-ment between soul and personality; between thelower mind, the soul and the higher mind. For this the race is now ready, andfor the first time in the career of humanity the bridging work can go forward ona relatively large scale. On this I need not enlarge, for it concerns thetechnicalities of the Ancient Wisdom, on which I have given you much in my otherbooks. [6]VII. Education is therefore the Science of the Antahkarana. This science andthis term is the esoteric way of expressing the truth of this bridgingnecessity. The antahkarana is the bridge the man builds—through meditation,understanding and the magical creative work of the soul—between the threeaspects of his mind nature. Therefore the primary objectives of the comingeducation will be:1. To produce alignment between mind and brain through a correct understandingof the inner constitution of man, particularly of the etheric body and the forcecentres.2. To build or construct a bridge between the brain-mind-soul, thus producing anintegrated personality which is a steady developing expression of thein-dwelling soul.3. To build the bridge between the lower mind, soul, higher mind, so that theillumination of the personality becomes possible.VIII. The true education is consequently the science of linking up the integralparts of man, and also of linking him up in turn with his immediate environment,and then with the greater whole in which he has to play his part. Each aspect,regarded as a lower aspect, can ever be simply the expression of the nexthigher. In this phrase I have expressed a fundamental truth which embodies notonly the objective, but also indicates the problem before all interested ineducation. This problem is to gauge rightly the centre or the focus of a man'sattention and to note where the consciousness is primarily centered. Then hemust be trained in such a way that a shift of that focus into a higher vehiclebecomes possible. We can also express this idea in an equally true manner bysaying that the vehicle which seems of paramount importance can become andshould become of secondary importance as it becomes simply the instrument ofthat which is higher than itself. [7] If the astral (emotional) body is thecentre of the personality life, then the objective of the educational processimposed upon the subject will be to make the mind nature the dominating factor,and the astral body then becomes that which is impressed by, and is sensitiveto, environing conditions, but is under the control of the mind. If the mind isthe centre of personality attention, then the soul activity must be brought intofuller expression; and so on and on the work proceeds, progress being made frompoint to point until the top of the ladder has been reached.It might be noted here that this entire exegesis of the mind and of the neededbridge building is but the practical demonstration of the truth of the occultaphorism that \"before a man can tread the Path he must become that Path itself.\"The antahkarana is the Path symbolically. This is one of the paradoxes of theesoteric science. Step by step and stage by stage, we construct that Path justas the spider spins its thread. It is that \"way back\" which we evolve out ofourselves; it is that Way which we also find and tread.SOME QUESTIONS ANSWEREDI will now attempt to deal somewhat with three questions on education asked byone of the students. I can but indicate the ideal, and in so doing I run therisk of producing an effect of being so visionary that any approach under ourpresent system might be regarded as impossible.In answer to the first question, the prime function of all educators is twofold:1. To train the brain to respond intelligently to impressions coming to it viathe sense apparatus and so carrying information about the outer tangible world.2. To train the mind so that it can fulfill three duties:a. Deal intelligently with information relayed to it by the brain. [8]b. Create thoughtforms in response to impulses emanating from the physicalplanes; to emotional reactions set in motion by the feeling-desire nature; tothe thought world, in which the man's environment is found.c. Orient itself to the subjective spiritual self, so that, from a condition ofpotentiality, the self may emerge into active government.In this formulation of the function of the apparatus with which all educatorshave to deal (the mind and the brain), I have indicated the answer to the secondquestion asked, which was:\"Are there definite types of activities, changing with the growing years andbased on the phases of the growth process in the individual, that make for hisbest all-around development?\"I differ somewhat concerning the periods indicated by such occult teachers asSteiner, for though the seven year cycles have their place, the division is aptto be over-applied. I would also suggest ten year cycles of development, dividedinto two parts: seven of learning and three of application.In the first ten years of a child's life he is taught to deal intelligently withinformation coming to him via the five senses to the brain. Observation, rapidresponse, and physical coordination as the result of intention, must beemphasised. The child must be taught to hear and see, to make contacts and touse judgment; and his fingers must then respond to creative impulses to make andproduce what he sees and hears. Thus are laid the elements of the arts andcrafts, of drawing and of music.In the next ten years the mind is definitely trained to become dominant. Thechild is taught to rationalise his emotional and desire impulses, and todiscriminate the right from the wrong, the desirable from the undesirable, andthe essential from the nonessential. This can be taught him [9] through themedium of history and the intellectual training which the cycle of his lifemakes compulsory under the laws of the country in which he lives. A sense ofvalues and of right standards is thus established. He is taught the distinctionbetween memory training and thinking; between bodies of facts, ascertained bythinkers and tabulated in books, and their application to the events ofobjective existence, plus (and here lies a thought of real importance) theirsubjective cause and their relation to the world of reality of which thephenomenal world is but the symbol.At the age of seventeen the study of psychology will be added to the rest of thecurriculum and the nature of the soul and its relation to the World Soul will beinvestigated. Meditation along suitable lines will be part of the curriculum. Itshould be noted here, however, that the religious implications of meditation areneedless. Meditation is the process whereby the objective tendencies andoutgoing impulses of the mind are thwarted, and it begins to be subjective, tofocus and to intuit. This can be taught through the medium of deep thinking onany subject—mathematics, biology, and so forth.The tendency of the newer education should be to make the subject of theeducational experiment the conscious possessor of his equipment; it should leavehim standing clear-eyed before life, with open doors ahead of him into the worldof objective phenomena and relationships; it should have brought him to theknowledge of a door leading into the world of Reality and through which he maypass at will and there assume and work out his relation to other souls.This second question—relating to the type of experience which would aid thechild to round out his development and be supplementary to the compulsory statecurriculum—is well-nigh impossible to answer, owing to the wide differences inhuman beings and the practical impossibility of finding those teachers who workas souls and as minds. [10]Every child should be studied in three directions. First, to ascertain thenatural trend of his impulses: Are they towards physical expression, towardsmanual labor, in which one would include such a wide range of opportunity asthat of the mechanical factory worker and the trained skill of the electrician?Is there a latent capacity for one or other of the arts, a reaction to colourand form, or a response to music and rhythm? Is the intellectual calibre onethat should warrant a definitely mental training in analysis, deduction,mathematics or logic? Then perhaps as life goes on our young people will begraded into two groups: the mystical, under which heading one would group thosewith religious, artistic and the more impractical tendencies; and the occult,which would include the intellectual, scientific and mental types. By the time achild is seventeen the training given should have enabled him to strike his noteclearly, and should have indicated the pattern into which his life impulses willmost probably run. In the first fourteen years, opportunity should be given toexperiment in many fields of opportunity. Pure vocational training should not beemphasised until the later years of the educational process.The time is coming when all children will be studied in the followingdirections:1. Astrologically, to determine the life tendencies and the peculiar problem ofthe soul.2. Psychologically, supplementing the best of modern psychology with a knowledgeof the Seven Ray types, which colours eastern psychology (see pages 18-23).3. Medically, with special attention to the endocrine system, plus the usualmodern methods in relation to eyes, teeth and other physiological defects. Thenature of the response apparatus will be carefully studied and developed.4. Vocationally, so as to place them later in life where their gifts andcapacities may find fullest expression [11] and enable them thus to fulfilltheir group obligations.5. Spiritually. By this I mean that the apparent age of the soul underconsideration will be studied, and the place on the ladder of evolution will beapproximately noted; mystical and introspective tendencies will be consideredand their apparent lack noted. Coordination between:a. Brain and the response apparatus in the outer world of phenomena,b. Brain and desire impulses, plus emotional reactions,c. Brain and mind and the world of thought,d. Brain, mind and soul,will be carefully investigated so as to bring the entire equipment of the child,latent or developed, into functioning activity and to unify it into a whole.The third question asks:\"What is the process of the unfoldment of the intellect in man? How does thehigher mind manifest, if at all, in the growing years?\"It is not possible in the short time at our command to deal here with thehistory of the progress of mental development. A study of its racial growth willreveal much, for every child is an epitome of the whole. A study, for instance,of the growth of the God-idea in the human consciousness would prove aprofitable illustration of the phenomena of thought development. A sequence ofgrowth might most inadequately and briefly be tabulated as follows, based uponthe process of unfoldment in a human being:1. Response to impact, the infant's sense awakened. He begins to hear and see.2. Response to possession and to acquisitiveness. The child begins toappropriate, becomes self-conscious and grasps for the personal self. [12]3. Response to the instinct governing the animal and desire nature, and to humantendencies.4. Response to the group. The child becomes aware of his environment and that heis an integral part of a whole.5. Response to knowledge. This begins with the impartation of informative facts,and so to the registration, through the memory, of these facts; thus aredeveloped interest, correlation, synthesis and application to the exigencies ofthe life.6. Response to the innate need to search. This leads to experiment on thephysical plane, to introspection on the emotional plane, and to intellectualstudy and a love of reading or of listening, thus bringing the mind into somecondition of activity.7. Response to economic and sex pressure or to the law of survival. This forceshim to use his equipment and knowledge and so take his place as a factor in thegroup life, and to promote group welfare by some aspect of active work and bythe perpetuation of the species.8. Response to pure intellectual awareness. This leads to a conscious free useof the mind, to individual thinking, to the creation of thoughtforms, andeventually to the steady orientation of the mind to a wider and wider field ofrealisation and awareness. These expansions of consciousness finally bring a newfactor into the field of experience.9. Response to the Thinker or the soul. With the registration of this response,the man enters into his kingdom. The above and the below become as one. Theobjective and the subjective worlds are unified. Soul and its mechanism functionas a unit.Towards this consummation all education should tend. Practically speaking,except in rare and highly evolved souls, [13] the higher mind does not manifestin children, any more than it did in infant humanity. It can only truly make itspresence felt when soul and mind and brain are aligned and coordinated. Flashesof insight and vision when seen in the young, are frequently the reaction oftheir very sensitive response apparatus to group ideas and the dominant thoughtsof their time and age, or of someone in their environment.Let me now deal briefly with the points raised concerning the attitude of theteacher, particularly towards adult aspirants.The true teacher must deal in truth and in sincerity with all seekers. His time(in so far as he is held by the time equation on the physical plane) is toovaluable to waste in social politeness or in refraining from making criticalcomment where a good purpose would be served. He must depend thoroughly upon thesincerity of those whom he teaches. Nevertheless, criticism and the pointing outof faults and errors does not always prove helpful; it may but increaseresponsibility, evoke antagonism or unbelief, or produce depression—three of themost undesirable results of the use of the critical faculty.By stimulating their interest, by producing a subjective synthesis in the grouphe is teaching, and by fanning the flame of their spiritual aspiration, thegroup may arrive at a right discrimination as to their joint quality andnecessities, and thus they will render the ordinary faultfinding attitude of theteacher unnecessary.Those upon the teaching ray will learn to teach by teaching. There is no surermethod, provided it is accompanied by a deep love, personal yet at the same timeimpersonal, for those who are to be taught. Above everything else, I wouldenjoin upon you the inculcation of the group spirit, for that is the firstexpression of true love. Two points only would I make:First of all, in teaching children up to fourteen years of age, it is necessaryto bear in mind that they are emotionally [14] focussed. They need to feel, andrightly to feel beauty, strength and wisdom. They must not be expected torationalise before that time, even if they show evidence of the power so to do.After fourteen years and during adolescence their mental response to truthshould be drawn out and counted upon to deal with presented problems. Even if itis not there, an effort should be made to evoke it.Secondly, an attempt should be made to approximate the child's place upon theladder of evolution by a study of his background, his physical equipment, thenature of his response apparatus with its varied reactions, and his majorinterests. This enquiry sets up a subjective rapport with the child which is farmore potent in its results than would be months and months of strenuously usedwords in the effort to convey an idea.THEORY, METHODS AND GOALSAll that I have to say here is still in the nature of introductory remarks.Please bear this in mind. I am anxious, however, to lay a sound foundation forour future discussions on the building of the antahkarana, so that we can workintelligently, but not critically. It is essential that as we start our work itshould be based on that which is today in existence. Nature works without anygaps, and this is so even when (from the standpoint of academic science) thereis an apparent hiatus between facts and known species. In transitional periodssome of the bridging forms have disappeared and the gap appears to be there. Butit is not so in fact. We have not yet discovered all that is to be found in theworld of phenomenal appearances. We are passing through one of the great naturaltransitional periods at this time. We are laying the foundation for theemergence of a new species of human being—a more highly evolved unit within thehuman family—hence much of our problem, and much of the present failure to meetthe demands [15] of the race, and to measure up to human need for development.We have, in the world, a general theory as to education, and certain basicmethods are universally employed. Countries vary greatly in the application ofmethods, and systems differ very considerably. All, however, teach these samefundamental things; they teach the youth of the country to read and write and toattain a fair measure of ability to deal with figures through instruction inelementary arithmetic. These three are curiously symbolic of the wholeevolutionary unfoldment of the race.Reading has to do with the clothing of ideas with form and is related to thefirst step in the creative process, wherein Deity, governed and impelled by anidea (embodying God's purpose and plan), converted that idea into the desiredsubstance and clothed it with the needed outer appearance. Writing symbolisesthe method whereby the process is carried on, but it is of course far morepersonal in its implications. Reading is concerned essentially with therealisation of a clothed idea of some kind, whereas writing is, curiouslyenough, concerned with the individual's conscious self-relation to ideas, andhis use of words in writing is the measure of the grasp he may have of theseuniversal ideas. Arithmetic (and the power to add, to subtract, and to multiply)is related also to the creative process and concerns the production of thoseforms upon the physical plane which will adequately produce the idea and bringit to manifestation.Vision might be regarded as concerning itself with the higher levels of themental plane, whereon the idea is sensed and seen. Writing has a more definiterelation to the concrete levels of the mental plane and to the ability of theman to bring through and express these visioned ideas in his own particularform. Arithmetic has a definite relation to subsequent aspects of the processand to the emergence of the idea into some correlated form upon the [16]physical plane. The visioning of the thoughtform is a process which must besucceeded by the appropriation of as much energy by the idea as is needed tomake it effective or \"apparent\" (esoterically speaking). Of this the symbolismof arithmetic is the expression.From another angle, man reads his destiny in the heavens and writes out thatdestiny in his life upon the earth; he reduces, knowingly or unknowingly, theidea of his soul to due and proper form, so that each life adds, subtracts andmultiplies, until the sum of each soul's experiencing is complete. Thus,symbolically, the three basic ideas are held in elementary education, thoughtheir true meaning is divorced from reality and the right significance isentirely lost. All that we have, however, emerging slowly and definitely throughthe medium of world education, is built upon this unrealised scaffolding. Thefundamental necessity which today confronts the educational world is the need torelate the process of unfolding the human mentality to the world of meaning, andnot to the world of objective phenomena. Until the aim of education is to orienta man to this inner world of realities, we shall have the misplaced emphasis ofthe present time. Until we can arrive in our educational objectives at thebridging of the gap between the three lower aspects of man and the soul (abridging which must take place upon the mental levels of consciousness), weshall make but little progress in right directions and all interim activity willbe inadequate to the modern need. Until the fact of the higher mind isrecognised, and the place which the lower concrete mind should fill as theservant of the higher is likewise recognised, we shall have the overdevelopmentof the concrete materialising faculty—with its aptitude to memorise, tocorrelate facts and to produce that which will meet man's lower desire—but weshall not have a humanity which can truly think. As yet, the mind reflects thelower desire nature and does not attempt to cognise the higher. [17]When the right method of training is instituted, the mind will be developed intoa reflector or agent of the soul and so sensitised to the world of true valuesthat the lower nature—emotional, mental and physical or vital—will become simplythe automatic servant of the soul. The soul will then function on earth throughthe medium of the mind, thereby controlling its instrument, the lower mind. Yetat the same time, the mind will remain the recorder and reflector of allinformation coming to it from the world of the senses, from the emotional body,and will register also the thoughts and the ideas current in its environment. Atpresent, it is alas true, the trained mind is regarded as the highest expressionof which humanity is capable; it is viewed entirely as a personality, and thepossibility of there being something which can use the mind, as the mind in itsturn uses the physical brain, is overlooked.One of the things which we shall seek to do in our studies together is to graspthe relation of the world of meaning to the world of expression; we shallattempt to study the technique whereby this world of quality (which expressesitself through the world of meaning) can be entered and understood by theintegrated consciousness of the intelligent human being.Certain words will recur again and again as we work and study together; suchwords as meaning, quality, value—all of which stand revealed in their vitalspiritual significance when man learns to grasp the fact of the higher realitiesand bridges the gap between his higher and his lower consciousness. Thesignificance also of creative activity and the right understanding of what wecall genius will likewise be made clearer, and in this way creative work will nolonger be regarded as unique and manifesting sporadically as is now the case butwill become the subject of trained attention, and so assume its normal place inman's unfoldment. It might be added here that creative activity in the field ofart becomes possible when the first aspect of [18] the bridging energy of mancan function and the soul (manifesting its third or lowest aspect) can begin towork. Creative work can be carried forward when two of the \"knowledge petals\" ofthe egoic lotus are unfolded. The man can produce, through knowledge andcreative energy, something upon the physical plane which will be expressive ofthe soul's creative power. When two of the \"love petals\" are also unfolded, thena genius makes his appearance. This is a technical piece of information forthose students who are studying the science of the Ageless Wisdom, but it is ofno value to those who do not recognise symbology, or the fact of the higher egoor soul.It might be of value here if I clarified my use of the words \"higher ego.\" Asyou know, if you have read A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vols. I and II(Esoteric Psychology), the soul is an aspect of the divine energy in time andspace. We are told that the Solar Logos circumscribed for His use and for themeeting of His desire, a certain measure of the substance of space and informedit with His life and consciousness. He did this for His good purposes and inconformity with His self-realised plan and intent. Thus He submitted Himself tolimitation. The human monad followed the same procedure and—in time andspace—limited itself in a similar manner. On the physical plane and in thephysical body, this phenomenal and transient entity controls its phenomenalappearance through the two aspects of life and consciousness. The lifeprinciple—the flow of divine energy through all forms—is temporarily seated inthe heart, while the consciousness principle, the soul of all things, is located(temporarily as far as the form nature of a particular human unit is concerned)within the brain. As again you know, the life principle controls the mechanismthrough the medium of the blood stream, for \"the blood is the life,\" and usesthe heart as its central organ; whilst the consciousness principle [19] uses thenervous system as its instrument, with the intricate extensions of the organ ofsensitivity, the spinal column.The objective of education should therefore be the training of the mechanism torespond to the life of the soul. The higher Self or Soul is the sumtotal of theconsciousness of the Monad, again in time and space. The lower self or soul is,for our purposes, as much of that sumtotal as any one person in any one life canuse and express. This activity is dependent upon the type and quality of thebody nature, the mechanism produced by soul activity in other lives, and theeffect of reaction to environing conditions. The increasing of soul awareness,the deepening of the flow of consciousness, and the development of an innercontinuity of awareness, plus the evocation of soul attributes and aspects uponthe physical plane through the medium of its triple mechanism, constitute theobjective of all education. These aspects are, as you well know:1. Will or purpose. This, through education, should be developed to the pointwhere the manifested life is governed by conscious spiritual purpose and thelife tendency is correctly oriented towards reality.The right direction of the will should be one of the major concerns of all trueeducators. The will-to-good, the will-to-beauty, and the will-to-serve must becultivated.2. Love-wisdom. This is essentially the unfolding of the consciousness of thewhole. We call it group consciousness. Its first development isself-consciousness, which is the realisation by the soul that (in the threeworlds of human evolution) man is the Three in One and One in Three. He cantherefore react to the associated groups of lives which constitute his ownlittle phenomenal appearance; self-consciousness [20] is, therefore, a stage onthe way to group consciousness and is the consciousness of the Immediate.Through education, this self-consciousness must be unfolded until the manrecognises that his consciousness is a corporate part of a greater whole. Heblends then with the group interests, activities and objectives. They areeventually his and he becomes group conscious. This is love. It leads to wisdom,which is love in manifested activity. Self-interest becomes group interest. Suchshould be the major objective of all true educational endeavour. Love of self(self-consciousness), love of those around us (group-consciousness), becomeeventually love of the whole (God consciousness). Such are the steps.3. Active Intelligence. This concerns the unfolding of the creative nature ofthe conscious, spiritual man. It takes place through right use of the mind, withits power to intuit ideas, to respond to impact, to translate, analyse, and toconstruct forms for revelation. Thus the soul of man creates. This creativeprocess can be described, as far as its steps are concerned, as follows:a. The soul creates its physical body, its phenomenal appearance, its outerform.b. The soul creates, in time and space, in line with its desires. Thus thesecondary world of phenomenal things comes into being and our moderncivilisation is the result of this creative activity of the soul's desirenature, limited by form. Ponder on this.c. The soul creates through the direct agency of the lower mind and hence theappearance of the world of symbols which fill our united lives with interest,concepts, ideas and beauty, through the written word, the spoken word, and thecreative [21] arts. These are the products of the thought of the thinkers of therace.The right direction of this already developed tendency is the aim of all trueeducation. The nature of ideas, the modes of intuiting them, and the laws whichshould govern all creative work are its goals and objectives. Thus we come tothe world of attributes which supplement the activity of the three aspects, inthe same way that the three major rays are enhanced and aided by the work of thefour minor rays. These four attributive unfoldments in man, through the activityof the soul in manifestation, are:4. The attribute of harmony, produced through conflict. This leads to releaseand to the eventual power to create. This is one of the attributes whicheducation should deal with from the angle of the intuition and should holdbefore its exponents as personality and group objectives. It is the attributelatent in all forms and is that innate urge or discontent which leads man tostruggle and progress and evolve in order finally to make atonement and unionwith his soul. It is the lowest aspect of that higher spiritual and monadictriad which reflects itself in the soul. It is the consciousness of harmony andbeauty which drives the human unit along the path of evolution to an eventualreturn to his emanating Source.Education must work, therefore, with this dissatisfaction and interpret it tothose who are taught, so that they can understand themselves and workintelligently.5. The attribute of concrete knowledge whereby man is enabled to concretise hisconcepts and so build thoughtforms whereby he materialises his visions and hisdreams and brings his ideas into being. This he does through the activity of thelower concrete mind. [22]The true work of education is to train the lower man in right discrimination andtrue sensitivity to the vision, so that he can build true to the purpose of hissoul and produce upon the earth that which will be his contribution to thewhole. It is right here that the work of modern education has to begin. Not yetcan man work with intelligence in the world of ideas and of patterns; not yet ishe sensitive to the true spiritual values. This is the goal for the disciple,even though the masses cannot yet function on these levels. The first thing thatmust be done is to train the child in the correct use of the discriminatingfaculty and in the power of choice and of directed purpose. He must be broughtto a truer understanding of the underlying purpose of being, and be led to workwith wisdom in the field of creative activity, which means, in the lastanalysis, in the right use of the \"mind stuff\" (the chitta of Patanjali). Thusand only thus, can he be released from the control of his lower nature.6. The attribute of devotion is the next to be considered. Devotion grows out ofand is the fruit of dissatisfaction, plus the use of the faculty of choice.According to the depths of a man's discontent, and of his power to see clearly,he passes from one point of temporary satisfaction to another, each timedemonstrating his devotion to a desire, to a personality, to an ideal, and to avision, until he finally unifies himself with the ideal which is the highestpossible to man. This is, first of all, the soul; and then the Oversoul or God.Educators are therefore faced with the opportunity of dealing intelligently withthe innate idealism to be found in any child, and with the interesting task ofleading the youth of the world on from one realised goal to another. But thisthey must do in the future from the angle of the ultimate [23] soul objectiveand not, as in the past, from the angle of a particular standard of nationaleducation. This is an important point, for it will mark the shift of attentionfrom the nonessential to the essential.7. Finally the attribute of order, and the imposition of an established rhythmthrough the development of innate faculty to function under directed purpose andritual. This particular attribute of divinity is now highly developed in oneaspect, so that we have today much standardisation of humanity, and theautocratic imposition of a ritualistic rhythm upon public life in a large numberof countries. It can be seen to perfection in the life in our public schools—butit is an undesirable perfection. This is partly due to the recognition that theunit or individual is only a part of a greater whole (a recognition which ismuch needed) and a part of the evolutionary unfoldment of the race. Owing,however, to our faulty application of any new truth it means as yet thesubmergence of that unit in the group, leaving him little opportunity for thefree play of the individual will, intelligence, purpose and soul technique.Educators will have to work with this principle of innate attribute and thisinstinct to ordered rhythm, making it more creatively constructive and soproviding, through it, a field for the unfoldment of soul powers.I have digressed thus far so as to instill certain of the basic ideas whichshould underlie the educational tendencies. These thoughts, coupled with thosealready given, constitute a statement of the objectives before the educators ofthe world which you would find it of value to consider. Earlier I suggested thegoal. I now link that goal up with possibilities, for I have here touched uponthe [24] equipment (aspects and attributes) which is found, in some stage ofdevelopment, in every human being. It is with these hidden traits and instinctsthat the future educational systems must work. They must not work, as they dotoday, with the brain apparatus and with the lowest aspects of the mind; normust they lay their emphasis upon the effort to impress upon that brain and mindthe facts, so-called, of the evolutionary process and of physical planeinvestigation.The above remarks will serve to show you that the true educator should beworking with energies in a world of energy; that these energies are tinged andqualified by distinctive divine attributes, and that each human being thereforecan be regarded as an aggregate of energies, dominated by some one particulartype of energy which serves to make him distinctive among his fellows, and whichproduces the differences among human beings. If it is true that there are sevenmajor types of energy qualifying all forms, and that these in their turn aresubdivided into forty-nine types of qualified energy, the complexity of theproblem emerges clearly. If it is true that all these distinctive energies playconstantly upon energy-substance (spirit-matter), producing \"the myriad formswhich make up the form of God\" (Bhagavad Gita, XI), and that each child is themicrocosmical representation (at some stage of development) of the Macrocosm,the magnitude of the problem becomes evident, and the extent of our demandedservice will call forth to the utmost the powers which any human being canexpress at any given moment in time and space.You will note that these words \"in time and space\" have repeatedly recurred inthis instruction. Why is this? Because it must constantly be remembered that weare living in the world of illusion—an illusion which is temporary and transientand which will some day disappear, taking with it the illusion of appearance,the illusion of evolutionary [25] unfoldment, the illusion of separativeness,and the illusion of distinctive identity—that illusion which makes us say \"Iam.\" The educator of the future will start his service to the child with therecognition of this ephemeral and transient misconception of the soul, and willdeal primarily with the mind aspect, and not with the imposition of as muchimparted organised knowledge concerning phenomenal existence as the memory ofthe child is capable of grasping. How can I illustrate this changed attitude toyou in the simplest form? Perhaps by pointing out that, whereas today parentsand guardians of the child spend much of their time in answering or evadingquestions posed by the awakening consciousness of the child, in time to come thesituation will be reversed. Parents will ceaselessly meet the demands of theemerging intelligence of the child by always enquiring of the child, Why? Whyask this? Why is it thus?—and so throwing always the responsibility of answeringthe questions upon the child, yet at the same time dropping the solution of thequestion subtly into the child's mind.This process will begin in the fifth year of the child's life; the seekingintelligence (which is the child itself) will always be forced by the teacherinto the position of inward search, not outer demand for a reply which can bememorised and which rests upon the authority of the older person. If this seemsto you as yet impossible, remember that the children who will or have come intoincarnation, after the period of increased stimulation found between the years1935 and 1942, will normally and naturally respond to this evocation of the mindelement.One of the major functions of those who train the infant minds of the race willbe to determine, as early as possible in life, which of the seven determiningenergies are controlling in each case. The technique to be later applied willthen be built upon this important initial decision—hence again, the growingresponsibility of the [26] educator. A child's note and quality will be earlydetermined, and his whole planned training will grow out of this basicrecognition. This is not yet possible, but will shortly be so, when the qualityand nature of any individual etheric body can be scientifically discovered. Thisdevelopment is not as distant as might be supposed or anticipated.It is not my intention to deal with the details of this process, nor toelaborate the methods whereby the children of the race can be trained. Ourobjective is to deal with the more universal and immediate necessity of bridgingthe gap between the different aspects of the lower self, so that an integratedpersonality emerges; and then of bridging the gap between the soul and thespiritual triad, so that there can be the free play of consciousness andcomplete identification with the One Life, thus leading to the loss of the senseof separateness and to the merging of the part with the Whole, with no loss ofidentity but with no recognition of self-identification.Here an interesting point should be carefully noted. It holds the key to futureracial unfoldment. For it the new science of psychology, which has developed soremarkably during the past thirty years, is preparing us. Students should trainthemselves to distinguish between the sutratma and the antahkarana, between thelife thread and the thread of consciousness. One thread is the basis ofimmortality and the other the basis of continuity. Herein lies a finedistinction for the investigator. One thread (the sutratma) links and vivifiesall forms into one functioning whole and embodies in itself the will and thepurpose of the expressing entity, be it man, God or a crystal. The other thread(the antahkarana) embodies the response of the consciousness within the form toa steadily expanding range of contacts within the environing whole.The sutratma is the direct stream of life, unbroken and immutable, which can beregarded symbolically as a direct stream of living energy flowing from thecentre to the periphery, [27] and from the source to the outer expression or thephenomenal appearance. It is the life. It produces the individual process andthe evolutionary unfoldment of all forms. It is, therefore, the path of life,which reaches from the monad to the personality, via the soul. This is thethread soul and it is one and indivisible. It conveys the energy of life andfinds its final anchor in the centre of the human heart and at some centralfocal point in all forms of divine expression. Naught is and naught remains butlife.The consciousness thread (antahkarana) is the result of the union of life andsubstance or of the basic energies which constitute the first differentiation intime and space; this produces something different, which only emerges as a thirddivine manifestation, after the union of the basic dualities has taken place. Itis the thread which is woven as a result of the appearance of life in form uponthe physical plane. Speaking again symbolically, it might be said that thesutratma works from above downward and is the precipitation of life into theouter manifestation. The antahkarana is woven, evolved, and created as theresult of this primary creation, and works from below upwards, from the withoutto the within, from the world of exoteric phenomena into the world of subjectiverealities and of meaning.This \"Path of Return,\" by means of which the race is withdrawn from outeremphasis and begins to recognise and register those inner conscious knowledgesof that which is not phenomenal, has already (through the evolutionary process)reached a point of development wherein some human beings can follow along thispath from the physical consciousness to the emotional, and from the emotional tothe mental. That part of the work is already accomplished in many thousands ofcases and what is now required is facility and right use of this power. Thisthread of energy, coloured by conscious sentient response, is later [28]coloured by the discriminating consciousness of the mind, and this produces thatinner integration which makes man eventually an efficient thinking being. Atfirst, this thread is used purely for lower selfish interests; it steadily getsstronger and more potent as time goes on, until it is a definite, clear, strongthread reaching from the outer physical life, from a point within the brain,straight through to the inner mechanism. This thread, however, is not identifiedwith the mechanism, but with the consciousness in man. Through the means of thisthread a man becomes aware of his emotional life in its many forms (note thisphraseology), and through it he becomes aware of the world of thought; he learnsto think and begins to function consciously on the mental plane, in which thethinkers of the race—a steadily increasing number—live and move and have theirbeing. Increasingly he learns to tread this path of consciousness, and therebyceases to be identified with the animal outer form and learns to identifyhimself with the inner qualities and attributes. He lives first the life ofdreams, and then the life of thought. Then the time comes when this lower aspectof the antahkarana is completed, and the first great conscious unity isconsummated. The man is an integrated, conscious, living personality. The threadof continuity between the three lower aspects of the man is established and canbe used. It stretches, if such a term can be used (my intent being entirelypictorial), from the centre of the head to the mind, which is in its turn acentre of energy in the world of thought. At the same time, this antahkarana isinterwoven with the thread of life or the sutratma which emerges from the heartcentre. The objective of evolution in form is now relatively complete.When this stage has been reached, the sensitive feeling-out into the environinguniverse still continues. Man weaves a thread which is like the thread thespider weaves so amazingly. He reaches out still further into his possible [29]environment and then discovers an aspect of himself of which he had littledreamt in the early stages of his development. He discovers the soul and thenpasses through the illusion of duality. This is a necessary but not a permanentstage. It is one which characterises the aspirant of this world cycle, perhaps Ishould say this manvantara or world period. He seeks to merge himself with thesoul, to identify himself, the conscious personality, with that overshadowingsoul. It is at this point, technically speaking, that the true building of theantahkarana must be begun. It is the bridge between the personality and thesoul.The recognition of this constitutes the problem with which the modern educatoris faced. It is a problem that has always existed but it has concerned theindividual hitherto more than the group. Now it concerns the group, for so manyof the sons of men are ready for this building. Down the ages individuals havebuilt their individual bridges between the higher and the lower, but sosuccessful has been the evolutionary process that today the time has come for agroup understanding of this emerging technique, for a group bridging, leading toa consequent or subsequent group revelation. This provides the modernopportunity in the field of education. It indicates the responsibility of theeducator and points out the necessity for a new unfoldment in educationalmethods. The \"group aspirant\" must be met and the group antahkarana must bebuilt. This, however, when rightly understood, will not negate individualeffort. That always must be met; but the group understanding will increasinglyaid the individual.COORDINATION AND INTEGRATIONThus far we have been occupied with generalisations as to the educationalprocesses later to be applied, with the mental apparatus which comes underdefinite and planned training, and which is subjectively and superconsciously[30] influenced during the process. I am presuming that you already grasp thenecessity for the building of the antahkarana and for this bridging work. It iswise also to accept the fact that we are in a position to begin the definiteprocess of constructing the link or bridge between the various aspects of man'snature, so that instead of differentiation there will be unity, and instead of afluid, moving attention, directed here and there into the field of materialliving and emotional relationships, we shall learn to control the mind and tobridge the divisions, and so can direct at will the lower attention in anydesired manner. Thus all aspects of man, spiritual and natural, can be focussedwhere needed.This bridging work has in part already been done. Humanity has as a wholealready bridged the gap between the emotional astral nature and the physicalman. As I said elsewhere:We might generalise in the following manner as to the stages of growth andconsequent ability to become the agent of ever increasing powers, tapping theresources of dynamic energy in the three worlds:Lower types of humanity use the sutratma as it passes through the etheric body.Average men utilise almost entirely that part of the sutratma which passesthrough the astral plane. Their reactions are largely based on desire, and areemotional.Intellectual men utilise the sutratma as it passes through the lower levels ofthe mental plane, down through the astral to the physical in its two sections.Their activities are energised by mind and not by desire, as in the earliercases.Aspirants of the physical plane use the sutratma as it passes through the twolower subplanes of the [31] abstract levels of the mental plane, and arebeginning gradually to build the antahkarana, or the bridge between the Triadand the Personality. The power of the Ego can begin to make itself felt.Applicants for initiation and initiates up to the third initiation use both thesutratma and the antahkarana, employing them as a unit. The power of the Triadbegins to pour through, thus energising all human activities upon the physicalplane, and vitalising in ever increasing degree the man's thought forms. The keyto the formation of the Mayavirupa is found in the right comprehension of theprocess.A Treatise on Cosmic Fire, pp. 959-960.It should be noted here that the bridging has to be done in the consciousnessaspect, and concerns the continuity of man's awareness of life in all hisvarious aspects. The energy which is used in connecting, in consciousness, thephysical man and the astral body is focussed in the solar plexus. Speaking insymbolical terms, many today are carrying that bridge forward and linking themind with the two aspects already linked. This thread of energy emanates from,or is anchored in, the head. A few people are steadily linking the soul and themind, which in its turn is linked with the other two aspects. The soul energy,when linked with the other threads, has its anchor in the heart. A very fewpeople (the initiates of the world) having effected all the lower syntheses, arenow occupied with bringing about a still higher union with that triple Realitywhich uses the soul as its medium of expression, just as the soul in its turn isendeavouring to use its shadow, the threefold lower man.These distinctions and unifications are matters of form, [32] symbols in speech,and are used to express events and happenings in the world of energies andforces in connection with which man is definitely implicated. It is to theseunifications that we refer when the subject of initiation is underconsideration.The life thread, the silver cord or the sutratma, is, as far as man isconcerned, dual in nature. The life thread proper, which is one of the twothreads which constitute the antahkarana, is anchored in the heart, whilst theother thread which embodies the principle of consciousness, is anchored in thehead. This you already know, but this I feel the need constantly to reiterate.In the work of the evolutionary cycle, however, man has to repeat what God hasalready done. He must himself create, in both the world of consciousness and oflife. Like a spider, man spins connecting threads, and thus bridges and makescontact with his environment, thereby gaining experience and sustenance. Thespider symbol is often used in the ancient occult books and the scriptures ofIndia in connection with this activity of the human being. The threads which mancreates are triple and with the two basic threads which have been created by thesoul, constitute the five types of energy which make man a conscious humanbeing. The triple threads created by man are anchored in the solar plexus, thehead and the heart. When the astral body and the mind nature are beginning tofunction as a unit, and the soul also is consciously connected (do not forgetthat it is always unconsciously linked), an extension of this fivefoldthread—the basic two and the human three—is carried to the throat centre; whenthat occurs man can become a conscious creator on the physical plane. From thesemajor lines of energy lesser lines can radiate at will. It is upon thisknowledge that all future intelligent psychic unfoldment must be based.In the above paragraph and its implications you have a brief and inadequatestatement as to the Science of the [33] Antahkarana. I have endeavoured toexpress this in terms, symbolic if you will, which will convey some general ideaof the process to your minds. We can learn much through the use of the pictorialand visual imagination. Many aspirants have already established the followinglinks of the bridging antahkarana:1. From the physical to the vital or etheric body. This is really an extensionof the life thread between the heart and the spleen.2. From the physical and the vital, regarding them as a unity, to the astral oremotional vehicle. This thread emanates from, or is anchored in, the solarplexus, and is carried upward by means of the aspiration till it anchors itselfin the love petals of the egoic lotus.3. From the physical and astral vehicles to the mental body. One terminal isanchored in the head, and the other in the knowledge petals of the egoic lotus,being carried forward by an act of the will.Many, too, are in process of linking the three lower aspects, which we call thepersonality, with the soul itself, through meditation, discipline, service anddirected attention. When this has been accomplished, a definite relation isestablished between the sacrifice or will petals of the egoic lotus and the headand heart centres, thus producing a synthesis between consciousness, the souland the life principle. The process of establishing this interlinking andinterrelation, and the strengthening of the bridge thus constructed, goes onuntil the third initiation. The lines of force are then so interrelated that thesoul and its mechanism of expression are a unity. A higher blending and fusingcan then go on.It is necessary for me to stop at this point and indicate that all the above aresimply word pictures of a process of [34] energy interrelations, and have adefinite value if they can introduce and make real to you the fact of theindicated processes. Some aspirants and students have the mystical consciousnesshighly developed, and are therefore apt to resent and regard as unnecessary themore technical and intellectual presentation of a truth which they sense andknow, but which remains a truth yet undefined. It is my purpose to assist youtowards a greater definiteness of realisation and expression; this should in noway detract from the wonder and the beauty of what you sense, but shouldincrease your power to know and also to make available to others the knowledgewhich you have gained. In the past the mystic expressed his realisation throughlove and practical kindness, expressing it on the physical plane throughcharitable deeds and self-sacrifice, and on emotional levels by his aspiration,his vision, and his ability to express the love of God to the world. The mystictoday continues with the same process, but under the evolutionary urge becomescapable of more than this. He should be able to formulate his knowledgeintelligently and to express his awareness clearly, in order that he may shareit with the public which is steadily growing in intelligence, but greatly needsthe vision. I therefore beg of you not to resent the technical formulation oftruth, for if education means anything at all, and if we are to consider theways in which education is to be applied to bring about this bridging andsynthesis, it is essential that we avoid that mental laziness and mysticalinertia which are characteristic of so many mystics and the line of leastresistance for many would-be disciples.It is necessary therefore that we grasp the facts that:1. The new education will primarily be concerned with the scientific andconscious bridging between the various aspects of the human being, thusproducing coordination and synthesis and an increased [35] expansion ofconsciousness through the establishing of right lines of energy.2. The task of the new education is therefore the coordination of thepersonality, eventually bringing about its at-one-ment with the soul.3. The new education will deal with, analyse and interpret the laws of thought,because the mind will be regarded as the link between the soul and the brain.These laws are the means whereby:a. Ideas are intuited.b. Ideals are promulgated.c. Mental concepts or thoughtforms are constructed which in due time will maketheir impact telepathically upon the minds of men.4. The new education will organise and develop the lower concrete mind.5. It will teach the human being to think from universals to particulars, aswell as to undertake the analysis of particulars. There will consequently beless emphasis in future schools upon the training of the memory. Interest willgreatly aid the will to recall.6. The new education will make a man a good citizen by developing the rationalaspects of his consciousness and life, teaching him to use his inherited,acquired and endowed equipment for the evidencing of the social consciousnessand attitudes.7. Above all else, the educators in the new age will endeavour to teach man thescience of unifying the three aspects of himself which are covered by thegeneral title of mental aspects:a. The lower concrete mind.b. The Son of Mind, the Soul, the Self.c. The higher, abstract or intuitional mind.or:a. The receptive mind or common-sense. [36]b. The individualised mind.c. The illuminating mind.8. The educators in the new age will deal with the processes or methods to beemployed in bridging the gaps in consciousness between the different aspects.Thus the Science of the Antahkarana will be brought definitely to the attentionof the public.9. The extension of this concept of bridging will be developed to include notonly the internal history of man, but also the bridging between him and hisfellowmen on all levels.10. It will include also the training of the human mechanism to respond to lifeimpacts, and to the soul. This soul is essentially intelligence, vitally used oneach plane. It functions as the discriminating mind on the mental plane, as thesensitive consciousness on the emotional plane, and as the active participatorin physical life. This intelligent activity is always used from the wisdomangle.11. The new education will take into consideration:a. The mind and its relation to the energy body, the etheric body, whichunderlies the nervous system and which galvanises the physical body intoactivity.b. The mind and its relation to the brain.c. The mind and its relation to the seven centres of force in the etheric body,and their externalisation and utilisation through the medium of the major nerveplexi to be found in the human body, and their relation (which will becomeincreasingly obvious) to the endocrine glands.d. The brain as the coordinating factor in the dense body, and its capacity todirect the activities of the man through the medium of the nervous system. [37]In the above statements you will see how large is our theme, and yet it is onewhich I intend to cover with the utmost brevity, writing only a fundamentaltextbook which will serve as a signpost for the production of the new culturewhich will distinguish the Aquarian Age. Other disciples will later elaborate mytheme, but the subject is as yet so little understood that much that could besaid would be meaningless, even to the most intelligent.Modern education is beginning to give some attention to the nature of the mindand to the laws of thought. In this connection we owe much to psychology andphilosophy. There is also an increasing interest in the Science of Endocrinologyas a material means of producing changes, usually in deficient children andmorons. Nevertheless, until modern educators begin to admit the possibility thatthere are central units in man which underlie the tangible and visiblemechanism, and will also admit the possibility of a central powerhouse of energybehind the mind, progress in education will be relatively at a standstill; thechild will not receive the initial training and the foundational ideas whichwill enable him to become a self-directed, intelligent human being. Psychology,with its emphasis upon the three aspects of man—thought, emotional feeling, andthe bodily organism—has already made a vital contribution and is doing much tobring about radical changes in our educational systems. Much remains to be done.The interpretation of men in terms of energy and the grasping of the seven typesof energy which determine a man and his activities, will bring about immediatechanges."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER II - THE CULTURAL UNFOLDMENT OF THE RACECIVILISATION AND CULTURE[38] Much emphasis is being laid today upon education—coordinating, relational,psychological, vocational and equipping. To this must be added the old method ofmemory training and the attempt either to infuse religion into the mind of thechild or to omit it with decision and with purpose. Modern education has beenprimarily competitive, nationalistic and, therefore, separative. It has trainedthe child to regard the material values as of major importance, to believe thathis particular nation is also of major importance and that every other nation issecondary; it has fed pride and fostered the belief that he, his group and hisnation are infinitely superior to other people and peoples. He is taughtconsequently to be a one-sided person with his world values wrongly adjusted andhis attitudes to life distinguished by bias and prejudice. The rudiments of thearts are taught him in order to enable him to function with the neededefficiency in a competitive setting and in his particular vocationalenvironment. To read, to write and to be able to add and do elementaryarithmetic are regarded as the minimum requirement; to know something of pastevents—historical, geographical, literary, philosophical and scientific—arelikewise added in many countries and for certain classes of people. Some of theliterature of the world is also brought to his attention. [39]The general level of world information is high but usually biassed, influencedeither by national or religious prejudices, serving thus to make a man a citizenof his own country but not a human being with world relations. World citizenshipis not emphasised. The teaching imparted stimulates the latent massconsciousness of the child, and evokes the memory (racial and individual)through the impartation of facts—uncorrelated facts—most of them unrelated todaily living. These facts could serve (if used as seed thoughts in meditationand technically employed) to recover from that race consciousness and racialmemory, not only national history but past history as well. I mention this inorder to emphasise the danger of such undue emphasis upon the past, for if thiswere done on a large scale it would prove disastrous; it would put a premium onracial and national ideals and objectives and would lead rapidly to racialcrystallisation and senility—metaphorically speaking. An example of an effort inthis direction was seen going on in Germany, and in a lesser way in Italy; itculminated in the Axis. Fortunately, the tide of life in the youth of any nationcan be trusted to swing the thought of the race into a better direction than theevocation of past glory, so-called, and the emphasising of the things whichshould be left behind.I would like here to enlarge somewhat upon the interpretation of the much usedwords (frequently also misused): culture and civilisation. For it is theproduction of some form of culture—material or spiritual, or material andspiritual—which is the objective of all education. Education is the major agentin the world.Civilisation is the reaction of humanity to the purpose of any particular worldperiod. In each age, some idea must be expressed in the current racial idealism.In Atlantean times, the idea that predominated was basically sensory religiousidealism or mysticism, expressing itself in terms of approach to a felt butunseen deity, an expression of the [40] way of feeling. Yet there were highlysensitive races, composed of nations and groups who laboured over thedevelopment of the feeling nature, consciously sometimes, but mostlyunconsciously. Their attitude to each other, as individuals or nations, wasprimarily sensitive and emotional—a state of consciousness (I cannot say stateof mind) most difficult for the modern Aryan race to grasp, or even intuit, forwith us the mind is beginning to function. Their attitude to the deity wasequally sensitive, and their religious activities were mystical and devotional,devoid of any mental understanding. They were significantly emotional inreactions to beauty, to the terror evoked by divinity and to the emotionalcharacteristics of God, to the sense of light and to wonder. The mysterious, thesense of awe, the following blindly of some recognised \"sensitive\" of a higherorder than the ordinary human being, and the interpretation of God and nature interms of feeling-perception—these laid the basis of that ancient civilisationand have largely coloured our present racial attitudes, at least up until theadvent of Christ, Who wrought great changes in the human consciousness andushered in a new civilisation. Children are still largely Atlantean in theirconsciousness; it is with them a form of recapitulation, analogous to theprenatal stage; the same recapitulation goes forward upon the Path when a mandevelops the mystical consciousness anew, after he has evoked his mental natureand prior to unfolding true occult awareness or knowledge and the reactions ofthe higher mind. The problem before Education is to take the Atlanteanconsciousness of the child and make it Aryan or mental. The Atlanteans had noeducational system as we understand the term. The kings and priests intuited;the masses obeyed.In the present race a different civilised attitude is emerging and is nearingits consummation. In each age, some idea functions and expresses itself in bothracial and national idealisms. Its basic trend down the centuries has [41]produced our modern world and this has been strictly materialistic. A nationtoday is regarded as civilised when it is awakened to mental values and at thesame time it is demanding material values; and when the mind (the lower mind)—inits memory aspect, its discriminating and separative aspects, its analysingfunctions, and its ability to formulate concrete ideas based on materialperception, material desire and material purposes—is receiving the trainingwhich will make a material civilisation, and has made our material civilisationwhat it is today. With the emphasis shifting away from feeling-perception tomental attitudes towards life, with the desire to make the material life of thecitizen of every nation the dominant factor in the national thought, with themind unfoldment consecrated to material living, and with science definitelycommitted to the enunciation only of the provable and concerned only with theenergies of material effect, is it any wonder that the major consideration ofour modern civilisation lies in the field of the economic life? We are occupiedwith material conditions, with the object of increasing possessions, withbettering worldly situations, elaborating physical plane living, andsubstituting the tangible for the intangible, the concrete for the spiritual,and physical values for the subjective values. However, these latter must someday emerge into expression.The above statement is superficial and of so general a character that it doesnot deal with the relatively small minority who do sense these larger values andare working to bring about their emergence into the racial life. These peopleare the custodians for the advance ideals of the current civilisation, but theenergy which they release works out frequently in the establishment,temporarily, of the more concrete values. My remarks are only partial, and thefacts equally so. I exaggerate perhaps; yet maybe I do not. Nevertheless, thefact remains that the two great civilisations about which we can really knowanything—the Aryan [42] and the Atlantean—present two extreme objectives orpositions towards which the humanity of the two periods directed and stilldirect their attention.The Atlantean civilisation was definitely religious in its attitudes; religionwas the commonplace of life and the raison d'être of all that was. The worldafter death was the subject of interest and unwavering, unquestioning belief.The subtle influences emanating from the unseen realms, the forces of nature andman's relation to them through a keen sensitivity, and the entire gamut of hisemotional attitudes constituted the life of the race, and coloured all thatthere was or might have been of embryo thought. The result of all this,inherited by us when history as we now have it arose (from the time of theflood, whenever that might have been), can be expressed by such words asanimism, spiritualism, lower psychism and feeling. The sense of God, the senseof immortality, the sense of subtler inner relationships, the sense of worshipand the undue sensitivity of modern man is our outstanding heritage from thecivilisations which existed upon old Atlantis.Upon all this basic structure the exact opposite is being imposed today, and inthe reaction—normal, right and developing—man is laying a superstructure inwhich the emphasis is increasingly upon the tangible, the material, the seen,and upon that which can be proved, diagnosed, analysed, and utilised for theimproving of man's outer life and his material position upon the planet. Bothcivilisations have gone too far, and in the swing of the pendulum we shallinevitably return to a middle position, to the \"noble middle path.\" This middleway, utilising the best and the highest ideals which the two precedingcivilisations have produced, will characterise the coming Aquarian Age and itscivilisations. Such an expression of the material and the immaterial, of theseen and the unseen, of the tangible and the spiritual has ever been the goaland the objective of those who comprehend the true meaning of culture. In [43]the last analysis, and for the purposes of our theme, civilisation concerns themasses and the racial consciousness, while culture concerns the individual andthe unseen spiritual man. Therefore a civilisation which is a full expression oftrue culture lies far ahead in the development of the race.Culture is the approximation of the two ways—feeling and mind; of twoworlds—sensitivity and thought; and of the attitudes, relational in nature,which will enable a man to live as an intelligent, subjective being in atangible physical world. The man of culture relates the world of meaning to theworld of appearances and regards them in his mind (thus recognising them withhis brain, an indication of an established link or relationship) as constitutingone world with two aspects. He moves with equal freedom in both worlds, and withsimultaneity as far as his consciousness or his sense of awareness is concerned.Even in Atlantean times there were those who comprehended the significance ofculture as an outgrowth of civilisation.The masses must be civilised as a step towards giving them that culture whichwill make of them true and significant human beings. A human being has perforceto be a man, capable of living in the world of external realities, and at thesame time capable of recognising himself as living in an inner world, as a mindand a soul. He then expresses an inner subjective life of such potency that itcontrols and dominates the physical plane life, motivating it and giving it truedirection. This attitude of the human being and the task of bringing thiscondition of consciousness to fruition, have been regarded for centuries as thetask of organised religion, whereas it is essentially and necessarily that ofeducation. It is true that the Church in ancient days was the educator of thetime, but the emphasis was laid upon the inner and subjective life, and as arule no attempt was made to fuse and blend the two—outer material well-being andinner spiritual existence. Education is the task of the outstanding [44]thinkers of the race and the responsibility of all governments, one however thatthey seldom recognise.Finally, we shall seek to see what are the basic ideas (beginning with therecognised instincts) which have led man, step by step, to his present strugglefor world betterment, group elevation and natural self-determination with aview—unconscious for the most part—of providing a better organ of expressionwithin the living organism, humanity.It is therefore a platitude and truism to state that humanity is today passingthrough a crisis of immense proportions. The causes of this crisis must besought in many factors. They lie in the past, in the growth through evolution ofcertain basic tendencies in man; in past mistakes, present opportunities and thepowerful activity of the Hierarchy of Love.* The future is of great promise,provided man can learn the lessons of the present which have been clearlypresented to him; he must accept them and understand clearly the nature of hisproblem and of the crisis with its many ramifications and various implications.* One of the threemajor centres through which Deity manifests: Shamball, wherethe Will of God is known; Hierarchy,where the Love of God holds sway; Humanity,embodying the Intelligence aspect of God.The seething turmoil in which the masses of the people are now living and theemergence of one or two key people in every nation have a close relationship.These key people make their voices heard and evoke attention; their ideas arefollowed—rightly or wrongly—with attention, appreciation or distrust.The slow and careful formation of the New Group of World Servers is indicativeof the crisis. They are overseeing or ushering in the New Age and are present atthe birth pangs of the new civilisation and the coming into manifestation of anew race, a new culture and a new world outlook. The work is necessarily slowand those of you who are immersed in the problems and pains find it hard to view[45] the future with assurance or to interpret the present with clarity.In the field of education united action is essential. Surely a basic unity ofobjectives should govern the educational systems of the nations, even thoughuniformity of method and of techniques may not be possible. Differences oflanguage, of background and of culture will and should always exist; theyconstitute the beautiful tapestry of human living down the ages. But much thathas hitherto militated against right human relations must and should beeliminated.In the teaching of history, for instance, are we to revert to the bad old wayswherein each nation glorifies itself at the expense frequently of other nations,in which facts are systematically garbled, in which the pivotal points inhistory are the various wars down the ages—a history, therefore, of aggression,of the rise of a material and selfish civilisation and one which had thenationalistic and, therefore, separative spirit, which has fostered racialhatred and stimulated national prides? The first historical date usuallyremembered by the average British child is \"William, the Conqueror, 1066.\" TheAmerican child remembers the landing of the Pilgrim Fathers and the gradualtaking of the country from its rightful inhabitants, and perhaps the Boston TeaParty. The heroes of history are all warriors—Alexander the Great, JuliusCaesar, Attila the Hun, Richard Coeur de Lion, Napoleon, George Washington andmany others. Geography is largely history in another form but presented in asimilar manner—a history of discovery, investigation and seizure, followedfrequently by wicked and cruel treatment of the inhabitants of the discoveredlands. Greed, ambition, cruelty and pride are the keynotes of our teaching ofhistory and geography.These wars, aggression and thefts which have distinguished every great nationwithout exception are facts and cannot be denied. Surely, however, the lessonsof the evils which they wrought (culminating in the war 1914-1945) can be [46]pointed out and the ancient causes of present day prejudices and dislikes can beshown and their futility emphasised. Is it not possible to build our theory ofhistory upon the great and good ideas which have conditioned the nations andmade them what they are, and emphasize the creativity which has distinguishedall of them? Can we not present more effectively the great cultural epochswhich—suddenly appearing in some one nation—enriched the entire world and gaveto humanity its literature, its art and its vision?The war produced great migrations. Armies marched and fought in every part ofthe world; persecuted peoples escaped from one land to another; welfare workerswent from country to country, serving the soldiers, salvaging the sick, feedingthe hungry and studying conditions. The world today is very, very small and menare discovering (sometimes for the first time in their lives) that humanity isone and that all men, no matter what the colour of their skin or the country inwhich they live, resemble each other. We are all intermingled today. The UnitedStates is composed of people from every known country; over fifty differentraces or nations compose the U.S.S.R. The United Kingdom is a Commonwealth ofNations, independent nations bound together into one group. India is composed ofa multiplicity of peoples, religions and tongues—hence her problem. The worlditself is a great fusing pot, out of which the One Humanity is emerging. Thisnecessitates a drastic change in our methods of presenting history andgeography. Science has always been universal. Great art and literature havealways belonged to the world. It is upon these facts that the education to begiven to the children of the world must be built—upon our similarities, ourcreative achievements, our spiritual idealisms, and our points of contact.Unless this is done the wounds of the nations will never be healed and thebarriers which have existed for centuries will never be removed.The educators who face the present world opportunity [47] should see to it thata sound foundation is laid for the coming civilisation; they must undertake thatit is general and universal in its scope, truthful in its presentation andconstructive in its approach. What initial steps the educators of the differentcountries take will inevitably determine the nature of the coming civilisation.They must prepare for a renaissance of all the arts and for a new and free flowof the creative spirit in man. They must lay an emphatic importance upon thosegreat moments in human history wherein man's divinity flamed forth and indicatednew ways of thinking, new modes of human planning and thus changed for all timethe trend of human affairs. These moments produced the Magna Charta; they gaveemphasis, through the French Revolution, to the concepts of liberty, equalityand fraternity; they formulated the American Bill of Rights and on the high seasin our own time they gave us the Atlantic Charter and the Four Freedoms. Theseare the great concepts which must govern the new age with its nascentcivilisation and its future culture. If the children of today are taught thesignificance of these five great declarations and are, at the same time, taughtthe futility of hate and war, there is hope of a better and happier as well asof a safer world.Two major ideas should be taught to the children of every country. They are: thevalue of the individual and the fact of the one humanity. The war boys and girlshave learnt, from appearances, that human life has small value; the fascistcountries have taught that the individual is of no value except in so far as heimplements the designs of some dictator—a Mussolini or a Hitler. In othercountries, some people and some groups—through hereditary position or financialassets—are regarded as of importance and the rest of the nation as of littleimportance. In still other countries, the individual regards himself of so muchimportance and his right to please himself of so much moment that his relationto the whole is entirely lost. Yet the value of the individual and the existenceof that whole we call Humanity [48] are most closely related. This needsemphasising. These two principles, when properly taught and understood, willlead to the intensive culture of the individual and then to his recognition ofhis responsibility as an integral part of the whole body of humanity.In the schools of today (grammar or primary schools, high schools or secondaryschools, universities or colleges, using terms in general use) there can be seenan imperfect and symbolic picture of the triple objectives of the new education:Civilisation, Culture, Unification.The grammar or primary schools might be regarded as the custodians ofcivilisation; they must fit the child for citizenship, teach him his place as asocial unit, and emphasise his group relations, thus fitting him for intelligentliving and evoking the racial memory through the courses given, in order to laythe foundation for his human relations. Reading, writing and arithmetic,elementary history (with the emphasis upon world history), geography and poetrywill be taught. They must teach him certain basic and important facts of living,foundational truths, coordination and control.The high schools or the secondary schools should regard themselves as thecustodians of culture; they should emphasise the larger values of history andliterature and give some understanding of art. They should begin to train theboy or girl for that future profession or mode of life which it is obvious willcondition them. Citizenship will be taught in larger terms and the world of truevalues be pointed out and idealism consciously and definitely cultivated. Thepractical application of ideals will be emphasised. They should teach the youthof the world in such a manner that he will begin to fuse the world ofappearances and the world of values and of meaning in his consciousness. Heshould begin to relate the worlds of objective outer living and of innersubjective existence. I am choosing my words with care. [49]Our colleges and universities should be a higher extension of all that has beenalready done. They should beautify and complete the structure already erectedand should deal more directly with the world of meaning. Internationalproblems—economic, social, political and religious—should be considered and theman or woman related still more definitely to the world as a whole. This in noway indicates neglect of individual or national problems or undertakings but itseeks to incorporate them into the whole as integral and effective parts, andthus avoid the separative attitudes which have brought about the downfall of ourmodern world.The college or the university should in reality be the correspondence in thefield of education to the world of the Hierarchy; it should be the custodian ofthose methods, techniques and systems of thought and of life which will relate ahuman being to the world of souls, to the Kingdom of God, and not only to otherhuman beings upon the physical plane; not only to the world of phenomena butalso to the inner world of values and quality.Again I repeat, this fitting of a man for citizenship in the Kingdom of God isnot essentially a religious activity, to be handled by the exponents of thegreat world religions. It should be the task of the higher education, givingpurpose and significance to all that has been done. If this seems idealistic andimpossible to you, let me assure you that by the time the Aquarian Age is infull flower, this will be the assured and recognised objective of the educatorsof that time.The following sequence suggests itself as we consider the curriculum to beplanned for the youth of the immediate generations:Primary education . . . . Civilisation . . . . Ages 1-14Secondary education . . Culture Ages . . Ages 14-21Higher education . . . . . Spiritual Ages . . Ages 21-28It is only our economic material emphasis and pressure which force the young towork before they are mature. [50] It should also be remembered (and this isbeing more widely recognised) that the quality of the young children now cominginto incarnation is steadily getting better and higher. They are in many casesabnormally intelligent, and what you (in your technical parlance) call theirI.Q. is frequently phenomenally high. This will be increasingly the case, untilyoung people of fourteen will have the equipment and intelligence of thebrilliant college men and women of today.It is not possible for me to prove the truth of these statements, but a study ofthe race and of the modern child in our more civilised countries will indicatetrends and tendencies which may make my position sounder in your finalestimation. You would all do well to study carefully this distinction betweenculture and civilisation.Putting this same truth in other words, and recognising as a basic premise theessentially supernormal potentialities of the human being, we might say that:The first effort of education to civilise the child will be to train and rightlydirect his instincts.The second obligation upon the educators will be to bring about his trueculture, by training him to use his intellect rightly.The third duty of education will be to evoke and to develop the intuition.When these three are developed and functioning you will have a civilised,cultured and spiritually awakened human being. A man will then be instinctivelycorrect, intellectually sound, and intuitively aware. His soul, his mind, andhis brain will be functioning as they should and in right relation to eachother, thus again producing coordination and correct alignment. Some day ananalysis will be made of the contribution of the three great continents—Asia,Europe and America—to this triple unfoldment, as far as the Aryan race isconcerned. The glory of humanity must, however, be remembered; it consists inthis: each race has produced those who have expressed the highest [51] which waspossible in their day and time—men who blended in themselves the triplicity ofinstinct, intellect and intuition. Their numbers were relatively few in theearly stages of mankind's unfoldment, but the process of speeding up thedevelopment is rapidly going forward, and many are today fitting themselves forthe \"higher education\" in the true sense of the term. Much more will beaccomplished when the educators of the world grasp the purpose of the process asa whole planned unfoldment, and will then give their attention to theinstinctual, intellectual and intuitive training of the race in such a mannerthat the whole twenty-eight years of training will be seen as an ordered,directed process, and the goal will be clearly visioned.It will be apparent, then, that those to be taught will be gauged from theangles upon which I have touched:a. Those capable of being rightly civilised. This refers to the mass of men.b. Those capable of being carried forward into the world of culture. Thisincludes a very large number.c. Those who can add to the assets of civilisation and culture \"the equipment\"required for the process of functioning as conscious souls, not only in thethree worlds of instinctual and intellectual living, but in the world ofspiritual being also, and yet with complete continuity of consciousness and witha complete triple integration.Not all can pass into the higher grades, and this must be appreciated. Thegauging of ability will be based upon an understanding of the ray types (thescience of esoteric psychology), on a comprehension of the condition of theglandular and physiological equipment, upon certain specific tests, and upon thenew form of astrology.I would here make a simple request to the earnest student. Ponder on thefollowing four statements: [52]1. The antahkarana expresses the quality of the magnetism which opens the doorinto the teaching centre of the Great White Lodge.2. The antahkarana is the conscious integrating force.3. The antahkarana is the medium of light transference.4. The antahkarana concerns the continuity of man's perception.THE PROCESS OF UNFOLDMENTI would like to add to the preceding analogy one more, which will serve toclarify the process of unfoldment in your minds and make the entire theme (fromthe racial angle) still more clear and definite:General racial development . . . . Civilisation . . . . Path of PurificationTraining of the Intelligentsia . . . Culture . . . . . . Path of DiscipleshipProduction of the Illuminati . . . . Illumination . . . Path of InitiationIt will be apparent to you, therefore, that the whole goal of the future and ofthe present effort, is to bring humanity to the point where it—occultlyspeaking—\"enters into light.\" The entire trend of the present urge forward,which can be noted so distinctly in the race, is to enable the race to acquireknowledge, to transmute it into wisdom by the aid of the understanding, and thusto become \"fully enlightened.\" Enlightenment is the major goal of education.It is precisely in this region of thought and of recognition that thedistinction is found between the work of the Buddha and the work of the Christ.The Buddha achieved \"Enlightenment\" and was the first of our humanity to do so.Lesser grades of enlightenment have been frequently achieved by many previouslyincarnating Sons of God. Christ, because of the attainment of the Buddha andbecause of His own point in evolution, was enabled to inaugurate a new era andinstitute a new goal, wherein another divine principle was enabled to come intomanifestation and to achieve [53] general recognition. He inaugurated the \"ageof love\" and gave to the people an expression of a new divine aspect, that oflove. The Buddha culminated the \"age of knowledge.\" The Christ began the \"age oflove.\" Both ages embody and express two major divine principles. Thus the neweducation has been made possible by the work of the Buddha. This will indicateto you how slowly evolution moves. The new religion has been made possible bythe work and the life of the Christ. Speaking esoterically, the knowledge petalsof the human egoic lotus have unfolded, and the Buddha accelerated the rapidaction of this happening. Now the love petals of the egoic lotus of the humanfamily are also unfolding—the rapidity of this occurrence being the result ofChrist's action. Can you understand the significance of what I am attempting totell you, and can you grasp the meaning of what I am going to say?The points that I am seeking to make are as follows:Because the three knowledge petals of the human egoic lotus are now raciallyunfolded (and when I use the word \"racial\" I mean the human family and not theAryan race), it is now possible for the love petals to unfold. The energyflowing from the outer tier of petals has had a triple effect:1. It has vitalised the entire body of humanity, and has produced the presentspeed, intelligent (or should I say \"intellectual\"?) civilisation, and ourmodern culture, wherever it is found. The brain of humanity is now open tovitalisation, hence mass education.2. It has opened a channel so that the love petals can vitalise the astral bodyof humanity, thus leading to general cooperation and group love. The heart ofhumanity is now open to vitalisation, hence the philanthropic, goodwill andwelfare movements of today.3. It will make possible, eventually, the vitalising of the mind body by thewill or sacrifice petals, and [54] this will give awareness of the Plan,directed purpose, and group synthesis.The first of these three knowledge petals opened in Lemurian times and brought ameasure of light to the physical plane consciousness of humanity. The secondopened in Atlantean times and brought light to the astral plane. And in ourrace, the Aryan, the third petal opened and brought the light of mentalknowledge to man. Thus was completed (in the three races) the arduous task ofvitalising the threefold manifested world (physical, astral, mental), and theenergy of intelligence became a powerful, ruling factor. Now the task ofvitalising man with the energy of love is proceeding and making much progress,and the effects (because they emanate from the second aspect of divinity) willbe produced with great facility, and in the realm of conscious awareness. I saythis for your encouragement.Through the activity of the energy of knowledge you have:Civilisation.....Culture......Illuminationand in the second case you will have:Cooperation......Loving Understanding......Group LoveThere are higher correspondences for which we have as yet no adequate words.Cooperative goodwill is all that can, at this time, be expected from the masses,and this is the sublimation of the forces released through civilisation. Lovingunderstanding should be the hallmark of the cultured, wiser group, plus anability to correlate the world of meaning with the world of outer effects.Ponder on this sentence. Group love is, and must be, the outstandingcharacteristic of the Illuminati of the world, and it is at this time themotivating power of the Masters of the Wisdom, until such time that enoughdisciples are expressive of this particular force[55] When the will or sacrifice petals of the human egoic lotus are opened,there will then be the appearance of a still higher triad of correspondences.These will be known as:Participation......Purpose.......PrecipitationTherefore, as a result of the evolutionary processes in humanity, there willappear the following category of forces or energies, each of them demonstratingcertain definite qualities, and they will parallel the opening of the petals inthe human lotus.EDUCATION AND SCIENCE - I. KNOWLEDGE PETALSCivilisation . . . . . . . Culture . . . . . . . . .IlluminationThe Masses of Men . .The Intellectuals . . .Spiritual ManPath of Discipleship . . Path of Initiation . . Path of Purification PlusRELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY - II. LOVE PETALSCooperation . . . . . . Loving Understanding .

(of the Plan bythe Hierarchy)You can note from the tabulation that the love petals are indeed showing signsof opening and this will make clear to you the possibility of certain hoped-forevents. The world has to move forward regularly and in order. Prematurehappenings are usually disastrous.All this concerns the cultural unfoldment of the race and is proceeding apace.When the conditioning factors are better understood and their method and purposeare grasped, we shall see an effort on the part of those interested in educationto move with greater rapidity; this will hasten the achievement of culture bythe masses, and the attainment of illumination by the more intellectual group.There is one point that I would like to make here. In the future, illuminationwill be viewed primarily from the intellectual angle and the whole subject willbe approached mentally, and not so definitely (as is the case today) from theangle of religion. Illumination, mysticism and religion have gone hand in hand.One of the major contributions of the present age to the unfoldment of the racehas been the growing recognition that spirituality is not to be confused withand confined to the acceptance and the following of the precepts contained inthe world Scriptures; it cannot be held down to the implications given to theseScriptures by an orthodox priestly caste, nor can the trends of ancienttheologies govern. God can be known by His works, and these works can be moreeasily appreciated through the revelations [57] of science than by the hymns,prayers and sermons of the churches throughout the world. What then will be thetask of the churches in the future? And what will be the major objective of thecoming new religion? Primarily it will be to bring about the opening of the lovepetals, thus inaugurating an era of true cooperation, loving understanding andgroup love. This will be done by training the people and the individual in therules of Right Approach.The keynote of the new education is essentially right interpretation of lifepast and present and its relation to the future of mankind; the keynote of thenew religion must and should be right approach to God, transcendent in natureand immanent in man, whilst the keynote of the new science of politics and ofgovernment will be right human relations and for both of these education mustprepare the child.Those working in these three groups must eventually proceed in the closestcooperation, and it is for this planned understanding and this intelligentactivity of mankind that the new education must prepare. In the above comments,plus what I have given earlier, you have the few suggestions which I have soughtto make in connection with the cultural unfoldment of the race. The true historyof humanity, which is long and varied and lost in the speculative indications ofthe esotericists (which, when true, are seldom susceptible of proof), havebrought humanity to a point in its evolution wherein the light of knowledge isdefinitely permeating the dark places of the earth. A mass of information is nowavailable to those who have the ability to read and write—and the number ofthese is growing every day—whilst the means of transmission and of communicationhave practically annihilated time and brought the whole world together as afunctioning unit. A very high level of educational attainment is also emergingin all civilised countries. The average citizen is in possession of a vastamount of data on every imaginable subject. Much of it is ill-digested and [58]unusable, yet it tends to the general elevation of the mental process. Theoutput of men's thoughts in writing and in speech, embodying that which is old,that which is new and modern, and that which is superficial and relativelyworthless, is so vast today that it is impossible to register it, and thelifetime of a book is brief. To crown all, there is a definite effort to bringthe resources of education within the reach of every man upon the planet. Thiseventually will be done, and the intended type of education will accomplish thefollowing things, thus laying the ground for the future unfoldment of the higherand better education:1. Make available to the average citizen what has \"come to light\" in the past.2. Evoke interest in the new sciences and knowledge which are coming to light inthe present.3. Develop the memory and the power to recognise that which is presented to themind.4. Correlate the past with the present.5. Train citizens in the rights and nature of possession, with the attention tothe processes of enjoyment and right use of the material and intellectual giftsof life, and their relation to the group.6. Indicate, after due study, the right vocation.7. Teach the methods whereby the coordination of the Personality can be broughtabout.All this will turn the man out into the arena of life with a certain amount ofknowledge of what has been discovered in the past and what is his intellectualheritage; with a certain amount of mental activity, which can be developed andtrained if the man himself so desires it and brings it about by the righthandling of himself in relation to his environment; with certain mental ideals,dreams and speculations, which can be transmuted into valuable assets if the manis dowered with persistence, if his imaginative faculties have not been dulledby an unbalanced, enforced curriculum, [59] and if he has been fortunate enoughto have a wise teacher and some understanding senior friends.It will be apparent to you also that the task of the new education is to takethe civilised masses and lead them on to the point where they are cultured; totake likewise the cultured people and train them in the ways of the Illuminati.Eventually it will be found that what is now taught in the schools of theesotericists will be part of the acknowledged curriculum imposed upon the risinggeneration, and that the teaching given to the advanced, thinking people of theworld today will be adapted to the needs of the youth of the period.THE NATURE OF ESOTERICISMEducators in the new age will lay an increasing emphasis upon the esotericapproach, and it might be of service if I here attempted to define esotericismin terms of the general average intelligence of esoteric students and theirpoint in evolution. I would remind you that true esotericism is a far deeperthing (from the angle of the Hierarchy) than you can appreciate.One of the most inadequate of the definitions of esotericism is that it concernsthat which is concealed and hidden and which, even though suspected, stillremains unknown. The inference is that to be an esotericist is to be among thosewho seek to penetrate into a certain secret realm to which the ordinary studentis not permitted to penetrate. If this were all that it is, then every scientistand every mystic would represent the approach of the mental type and of thedeveloped emotional type to the world of esotericism and of the hiddenrealities. This would not, however, be accurate. The mystic is never a trueesotericist, for he is not dealing in his consciousness with energies andforces, but with that vague \"Something other\" (called God, the Christ, theBeloved) and therefore, in reality, with that which satisfies the hunger of hissoul. The scientist who is [60] now so rapidly dealing with and entering intothe world of forces and energies, is in reality a true esotericist—even if, inhis effort to control the sought-for energies, he denies their source. That isof relatively small moment; later he will recognise their emanating source.The basic approach for all who endeavour to grasp esotericism, or to teachesoteric students, is to lay the emphasis upon the world of energies and torecognise that behind all happenings in the world of phenomena (and by that Imean the three worlds of human evolution) exists the world of energies; theseare of the greatest diversity and complexity, but all of them move and workunder the Law of Cause and Effect. It is hardly necessary for me therefore toindicate the very practical nature of this definition and its applicability tothe life of the individual aspirant, to community life and world affairs, or tothe immediate conditioning levels of experimental spiritual energies which areconstantly seeking impact upon or contact with the world of phenomena. This theydo, under spiritual direction, in order to implement the Plan. The abovestatement is foundational in its importance; all other definitions are implicitin it, and it is the first important truth anent esotericism which must belearnt and applied by each aspirant to the mystery and the universality of thatwhich moves the worlds and underlies the evolutionary process.The first task of the esotericist is to comprehend the nature of the energieswhich are seeking to condition him and which work out into expression on thephysical plane through the medium of his equipment or his vehicle ofmanifestation. The esoteric student has, therefore, to grasp that:1. He is an aggregation of forces, inherited and conditioned by what he hasbeen, plus a great antagonistic force which is not a principle and which we callthe physical body. [61]2. He is sensitive to and should be increasingly aware of certain energies, atpresent unknown and of no use to him; of these he must eventually become aware,if he is to move deeper into the world of hidden forces. They may be energieswhich, for him, would be evil were he to work with them, and these must bedistinguished and discarded; there are others which he must learn to use, forthey would prove beneficial and would increase his knowledge, and shouldtherefore be regarded as good. Bear in mind, however, that energies per se areneither bad nor good. The Great White Lodge, our spiritual Hierarchy, and theBlack Lodge employ the same universal energies but with different motives andobjectives; both groups are groups of trained esotericists.The esotericist in training has, therefore:1. To become aware of the nature of the forces which constitute his personalityequipment and which he himself magnetically brought into expression in the threeworlds. They form a combination of active forces; he must learn to differentiatebetween strictly physical energy, which is automatic in its response to otherand inner energies, and those which come from emotional and mental levels ofconsciousness, focussing through the etheric body which, in turn, motivates andgalvanises his physical vehicle into certain activities.2. To become sensitive to the impelling energies of the soul, emanating from thehigher mental levels. These seek to control the forces of the threefold man whena certain definite point in evolution is reached.3. To recognise the conditioning energies in his environment, [62] seeing themnot as events or circumstances but as energy in action; by this means he learnsto find his way behind the scene of outer happenings into the world of energies,seeking contact and qualifying for the bringing about of certain activities. Hethus acquires entrance into the world of meaning. Events, circumstances,happenings and physical phenomena of every kind are simply symbols of what isoccurring in the inner worlds, and it is into these worlds that the esotericistmust enter as far as his perception permits; he will sequentially discoverworlds which will call for his scientific penetration.4. For the majority of aspirants, the Hierarchy itself remains an esoteric realmwhich demands discovery and which will accept penetration. I am choosing mywords with care in an effort to evoke your esoteric response.Beyond this point of humanity's destined goal I seek not to go; to initiates anddisciples who have not yet taken the Initiation of Transfiguration, the higherrealms of awareness and the \"secret Place of the Most High\" (the Council Chamberof Sanat Kumara) remain deeply esoteric. It is a higher realm ofenergies—planetary, extra-planetary and inter-planetary; with them educatorshave no concern and with their consideration the teaching staff of an esotericschool is not called upon to deal. The task is to train students in therecognition of energy and force; to discriminate between the various types ofenergy, both in relation to themselves and to world affairs, and to begin torelate that which is seen and experienced to that which is unseen, conditioningand determining. This is the esoteric task.There is a tendency among esoteric students, particularly those in the olderPiscean groups, to regard any interest in the energies producing world events orwhich concern governments and politics as antagonistic to esoteric and [63]spiritual endeavour. But the newer esotericism which the more modern groups andthe more mental types will sponsor sees all events and world movements andnational governments, plus all political circumstances, as expressions of theenergies to be found in the inner world of esoteric research; therefore they seeno sound reason for excluding such an important aspect of human affairs fromtheir reasoning and thinking and from the discovery of those new truths andtechniques which may bring about the new era of right human relations. They ask:Why omit political research from the spiritual curriculum? They deem it to be ofequal if not of greater importance than the activity of the churches;governments condition people and aid in the production of any currentcivilisation, forcing the masses of men into certain needed lines of thought.The churches and men everywhere need to learn that there is nothing in theentire world of phenomena, of forces and of energies, which cannot be broughtunder the control of that which is spiritual. All that exists is, in reality,spirit in manifestation. The masses today are becoming politically-minded, andthis is viewed by the Masters as a great step forward. When thespiritually-minded people of the world include this relatively new area of humanthought and its international activity within the field of their esotericresearch, very great progress will be made.Let me give you one simple illustration: War is, factually, a great explosion ofenergies and forces, generated on the inner planes where the esotericist oughtto be working (but is seldom to be found), and finding its dire and catastrophicexpression upon the physical plane. This is indicated today by the constant useof the terms \"Forces of Light\" and \"Forces of Evil.\" When the inner, esotericand predisposing causes of war are discovered through esoteric research, thenwar and wars will come to an end. This is in the nature of truly esoteric work,but is scorned by present day esotericists who regard themselves as spiritually[64] superior to such affairs and—in their ivory tower—concentrate on their owndevelopment, plus a little philosophy.One point should here be stated: Esotericism is not in any way of a mystical andvague nature. It is a science—essentially the science of the soul of allthings—and has its own terminology, experiments, deductions and laws. When I say\"soul,\" I refer to the animating consciousness found throughout nature and onthose levels which lie outside the territory usually called nature. Students areapt to forget that every level of awareness, from the highest to the lowest, isan aspect of the cosmic physical plane, and is therefore (from the angle ofevolutionary process) material in nature, and (from the angle or point of viewof certain divine Observers) definitely tangible and formed of creativesubstance. The esotericist is dealing with substance all the time; he isconcerned with that living, vibrant substance of which the worlds are made andwhich—inherited as it is from a previous solar system—is coloured by pastevents, and is (as has been said) \"already tinged with karma.\" It should also benoted that just as the physical plane, so familiar to us, is not regarded as aprinciple by the esoteric student, so the cosmic physical plane (from thestandpoint of the cosmic lives) is likewise \"not a principle.\" I give you heremuch food for thought.It might be stated that the esotericist is occupied in discovering and workingwith those principles which energise each level of the cosmic physical plane andwhich are, in reality, aspects of the qualified life energy which is working inand through unprincipled substance. His task is to shift the focus of hisattention away from the substance-form side of existence and to become aware ofthat which has been the source of form production on any specific level. It ishis task to develop within himself the needed responsiveness and sensitivity tothe quality of the life dominating any form until he arrives eventually at thequality of the ONE LIFE [65] which animates the planet and within Whose activitywe live and move and have our being.To do this, he must first of all discover the nature of his own qualifiedenergies (and here the nature of the governing rays enters in) which areexpressing themselves through his three lower vehicles of manifestation, andlater through his integrated personality. Having arrived at a measure of thisknowledge and having oriented himself towards the qualified life aspect, hebegins to develop the subtle, inner mechanism through which contact can be madewith the more general and universal aspects. He learns to differentiate betweenthe quality or karmic predispositions of the \"unprincipled\" substance of whichhis form and all forms are made, and the qualified principles which are seekingexpression through those forms and, incidentally, to redeem, salvage and purifythem so that the substance of the next solar system will be of a higher orderthan that of the present one, and consequently more responsive to the willaspect of the Logos.Viewed from this angle, esotericism is the science of redemption, and of thisall World Saviours are the everlasting symbol and exponents. It was to redeemsubstance and its forms that the planetary Logos came into manifestation, andthe entire Hierarchy with its great Leader, the Christ (the present worldSymbol), might be regarded as a hierarchy of redeemers, skilled in the scienceof redemption. Once They have mastered this science, They can then pass on tothe Science of Life and deal with the energies which will eventually hold anduse the qualified, redeemed and then principled substance and forms. It is theredemption of unprincipled substance, its creative restoration and spiritualintegration, which is Their goal; the fruits of Their labour will be seen in thethird and final solar system. Their activity will produce a great spiritual andplanetary fusion, of which the fusion of personality and soul (at a certainpoint upon [66] the path of evolution) is the symbol in the microcosmic sense.You can see by this the close relation between the work of the individualaspirant or disciple as he redeems, salvages and purifies his threefold body ofmanifestation and the work of the planetary Logos as He performs a similar taskin connection with the \"three periodical vehicles\" through which He works: Hispersonality vehicle, His soul expression and His monadic aspect.By means of all that I have said you will realise that I am endeavouring to takethe vagueness out of the word \"esotericism,\" and to indicate the extremelyscientific and practical nature of the enterprise upon which all esotericistsare embarked.Esoteric study, when coupled with esoteric living, reveals in time the world ofmeaning and leads eventually to the world of significances. The esotericiststarts by endeavouring to discover the reason why; he wrestles with the problemof happenings, events, crises and circumstances in order to arrive at themeaning they should hold for him; when he has ascertained the meaning of anyspecific problem, he uses it as an invitation to penetrate more deeply into thenewly revealed world of meaning; he then learns to incorporate his littlepersonal problems into the problem of the larger Whole, thus losing sight of thelittle self and discovering the larger Self. The true esoteric viewpoint isalways that of the larger Whole. He finds the world of meaning spread like anintricate network over all activity and every aspect of the phenomenal world. Ofthis network the etheric web is the symbol and design; and the etheric web to befound between the centres up the individual spinal column is its microcosmiccorrespondence, like a series of doors of entrance into the larger world ofmeaning. This, in reality, concerns the true Science of the Centres to which Ihave frequently referred. They are modes of conscious entry (when developed andfunctioning) into a world of subjective realities [67] and into hitherto unknownphases of the divine consciousness.Esotericism is not, however, concerned with the centres as such, and esotericismis not an effort scientifically to awaken the centres, as many students think.Esotericism really is training in the ability to function freely in the world ofmeaning; it is not occupied with any aspect of the mechanical form; it isoccupied entirely with the soul aspect—the aspect of Saviour, Redeemer andInterpreter—and with the mediating principle between life and substance. Thismediating principle is the soul of the individual aspirant or disciple (if onemay use such misleading wording); it is also the anima mundi in the world as awhole.Esotericism therefore involves a life lived in tune with the inner subjectiverealities; it is only possible when the student is intelligently polarised andmentally focussed; it is only useful when the student can move among these innerrealities with skill and understanding. Esotericism involves also comprehensionof the relation between forces and energies and the power to use energy for thestrengthening, and then for the creative use of the forces contacted; hencetheir redemption. Esotericism uses the forces of the third aspect (that ofintelligent substance) as recipients of the energies of the two higher aspectsand, in so doing, salvages substance. Esotericism is the art of \"bringing downto earth\" those energies which emanate from the highest sources and there\"grounding them\" or anchoring them. As illustration: it was an esoteric activityof a world-wide group of students which resulted in the giving out of theteaching anent the New Group of World Servers, (A Treatise on White Magic, pages398-433; A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol. II Esoteric Psychology, pages629-751). thereby grounding and fixing in the consciousness of humanity the factof the existence and work of this basically subjective group; thus the work ofthat group was focussed and their redeeming activity intensified.[68] All true esoteric activity produces light and illumination; it results inthe inherited light of substance being intensified and qualified by the higherlight of the soul—in the case of humanity consciously functioning. It istherefore possible to define esotericism and its activity in terms of light, butI refrain from doing so because of the vagueness and the mystical applicationhitherto developed by esotericists in past decades. If esotericists wouldaccept, in its simplest form, the pronouncement of modern science that substanceand light are synonymous terms, and would recognise also that the light whichthey can bring to bear on substance (the application of energy to force) isequally substantial in nature, a far more intelligent approach would be made.The esotericist does deal with light in its three aspects, but it is preferabletoday to attempt a different approach until—through development, trial andexperiment—the esotericist knows these triple differentiations in a practicalsense and not just theoretically and mystically. We have to live down some ofthe mistakes of the past.I have given you many other definitions in my various books, and some of themwere quite simple; they can carry meaning today and will come to have moreabstruse significances to you later on.I would challenge all esotericists to attempt the practical approach which Ihave here outlined. I would ask them to live redemptive lives, to unfold theirinnate mental sensitivity, and to work continuously with the meaning which is tobe found behind all individual, community, national and world affairs. If thisis done, then the light will suddenly and increasingly shine upon your ways. Youcan become light-bearers, knowing then that \"in that light you will seeLight\"—and so will your fellowmen."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER III - THE NEXT STEP IN THE MENTAL DEVELOPMENT OF HUMANITYTHE PRESENT TRANSITION PERIOD[69] There are three immediate steps ahead of the educational systems of theworld, and some progress has already been made towards taking them. Bear in mindthat under the evolutionary urge such steps are often made without anyunderstanding of the true objectives, or any real grasp of the emergingsignificance and purpose. They are simply made because the need of the timemakes them the obvious next step, because the old system is failing toaccomplish its intended purpose, because the results are patently undesirable,and because some man of vision works out a newer method and imposes his willupon those around him in order to demonstrate the new ideal. These threeimmediate steps are:First: The development of more adequate means of understanding and studying thehuman being. This will be made possible in three ways:1. The growth and the development of the Science of Psychology. This is thescience of the essential man, and is at this time being more generallyrecognised as useful to, and consistent with, the right development of the humanunit. The various schools of psychology, [70] so numerous and separative, willeach eventually contribute its particular and peculiar truth, and thus the realscience of the soul will emerge from this synthesis.2. The growth and the development of the Science of the Seven Rays. This sciencewill throw light upon racial and individual types; it will clearly formulate thenature of individual and racial problems, it will indicate the forces andenergies which are struggling for expression in the individual and in the race;and when the two major rays and the three minor rays (which meet in every man)are recognised and studied by the educator in connection with the individual,the result will be right individual and group training, and correct vocationalindications.3. The acceptance of the Teaching anent the Constitution of Man given by theesotericists, with the implied relation of soul and body, the nature of thosebodies, their qualities and purpose, and the interrelation existing between thesoul and the three vehicles of expression in the three worlds of humanendeavour.In order to bring this about, the best that the East has to offer and theknowledge of the West will have to be made available. The training of thephysical body, the control of the emotional body, and the development of rightmental apprehension must proceed sequentially, with due attention to the timefactor, and also to that period wherein planned coordination of all aspects ofthe man should be carefully developed.Second: The recognition of the facts of Esoteric Astrology.When this becomes possible there will be an opportunity to train the child fromits earliest breath. A careful record will be kept of that exact moment, themoment of birth, or [71] of the first breath, often accompanied by the firstcry. Character delineations will be noted and compared with the developingsubject and also with the ray chart, and the relation of these two—the horoscopeand the ray chart—will be subjected to a careful analysis every seven years.These processes will guide the educator in the necessary steps which should betaken wisely to hasten the child's unfoldment. Modern ordinary astrology, withits prevision factor, its emphasis upon the nonessential points and upon thephysical concerns of the incarnated soul, will be gradually superseded by therecognition of relationships, of life objectives, of basic characterpredispositions and of the soul purpose, and much will then become possible tothe wise friend and guide of youth—which is what every educator should aim tobe.Third: The admittance of the fact of the Law of Rebirth as a governing, naturalprocess.This will serve as a determining factor in the racial life and will bring muchlight into the educational Field. The tracing and relating of basic trends topast racial unfoldments and to ancient racial episodes will prove of interestand of import, and though the recovery of past lives will be of no interest, therecognition of characteristics which have been inherited from the past willserve real purpose. Young people will then be studied from the standpoint oftheir probable point upon the ladder of evolution, and will be grouped as:a. Lemurians, with physical predispositions.b. Atlanteans, with emotional dominance.c. Aryans, with mental tendencies and inclinations.d. New race, with group qualities and consciousness and idealistic vision.The time factor (from the angle of present attainment and possible goal in theimmediate life) will be carefully considered, [72] and in this way there will beno lost motion; the boy or girl will meet with understanding help and withanalysis, but not with ignorance and criticism; they will be safeguarded and notpunished; they will be stimulated and not held back; they will be occultlyrecognised, and therefore will not constitute a problem.It will be obvious to you that some decades must elapse before such a state ofaffairs can become possible and usual, but you will note that I have said\"decades\" and not \"centuries.\" The earlier experiments along this line willbecome possible only in small schools of specially selected children or smallcolleges with a picked and trained faculty, cautiously ready to experiment. Itis only by the demonstration of the advantage of the above methods of studyingand training children that national educational authorities will be convinced ofthe light which these modes of approach to the delicate task of fitting thehuman being for life, can throw upon the problem. At the same time, it isessential that such schools and colleges preserve as much of the ordinarydemanded curriculum as is possible, so as to be able to demonstrate theiradequacy when in competition with other recognised educational systems.If a true understanding of the seven ray types, of the constitution of man andof astrology, plus a right application of a synthetic psychology is of any useat all, it must demonstrate itself in the production of a correctly coordinated,wisely developed, highly intelligent and mentally directed human being.The trouble with the majority of the previous attempts to impose a form of thenew age education upon the modern child has been of a twofold nature:First, there has been no compromise between the present form of education andthe desired ideal; there has been no scientific bridging done; and no attempthas been made to correlate the best of the present methods (probably welladapted to the child of the period) and some of the more [73] appropriatemethods embodied in the new vision, particularly those which can be easilyapproximated to those in use. Only in this way can the sequential steps betaken, until the new education is an accomplished fact and the old and the newtechniques are welded into one appropriate whole. The visionary idealist hashitherto held the field and thus slowed up the process.Second, the new methods can be tried out successfully only through the medium ofmost carefully selected children. These children must be watched from babyhood,their parents must be willing to cooperate in the task of providing right earlyconditions and right atmosphere, and their lives (their case histories) must bestudied along the lines suggested earlier in this instruction.Visionary, mystical hopes and dreams are useful in so far as they indicate apossible goal; they are of small use in determining process and method. Theimposition of the new age ways in education, upon a child who is basicallyAtlantean or early Aryan in his consciousness, is a fruitless task and will dolittle really to help him. It is for this reason that a careful analysis of thechild must be made from the very moment of birth. Then, with as full informationas possible, the educator will endeavour to meet the need of the three majortypes of children: The Atlantean, or basically emotional, sensuous type; theearly Aryan, or emotional-mental type; the later Aryan or early New Age type,which will be predominantly mental, and at the same time idealistic, brilliant,coordinated, and a personality.The question here arises: How can such methods be employed without the wholeprocess appearing too much like a laboratory experiment in which the child isregarded as a specimen—or a sample child—to be subjected to certain types ofimpression in which he is deprived of that free scope to be himself—anindividual (which seems at all times so desirable and necessary)—and in whichthe entire process appears as an infringement of the dignity which is the [74]heritage of every human being? Such educational questions and objectives soundimportant and fine and imposing, but what do they really mean?I have suggested that the textbooks be rewritten in terms of right humanrelations and not from the present nationalistic and separative angles. I havealso pointed out certain basic ideas which should be immediately inculcated: theunique value of the individual, the beauty of humanity, the relation of theindividual to the whole and his responsibility to fit into the general picturein a constructive manner and voluntarily; I have noted the imminence of thecoming spiritual renaissance. To all of these I would like to add that one ofour immediate educational objectives must be the elimination of the competitivespirit and the substitution of the cooperative consciousness. Here the questionat once arises: How can one achieve this and at the same time bring about a highlevel of individual attainment? Is not competition a major spur to allendeavour? This has hitherto been so, but it need not be.Today the average child is, for the first five or six years of his life, thevictim of his parents' ignorance or selfishness or lack of interest. He isfrequently kept quiet and out of the way because his parents are too busy withtheir own affairs to give him the needed time—busy with nonessential matters,compared to the important and essential business of giving their child a rightstart upon the pathway of life in this incarnation. He is left to his ownresources or those of some ignorant nursemaid, at a stage when a destructivelittle animal should be developed into a constructive little citizen. He issometimes petted and often scolded. He is dragged hither and thither, accordingto his parents' whims and interest, and he is sent to school with a sense ofrelief on their part, in order to get him occupied and out of the way. Atschool, he is frequently under the care of some young, ignorant thoughwell-meaning person whose task it is to teach him the rudiments ofcivilisation—a certain superficial [75] attitude and form of manners whichshould govern his relations to the world of men, an ability to read and writeand figure, and a smattering (rudimentary indeed) of history and geography andgood form in speech and writing.By that time however the mischief is done and the form which his latereducational processes may take, from the age of eleven onward, is of smallmoment. An orientation has been effected, an attitude (usually defensive, andtherefore inhibiting) has been established, a form of behaviour has beenenforced or imposed which is superficial, and which is not based upon therealities of right relationships. The true person which is found in everychild—expansive, outgoing and well-meaning as are the bulk of children ininfancy—has consequently been driven within, out of sight, and has hidden itselfbehind an outer shell which custom and tuition have enforced. Add to this amultitude of misunderstandings on the part of loving but superficial andwell-intentioned parents, a long series of small catastrophes in relation toothers, and it is obvious that the majority of children get off to a wrong startand begin life basically handicapped. The damage done to children in the plasticand pliable years is often irremediable and is responsible for much of the painand suffering in later life. What then can be done? What, apart from the moretechnical approaches outlined by me in earlier parts of this instruction, shouldbe the effort on the part of parents and educators?First, and above everything else, the effort should be made to provide anatmosphere wherein certain qualities can flourish and emerge.1. An atmosphere of love, wherein fear is cast out and the child realises he hasno cause for timidity, shyness or caution, and one in which he receivescourteous treatment at the hands of others, and is expected also to renderequally courteous treatment in return. This is rare indeed to find inschoolrooms [76] or in homes for that matter. This atmosphere of love is not anemotional, sentimental form of love but is based upon a realisation of thepotentialities of the child as an individual, on a sense of true responsibility,freedom from prejudice, racial antagonisms, and above everything else, uponcompassionate tenderness. This compassionate tenderness is founded on therecognition of the difficulty of living, upon sensitivity to the child'snormally affectionate response, and upon a knowledge that love always drawsforth what is best in child and man.2. An atmosphere of patience, wherein the child can become, normally andnaturally, a seeker after the light of knowledge; wherein he is sure of alwaysmeeting with a quick response to inquiry and a careful reply to all questions,and wherein there is never the sense of speed or hurry. Most children's naturesare warped by the rush and hurry of those with whom they are perforceassociated. There is no time to instruct them and to reply to their small andmost necessary inquiries, and the time factor therefore becomes a menace toright development, and leads eventually to a life of evasions and of wrongperspectives. Their standard of values becomes distorted by watching those withwhom they live, and much of it is brought to their attention by the impatiencewhich is displayed towards them. This impatience on the part of those upon whomthey are so pathetically dependent, sows in them the seeds of irritation, andmore lives are ruined by irritation than can be counted.3. An atmosphere of ordered activity, wherein the child can learn the firstrudiments of responsibility. The children who are coming into incarnation atthis time, and who can profit by the new type of education, are necessarily onthe very verge of soul consciousness. One of the first indications of such soulcontact is a [77] rapidly developing sense of responsibility. This should becarefully borne in mind. for the shouldering of small duties and the sharing ofresponsibility (which is always concerned with some form of group relation) is apotent factor in determining a child's character and future vocation.4. An atmosphere of understanding, wherein a child is always sure that thereasons and motives for his actions will be recognised, and that those who arehis older associates will always comprehend the nature of his motivatingimpulses, even though they may not always approve of what he has done or of hisactivities. Many of the things which the average child does are not inthemselves naughty or wicked or intentionally bad. They are frequently promptedby a thwarted inquiring spirit, by the desire to retaliate for some injustice(based on the adult's lack of understanding his motivation), by an inability toemploy time rightly (for the directional will is often, at this age, entirelyquiescent and will not become active until the mind is beginning to function),and by the urge to attract attention—a necessary urge in the development ofself-consciousness, but one which needs understanding and most careful guidance.It is the older generation who foster in a child an early and most unnecessarysense of guilt, of sinfulness and of wrongdoing. So much emphasis is laid uponpetty little things that are not really wrong but are annoying to the parent orteacher, that a true sense of wrong (which is the recognition of failure topreserve right relations with the group) gets overlaid and is not recognised forwhat it is. The many small and petty sins, imposed upon children by the constantreiteration of \"No,\" by the use of the word \"naughty.\" and based largely onparental failure to understand and occupy the child, are of no real moment. Ifthese [78] aspects of the child's life are rightly handled, then the truly wrongthings, the infringements upon the rights of others, the encroachments ofindividual desire upon group requirements and conditions, and the hurting ordamaging of others in order to achieve personal gain, will emerge in rightperspective and at the right time. Then the voice of conscience (which is thewhisper of the soul) will not be deadened, and the child will not becomeanti-social. He only becomes anti-social when he has not met with understandingand therefore does not understand or when circumstances demand too much of him.You might inquire here, after considering these four types of atmosphereregarded as essential preliminary steps to the new education: How, in this case,do you make allowance for inherited instinct, normal inclination based upon thepoint in evolution and character tendencies which are determined by ray forcesand astrological influences?I have not emphasised them there, even while recognising them as conditioningfactors which must receive attention, because I have been dealing with theunnecessary and vast accumulation of imposed difficulties which are not innatein the child or truly characteristic of him, but which are the result of hisenvironment and the failure of his home circle and existing educational agenciesrightly to aid him in making his adjustments to life and his period. When thereis wise handling from infancy, when the child is regarded as the most importantconcern of his parents and teachers (because he is the future in embryo), andwhen, at the same time, he is taught a sense of proportion by right integrationinto the little world of which he is a part, we shall see the major lines ofdifficulty, the basic character trends and the gaps in his equipment emergeclearly. They will not be hidden until the years of adolescence by the littlesins and evasions and by the petty embryonic complexes, which have been imposedupon him by others and did not form a part of his innate equipment when he came[79] into incarnation. Then these major difficulties can be handled in anenlightened manner, and those basic tendencies which are undesirable can beoffset through the wisdom of the educator, plus the cooperation andunderstanding of the child. He will understand because he is understood andconsequently fearless.Let us now formulate a more extended plan for the future education of thechildren of the world. We have noted that in spite of universal educationalprocesses and many centres of learning in every country, we have not yetsucceeded in giving our young people the kind of education which will enablethem to live wholly and constructively. The development of world education hasbeen progressively along three main lines, starting in the East and culminatingtoday in the West. Naturally, I am speaking only in terms of the last two orthree thousand years. In Asia, we have had the intensive training, down thecenturies, of certain carefully chosen individuals and a complete neglect of themasses. Asia and Asia alone has produced those outstanding figures who are, eventoday, the object of universal veneration—Lao Tze, Confucius, the Buddha, ShriKrishna and the Christ. They have set Their mark upon millions and still do.Then in Europe, we have had educational attention concentrated upon a fewprivileged groups, giving them a carefully planned cultural training butteaching only the necessary rudiments of learning to the masses. This producedperiodically such important epochs of cultural expression as the Elizabethanperiod, the Renaissance, the poets and writers of the Victorian era and thepoets and musicians of Germany, as well as the clusters of artists whose memoryis perpetuated in the Italian School, the Dutch and the Spanish groups.Finally, in the newer countries of the world, such as the United States,Australia and Canada, mass education was instituted and was largely copiedthroughout the entire civilised world. The general level of cultural attainment[80] became much lower; the level of mass information and competencyconsiderably higher. The question now arises: What will be the next evolutionarydevelopment in the educational world?Let us remember one important thing. What education can do along undesirablelines has been well demonstrated in Germany with its wrecking of idealism, itsinculcation of wrong human relations and attitudes and its glorification of allthat is most selfish, brutal and aggressive. Germany has proved that educationalprocesses when properly organised and supervised, systematically planned andgeared to an ideology, are potent in effect, especially if the child is takenyoung enough and if he is shielded from all contrary teaching for a long enoughtime. Let us remember at the same time that this demonstrated potency can worktwo ways and that what has been wrought out along wrong lines can be equallysuccessful along right ones.We need also to realise that we must do two things: We must place the emphasiseducationally upon those who are under sixteen years of age (and the younger thebetter) and. secondly. that we must begin with what we have, even whilstrecognising the limitations of the present systems. We must strengthen thoseaspects which are good and desirable; we must develop the new attitudes andtechniques which will fit a child for complete living and so make him trulyhuman—a creative, constructive member of the human family. The very best of allthat is past must be preserved but should only be regarded as the foundation fora better system and a wiser approach to the goal of world citizenship.It might be of value at this point to define what education can be, if it isimpulsed by true vision and made responsive to sensed world need and to thedemands of the times.Education is the training, intelligently given, which will enable the youth ofthe world to contact their environment with intelligence and sanity, and adaptthemselves to the [81] existing conditions. This today is of prime importanceand is one of the signposts in a world which has fallen to pieces.Education is a process whereby the child is equipped with the information whichwill enable him to act as a good citizen and perform the functions of a wiseparent. It should take into consideration his inherent tendencies, his racialand national attributes, and then endeavour to add to these that knowledge whichwill lead him to work constructively in his particular world setting and provehimself a useful citizen. The general trend of his education will be morepsychological than in the past and the information thus gained will be geared tohis peculiar situation. All children have certain assets and should be taughthow to use them; these they share with the whole of humanity, irrespective ofrace or nationality. Educators will, therefore, lay emphasis in the future upon:1. A developing mental control of the emotional nature.2. Vision or the capacity to see beyond what is, to what might be.3. Inherited, factual knowledge upon which it will be possible to superimposethe wisdom of the future.4. Capacity wisely to handle relationships and to recognise and assumeresponsibility.5. The power to use the mind in two ways:a. As the \"commonsense\" (using this word in its old connotation), analysing andsynthesising the information conveyed by the five senses.b. As a searchlight, penetrating into the world of ideas and of abstract truth.Knowledge comes from two directions. It is the result of the intelligent use ofthe five senses and it is also developed from the attempt to seize upon andunderstand ideas. Both of these are implemented by curiosity and investigation.[82]Education should be of three kinds and all three are necessary to bring humanityto a needed point of development.It is. first of all, a process of acquiring facts—past and present—and of thenlearning to infer and gather from this mass of information. graduallyaccumulated. that which can be of practical use in any given situation. Thisprocess involves the fundamentals of our present educational systems.It is, secondly, a process of learning wisdom as an outgrowth of knowledge andof grasping understandingly the meaning which lies behind the outer impartedfacts. It is the power to apply knowledge in such a manner that sane living andan understanding point of view, plus an intelligent technique of conduct, arethe natural results. This also involves training for specialised activities.based upon innate tendencies, talents or genius.It is, finally, a process whereby unity or a sense of synthesis is cultivated.Young people in the future will be taught to think of themselves in relation tothe group, to the family unit and to the nation in which their destiny has putthem. They will also be taught to think in terms of world relationship and oftheir nation in relation to other nations. This covers training for citizenship,for parenthood, and for world understanding; it is basically psychological andshould convey an understanding of humanity. When this type of training is given,we shall develop men and women who are both civilised and cultured and who willalso possess the capacity to move forward (as life unfolds) into that world ofmeaning which underlies the world of outer phenomena and who will begin to viewhuman happenings in terms of the deeper spiritual and universal values.Education should be the process whereby youth is taught to reason from cause toeffect, to know the reason why certain actions are bound inevitably to producecertain results and why (given a certain emotional and mental equipment, plus anascertained psychological rating) definite life trends [83] can be determinedand certain professions and life careers provide the right setting fordevelopment and a useful and profitable field of experience. Some attempts alongthis line have been undertaken by certain colleges and schools in an effort toascertain the psychological aptitudes of a boy or a girl for certain vocationsbut the whole effort is still amateurish in nature. When made more scientific itopens the door for training in the sciences; it gives significance and meaningto history, biography and learning and thus avoids the bare impartation of factsand the crude process of memory training which has been distinctive of pastmethods.The new education will consider a child with due reference to his heredity, hissocial position, his national conditioning, his environment and his individualmental and emotional equipment and will seek to throw the entire world of effortopen to him, pointing out that apparent barriers to progress are only spurs torenewed endeavour and thus seeking to \"lead him out\" (the true meaning of theword \"education\") from any limiting condition and train him to think in terms ofconstructive world citizenship. Growth and still more growth will be emphasised.The educator of the future will approach the problem of youth from the angle ofthe instinctual reaction of the children, their intellectual capacity and theirintuitional potentiality. In infancy and in the earlier school grades, thedevelopment of right instinctual reactions will be watched and cultivated; inthe later grades, in what is equivalent to the high schools or the secondaryschools, the intellectual unfoldment and control of the mental processes will beemphasised, whilst in the colleges and universities the unfoldment of theintuition, the importance of ideals and ideas and the development of abstractthinking and perception will be fostered; this latter phase will be soundlybased upon the previous sound intellectual foundation. These threefactors—instinct, intellect and intuition—provide the keynotes for the threescholastic institutions through which every [84] young person will pass andthrough which, today, many thousands do pass.In the future, education will make a far wider use of psychology thanheretofore. A trend in this direction is definitely to be seen. Thenature—physical, vital, emotional and mental—of the boy or girl will becarefully investigated and his incoherent life purposes directed along rightlines; he will be taught to recognise himself as the one who acts, who feels andwho thinks. Thus the responsibility of the central \"I,\" or the occupant of thebody will be taught. This will alter the entire present attitude of the youth ofthe world to their surroundings and foster, from the earliest days, therecognition of a part to be played and a responsibility to be assumed and thateducation is a method of preparation for that useful and interesting future.It, therefore, becomes increasingly apparent that the coming education could bedefined in a new and broader sense as the Science of Right Human Relations andof Social Organisation. This gives a comparatively new purpose to any curriculumimparted and yet indicates that nothing hitherto included need be excluded, onlya better motivation will be obvious and a nationalistic, selfish presentationavoided. If history is, for instance, presented on the basis of the conditioningideas which have led humanity onward and not on the basis of aggressive wars andinternational or national thievery, then education will concern itself with theright perception and use of ideas, of their transformation into working idealsand their application as the will-to-good, the will-to-truth and thewill-to-beauty. Thus a much needed alteration of humanity's aims from ourpresent competitive and materialistic objectives into those that will more fullyexpress the Golden Rule will come about and right relations between individuals,groups, parties, nations and throughout the entire international world will beestablished.Increasingly, education should be concerned with the [85] wholes of life as wellas with the details of daily individual living. The child, as an individual,will be developed and equipped, trained and motivated and taught then hisresponsibilities to the whole and the value of the contribution which he can andmust make to the group.It is perhaps a platitude to say that education should occupy itself necessarilywith the development of the reasoning powers of the child and not primarily—asis now usually the case—with the training of the memory and the parrot-likerecording of facts and dates and uncorrelated and ill-digested items ofinformation. The history of the growth of man's perceptive faculties underdiffering national and racial conditions is of profound interest. Theoutstanding figures of history, literature and art and of religion will surelybe studied from the angle of their effort and their influence for good or evilupon their period; the quality and purpose of their leadership will beconsidered. Thus the child will absorb a vast amount of historical information,of creative activity and of idealism and philosophy not only with the maximum ofease but with permanent effect upon his character.The continuity of effort, the effects upon civilisation of ancient tradition,good and evil happenings and the interplay of varying cultural aspects ofcivilisation will be brought to his attention and the dry-as-dust information,dates and names will fall into the discard. All branches of human knowledgecould, in this way, become alive and reach a new level of constructiveusefulness. There is already a definite tendency in this direction and it isgood and sound. The past of humanity as the foundation for present happeningsand the present as the determining factor for the future, will increasingly berecognised and thus great and needed changes will be brought about in humanpsychology as a whole.The creative aptitude of the human being should also, under the new era, receivefuller attention; the child will be spurred on to individual effort suited tohis temperament [86] and capacity. Thus he will be induced to contribute what hecan of beauty to the world and of right thought to the sumtotal of humanthinking; he will be encouraged to investigate and the world of science willopen up before him. Behind all these applied incentives, the motives of goodwilland right human relations will be found.Finally, education should surely present the hypothesis of the soul in man asthe interior factor which produces the good, the true and the beautiful.Creative expression and humanitarian effort will, therefore, receive a logicalbasis. This will not be done through a theological or doctrinal presentation, asis today the case, but as presenting a problem for investigation and as aneffort to answer the question: What is man; what is his intrinsic purpose in thescheme of things? The livingness of the influence and the proclaimed purposebehind the constant appearance of spiritual, cultural and artistic world leadersdown the ages will be studied and their lives subjected to research, bothhistorical and psychological. This will open up before the youth of the worldthe entire problem of leadership and of motive. Education will, therefore, begiven in the form of human interest, human achievement and human possibility.This will be done in such a manner that the content of the student's mind willnot only be enriched with historical and literary facts but his imagination willbe fired, and his ambition and aspiration evoked along true and right lines; theworld of past human effort will be presented to him in a truer perspective andthe future thrown open to him also in an appeal for his individual effort andpersonal contribution.What I have written above in no way implies an indictment of past methods exceptin so far that the world today itself presents an indictment; it does not eitherconstitute an impractical vision or a mystical hope, based on wishful thinking.It concerns an attitude to life and the future which many thousands of peoplehold today, and among them [87] many, many educators in every country. Theerrors and mistakes of the past techniques are obvious but there is no need towaste time in emphasising them or in piling up instances. What is needed is arealisation of the immediate opportunity, plus the recognition that the requiredshift in objectives and change in methods will take much time. We shall have totrain our teachers differently and much time will be lost as we grope for thenew and better ways, develop the new textbooks and find the men and women whocan be impressed with the new vision and who will work for the new civilisation.I have sought only to emphasise principles and I do this with the recognitionthat many of them are by no means new but that they require new emphasis. I haveendeavoured to show that now is the day of opportunity, for everything has to bebuilt up again, for everything has been destroyed in the greater part of theworld. The war has demonstrated that we have not taught aright. A bettereducational system should, therefore, be worked out which will present thepossibilities of human living in such a manner that barriers will be brokendown, prejudices removed and a training given to the developing child which willenable him, when grownup, to live with other men in harmony and goodwill. Thiscan be done, if patience and understanding are developed and if educatorsrealise that \"where there is no vision, the people perish.\"An international system of education, developed in joint conference bybroadminded teachers and educational authorities in every country, is today acrying need and would provide a major asset in preserving world peace. Stepstowards this are already being taken and today groups of educators are gettingtogether and discussing the formation of a better system which will guaranteethat the children of the different nations (beginning with the millions ofchildren now demanding education) will be taught truth, without bias orprejudice. World democracy will take form when men everywhere are regarded inreality as equal; when boys [88] and girls are taught that it does not matterwhether a man is an Asiatic, an American, a European, British, a Jew or aGentile but only that each has an historical background and history whichenables him to contribute something to the good of the whole, and that the majorrequirement is an attitude of goodwill and a constant effort to foster righthuman relations. World Unity will be a fact when the children of the world aretaught that religious differences are largely a matter of birth; that if a manis born in Italy, the probability is that he will be a Roman Catholic; if he isborn a Jew, he will follow the Jewish teaching; if born in Asia, he may be aMohammedan, a Buddhist, or belong to one of the Hindu sects; if born in othercountries, he may be a Protestant and so on. He will learn that the religiousdifferences are largely the result of man made quarrels over humaninterpretations of truth. Thus gradually, our quarrels and differences will beoffset and the idea of the One Humanity will take their place.Much greater care will have to be given in picking and training the teachers ofthe future. Their mental attainments and their knowledge of their particularsubject will be of importance, but more important still will be the need forthem to be free from prejudice and to see all men as members of a great family.The educator of the future will need to be more of a trained psychologist thanhe is today. Besides imparting academic knowledge, he will realise that hismajor task is to evoke out of his class of students a real sense ofresponsibility; no matter what he has to teach—history, geography, mathematics,languages, science in its various branches or philosophy—he will relate it allto the Science of Right Human Relations and try to give a truer perspective thanin the past upon social organisation.When the young people of the future—under the proposed application ofprinciples—are civilised, cultured and responsive to world citizenship, we shallhave a world of men awakened, creative and possessing a true sense of values[89] and a sound and constructive outlook on world affairs. It will take a longtime to bring this about, but it is not impossible as history itself has proved.It will be only common sense, however, to realise that this integration is notpossible for every student passing through the hands of our teachers. All,however, no matter what their initial capacity, can be trained in the Science ofRight Human Relations and thus respond to the major objective of the comingeducational systems. Indications of this can be seen on every hand but as yetthe emphasis is not laid on it when training teachers or influencing parents.Much, very much, has been done by enlightened groups of men in all lands andthis they have done whilst studying the requirements for citizenship, whilstundertaking research work connected with correct social relations (communal,national and international) and through the many organisations which are tryingto bring to the mass of human beings a sense of responsibility for humanhappiness and human welfare. Nevertheless, the real work along these linesshould be started in infancy so that the consciousness of the child (so easilydirected) can from its earliest days assume an unselfish attitude towards hisassociates. It can be started very simply if the parents so desire; it can becarried forward progressively if parents and teachers demonstrate in their ownlives what they teach. Finally the time will come, under these conditions, whenin late adolescence a crisis, needed and planned, is precipitated in the youngperson's life, and he will then stabilise himself in the particular manner inwhich destiny ordains that he shall fulfil his task of right relationshipthrough the means of vocational service.It is bridging work which has now to be done—bridging between what is today andwhat can be in the future. If, during the next 150 years, we develop thistechnique of bridging the many cleavages found in the human family and inoffsetting the racial hatreds and the separative attitudes of nations andpeople, we shall have succeeded in implementing [90] a world in which war willbe impossible and humanity will be realising itself as one human family and notas a fighting aggregate of many nations and people, competitively engaged ingetting the best of each other and successfully fostering prejudices and hatred.This has, as we have seen, been the history of the past. Man has been developedfrom an isolated animal, prompted only by the instincts of self -preservation,eating, and mating, through the stages of family life, tribal life and nationallife to the point where today a still broader ideal is grasped byhim—international unity or the smooth functioning of the One Humanity. Thisgrowing idealism is fighting its way into the forefront of the humanconsciousness in spite of all separative enmities. It is largely responsible forthe present chaos and for the banding together of the United Nations. It hasproduced the conflicting ideologies which are seeking world expression; it hasproduced the dramatic emergence of national saviours (so-called), world prophetsand world workers, idealists, opportunists, dictators, investigators andhumanitarians. These conflicting idealisms are a wholesome sign, whether weagree with them or not. They are definitely exploiting the human demand—urgentand right—for better conditions, for more light and understanding, for greatercooperation, for security and peace and plenty in the place of terror, fear andstarvation.It is difficult for modern man to conceive of a time when there will be noracial, national or separative religious consciousness present in humanthinking. It was equally difficult for prehistoric man to conceive of a timewhen there would be national thinking and this is a good thing for us to bear inmind. The time when humanity will be able to think in universal terms still liesfar ahead but the fact that we can speak of it, desire it and plan for it issurely the guarantee that it is not impossible. Humanity has always progressedfrom stage to stage of enlightenment and from glory to glory. We are today onour way to a far better civilisation [91] than the world has ever known andtowards conditions which will ensure a much happier humanity and which will seethe end of national differences, of class distinctions (whether based on anhereditary or a financial status) and which will ensure a fuller and richer lifefor everyone.It will be obvious that very many decades must elapse before such a state ofaffairs will be actively present—but it will be decades and not centuries, ifhumanity can learn the lessons of war and if the reactionary and theconservative peoples in every nation can be prevented from swinging civilisationback on to the bad old lines. But a beginning can immediately be made.Simplicity should be our watchword for it is simplicity which will kill our oldmaterialistic way of living. Cooperative goodwill is surely the first idea to bepresented to the masses and taught in our schools, thereby guaranteeing the newand better civilisation. Loving understanding, intelligently applied, should bethe hallmark of the cultured and wiser groups, plus effort on their part torelate the world of meaning to the world of outer efforts —for the benefit ofthe masses. World Citizenship as an expression of both goodwill andunderstanding should be the goal of the enlightened everywhere and the hallmarkof the spiritual man, and in these three, you have right relations establishedbetween education, religion and politics.All the work being done now is definitely transitional work and therefore mostdifficult. It infers a bridging process between the old and the new, and wouldpresent almost insuperable difficulties were it not for the fact that the comingtwo generations will bring in those types of egos who are competent to deal withthe problem. Upon this fact those of you who are concerned with the educationalsystem and situation, and who are bewildered by the presented vision and by thetask of approximating the cherished possibilities, must rest back withconfidence. Clear thinking, much love and a sense of true compromise (note thisphrase) will do much to lay the needed foundations and keep the door of the [92]future wide open. A balancing process is going forward in this interim period,and to it the modern educator should pay due attention.I can perhaps indicate the nature of this process. I have stated here andelsewhere that the soul anchors itself in the body at two points:1. There is a thread of energy, which we call the life or spirit aspect,anchored in the heart. It uses the blood stream, as is well known, as itsdistributing agency and, through the medium of the blood, life-energy carriesregenerating power and coordinating energy to all the physical organisms andkeeps the body \"whole.\"2. There is a thread of energy, which we call the consciousness aspect or thefaculty of soul knowledge, anchored in the centre of the head. It controls thatresponse mechanism which we call the brain, and through its medium it directsactivity and induces awareness throughout the body by means of the nervoussystem.These two energy factors, which are recognised by human beings as life andknowledge, or as living energy and intelligence, are the two poles of a child'sbeing. The task ahead of him is to develop consciously the middle or balancingaspect which is love or group relationship, in order that knowledge should besubordinated to the group need and interests, and that living energy should beturned consciously and with intention into the group whole. In doing this a truebalance will be achieved and it will be brought about by the recognition thatthe Way of Service is a scientific technique for the achieving of this balance.Educators therefore have three things to bear in mind during this present periodof transition: [93]1. To reorient the knowledge, the consciousness aspect or the sense of awarenessin the child in such a manner that he realises from infancy that all that he hasbeen taught or is being taught is with the view to the good of others more thanof himself. He will therefore be trained to be definitely forward looking.Information as to the past history of the race will be given to him from theangle of the racial growth in consciousness and not so much from the angle ofthe facts of material or aggressive achievement as is now the case. As the past,in the child's mind, is correlated with the present, his capacity to correlate,unify and bridge, in the different aspects of his life and on various planes,will be developed.2. To teach him that the life which he feels pulsing through his veins is onlyone small part of the total life pulsing throughout all forms, all kingdoms innature, all planets, and the solar system. He will learn that he shares it withall that exists, and that therefore a true \"blood Brotherhood\" is everywhere tobe found. Consequently, from the very start of his life, he can be taughtrelationship, and this the small child will be apt to recognise more quicklythan will the average adult, trained in the ways and attitudes of the old age.When these two realisations—responsibility and relationship—are inculcated inthe child from infancy, then the third objective of the new education will comewith greater ease.3. The unification in consciousness of the life impulse and the urge toknowledge will lead eventually to a planned activity. This planned activity willconstitute service, and this, in its turn, will do three things for the childwho is taught to practice it:a. It will serve as a directional agency from the earliest years, finallyindicating vocation and avocation and thus aiding in the choice of a lifecareer. [94]b. It will draw out the best that is in the child and will make him a magneticradiating centre in the place where he is. It will enable him to attract tohimself those who can help him or be helped by him, those who can serve him andwhom he best can serve.c. It will therefore make him definitely creative, and so enable him to spinthat thread of energy which, when added to the life thread and to theconsciousness thread, will link head, heart and throat into one unified andfunctioning agency.The meeting of the three aforesaid requirements will be the primary step (madeon a racial scale) to the building of the antahkarana or the bridge between:1. Various aspects of the form nature.2. The personality and the soul.3. The man and other human beings.4. The man as a member of the human family, and his environing world.You will note from this that education should be basically concerned withrelations and interrelations, with the bridging or the healing of cleavages, andthus with the restoration of unity or synthesis. The establishment of theScience of Right Relations is the next immediate step in the mental unfoldmentof the race. It is the major activity of the new education.THE AQUARIAN AGEAs a result of the bridging work which will be done in the immediate one hundredand fifty years ahead of us, the technique of bridging the various cleavagesfound in the human family, and of weaving into one strong cable the variousthreads of energy which tenuously, as yet, connect the various aspects of theinner man with the outer form, will have made [95] so much progress that thebulk of the intelligent people in the world and of all classes and nations willbe integrated personalities. When this is the case, the science of theantahkarana will be a planned part of their training. Today, as we study thisscience and its related sciences of meditation and service, the appeal will beonly to the world aspirants and disciples. Its usefulness will only be found atpresent to be for those special incarnating souls who are today coming intoincarnation with such rapidity as a response to the world's need for help. Butlater the appeal will be general and its usefulness more nearly universal.It is needless for me to outline for you the nature of the educational systemsof the Aquarian Age because they would prove most unsuitable at this time. Imention them as it is necessary to remember that the work done during the nexttwo centuries in the field of education is definitely temporary and balancing,and that out of the fulfillment of the task assigned to education will growthose more permanent systems which, in the new age, will be found flourishingeverywhere.Three major sciences will eventually dominate the field of education in the newage. They will not negate the activities of modern science but will integratethem into a wider subjective whole. These three sciences are:1. The Science of the Antahkarana. This is the new and true science of the mind,which will utilise mental substance for the building of the bridge betweenpersonality and soul, and then between the soul and the spiritual triad. Thisconstitutes active work in substance subtler than the substance of the threeworlds of ordinary human evolution. It concerns the substance of the threehigher levels of the mental plane. These symbolic bridges, when constructed,will facilitate the stream or flow of consciousness and will produce thatcontinuity of consciousness, or that sense of unimpeded awareness, which willfinally end the fear of death, [96] negate all sense of separateness, and make aman responsive in his brain consciousness to impressions coming to him from thehigher spiritual realms or from the Mind of God. Thus he will more easily beinitiated into the purposes and plans of the Creator.2. The Science of Meditation. At present meditation is associated in the mindsof men with religious matters. But that relates only to theme. The science canbe applied to every possible life process. In reality, this science is asubsidiary branch, preparatory to the Science of the Antahkarana. It is reallythe true science of occult bridge building or bridging in consciousness. By itsmeans, particularly in the early stages, the building process is facilitated. Itis one of the major ways of spiritual functioning; it is one of the many ways toGod; it relates the individual mind eventually to the higher mind and later tothe Universal Mind. It is one of the major building techniques and willeventually dominate the new educational methods in schools and colleges. It isintended primarily to:a. Produce sensitivity to the higher impressions.b. Build the first half of the antahkarana, that between the personality and thesoul.c. Produce an eventual continuity of consciousness. Meditation is essentiallythe science of light, because it works in the substance of light. One branch ofit is concerned with the science of visualisation because, as the lightcontinues to bring revelation, the power to visualise can grow with the aid ofthe illumined mind, and the later work of training the disciple to create isthen made possible. It might be added here that the building of the second halfof the antahkarana (that which bridges the gap in consciousness between the souland the spiritual triad) is called the science of vision, because [97] just asthe first half of the bridge is built through the use of mental substance, sothe second half is built through the use of light substance.3. The Science of Service grows normally and naturally out of the successfulapplication of the other two sciences. As the linking up of soul and personalityproceeds, and as the knowledge of the plan and the light of the soul pour intothe brain consciousness, the normal result is the subordination of the lower tothe higher. Identification with group purposes and plans is the naturalattribute of the soul. As this identification is carried forward on mental andsoul levels, it produces a corresponding activity in the personal life and thisactivity we call service. Service is the true science of creation and is ascientific method of establishing continuity.These three sciences will be regarded eventually as the three major concerns ofthe educational process and upon them will the emphasis increasingly be placed.We have now laid the ground for a consideration of the three sciences which willdominate the thought of educators in the coming age. The building and thedevelopment of the antahkarana, the development of the power to control life andto work white magic through the science of meditation, and also the science ofservice whereby group control and group relationship are fostered anddeveloped—these are the three fundamental sciences which will guide thepsychologist and the educator of the future. These will also cause a radicalchange in the attitude of parents towards their children and in the methodswhich they employ to train and teach them when they are very young and in theformative years of their consciousness.It should here be remembered that these parents themselves will have beenbrought up under this new and different regime and will themselves have beendeveloped [98] under this changed mode of approaching the educational process.What may therefore seem to you mystical and vague (because of its newness, orits idealism and its emphasis upon a seeming abstract group consciousness), willseem to them normal and natural. What I am here outlining to you is apossibility which lies ahead for the next two or three generations; I am alsoreferring to a recognition which a new educational ideology will normally permitto govern the mode of instruction."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IV - THE CULTURE OF THE INDIVIDUAL[99] The culture of the individual will be approached from three angles, eachcontributing to the completed whole which is to make the individual: anintelligent citizen of two worlds (the world of objective existence and theinner world of meaning), a wise parent, a controlled and directed personality.We shall now proceed to take up these points.I have not elaborated the teaching of the Aquarian Age nor dealt at all with theeducational systems of that time. It is of no service to you to do so, and I amunable to really aid your thought if I jump you forward two hundred years into acivilisation and a culture of which, as yet, only the faintest indications canbe seen. It is of more value if I lay the emphasis upon the emerging ideas whichwill govern future procedure in the next generation and carry the world throughthe most difficult transitional period which it has ever seen.Certain basic ideals, emerging out of the current ideologies, are beginning tomake their impact upon public consciousness. These ideals in themselves areessentially human reactions to divine ideas; they are consequently not entirelyfree from error and are necessarily coloured by the calibre of the minds whichare formulating them; they are inevitably conditioned by past history, bynational tradition and by racial trends of thought. There is, nevertheless, acurious uniformity about them, even when expressed by the followers [100] ofwidely diverging world idealism. If we are properly to understand these ideasand are to lay a right foundation, it would be of value perhaps if we discussedsome of these universal attitudes and considered what they indicate in the lightof the present world problems, and the indications of the coming world which wecan draw therefrom.THE ANGLE OF CITIZENSHIPThere is a growing feeling amongst the citizens of most nations that the majortask of the educational systems is to fit the child for citizenship. By thatthey mean that it is the task of the State and of the taxpayers so to train thechild that he may be a cooperative, intelligent part of that organised wholewhich we call a nation; that he may be so disciplined that he can take his partin and make his contribution to the State and thus can be of social value yetplay a distinct individual part, and at the same time a group-directed part, inthe life of the community wherein he has been born and in which he mustnecessarily sustain himself; that his individual life and interests count lessthan the corporate life, and that the preliminary lesson he must be taught isthe fact that he is a unit in a functioning group of similar units, each of whomis expected to contribute his quota of good to the whole.The initial germ of this idea (amazing as it may seem) started when the firstschool was organised, thousands of years ago. These schools were very small atfirst, educating only a favoured few, but leading up gradually (usually viareligious organisations) to that mass education and compulsory tuition whichdistinguishes the modern State schools, whose task it noticeably is to preparemillions of young people in the world for intelligent, but directed,citizenship.Today, among the so-called enlightened nations, some kind of compulsoryeducation is imposed upon the masses; the children of all nations are taughtreading, writing and [101] the rudiments of arithmetic. They are supposedthereby to have a general idea of world conditions taught—geographically,historically and economically—and are supposed thereby to achieve somerecognition, objectively and naturally, of the processes and reasons why thevarious nations have come to be what they are and where they are, and so to havegained a consciousness of a general planetary picture. The changing outlines ofthis picture are today producing mental flexibility in children, and this is, inmany ways, a definite asset.In producing citizens, however, the emphasis up till this time has been twofold.The aim of education has been so to equip the child that when he reached yearsof maturity he could take care of himself in the predatory world of modern life,earn a livelihood and become if possible rich and independent of those with whomhis life was cast. In all this tuitional process the emphasis was laid uponhimself as an individual, and the point of interest was upon what he was goingto do, how he was going to live, and what he could get, make and achieve out oflife.In those conditions where the school bias was religious (as in Church schools ofany kind), he was taught that he must endeavour to be good, and the selfishincentive was held before him that if he could do this he might some day go toHeaven and have a happy time. When these ideas had been instilled into him, whenhe had been forced by organisational pressure into the desired pattern andmould. when he had absorbed the needed amount of sketchy information abouthumanity and human achievements, and when his capacity to remember facts(historical, scientific, religious and other) had been developed, even thoughhis power to think remained entirely undeveloped, he was turned loose upon theworld and his ordained community to make good and to establish himself.The above is, I realise, a broad generalisation. It leaves out of reckoningaltogether the innate and inherent capacities [102] of the child, his achievedpoint of soul development, and any recognition of the powers with which heenters into life as a result of many previous life experiences. It leaves outalso the influence of the many conscientious, spiritually-minded and highlyevolved teachers who have—down the ages—set their mark upon the young peoplethey have taught and thus oriented them and led them forward to better things. Iam dealing solely with the institutional aspect of the educational systems andwith the proven effect upon the young of every nation who have been subjected tothese systems. The realised goals which the institutional teacher has set beforehimself have been narrow, and the consequent effect of his teaching and of hiswork has been the production of a selfish, materialistically-minded person whosemajor objective has been self-betterment in a material sense. This has beenstrikingly aided where any individual ambition has been present which would leadthe child to operate willingly with the narrow selfish goal of the teacher. Thenatural idealism of the child (and what child is not an innate idealist?) hasbeen slowly and steadily suffocated by the weight of the materialism of theworld's educational machine and by the selfish bias of the world's business inits many departments, plus the emphasis always laid upon the necessity of makingmoney.Little by little this disastrous state of affairs (which reached its climax inthe early years of this century) has been slowly changing, so that today in manycountries the welfare of the State itself, the good of the Empire, the need ofthe Nation is held before the child from its earliest years as the highestpossible ideal. He is taught that he must serve the State, Empire or Nation withthe very best that is in him; it is strongly inculcated into his consciousnessthat his individual life must be subordinated to the greater life of the Stateor Nation, and that it is his duty to meet the national need, even at theexpense of life itself. He is taught [103] that in times of great emergency he,as an individual, does not count at all, but that the larger corporate whole, ofwhich he is an infinitesimal part, is the sole factor that matters. This is adefinite step forward in the expansion of consciousness which the human racemust achieve.I would here remind you that it is the expansion of consciousness and theproduction of increased sensitivity and perceptive awareness which is the goalof all divine and hierarchical effort. The goal is not for betterment ofmaterial conditions. These will automatically follow when the sense of awarenessis steadily unfolded. The future of humanity is determined by its aspiration andability to respond to the idealism which is today flooding the world.At this time also a still further step is taking place. Everywhere and in everycountry men are being taught in their earliest years that they are not onlyindividuals, not only members of a state, empire or nation, and not only peoplewith an individual future, but that they are intended to be exponents of certaingreat group ideologies—Democratic, Totalitarian, or Communistic. Theseideologies are, in the last analysis, materialising dreams or visions. Forthese, modern youth is taught that he must work and strive and, if necessary,fight. It is therefore surely apparent that behind all the surface turmoil andchaos so devastatingly present today in the consciousness of humanity, andbehind all the fear and apprehension, the hate and separativeness, human beingsare beginning to blend in themselves three states of consciousness—that of theindividual, of the citizen, and of the idealist. The power to achieve this, andto be all these states simultaneously, is now reaching down into those levels ofhuman life which we call \"submerged classes.\"All this is very good and part of the ordained plan. Whether it is thedemocratic ideal, or the vision of the totalitarian state, or the dream of thecommunistic devotee, the [104] effect upon the consciousness of humanity as awhole is definitely good. His sense of world awareness is definitely growing,his power to regard himself as part of a whole is rapidly developing and allthis is desirable and right and contained within the divine plan.It is of course entirely true that the process is spoiled and handicapped bymethods and motives that are highly undesirable, but human beings have a habitof spoiling that which is beautiful; they have a highly developed capacity ofbeing selfish and material, and because the minds of men are as yet practicallyuntrained and undeveloped, they have little power of discrimination and smallability to differentiate between the old and the new, or between the right andthe more right. Having been trained in selfishness and in material attitudeswhile under parental control and in the educational systems of the day, theirtrend of thought normally runs along these undesirable lines.In the Piscean Age which is passing, the youth in every country has been broughtup under the influence of three foundational ideas. The result of these ideasmight be expressed under the terms of the following questions:1. What shall be my vocation in order that I may have as much of the materialworld as my state in life and my wants permit?2. Who are the people who are above me, to whom I must look and whom I musthonor, and who are those below me in the social order and how far am I able tomount in the social scale and so better myself?3. From childhood I have been taught that my natural inclination is to do wrong,to be naughty, or (if the setting is narrowly orthodox) that I am a miserablesinner and unfit for future happiness. How can I escape the penalties of mynatural predilections? [105]The result of all this is to breed in the race a deep-seated sense of materialand social ambition and also an inferiority complex which necessarily breaks outinto some form of revolt in the individual, in racial explosions or, againspeaking individually, in a rabidly self-centered attitude to life. From thesedistorted tendencies and retrogressive ideals the race must eventually emerge.It is the realisation of this which has produced in some nations theoveremphasis on the national or racial good and on the State as an entity. Ithas led to the undermining of the hierarchical structure of the social order.This hierarchical structure is a basic and eternal reality, but the concept hasbeen so distorted and so misused that it has evoked a revolt in humanity and hasproduced an almost abnormal reaction to a freedom and a license which areassuming undesirable dimensions.The widespread demand of the youth of the world today (in some countries) for agood time, their irresponsibility and their refusal to face the real values oflife, are all indicative of this. This is to be seen at its worst in thedemocratic countries. In the totalitarian states it is not permitted on the samescale, as the youth in those states are forced to shoulder responsibility and todedicate themselves to the larger whole, and not to a life of material vocationand the wasting of their years in what I believe you slangfully call \"a goodtime.\" This good time is usually had at the expense of others, and takes placein the formative years which inevitably condition and determine the youngperson's future.I am not here speaking politically or in defense of any governmental system. Aforced activity and then a forced responsibility, relegate the bulk of those soconditioned to the nursery stage or the child state, and humanity should bereaching maturity, with its willingness to shoulder responsibility and itsgrowing sense of the real values of the standards of life. The sense ofresponsibility is one of the first indications that the soul of the individualis awakened. [106] The soul of humanity is also at this time awakening en masse,and hence the following indications:1. The growth of societies, organisations and mass movements for the bettermentof humanity everywhere.2. The growing interest of the mass of the people in the common welfare.Hitherto the upper layer of society has been interested, either for selfish,self-protective reasons or because of innate paternalism. The intelligentsia andthe professional classes have investigated and studied the public welfare fromthe angle of mental and scientific interest, based upon a general materialbasis, and the lower middle class has naturally been involved in the sameinterest, from the point of view of financial and trade returns. Today thisinterest has reached down to the depths of the social order and all classes arekeenly alive and alert to the general, national, racial or international good.This is very well and a hopeful sign.3. Humanitarian and philanthropic effort is at its height, alongside of thecruelties, hatreds and abnormalities which separativeness, overstressed nationalideologies, aggressiveness and ambition have engendered in the life of allnations.4. Education is rapidly becoming mass effort and the children of all nationsfrom the highest to the lowest are being intellectually equipped as neverbefore. The effort is, of course, largely to enable them to meet material andnational conditions, to be of use to the State and no economic drag upon it. Thegeneral result is, however, in line with the divine plan and undoubtedly good.5. The growing recognition by those in authority that the man in the street isbecoming a factor in world affairs. He is reached on all sides by the press andthe radio, and is today intelligent enough and interested [107] enough to bemaking the attempt to form his own opinions and come to his own conclusions.This is embryonic as yet, but the indications of his effort are undoubtedlythere; hence the press and radio control which is found in all countries in someform or another, for there can never be any permanent evasion of thehierarchical structure which underlies our planetary life. This control fallsinto two major categories:Financial control, as in the United States.Government control, as in Europe and Great Britain.The people are told just what is good for them; reservations and secretdiplomacy colour the relation of the government to the masses, and thehelplessness of the man in the street (in the face of authorities in the realmof politics, conditioning decisions such as war or peace, and theologicalimpositions, as well as economic attitudes) is still pitiful, though not sogreat and so drastic as it was. The soul of humanity is awakening and thepresent situations may be regarded as temporary.The purpose of the coming educational systems will be to preserve individualintegrity, promote the sense of individual responsibility, encourage adeveloping group consciousness of basic individual, national and worldrelationships, meanwhile extroverting and organising capacity, interest andability. At the same time there will be an effort to intensify the sense ofcitizenship, both in the tangible outer world of the physical plane and in theKingdom of God and of soul relationships.In order to bring this about, and thus completely change the present worldattitudes and wrong emphases, the drastic and catastrophic present planetarysituation has been permitted.THE WORLD SITUATION AND IDEOLOGIES[108] Before we take up the more technical side of our work, I would have youfor a moment reflect upon the world situation and the world ideologies from theangle of education. I would have you consider it deeply from the point of viewof the existing fundamental group relations, envisaging the necessity to preparethe youth of the future for the coming age—outlines of which can only now dimlybe seen. I would like you to achieve if possible a general idea of the presentworld situation, dealing only with the broad and general outlines and omittingany study of detail or of specific personalities, except by way of illustration.In my other writings I have laid a foundation for this when I brieflyendeavoured to consider the psychological problem of the various nations, itscause or causes, and the peculiar contribution which each specific nation has tomake to the world whole.We will try to recognise certain outstanding facts, though these facts may bemore usually considered facts by esotericists than by the world in general. Butwe are working, or endeavouring to work, as esotericists. These facts are:1. The fact that there are certain basic ideas which have come forth down theages and have brought humanity to its present evolutionary point. Ideas are thesubstance of the evolutionary urge.2. The fact that there is a hidden control which has persisted down the ages andwhich can be deduced from the definitely emerging plan, as far as theconsciousness of man is concerned.3. The fact that all growth is through experiment, struggle andpersistence—hence the present modern upheaval. It is significant of a \"pushingthrough\" to the light, the light of the world, as well as the group antahkarana.[109]It is obvious that a good deal of what I may give in these instructions may notprove of immediate application, but students are asked to ponder and to thinkalong the lines which I may point out, for only as a nucleus of thinkers is thusformed who are responsive to the new educational ideas, does it become possiblefor the spiritual Hierarchy of Masters to achieve the intended results in Theirwork to bring into being the plans of God. The Masters can not and do not workwithout Their chosen physical plane focal points. I would ask you again toregard yourselves as outposts of the consciousness of Those Who, upon the innerside of life, are seeking to bring in new light upon the subject of socialorganisations, the relationship of the individual to the whole, and the new anddesirable trends in education. I would ask you to submit yourselves to thoughttraining with this in view. Note the manner in which I have worded this request:first, regard; then, train. First, faith as to contact; then the steps taken tofacilitate and develop that contact.Our theme is the study of the educational organisation of humanity, involving asit does (in its later stages) responsibility and right action. We shallconsider, on broad lines, the development of man from an isolated personal unit,through the stages of family life, tribal life, national life, to the presentstage of aspirational idealistic humanity. This idealism and this prevalentenquiry are responsible for the present world chaos; they have produced theconflicting ideologies, and the dramatic emergence of the national saviours,world prophets and workers, idealists, opportunists, dictators and investigatorson all sides, in every department of human thought and in every land. Thisidealism is a good sign. It is also responsible for the seething unrest and theurgent demand for better conditions, more light and understanding, deepenedcooperation, for a security based on right adjustments, and for peace and plentyin the place of fear, terror and starvation. [110]It is not my intention to handle this subject from the angle of the many moderntextbooks on government, on law, or on the many schemes (economic, political,etc.) which are today so dominantly engrossing attention. I do not intend to gointo details or definitions. The exponents of the differing creeds can providethe needed literature and present their case far more successfully than I can.The protagonists of an ideology can express their beliefs and objectives morefervently and hopefully than is possible to me. I shall write for you as one whosees the pattern emerging more clearly than you, because I can see it both fromthe inside and the outside, and also from the blueprints in the custody of theHierarchy. I shall write as one who has, in conference with workers in theHierarchy, sought to comprehend the objectives and to cooperate with theimmediate plans in this time of planetary crisis and upheaval, of drasticchanges, and of the stepping up of humanity to new levels of living and higherstates of consciousness; as one who has studied somewhat deeply into the recordsof the past and into the modes of meditation, and has achieved thereby a measureof inclusiveness of past, present and future which is naturally not possible foryou at this time.Some of the plans and ideas controlling hierarchical action I will seek to laybefore you, leaving them to ferment in your minds, thus bringing to you eitherrejection or conviction. I but seek to suggest. It is for you to make deduction,to draw intelligent inferences, and to think along the lines indicated. I seekto have you steep yourselves in this line of thought so that my work with yourminds may be facilitated and the group building of the needed bridges of lightmay go on apace. Forget not that I, too, have to make an effort to render mythought and ideas intelligible to you, and this can only be possible if Idemonstrate wisdom and you demonstrate intelligence and perseverance. Where the[111] teacher is wise and the pupil intelligent, much then becomes possible.I would ask that your attitude should also be (for a time at least)non-critical; that you discard temporarily your preconceived ideas; that youcultivate a willingness to consider and to weigh, not evidence this time, but aninner structure of esoteric happening of more import than the outer events, andthus grasp somewhat of the purpose of the new education. Ponder on this lastphrase and deeply consider my meaning. I would have you achieve a verticalposition, with a horizontal outlook. Ponder too on this phrase.As we study the way of man as he gropes his way out of the animal condition tohis present increasingly intellectual attitude, and as he presses forward into afuture of widest possibility and opportunity, let us always remember that to theCustodians of God's Plan and to Those Who are working out the new developments,the form side of life, the outer tangible expression, is of entirely secondaryimportance. Your vision is oft distorted by the pain and suffering to which theform is subjected (either your own or that of others, individually or en masse),so that you do not see clearly the purpose and the urgency of the life withinthe form. To many of you, for instance, the World War was a supreme disaster, anagony to be averted in the future at any cost, a dire and dreadful happeningindicative of the wickedness of man and the incredible blind indifference ofGod. To us, on the inner side, the World War was in the nature of a majorsurgical operation made in an effort to save the patient's life. A violentstreptococcic germ and infection had menaced the life of humanity (speaking insymbols) and an operation was made in order to prolong opportunity and savelife, not to save the form. This operation was largely successful. The germ, tobe sure, is not eradicated and makes its presence felt in infected areas in thebody of humanity. [112]Another surgical operation may be necessary, not in order to destroy and end thepresent civilisation, but in order to dissipate the infection and get rid of thefever. It may not, however, be needed, for a process of dissipation,distribution and absorption has been going on and may prove effective. Let uswork towards that end. But at the same time, let us never forget that it is theLife, its purpose and its directed intentional destiny that is of importance;and also that when a form proves inadequate, or too diseased, or too crippledfor the expression of that purpose, it is—from the point of view of theHierarchy—no disaster when that form has to go. Death is not a disaster to befeared; the work of the Destroyer is not really cruel or undesirable. I say thisto you who am myself upon the Ray of Love and know its meaning.There are two lines of destruction: that which is meted out by human beings withno understanding of the life purposes, who act blindly and ignorantly, promptedby selfish desire, by love of power or by hatred; there is also that which ispermitted by the soul in due and right time, and it comes when a new vehicle ofexpression is demanded by the indwelling life. Therefore, there is muchdestruction permitted by the Custodians of the Plan and much evil turned intogood, because the end is seen from the beginning, and the consciousness is ripeenough in experience to relinquish the form because of the sensed benefits to begained. This is true of individuals, of nations and of races. Sensitivity toworld suffering is a great and divine characteristic; when, however, it isqualified by emotion, it becomes separative in interpretation and focussed inpartisanship and personalities, and thus develops into a glamour and anillusion, confusing the real issue and blinding men to the divine facts.I would remind you that the esotericist always argues from universals toparticulars. This I shall always do, and thus offset the detailed point of view,the distorted foreground [113] and the myopic vision of the student. We willstudy the major trends, the wide sweep of the emerging human consciousness,demanding—as it ceaselessly does—a change in education, religion and socialorganisation commensurate with its unfoldment. Civilisations, cultures, racesand nations appear and disappear, but the same individualities come and go withthem, garnering the fruits of experience, and progressively marching on tofuller Self-government and group organisation and synthesis.I would remind you also that there is a peculiar quality in every human being—aninnate, inherent characteristic which is inevitably present—to which one mightgive the name of \"mystical perception.\" I use this term in a far wider sensethan is usually the case, and would have you regard this quality of mysticalperception as inclusive of:1. The mystical vision of the soul, of God and the universe.2. The power to contact and appreciate the world of meaning, the subjectiveworld of the emerging reality.3. The power to love and to go out to that which is other than the self.4. The capacity to grasp and to intuit ideas.5. The ability to sense the unknown, the desirable and the desired. Theconsequent determination and persistence which enable man to seek, search forand demand that unknown reality. It is the mystical tendency which has producedthe great mystics of world renown, the large number of explorers, discoverersand inventors.6. The power to sense, register and record the good, the beautiful and the true.It is this that has produced the writer, the poet, the artist and the architect.7. The urge to discover and to penetrate to the secrets of God and of nature. Itis this which produced the scientist, and the religious man. [114]From a study of these definitions you will see how inclusive the term \"mysticalperception\" is. It is no more and no less than the power, innate in man, toreach out and to grasp that which is greater and better than himself, and whichhas driven him on, through progressively developing cultures and civilisations,until today he stands on the verge of a new kingdom in nature. It is the powerto appreciate and to strive after the apparently unattainable good. Let thisbroad and general thesis therefore be in your minds as we study man's developingpower of self-expression, self-determination and self-government.What are the basic ideas (beginning with the recognised instincts) which haveled man, step by step, to his present struggle for world betterment, groupevaluation and natural self-determination, with a view—unconscious for the mostpart— of providing a better organ of expression within the living organism,humanity?I dealt with this elsewhere when discussing the present Ray Plan for humanity inthe field of politics, of religion and of education, and I should like to repeatpart of what is there said for it has a direct bearing on our theme:\"In the final analysis, the main problem of world government is the wise use ofideas. It is here that the power of speech makes itself felt, just as in thedepartment of religion or of education the power of the written word, of theprinted page, is felt. In the field of politics, the masses are swayed by theirorators, and never more so than now through the use of the radio. Great ideasare dinned into the ear of the public without cessation—theories as todictatorship, communism, Nazism, fascism, marxism, nationalism and democraticideals. Methods of rule by this or that group of thinkers are presented to thepublic, leaving them no time for consideration, or for clear thinking. Racialantipathies are spread, and personal preferences and illusions find expression,bringing about the deception of the unthinking. [115] The man who has a goldentongue, the man who has the gift of playing with words and can voice withemphasis people's grievances, the juggler in statistics, the fanatic with acertain and sure cure for social ills and the man who loves to fan race hatreds,can ever get a following. Such men can with facility upset the balance of thecommunity and lead a body of unthinking adherents to a transient success andpower, or to obloquy and oblivion.\"In the aggregate of this play with ideas, and in the constant impact upon thehuman consciousness of the great concepts which lie back of our evolutionaryprocess, the race is developing the power to think, to choose, and to build asure foundation. Through the evolutionary presentation of these ideas there is asteady march towards a liberty of thought (through the old method of experiment,of discard, and of renewed effort with ever newer concepts) which will enablemankind to build true to the great thought patterns which underlie the outerstructure of our world. The attentive minds of the age are constantly being madesensitive to these patterns, so that the individual mind can recognise them andwrest them out of the darkness into the light of day. Thus will the truepatterns be made available, to play their part in leading the race towards itsdestiny, towards those deeper realisations which mould the racial types, and tothat synthesis of understanding which will result in a realisation ofBrotherhood. Thus thoughts play their part, and the problem of ideas will beincreasingly understood, until the time may come when we shall have our trainedintuitives and thinkers who will be able to work directly in the world ofconcepts and bring through (for the use of the race) the pattern ideas uponwhich to build. In saying this I realise that I may be accused of romancing andof communicating the impossible; but time will demonstrate the truth of thatwhich I predict. The world structure emerges from and is built upon certaininner thought patterns, and it is these thought patterns which are producing[116] the present flood of governmental experiments among all nations. But todaythere is no training given upon the process of contacting the world of patternsand upon the true interpretation of ideas, and hence the problems. Later, whenthe race sees its problem with clarity, it will act with wisdom and train withcare its Observers and Communicators. These will be men and women in whom theintuition has awakened at the behest of an urgent intellect; they will be peoplewhose minds are so subordinated to the group good, and so free from all sense ofseparativeness, that their minds present no impediment to the contact with theworld of reality and of inner truth. They will not necessarily be people whocould be termed 'religious' in the ordinary sense of that word, but they will bemen of goodwill, of high mental calibre, with minds well stocked and equipped;they will be free from personal ambition and selfishness, animated by love ofhumanity and by a desire to help the race. Such a man is a spiritual man.\"A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol. I, p. 179-181.REASONS FOR THE PRESENT WORLD UNRESTLet me list for you some of the reasons for the present world unrest, remindingyou that many of them are based upon causes which lie in so remote a past thathistory knows nothing of them, and they appear meaningless to you because youhave no clear idea of the nature of early humanity. Some grasp of the essentialsituation will be of value if you are to follow development in the futureintelligently.First, the point reached by humanity itself is one of the major and primarycauses. This evolutionary status has brought mankind to the threshold of a doorupon the great path of evolution and has indicated an unfoldment whichnecessitates drastic changes in man's entire attitude to life and to all hisworld relations. These changes are being self-initiated by him and are notimposed upon him by an outside [117] force or by the coercion of humanity in anyform. This is an important point to be grasped. It might therefore be statedthat;1. Man is now at the point where the principle of intelligence is so stronglyawakened within him that nothing can arrest his progress into knowledges whichwould be dangerously misused and selfishly applied if nothing were done to calla halt and thus safeguard him from himself—even at the cost of temporary pain.He must be taught to react to a higher and better sense of values.2. Millions of human beings are now integrated or at the point of integration.They are beginning to function as a unity within themselves, preparatory to ahigher process which will enable them consciously to integrate into the greaterWhole. From the form side of manifestation, mind, emotion and brain are workingin unison. Now the higher correspondence of these lower forces—wisdom, love anddirection—must appear; the more subtle energies must be enabled to expressthemselves. Instinctively and mystically, humanity perceives that need with aclear definiteness. The instinct to go forward to higher achievement, to enquireand to search for that which is better, remains potent. Humanity can be trustedto push onward and to make progress. The Hierarchy of Love is, however,endeavouring to hasten the process, thereby taking the risk of complications inso doing.3. Certain men and women in every field of human thought are expressing thepotency of the unfoldment of their achieved integration and (if you will butbelieve it) the reality of their soul contact, by emerging out of the dead levelof humanity. They stand forth above their fellows through the very force oftheir personality-integration and because they can [118] function as high gradeand idealistic persons. From the altitude at which they stand (relatively highfrom the human standpoint, and interesting from the hierarchical point of view),they are seeking to mould the racial thought and life to a certain pattern whichseems to them—according to their inclination, type and ray—to be desirable. These individuals in the fields of government, religion, science, philosophy,economics and sociology are having a united powerful effect, some of it of ahigh and good order, some of it not so good. They affect their civilisationmaterially if their emphasis is there; they produce a cultural effectsubjectively and spiritually if that is the impression they seek. Their motivesare often sound and good, for they all have a touch of true idealism, but—beingas yet inexperienced in the ways of the soul—they make many mistakes, aresidetracked in dangerous ways and lead many people into error and trouble. Inthe long run, the result will be the awakening of the public consciousness, andthat is ever good.Second, the emerging of a new racial type. The subjective outlines of this typecan already clearly be seen. So glamoured are we by the form side that manyclaims are made today that the new race is to be found in America. The new raceis forming in every land, but primarily in those lands where the fifth orCaucasian races are to be found. Among the fourth race peoples, however, a few,such as those to be found among the Chinese and the Japanese, are beingdiscovered by the Hierarchy and are making their real and esoteric contributionto the whole.Let me also make one definite statement at this point which may cause somesurprise. The fifth kingdom in nature, the spiritual, will emerge out of thefifth root race. Such is the esoteric control of the Law of Correspondence. Iwould [119] remind you nevertheless that the only fourth root race people to befound upon our planet are the Chinese, the Japanese, the various Mongoloid racesin Central Asia (and they are somewhat intermixed with the Caucasian race) andthe hybrid groups found in the many islands in the southern waters in bothoceans and hemispheres, as well as the descendants of the races which a millionyears ago made the South American continent famous for its civilisation. I amnecessarily widely generalising.The new racial type is far more a state of consciousness than a physical form;it is a state of mind more than a peculiarly designed body. In time, however,any developed state of consciousness invariably conditions and determines thebody nature and produces finally certain physical characteristics. Theoutstanding type of awareness of the coming new race will be the widespreadrecognition of the fact of the mystical perception. Its primary quality will bethe intuitive understanding and control of energy; its contribution to thedevelopment of humanity is the transmutation of selfish desire into group love.This can be seen working out noticeably even today in the attitudes of greatnational leaders who are not, as a rule, animated at all by selfish ambition,but are controlled by love of their nation and thus by some definite form ofidealism—hence the great emerging ideologies. Ponder on this point, get a widerpicture of the growth of the human consciousness, and grasp somewhat the goal ofthe new and coming educational system.Third, the ending of the Piscean Age, which has brought to the point ofcrystallisation (and therefore of death) all those forms through which thePiscean ideals have been moulded. They have served their purpose and done agreat and needed work. It might be asked here: What are the major Pisceanideals?1. The idea of authority. This has led to the imposition of the different formsof paternalism upon the [120] race—political, educational, social and religiouspaternalism. This may be either the kindly paternalism of the privilegedclasses, seeking to ameliorate the condition of their dependents (and there hasbeen much of this; or the paternalism of the churches, the religions of theworld, expressing itself as ecclesiastical authority; or the paternalism of aneducational process.2. The idea of the value of sorrow and of pain. In the process of teaching therace the necessary quality of detachment, in order that its desire and plansshall no longer be oriented to form living, the Guides of the race haveemphasised the idea of the virtues of sorrow and the educational value of pain.These virtues are real, but the emphasis has been overdone by the lesserteachers of the race, so that the racial attitude today is one of sorrowful andfearful expectancy and a feeble hope that some reward (in a desirable andusually material form, such as the heaven of the various world religions) mayeventuate after death, and thus compensate for all that has been undergoneduring life. The races today are steeped in misery and an unhappy psychologicalacquiescence in sorrow and pain. The clear light of love must sweep away allthis and joy will be the keynote of the coming new age.3. To the above thought must be coupled the idea of self-sacrifice. This ideahas lately shifted from the individual and his sacrifice to the grouppresentation. The good of the whole is now held theoretically to be of suchparamount importance that the group must gladly sacrifice the individual orgroup of individuals. Such idealists are apt to forget that the only truesacrifice is that which is self-initiated, and that when it is an enforcedsacrifice (imposed by the more powerful and superior person or group) it is apt[121] to be, in the last analysis, the coercion of the individual and hisenforced submission to a stronger will.4. The idea of the satisfaction of desire. Above everything else, the PisceanAge has been the age of material production and of commercial expansion, of thesalesmanship of the products of human skill which the general public is educatedto believe are essential to happiness. The old simplicity and the true valueshave been temporarily relegated to the background. This was permitted tocontinue without arrest for a long period of time because the Hierarchy ofWisdom sought to bring the people to the point of satiety. The world situationis eloquent today of the fact that possession and the multiplication of materialgoods constitute a handicap and are no indications that humanity has found thetrue road to happiness. The lesson is being learnt very rapidly and the revoltin the direction of simplicity is also rapidly gaining ground. The spirit ofwhich commercialism is the indication is doomed, though not yet ended. Thisspirit of possession and the aggressive taking of that which is desired hasproven widely inclusive and distinguishes the attitude of nations and of racesas well as individuals. Aggression in order to possess has been the keynote ofour civilisation during the past fifteen hundred years.Fourth, the coming into manifestation of the Aquarian Age. This fact shouldprovide the grounds for a profound and convinced optimism; nothing can stop theeffect—growing, stabilising and final—of the new, incoming influences. Thesewill inevitably condition the future, determine the type of culture andcivilisation, indicate the form of government and produce an effect uponhumanity, as has the Piscean or Christian Age, or the earlier period governed byAries, the Ram or Goat. Upon these steadily emerging influences [122] theHierarchy counts with assurance, and the disciples of the world must likewiselearn to depend upon them. The consciousness of universal relationship, ofsubjective integration and of a proven and experienced unity will be theclimaxing gift of the period ahead of us.In the coming world state, the individual citizen—gladly and deliberately andwith full consciousness of all that he is doing—will subordinate his personalityto the good of the whole. The growth of organised brotherhoods and fraternities,of parties and of groups, dedicated to some cause or idea, is another indicationof the activity of the coming forces. The interesting thing to note is that theyare all expressive of some grasped idea more than of some specific person'sdetermined and imposed plan. The Piscean type of man is an idealist along someline of human development. The Aquarian type will take the new ideals and theemerging ideas and—in group activity—materialise them. It is with this conceptthat the education of the future will work. The idealism of the Piscean type andhis life upon the physical plane were like two separate expressions of the man.They were often widely separated and were seldom fused and blended. The Aquarianman will bring into manifestation great ideals, because the channel of contactbetween soul and brain, via the mind, will be steadily established through rightunderstanding, and the mind will be used increasingly in its dual activity—asthe penetrator into the world of ideas and as the illuminator of life upon thephysical plane. This will ultimately produce a synthesis of human endeavour andan expression of the truer values and of the spiritual realities such as theworld has never yet seen. Such again is the goal of the education of the future.What is the synthesis which will later be thus produced? Permit me to list a fewfactors without elaboration:1. The fusion of man's differentiated spiritual aspirations, as expressed todayin many world religions, into [123] the new world religion. This new religionwill take the form of a conscious unified group approach to the world ofspiritual values, evoking in its turn reciprocal action from Those Who are thecitizens of that world—the planetary Hierarchy and affiliated groups.2. The fusion of a vast number of men into various idealistic groups. These willform in every realm of human thought and they in turn will gradually be absorbedinto ever larger syntheses. I would call your attention to the fact that if thevarious educational groups found in the world today, in every country, were tobe listed, certain underlying and analogous trends would appear: their widediversification, their basic foundation upon some idea of human betterment andtheir unity of goal. Their many ramifications and subsidiary groups constitute avast interlocking network throughout the world which is indicative of twothings:a. The steadily growing power of the man in the street to think in terms ofideals which are founded upon certain ideas and which have been put forward bysome great intuitive.b. The gradual upward shift of man's aspirational consciousness by these ideas,his recognition of the idealism of his fellow men and his consequent training inthe spirit of inclusiveness.This growing trend towards idealism and inclusiveness is, in the last analysis,a trend towards love-wisdom. The fact that men today misapply these ideals,lower the vision and distort the true picture of the desired goal, andprostitute the early grasp of beauty to the satisfaction of selfish desire,should not prevent the realisation that the spirit of idealism is growing in theworld and is not, as in the past, confined to a few advanced groups or one ortwo great intuitives. The discussions of the man in the street are today [124]connected with some political, social, educational or religious philosophy,based on some school of idealism. From the standpoint of Those Who areresponsible for man's evolutionary development, a great step forward has beenmade in the last two hundred years. What were the themes of the intellectualsand the philosophers in the middle ages are today the points for animateddiscussion in restaurants, railway carriages, or wherever people consort, argueand talk. This is apt to be forgotten, and I would ask you to ponder on itsimplications and to enquire what is liable to be the final outcome of thiswidespread ability of the human mind to think in terms of the larger Whole andnot only in terms of personal interest, and to apply forms of idealisticphilosophy to the life of practical affairs. Today man does both these things.What, therefore, does this indicate? It signifies a trend in the consciousnessof humanity towards the fusion of the individual with the whole, without hislosing, at the same time, his sense of individuality. Whether he joins apolitical party, or upholds some form of welfare work, or joins some of the manygroups occupied with forms of esoteric philosophy, or becomes a member of someprevalent ism or cult, he is increasingly aware of an expansion of consciousnessand of a willingness to identify his personal interests with those of a groupwhich has for its basic objective the materialising of some ideal. Through thisprocess it is believed that the conditions of human living will be bettered orsome need will be met.This process is going on today in every nation and in all parts of the world,and a census of the world educational groups and the world religious groups (tomention only two out of many possible categories) would prove the staggeringnumber of such bodies and affiliations. It would indicate the differentiation ofthought, and at the same time substantiate my conclusion that men are everywhereturning towards synthesis, fusion, blending and mutual cooperation for certain[125] visioned and specific ends. It is, for mankind, a new field of expressionand of enterprise. Hence the frequent misapplications of the newer truths, thedistortion of the values sensed and the perversion of the truth to suitindividual aims and ends. But as man gropes his way along these lines, and asthe many ideas and the various ideologies present to him points of choice andindicate emerging standards of living and of relationship, he will graduallylearn to think with greater clarity, to recognise the differing aspects of truthas expressions of a basic subjective reality, and—relinquishing no part of thetruth which has set him or his group free—he will learn also to include hisbrother's truth along with his own.When this attitude has been developed in the field of practical education weshall find nations and individuals developing the ideas which seem to suit thenational or personal psychology, yet recognising the reality, potency andusefulness of the point of view of other individuals and nations. When, forinstance, the ideas contained in the teaching on the seven rays are of generalrecognition, we shall find the growth of psychological understanding, and thenations and the world religions will arrive at mutual understanding.THE ANGLE OF PARENTHOODI began with the angle of citizenship for two definite reasons: first, becauseit is a basic rule in esotericism to argue always from the universal to theparticular, and secondly, the theme of citizenship, of the relationship of theunit to the whole and of the individual to the state, is the all-engrossingtopic today in world affairs. With it newspapers, radio dialogues andgovernmental appeals all deal. This subject necessarily embodies the wholeproblem of individual freedom and of collective responsibility. This subtlerelationship must be understood and expressed by humanity in line [126] with theunderlying principles of the entire human and planetary structure. Thisstructure is that of an all-embracing Hierarchy. In spite of the rationalisationof men's minds, this Hierarchy exists and extends from the atom of substance atthe very depth of manifestation to the entire solar system; it expresses in itsgraded ascent every type of consciousness, from that of the infinitesimallysmall to that of the infinitely great. It is with a small section of thehierarchical structure—and a very small section at that—that we are engaged. Ourfield of investigation is that of the fourth Creative Hierarchy, which is thehierarchy of human beings; it concerns the relations of the members of thishierarchy within its hierarchical periphery; it deals also with a possible rangeof existence in the subhuman realms on a lower rung of the ladder ofhierarchical existence, and with that hierarchical structure which is foundimmediately above the human in the scale of beings that of the fifth orspiritual kingdom, the Kingdom of God.With that great hierarchical unit which we call the animal kingdom, the thirdkingdom in nature, man is definitely related through the medium of his animal,etheric and astral bodies. He is also related to the kingdom of souls, becausehis own soul is an integral part of that kingdom, just as his physical body isan integral part of the animal kingdom. The aspect of himself which is strictlyand specifically human is the mind or mental body; this is essentially the organof relationship to all other human races.In connection with our subject, therefore, I would have you bear in mind thatthe \"threads of lighted consciousness\" which we unfailingly create, and whicheventually form the antahkarana, have to be woven between each and everyhierarchical unit, and that within the human kingdom itself these connectingrelationships and bridging factors have to be established between unit and unitand between group and group.In the earlier stages this is effected on a mass scale by [127] means of theinfluence of the prevailing culture and civilisation. This, through its externalimpact and through the medium of its telepathic influence, makes a gradual andslow change, for at the beginning of the evolutionary process development is soslow as to be scarcely recognisable. Inevitably, however, subjective changes arewrought in the life of the individual. As evolution proceeds the process becomesincreasingly rapid, until today in the so-called civilised countries, the areasaffected by civilisation are speedily widening and the cultural effects are asrapidly deepening.It is hard for the modern thinker to conceive of that time when there was noracial, national or blended religious consciousness such as is expressing itselfin the world today. Even the most imaginative man is unable to visualise a stateof mind wherein the consciousness was purely instinctive, self-engrossed in thephysical sense, and unable to register any wider contacts than those of mate,offspring, and the call of physical appetites. Some study of such a state ofconsciousness has been attempted in connection with the evolution of the tribeswhich are fast dying out in the modern world, but even here it is impossible tomake adequate allowance for the subtler impressions and influences which are theresult of united thought and inner mental pressure of the civilised part ofhumanity. Gradually the world of men has become increasingly self-aware and isbeing sharply differentiated (with the relationship at the same time recognised)from the animal. The state of consciousness related to the kingdom of souls isdivided into various psychological schools, or is termed either occult ormystical.We could therefore, in connection with the consciousness of humanity, divide theentire subject into three parts:1. That concerning the tangible apparatus, the animal body, and the responsemechanism whereby objective and outer contacts are made possible.2. That concerning the inner or psychological life of [128] man. This consistsmainly of desire, aspiration, ambition and mental activity, and all of these canmanifest either in their animal, psychical, mental or spiritual forms.3. That concerning the spiritual life of man and his relationship to the worldof souls, which involves, incidentally, his relationship to his own soul.As time has progressed, these three developing aspects in the realm ofconsciousness have brought humanity to the recognition, not only of man's owninner personal relationships (incidentally leading to an understanding of hisown physical, psychological and mental equipment), but they have brought mankindalso to a realisation of the various human group relationships of which thefirst and the most important hitherto has been the family group-unit. It is herethat one of the major distinctions between the human state of consciousness andthat of the animal has developed, through the divine imposition of the Law ofNecessity. This law has provided opportunity for the development of the sense ofresponsibility for the care of the family. Once an animal or a bird can fend foritself physically, it is cast off by the parent or parents and left to its ownresources. In the case of the human family, the physical care of the child, aswell as its psychological unfoldment, has gradually been extended until eitherthe parent or the church, the community or the state, is responsible for him formany years—the time element varying according to the country of birth and socialstatus.This has entirely altered the aspect of affairs and the first group, therefore,of which any individual child becomes normally aware is the family group as aunit in the community. In that particular group relationship, throughout theages (both symbolically and indeed in fact), the following factors—underlyingthe very structure of existence itself—[129] are preserved and developed and areheld before the race as that which is ultimately ideal:1. The recognition of hierarchical status, which is, in the last analysis, therelation of the lesser to the greater, of the weaker to the stronger and of themore experienced to the less experienced. Thereby the sense of protection isdeveloped, which is the working out of one form of the love aspect in theuniverse.2. The recognition of responsibility, inherited, applied or shouldered. This isthe relation of the older to the younger, of the wise to the ignorant. Therebythe need of providing opportunity for the unfoldment of knowledge is developed.3. The recognition of the faculty of forgiveness, which is, or rather should be,the expression of the relationship between unit and unit within the largergroup, or of group and group within a still larger whole. Forgiveness isessentially the process whereby each gives to each along psychical lines, and itis one of the rudimentary expressions of the quality of self-sacrifice which is,in its turn, an aspect of the will nature of Deity. Being therefore related tothe monadic or will life, it is as yet completely misunderstood andmisinterpreted. It is in reality the sense of synthesis or of identification andof \"each for all and all for each.\" This sense is being developed today as neverbefore, but it is still so embryonic that words do not help in explaining it.This faculty of forgiveness is not a form of magnanimous forgetting oroverlooking, neither is it a gesture of superiority whereby the slate is wipedclean. It is the very breath of life itself—the giving of all to all and forall.4. The recognition of group interplay within the larger worldrelationship—justly, harmoniously and rhythmically. [130] It is the sense ofright relations, carried forward consciously and harmoniously developed.In the period which is coming, and under the influence of the new education,these four basic recognitions will be inculcated and taught to every child inschool and college. They will thus govern and develop the new form of familyunit which must inevitably come into existence.The family group (like all else in human affairs) has shared in the generalseparativeness, selfishness and individual, isolated exclusiveness, based onclass distinctions, inherited tradition, racial attitudes and national custom.Families (under any category and bracket) present a united front to the world;parents defend their own children and position and situation, right or wrong;family pride, tradition, pedigree are overemphasised, leading to the differentbarriers which today separate man from man, family from family and group fromgroup. The grip of the past upon families is a factor which is largelyresponsible for the revolt of modern youth against parental control, thoughother factors—such as rebellion against enforced religion and old outwornstandards and philosophies—are equally responsible. However, under the comingworld order, educators will prepare the young people in school and college forparticipation in an active and consciously realised group life. For this theywill be prepared by training them in the recognition of the four factors I havelisted as essential to human progress at this time. These will, when grasped andpracticed, produce the needed right relationships and eventually a harmoniousworld.Hierarchy, responsibility, group interplay, and forgiveness or sacrifice—theseare the four categories of recognition which will enable each person to do hispart and take his share in bridging between person and person, between group andgroup, and between nation and nation, thus establishing that new world ofrecognised corporate relationships [131] which will eventually produce thecivilisation of light and love which will be characteristic of the Aquarian Age.It is these four concepts which lie behind the Science of the Antahkarana, theScience of Meditation, and the Science of Service. Their connotations have to beinterpreted in no sentimental sense, or in the coin of current ideas, but alwaysfrom the angle of a trained intelligence and of a spiritually developedconsciousness.Parenthood will not be regarded primarily as an animal function or as a purelysocial or economic function, which are the usual lines of approach at thispresent time. The establishing of a deliberately prepared or constructed threadof light (as a definite part of the world-antahkarana) between parent and child,even in the prenatal stages, will be carefully taught. Thus a close rapport willbe brought about \"in the light\" yet without establishing undue mental controland authority. This latter sentence will show you how impossible it has been todate to hasten the teaching of this new science of the antahkarana. Today it isbeginning to be possible to lay the foundation for this new teaching, becausethe young people in every land are forcing upon their parents and their teachersthe idea of their essential and determined independence. The revolt of youth, inspite of all the immediate and individual disasters, has been a desirable thingand has prepared the way for the establishing of right and better relations,based upon the premises which I have laid down.It is of course impossible for me to do more than indicate here the basis of thenew education which will prepare the youth of the world for the responsibilitiesand duties of parenthood. The entire problem is tied up with that of sex, andalso with the problem of the state and its control, far more than is generallyconceded. Those are two problems which are only emerging today into their fullsignificance, and with them I cannot here deal. Parenthood is the result, andthe ordained result, of the relation of two animal [132] bodies, and I wouldhave you ponder—even if ineffectually—upon the wider group implications of thisstatement. Parenthood is what makes a state, a nation, and a group possible asfar as manifestation is concerned, and here again the vastness of the problem isstaggering. Parenthood has also a close symbolic relationship to the Hierarchy,for the family unit is the symbol upon earth of the Hierarchy, and it is throughthe two facts of sexual relationship and physical birth that the vast Hierarchyof Souls can achieve physical manifestation and attain spiritual perfection inthe three worlds of human evolution. One could (and this fact should becarefully borne in mind) divide the Hierarchy into two basic groups:1. Those souls who have reached perfection and achieved the status of divineservers.2. Those souls who are in the processes of evolution and passing through theperiods of continual incarnation.The idea of generation, birth and subsequent manifestation runs like a guidingthread through all esoteric thought. The ancient teachers of the race, sent outby the Hierarchy from time to time, ever employed the symbolism of naturalprocess in order to illustrate and make clear the needed instruction, and laythat spiritual foundation of truth which will in the coming age lead the raceinto new ways and a new manner of thought. For the esotericist, there is theprocess of birth into the darkness of physical incarnation which—in its turn—isthe foreordained preparatory process which leads to birth into light, carriedforward in the light and producing the externalisation of the body of light.This continuing process (for in all ages this birth into light has been goingforward) will produce that future world of light which it is the purpose of thenatural processes of evolution to reveal. This is the \"second birth\" spoken of[133] in the New Testament, in which a man is \"born again\" into the world oflight and love.From the angle of the new education, these new concepts will govern the mentalattitude of parents in the coming civilisation, and for this the adolescent mustbe prepared. It is the misinterpretation of the newer concepts which isprevalent at this time and is thus producing the emphasis laid—in certaincountries and among nationalists of all countries—upon the necessity to increasethe birth rate. Attention is now being paid to birth rate, its rise and fall, tocorrect care of mothers and children, even in the prenatal period, and to theeducation of parents everywhere. Out of all this, new ideas and attitudes musteventually arise which will be in line with the coming world culture andconcepts. But today, the motive for this solicitude is wrong. The interiorimpulse to deal with the whole problem of parenthood in a newer and better wayis right. The objectives, however, which are held before the race are not thehighest or the most desirable. The necessity of the times will eventuallyproduce radical changes in the approach to family life, parenthood and thetraining of children, and for this a nucleus is preparing the way—or can do soif faithful, attentive and intelligent work is done.TRENDS INDICATIVE OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENTSAs I said before, this subject of parenthood and child training is too great forample or satisfactory discussion in these brief instructions, but certainstatements can be made which will be indicative of future developments and pointthe way to where the changed attitude may be anticipated. Let me list them asfollows:1. The emphasis in the future will shift from the urge to produce large familiesto that of producing quality and intelligence in the offspring. This willinclude that science of which eugenics is the distorted and [134] exotericindication. When the fact of the etheric body with its force centres isscientifically established, the above prophecy will assume significance andmeaning.2. The need of an increasing birthrate will be eventually regarded as erroneous,and this for three reasons which it would profit you to study:a. Many souls are rapidly achieving perfection and passing away altogether fromour planetary life. This process will be intensified during the coming AquarianAge. It should be remembered that the door will be shut for some time as yetupon the animal kingdom, and for a long period no individualisation willculminate in materialisation into physical bodies. Technically, anyindividualisation which may take place will be that which is technically called\"individualisation into pralaya, there to await the inevitable call.\" There willbe, therefore, no necessity for a massed and hurried creation of human forms.b. The economic situation will make it necessary that certain physicalrestrictions should be imposed, because it is now evident that beyond a certainpoint the planet cannot support humanity. This is more fundamental in itsimplications than you can imagine. Again, we have evidence of a growingrealisation of the race along this particular line; that realisation is as yetdistorted and much misunderstood and is today producing the promiscuous use ofcontraceptive methods. As the intelligence of the race is developed (and that isgoing on apace), as the Laws of Rhythm and Approach are grasped, it will then befound that there are certain innate reactions which will negate conception, andthat then the mechanical means will no longer be required. This sounds as yetextremely [135] vague and almost impossible, but the race is rapidly achievingpersonality control (e'en though our idea of rapidity may not be yours) andthis, in its turn, must produce certain automatic and inherent changes. This isa point which must be grasped by esotericists.c. The widespread promiscuity of the sexes, and the rule in many countries whichentitles a man to possess many wives (which is an insult to the woman), willeventually and inevitably cease. It is, in the last analysis, a form oflegalised prostitution, and the fact that it has the endorsement of traditionand centuries of practice does not mitigate this position which I take. Throughthis lack of regulation and of essential rhythm, the natural consequences haveoccurred, and millions of souls have been brought into incarnation who werenever intended at this time to incarnate and achieve exoteric manifestation.This fact is largely responsible for much of the present economic distress andfor the modern planetary dilemma. The economic situation and the necessity toprovide for the unduly large population of the planet lies behind much of theaggression and greed of the nations down the ages, and for the effort being madetoday as never before to provide better and more adequate living conditions. Warhas consequently been the inevitable result of this undue and unlimitedpropagation of the human species. This lack of sexual control has brought intothe world thousands of unwanted children whose appearance is solely the resultof accidental and uncontrolled sexual relations, and in no way indicates theplanned intention of parents—planned because intended to offer experience toincarnating souls, with the conscious intent of [136] offering the opportunityto hasten the \"birth into the light\" of those particular souls, thus renderingservice to the divine plan.3. The science of eugenics and of sex hygiene and the development of mentallycontrolled relationships will steadily grow. Much that is now taught along theselines is erroneous and wrongly motivated, being based upon fear, expediency andthe desire for improved racial attributes and physical perfection. The rightform of scientific sex control, leading to those right conditions in which soulsmay incarnate, cannot be imposed by law. The desired ends may be aided byeducational methods and already this is being done in a tentative and embryonicmanner; but the real change in human consciousness which is needed will appearonly as the race itself is brought under a rhythmic law—under which, forinstance, the animal lives function, or the seasonal law under which forms inthe vegetable kingdom operate—thus transferring the whole concept on to a higherturn of the evolutionary spiral. This, when it is brought about, will producecertain fundamental changes—regulated sex life, an organised parental life, andmental differences in the racial attitude towards the sex relation and itsordained consequence, Birth.4. As yet, it is only the religious person who thinks in terms of the twonecessitated and inevitable births, the physical and the spiritual, and hethinks of the relation between the two as purely symbolic and not in any way tobe interpreted literally. Yet there is a close relation and an analogy betweenthe two which, as time elapses, will become more clear. There can be no newbirth, no creation of the \"body of light,\" and no \"manifestation of the sons ofGod\" apart from the process of physical incarnation. There can be no fusion ofthe opposites of soul and personality [137] apart from the physiologicalprocesses of sex, and I say this deliberately, for it is in the relation of thesexes that the element of time enters into the experience of the soul, and theunderstanding of this will come when the doctrine of reincarnation is properlycomprehended and taught universally. It is here that sex magic and the innertantric teachings have gone so woefully astray, and been centralised uponindividual development and the attainment of some experience which is presumedto promote spiritual attainment. The underlying idea, governing all that hasbeen given out on the sex relation heretofore, is twofold in its implications:a. To provide bodies for incarnating souls so that certain destined evolutionaryunfoldments may be carried forward, and the attainment of an equally destinedand inevitable spiritual unfoldment becomes possible.b. To impart the scientific procedure whereby bodies \"built in the dark\" maygradually be superseded by bodies \"built in the light.\" Thus will be broughtabout the manifestation of the foundational light aspect of the world and itsunderlying structure.5. The sex relation has, therefore, only one major objective, which is toproduce physical bodies for incarnating souls. The relation between the soul andthe personality is consequently a higher aspect of the basic sex expression ofthe universe, and this relation is intended to bring about the appearance of ason of God as light in the world, enabling him to say, as did the Christ, thathe is \"the light of the world,\" and to fulfill the injunction, \"let your lightshine.\" Again, the relation between humanity and the Hierarchy is intended toproduce the radiance of group light and cause to emerge, out of these two [138]planetary groups or bodies, through their close fusion and scientificinterrelation, that form of divine manifestation to which the name \"the Kingdomof God\" has been given in the West.I would ask you to ponder on these five points or statements which are onlyintended to be suggestive, to evoke brooding thought and to indicate thoseelementary ideas which will bring in the newer attitudes to parentalresponsibility. In the world today there are many thinking men and women who areconscious of and earnestly desiring the above, and who are working towards theseends. But the mass of the people in their untold millions are totally unaware ofthe situation, either in its economic or esoteric aspects. One of the tasks ofthe educator of the future will be to teach the meaning of the Law of Rebirth,and thus bring about such a profound change in the racial attitude to life andsex, to birth and parenthood, that sex rhythm, cyclic experience, psychologicalpreparation and directed, controlled body-building may go forward and supersedethe present methods, which are based upon an uncontrolled response to the sexurge and desire, and the unthinking procreation of children. The vast populationof the world today is the result of an animal response to those urges and of thegeneral promiscuity, which is perhaps the outstanding factor, esotericallyspeaking and from the standpoint of the Hierarchy, of the present worlddistress, economic difficulties and national aggressions. Think this out, for itholds a clue.Summing up very briefly, I would say that the objective before the race as itenters into the new age is to \"create in the light through the ordained activityof the light-body.\" This involves the understanding of the different lightexpressions—the light of understanding, the light of a prearranged andcomprehended process and the light of experience. With these more subtle aspectsof light leading, [139] controlling and directing the human consciousness inrelation to racial generation and the perpetuation of the species, and with thescience of light (a science dealing with that which concerns substance and form,for it must not be forgotten that light and substance are synonymous terms)forming an integral part of the education of parents and adolescents, we canthen look forward to adjustments and changes, which are bound to come, withconfidence and assurance that all will be well.The motives leading to marriage will undergo profound changes during the nextone thousand years, though the basic motive—that of love between two people—willremain unchanged or more properly emphasised and selflessly expressed. Theattitude of parents towards their children will alter dramatically and theresponsibility angle will be continuously emphasised, though that responsibilitywill be concerned primarily with the time, opportunity and correctness ofproducing the forms which incarnating souls will assume. The idea of the needfor rapid procreation and the production of large families through which thestate can achieve its end will be changed. The preparation of adults for theduties of parenthood and their training in the basic necessities of the comingchild will shift increasingly to the mental and spiritual levels ofconsciousness and be less given to physical preparations. The light which is inthe parents, which in the days to come will be seen clairvoyantly by anincreasing number of people, will be scientifically related to the embryoniclight in the child, and the thread of light connecting parent and child (ofwhich the umbilical cord is the exoteric symbol) will be skillfully andpatiently constructed. The child will come into incarnation with its light bodyalready embedded and functioning in the physical body and this will be due tothe intelligent mental work of the parents. This is not so today, except in thecase of very advanced egos, for the light body is inchoate and diffused andsimply hovers over the physical form of the child, waiting [140] for anopportunity to enter and irradiate the consciousness. Thus will be brought aboutan integration in the light substance of the planet which is lacking at thistime; and the production of this integration will be definitely initiated by thetrained parents of the new age and facilitated, as the child matures, by theteaching and influence of the illumined educator.This all sounds to you necessarily peculiar and too abstract and farfetched tomake much sense. I would have you remember that much which is familiar to youtoday and which constitutes a definite part of the recognised facts of dailylife would, a few hundred years ago, have been regarded as equally peculiar,incomprehensible and impossible. What is really taking place is the hastening ofthe processes of light manifestation, and this has become possible because ofthe point of attainment of humanity and the increased stimulation which is beingapplied to the race by the Hierarchy, assisted by forces emanating fromShamballa.THE ANGLE OF PERSONALITY CONTROLMuch that I could say here would simply be a repetition of that which youalready know and have been taught. Many of you who are reading my words here aresteeped in the ideas which I have been seeking to impart to humanity for thepast years, for it was in 1919 that I first started writing through thecooperation of A.A.B. In these writings I have sought to do two things:1. Teach the basic necessity for certain great fusions—individual, racial andspiritual:a. The fusion or integration of the different aspects of man's nature—physical,emotional and mental. When this has been accomplished we shall have themanifestation of the integrated elemental forces to which we give the name ofthe Personality, producing [141] the manifestation of a powerful, self-directed,high grade human being.b. The fusion of the personality and the soul. This has to be carried outconsciously and deliberately, with the willingness of these related parts of agreat divine whole to see the personality subjected to changes andtransmutations, produced as a result of soul contact. This will lead to themanifestation of the indwelling soul, the Christ consciousness, the Solar Angel.c. The ultimate fusion of humanity with the Hierarchy, producing themanifestation of God's Kingdom on earth. This will be the consummation of allthe other fusions, and will have produced certain great planetary, racial andnational fusions which are incidental and necessary to progress and itsinevitable results.These fusions are not carried forward as listed above in an ordered sequentialfashion. There is much overlapping and lack of balance in the process, butthough there may be differences and difficulties in the lengthy process, the endis inevitable and unalterable. The Kingdom of God, the consummation of it all,will appear upon the planet.2. Inculcate the methods, productive of quality and not just of quantity, whichwill facilitate the emergence of certain great divine characteristics. Thesewill, in due time, change the world and bring in the new attitudes and states ofconsciousness. These, when they are matured and recognised, will bring about theappearance of the culture and civilisation which is, for the race, the nextplanned and desired development.Need I, therefore, talk to you about personality development and control? Is notthat something which you have [142] considered and worked at for years? Can Itell you anything of a practical nature that you do not already know and striveto attain? Shall I increase your present responsibility by repetition? I thinknot. The new culture will emerge and come into being, as all of those who have aconsciousness of light and the goal of pure service (which such a consciousnessinevitably entails) proceed with their appointed task—a self-appointed task inevery case—of living and teaching the truth about light, as opportunity offers."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER V - THE SCIENCE OF THE ANTAHKARANA[143] As a preparation for what students need to master, I would like toemphasise certain points by tabulating the information already given. TheScience of the Antahkarana is not an easy one to learn because of the followingpoints. These emphasised points must be accepted by students as a workinghypothesis prior to all attempted work:1. The Science of the Antahkarana is connected with the entire problem ofenergy, but peculiarly with the energy handled by the individual and with theforces by which the individual relates himself to other individuals or togroups. For the sake of clarity, we will give the name ofa. Energy: to all forces pouring into the individual form from whateverdirection and source. To these major energies, the names of \"sutratma\" or \"lifethread\" or \"silver cord\" have frequently been given.b. Force: to all the energies which—after due manipulation and concentration—areprojected by the individual or group in any direction and with many possiblemotives, some good and many selfish.2. The Science of the Antahkarana, technically speaking and for group purpose,is especially the science of [144] light manifestation with its results ofrevelation and consequent changes. It should be remembered that:a. Light is substantial, and from the angle of the spirit is a sublimation orhigher form of material matter.b. Light is also the quality or major characteristic of the soul in its ownrealm, and of the etheric body (a reflection of the soul eventually) in thethree worlds of human evolution.c. The object of the science with which we are dealing is to fuse the lower andthe upper lights, so that one light shines forth in physical manifestation and asynthesis of light is consequently brought about.d. Technically speaking, two light bodies exist—the vital or etheric body andthe soul vehicle. One is the result of aeons of incarnating life and becomes intime a powerful repository of energies gathered out of a wide range of contacts,though conditioned by the ray type in its three aspects. The etheric body existsand is today functioning powerfully. The soul body is in process of being slowlyconstructed, and is that \"house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens\" towhich the New Testament refers (II Cor. 5: l). It is interesting to note thatthe Old Testament refers to the etheric body (Ecc. 12:6-7) and its construction,and the New Testament deals with the building of the spiritual body.3. The Science of the Antahkarana must be studied in three ways:a. Concretely and in relation to the etheric body, which is a substantial,tangible form, and is being so considered (though not as yet universallyadmitted) by modern science. [145]b. Egoically and in relation to the soul and to the \"light body\" through whichthe spiritual man must function in the world of souls, and which—when blendedand fused with the etheric body—produces the manifestation of divinity uponearth to a greater or lesser degree, according to the extent of fusion and theconscious recognition by the individual of the attained fusion.c. Abstractly and in relation to knowledge-wisdom, which are two words used inrelation to force and energy, and their use by the individual in his environmentand contacts. Ponder on these words. You will realise how necessary it is thatthere should be some capacity for abstract thinking before the true implicationsof this new science can be understood.4. The Science of the Antahkarana is concerned with the problem of thecontinuity of consciousness and with the problem of life and death. Keep thesetwo themes clearly in your mind for they are basic and important.5. The Science of the Antahkarana deals with the threefold thread whichconnects:a. The monad, the soul and the personality, linking all three periodicalvehicles and unifying all seven principles.b. The triple personality and its environment in the three worlds of humanenterprise, and later in the other two worlds (making five) of superhumanexpression.c. The consciously creative man and the world of ideas. These he must contactand express through creative work, thus bridging with the light:1. Between the world of souls and the world of phenomena. [146]2. Between the realm of subjective beauty and reality and the outer tangibleworld of nature.3. Between himself and others.4. Between group and group.5. Later, when the divine Plan has become a reality to him, between the fourthkingdom (the human) and the fifth kingdom (the Kingdom of God).6. Finally, between humanity and the Hierarchy.6. The Science of the Antahkarana is the science of the triple thread whichexists from the very beginning of time and links individual man with his monadicsource. The recognition of this thread and its use, consciously, as the Path andthe means of ever expanding contacts, comes relatively late in the evolutionaryprocess. The goal of all aspirants and disciples is to become aware of thisstream of energy in its various diversifications and consciously to employ theseenergies in two ways: interiorly in self-unfoldment, and in the service of theplan for humanity.7. The Science of the Antahkarana teaches certain fundamental truths about thethread, some of which might be enumerated as follows:a. The life thread comes directly from the monad or the ONE. This thread isanchored in the heart during incarnation. There is the seat of life.b. The consciousness thread comes directly from the soul. It is anchored in thehead. There is the seat of consciousness.c. The thread of creative activity is initiated and constructed by the humanbeing. It is anchored, when sufficiently constructed, in the throat. This threadis an extension or synthesis of the two basic threads. [147]The creative thread itself is triple in nature. It is slowly constructed downthe ages by the man. As he becomes truly alive, from the standpoint ofintelligent awareness and the desire fully to express himself, the process ismaterially hastened. These three self-created lesser threads which constitutethe third thread of the antahkarana extend eventually:1. From the physical body to the etheric body, passing from the heart to thespleen, and thence to the body of prana, the vital or etheric body, unites withforce from the egoic will petals.2. From the etheric body to the astral body. This thread passes from the solarplexus to the heart and from thence to the astral body, picking up the energy ofthe thread mentioned above, unites with force the love petals.3. From the astral body to the mental vehicle. This thread passes from the ajnacentre to the head centre and from thence to the mind body, picking up theenergy of the other two threads mentioned above, unites with the force from theknowledge petals.Though these three energies are woven into one thread finally, yet they remaindistinct. It should be borne in mind that the soul body is constructed of purewhite light, whilst the light out of which the etheric body is made is golden.8. The Science of the Antahkarana deals, therefore, with the entire incomingsystem of energy, with the processes of usage and transformation and fusion. Itdeals also with the outgoing energies and their relationship to the environmentand is the basis of [148] the science of the force centres. The incoming and theoutgoing energies constitute finally two great stations of energy, onecharacterised by power and the other by love, and all directed to theillumination of the individual and of humanity as a whole, through the medium ofthe Hierarchy composed of individuals. This is basically the Science of thePath.The antahkarana, therefore, is the thread of consciousness, of intelligence, andthe responsive agent in all sentient reactions. The interesting point to bear inmind, and where we must now lay the emphasis, is that this thread ofconsciousness is evolved by the soul and not by the monad. The World Soul poursits gossamer thread of sentient consciousness into all forms, into all bodycells and into all atoms. The human soul, the solar angel, repeats the processin relation to its shadow and reflection, the personality. This is part of thecreative work of the soul. But, in its turn, the human being has also to becomecreative in the mental sense of the term and must repeat the process, for in allpoints the microcosm resembles the macrocosm. Therefore, through the lifethread, the soul creates and reproduces a personality through which to function.Then through the building of the antahkarana, the soul first of all developssentiency down upon the physical plane, and later bridges the gap—throughmeditation and service—between the three mental aspects. It thus completes thecreation of the path of return to the Centre, which must parallel the path ofoutgoing.I have now completed my introductory presentation of the fundamentals which willin the future age dominate the educational systems. It was necessary for all ofyou—and for those who will later study these instructions anent the neweducation—to have some grasp of past foundational implications and basictendencies and also some ideas, however [149] vague, of the line along whichmajor changes can be expected to come. You can begin, therefore, to workintelligently and with as little loss of time as possible.It remains now to make the teaching which I have given practical in itsimplications. The New Education now must take the place of that which is old andwhich has proved so wrong that it could not prevent the universal holocaustwhich distinguished the years 1914-1945. It must be superseded. The next stageof human evolution will emerge as a result of the purificatory action of theWorld War. There are steps which humanity must take, and only a new type ofeducation and a different attitude to the educational processes (imposed uponthe very young of every nation) will enable mankind to take them.A new cycle of experience, of psychological development and of new educationalprocesses is imminent. What I have given here and elsewhere on the Science ofMeditation, of Service and anent the Antahkarana gives method, mode, promise andpoint to it all.The Tibetan"},{"pageContent":"SYNOPSIS[151] The following synopsis in three sections is intended to give the student acomprehensive grasp of the ideas upon which the teaching of the New Education isbased.
